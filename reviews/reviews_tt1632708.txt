"\nI was able to see a sneak screening of this movie almost 1 month prior\nto it's official release. I honestly walked in simply thinking I was\nseeing another typical romantic comedy with my girlfriend. To my\nsurprise it was much more.<br><br>Timberlake plays an LA Blog Art Director who has just been recruited to\nwork for GQ in New York by Kunis who is a headhunter. The two had great\nchemistry through out the movie.<br><br>What's funny is that even though it does contain the usual Cliché\nscenes that most romantic adult comedies contain, it does tend to poke\nfun at them and have some sort of realism to the plot.<br><br>Both Timberlake and Kunis are likable and really funny. Woody Harrelson\nwas the best addition to support this younger cast. Harrelson plays a\nflamboyantly gay sports editor who goes from making sexual advances to\nJT, to offering him some pearls of wisdom with his love life.<br><br>I would have to say this movie was very enjoyable and if your skeptical\nabout seeing it in the theaters, definitely put it on your \"must rent\"\nlist.\n"
"\nI was expecting to have to compare this movie with No Strings Attached\n(or whatever that movie with Ashton Kutcher was) all the way through\nhowever I was pleasantly surprised that the story was a bit more\ncomplex despite the obvious parallels.<br><br>Yes it's the typical \"boy and girl decide to be friends only but end up\nloving each other\" movie .... but I must admit that it was a lot\nsmarter in the delivery. Timberlake and Kunis have a lot of chemistry\non camera ... It's shot primarily in new york so expect the clichéd new\nyork locations ... <br><br>The complexity of Timberlake's character is slowly revealed through the\nshow as opposed to being revealed in the first 3 minutes like most\nother movies.<br><br>A good watch ... not slap your knee funny but certainly entertaining to\nthe end ... clichés and all\n"
"\nThis movie was all things cliché and predictable. Even though you know\nwhat is coming, the honesty with life's little quirks and human\nbehavior was incredibly well done. <br><br>Timberlake is an okay actor. I found him to be a fresh breath in this\nmovie. The dialogue and scenario fit his charm quite well. <br><br>I found Mila Kunis to be quite funny, and she pulled off that cute,\ncharming, awkwardly damaged woman, perfectly. She was chic, yet easy to\nrelate too. Down to earth, but an air of success and confidence, hidden\nin all the girly dreams and fairy-tales. <br><br>If you want something original and never done before, this is the wrong\nmovie to watch. If you wish to appreciate a good spin on an old concept\nwith stellar humor and humanity, it is worth the watch..\n"
"\n\"Friends with Benefits\" has a predictable and unoriginal rom-com\nstoryline and its ending is pretty lame. Yet this movie coasts on the\ncharisma of Justin Timberlake and Mila Kunis and a lot of sharp and\nwitty dialogue. As long as these two actors are talking to each other\nor having sex, there is hardly ever a dull moment. And the reason for\nthis seems to be simple enough. In most rom-coms, the actors play\npretty dim-witted, boring and superficial people and therefore there is\nno reason to take interest in anything they may say or do. In this\nrom-com, \"Friends with Benefits,\" Timberlake and Kunis play fresh,\nindependent and smart people and for this reason we are interested in\nthe lives they lead and what they say to each other. So \"Friends with\nBenefits\" does not have much of a plot, but that does seem to matter\nbecause on this rare occasion we are happily distracted by the\nmagnetism of two capable on screen actors who are playing two\nwell-craft parts.\n"
"\nWatch this if...you are in the mood for an adult-oriented romantic\ncomedy that has a great pace and manages to appeal to both genders.<br><br>Acting/Casting: 6.5* - Timberlake and Kunis are very good in the lead\nroles and the supporting cast is well put together. Honestly,\nTimberlake surprised me a bit with his performance.<br><br>Directing/Cinematography/Technical: 6* - There is a lot of great\nscenery of LA and New York in the film. The movie also has a great\npace, which can be attributed to the directing.<br><br>Plot/Characters: 6* - Nothing new in the storyline with this movie, but\nit is done fairly well. Guy and girl are friends and decide to have no\nstrings attached sex, but of course that is hard to do.<br><br>Entertainment Value: 7* - As mentioned, this movie is appealing to both\ngenders and is fast paced and entertaining. I would recommend to anyone\nlooking for a good romantic comedy that would interest both members in\nthe relationship.<br><br>My Score: 6.5+6+6+7 = 25.5/4 = 6.4<br><br>Email your thoughts to filmwatchinfool@gmail.com\n"
"\nThis movie is just...ugh. I got halfway through it and realized that I\nliterally did not care what happened at all. I wouldn't have cared if\none of them was hit by a truck and died, that was the result of\nunconvincing characters who just sound like their spewing out bad jokes\nfrom their memorised script. This movie didn't even have the bright\nside of good actors, Justin Timberlake and Mila Kunis may be easy on\nthe eye but are mediocre actors at best, you only have to watch MK in\nOz: The Great And Powerful to see what I mean. It's just so boring and\npredictable and as the movie goes on it gets more and more cheesy. The\nplot is so unbelievably cliché that you only have to read the\ndescription on the back to know what's going to happen.\n"
"\nOK, what you see from the beginning to end is a display of Sony\nproducts.<br><br>A deliberate and a ridiculous scene is placed just so that the\ncharacters could be seen playing the Sony playstation.<br><br>The couple watch a show on a.......Sony TV.<br><br>If they use a laptop it would be a VAIO .<br><br>And of course, the background music is composed of artists that come\nfrom the Sony records label.<br><br>The film ? Well the guys were so focused as to how the place the Sony\nproducts that they turned the movie into a total crap.<br><br>It is NOT a romantic comedy. It does not have any class. The characters\ndebit dialogs straight from the gutter.<br><br>I used to have a high esteem of the Sony Group. This movie produced in\nme the opposite effect. I would buy any label except this.\n"
"\n15 minutes into this movie and i have no idea who these two main\ncharacters are. I assume i am supposed to take the dialogue lines of\neach's partner breaking up with them at face value, giving us some\ninsight into our main characters inner problems, but i can't. It just\nall to superficial and neither of the \"divorced\" shows any emotional\nreaction. So nothing to identify here. Neither with our characters\nprofession: Two real super successful hotshots in NY (now) which simply\nain't close enough at home for a mass audience. Should we admire this\nDenver-Clanesque setup? But the biggesst flaw, really isn't the story\nor unlikeable characters, the real caveat is the pacing. There is\nsimply is none. This movie moves along in a manner, like it were\ntelling you \"what do i care, if you're watching\"? On the bottomline:\nNot all engaging, not funny, not interesting, not fresh, not making\nyour heart raise or slow down, just an empty shell of nothingness, that\nhappened to got (almost) written and film through some camera. Stay\naway. It sucks!\n"
"\nIs not.. and maybe is good. Justin Timberlake is like a piece of wood..\nand wood express emotions very hardly. Is not.. because \"sex is like\ntennis\" so.. its predictable from begging to end. Is not comedy to.. I\ntry very hard to find any funny moments.. was hopeless. OK.. its maybe\nany interesting story here?.. Which mean.. you can watch this movie and\nyou don't know what happen next? Sorry.. no! Wooden hero meets\nbeautiful girl, go to bed, split up, hero talk with Yoda, they meet\nagain.. end of story. Familiar? To much familiar for me. A few weeks\nago I saw \"No Strings Attached\".. there Natalie Portman can lift and\nrescue this movie.. (another wooden hero BTW - Ashton Kutsher). Big\nMila Kunis eyes can't help here. Its a pity. so.. what you get? you can\nremember something when you get out from cinema? Not too much I\nthink... nothing maybe.. You forgot this movie before you arrive home.\nMy prediction for Golden Raspberries this year: - worst scenario -\nworst couple - worst male performer - worst director\n"
"\nI saw the advert for this on TV and thought that this could have\npotential to watch with my girlfriend so we went to see it. Ohh how i\nwas wrong, i can honestly say i can't think of a worse film i have seen\nall year. The acting was terrible the storyline was predictable the\nediting was shocking too.<br><br>The whole film seems rushed in the sense that for the 1st 20mins the\nconversation is back and forth so fast it all drowns in to one monotone\nnoise. It does ease off a bit towards the end but it was too little too\nlate.<br><br>I can see JT being in films as a cameo role but to be a lead actor that\ntakes some acting talent which he has none of.<br><br>I want the 90mins back of my life.\n"
"\nCheesy forced dialogue.A ridiculous screenplay. Did we really have to\nhave the usual \"Mom caught us having sex\" scene. How bogus can you get?\nTimberlake can not act. Sorry. He's too much a newbie to have tried to\ncarry this. I found the so called sex scenes to be trite and routine\nand mostly unfunny.<br><br>There must be a director's play book out there for doing sex scenes.\nIt's all predictable. She's on top. Then he's on top. Then he's bobbing\nridiculously around under the sheets. Then he has to pee. Gotta get in\nthose butt shots, right? Had don't forget those breasts, but be sure\nand keep one leg up. At least she demanded a butt double.<br><br>A snore. Yawn...............................\n"
"\n\"What Crap\", would have made a much better title for this ridiculously\nfoul movie. <br><br>What is it foul? Do we really need to an explanation from Timberlake on\nwhy it's hard to urinate when a man is excited?<br><br>The film is replete with vulgarity's like this. It appears that rather\nthan building on the film's few qualities, and it has a few, the\nproducers decided to educate the opposite sex (whichever you happen to\nbe) with crude innuendo on the other. It would appear they were trying\nto make the film interesting to 13 year old's. <br><br>This odd downplay to the audience in general goes hand in hand with the\nfact the film is simply a rehash of \"No Strings Attached\".<br><br>Mila Kunis, I expected better from you following, \"The Black Swan\"<br><br>Justin Timberlake, I expected nothing from you following, \"Yogi Bear\".\n"
"\nWhat a waste of time. Same boring script we've seen time and time\nagain. Might have been a better movie if Timberlake and Harrelson\nexchanged roles. Horrible. Way overboard with the sexual situations and\nlanguage. Couple of narcissistic persons with a complete lack of\nmorality try to hook up. You know every move before it happens. I\nwonder if they have run out of ideas in Hollywood. The background music\nwas way too distracting. I wasn't sure if they were showing a movie or\npromoting a music CD. Timberlake is completely unbelievable in his\nrole. I thought I was watching \"That Seventies Show\" with the cast they\nhad. Forget this one and rent another movie.\n"
"\nI was actually embarrassed for the headline actors, Justin Timberlake\nand Mila Kunis. The material was not good nor were the jokes. Justin\nTimberlake was bad enough to begin, as usual. Mila Kunis is normally\nbetter than this. I guess she was playing down to her material and\nco-star. Either way the acting was horrible as was the plot and the\ndirection. A negative trifecta. If there were any redeeming factors to\nthe film it was the supporting actors. All of which I felt did an\nexcellent job with the material they had to work. Patricia Clarkson,\nWoody Harrelson, Richard Jenkins and even Jenna Elfman, respectively.\nThe film was predictable which is OK in this genre. Just a sloppy\nproject in every facet. Save your time and bypass this one.\n"
"\nI have been a member on IMDb for almost 10 years and never wrote a\nreview. This film made me so shocked that I came here just tow write\nthis review.<br><br>This has been one of the few most unnatural films I have seen. The\nstory line, the way they act, the way they talk, and almost everything\nelse seems strange.<br><br>The 2 main actors talk loud like they are performing in a theater. The\nstory is full of strange things. The guy is supposedly working in web\nbusiness (my field for almost 20 years), yet it does not make any sense\nto me. You gather 20 colleagues to select a photo for your website?\n"
"\nI love this movie so much. It's really good and really adorable. Sadly,\nit has almost the exact same plot line as No Strings Attached, but what\nare you going to do. I want to let you know how much I enjoyed this\nmovie. I enjoyed it so much, that I grew to like Justin Timberlake.\nBefore seeing this movie, I did not care for him at all. That's how\npersuasive this movie was.<br><br>This movie is about two people who randomly meet, and who are put\ntogether through work and fall madly in love. But not in the way you'd\nthink. They meet, don't like each other, become friends, become friends\nwith benefits, hence the title, and then they fall in love. This movie\ncompletely avoids the clichés of romantic comedies. And is a terrific\nwatch.<br><br>Overall, I give this movie an 8 out of 10.\n"
"\nFollowing on from the almost identical \"No Strings Attached\" staring\nAshton Kutcher and Natalie Portman which grossed over $100 million,\nthis movie replaces Kutcher and Portman with the impossibly gorgeous\npairing of Justin Timberlake and Mila Kunis who make an engaging\nromantic couple. <br><br>Modern Family's Nolan Gould has a small role as Timberlake's nephew and\nWoody Harrelson simply steals the movie, he owns every scene he is in\nas a gay sports editor.<br><br>The writer and director set us up for what could have been a great\nmoment-one which we expect to see, but it never takes place. Harrelson\nis constantly asking Timberlake to go out for drinks, so the can hit on\nmen and women respectively. Timberlake always refuses, but half way\nthrough the movie he agrees. At this point we expect some funny scenes\nwatching Harrelson on the prowl. When we don't see it, we miss it.<br><br>Friends With Benefits is not without it's clichés, but overall a\npleasant way to spend some time.\n"
"\nYes, the movie made money. Yes, it was filmed in L.A. and N.Y. - where\nelse, duh! Yes, the old salesmen trick of repackaging the same product\nto sell to the same schmuck by changing the packaging a little works as\nusual and always has and always will. So what do the cloistered\nwriters, producers and directors in N.Y. &amp; L.A. do with their lives\nwell, sit in little pretend manly cubicles trying to tweak another\ndollar out of the rom-com boxed-in consumer. What is the formula that's\ntweaked? Middle class white professionals that cuss a lot to bluff\ntoughness; sex dominates their discussions; monetary self interest\ndominates their social consciousness; parties, bars and objects-\ndu-jour their support system. What's tweaked? Change an actor or two\nbut not too many; change an office/occupation but not too many; change\nthe social scenes but not too many. Everything else stays the same\npredictable self including the ending. Ah hah moment, the monetary\ncomfort of predictability in exchange for the psychological comfort of\npredictable fantasy.\n"
"\nThis is a good idea for a film, which was done slightly less badly in\nNo Strings Attached.<br><br>The two main characters in this film are boring and unlikeable. Justin\nTimberlake's character lacks a personality and Mila Kunis' character is\narrogant. It's meant to be funny, sexy and romantic - but it fails\nmiserably on all counts.\n"
"\nFriends with benefits is a 2011 comedy starring Justin Timberlake and\nMila Kunis as two friends who decide to have sexual intercourse one\nnight and never speak about it eve again and remain friends. The film\nstands out as a bit of a remake of No Strings Attached(2010). I loved\nthis movie so darn much,it was absolutely hilarious probably from that\nguy who the hard guy in Zombieland(2009)and also Justin Timberlake who\nI hate as a singer and actor,Mila Kunis was OK in this film nothing\ngreat,I think there was somebody else who should have played her but\napart from that everything was great. Also,really liked Patrica\nClarkson from the TV remake of Carrie in this as the mom.<br><br>Friends with Benefits is a awesome comedy.\n"
"\nReviewed July 2011<br><br>Well the movie turned out to be exactly I have pictured it to be. Lots\nof clichéd romantic stuff. Decent humor occasionally. Lovely Mila\nKunis. Surprisingly not so annoying Justin Timberlake. Good chemistry\nbetween them. Happily ever after ending. <br><br>This very same concept has been exploited quite a few times recently\nwith 'Love, Sex and Other Drugs' as well as 'No Strings Attached'. So I\nam not going to get into the details about the plot baring one, it has\ndifferent leads. <br><br>Now that I am done with my neutral and positive points of view, lets\nget to the critic stuff. There is absolutely no fresh point it deals\nwith that has been dealt 100 times before. No innovative/brilliant\nscreenplay or narration, cinematography/visuals or background score.\nThere is no element of surprise and it doesn't even try to be a\ntearjerker as it is not packing any of the above other qualities. Just\ntrying to be a money spinner riding on it's likable leads. <br><br>You don't miss anything by missing it, you don't gain anything by\nwatching it.\n"
"\nHow did this thing get rated under 7 on IMDb, when it clearly deserves\na ... 7?<br><br>Mila Kunis was a pretty good actress and good to look at. It tried to\nflout the conventions of the romantic movie, and even got Jason Segal\nto act in a fake movie they kept watching. There was more skin, and\nmore sex up front. There was much more sweet kindness in the first Act. <br><br>But it was pretty much a romantic movie with the first and second Acts\nswitched. They start out sexy and friendly, but then become contentious\nin the second Act. She still had to deal with her issues and he still\nhad to confess his love in a big public display, and love was still the\nonly thing that mattered. They also tried faster talking than usual but\nmy wife and I could hardly follow it.<br><br>I'll bet some romCom fans trashed it for the betrayal. It was like some\ncheerleader than claims to hate 'those vain girls'. That would grind\nthe other cheerleaders.<br><br>Justin Timberlake was OK, but dragged it down a little. Damn that guy,\nhe does OK at all sorts of things that pay him millions.\n"
"\nI found this movie super annoying initially and almost shut it off. It\ndid start to grow on me at about the half-way mark though when the\nstoryline got more serious and family members were introduced to take\nthe edge off. It think it also took me that long to acclimatise to the\ninsistent, trying too hard to be funny, ongoing (&amp; going) dialogue Mila\nKunis kept spouting. And I like this girl too, but jeez.<br><br>This is another predictable rom-com with a predictable storyline even\nthough it tries not go that route, but (didn't I see this exact same\nplot in No Strings Attached?) In this version we follow two friends who\ntry to add sex to their relationship without all the, well, strings.\nThis idea fails (shocker) as Jamie and Dylan find it difficult to keep\ntheir emotions at bay.<br><br>While this movie tried hard not to be cliché it failed. I did find\nWoody Harrelson's gay sports writer character kinda funny and got\nsucked into the storyline involving (Richard Jenkins) as Justin\nTimberlake's father but for the most part forgettable 10.13\n"
"\nSynopis:<br><br>Dylan and Jamie are two people who decide to have sex rather than admit\nthat they have feeling for one another and even though they try to find\nnew people will they ever admit that they like each other.<br><br>I didn't see it all on TV as I was watching something else but the\nmovie is about a Head Designer named Dylan(Justin Timberlake)who hires\na girl called Jamie(Mila Kunis) and the two have this friends with\nbenefits relationship where they have sex and date other people. But\nwill they admit that they want to take their relationship as a real\ngenuine one?<br><br>Overall its an OK movie,and to be honest I prefer Justin Timberlake as\na singer rather than an actor,I dunno why but his better as a musician.\nThe ending was OK but you can smell the ending a mile away as a lot of\npeople say its like No Strings Attached. <br><br>4/10\n"
"\nDon't expect something new out of this. It just an ordinary romantic\ncomedy movie that always tell about how beautiful and great love is.<br><br>I watch this movie with my girlfriend who made me to watch it. Well, i\ndon't want to watch it, but then she told me that Mila Kunis get naked\nin it, then i agree to watch it.<br><br>The film take of from a guy who got a job offer in New York and pick up\nby a girl in the airport and show how great New York is, then he agree\nto take the job. He and she quickly become a friend, since he just move\nin to New York. My favorite part of this movie is, when they both watch\na romantic comedy in the DVD, and she asked: \"why there is no movie\nthat show what happen after the big kiss (the happily ever after\npart)?\" and he answer: \"yeah they made it, it call porn\".<br><br>Well, overall it just the same old romantic comedy that the both main\ncharacter got fell in loved to each other and nothing new to it. But it\nfun to watch, and it got a lot of sex scene that's all.\n"
"\nI was really expecting less, especially because I thought it would be a\ncopy of No strings attached. The plot was terrible, but I thought\nJustin's acting was pretty damn good, he represented that very capable\nbut still childish young businessman.<br><br>I guess people like to watch this, because it represents some kind of\ndream they'd like to live, believe me this is pure BS, this kind of\nthing doesn't happen. but well it is a chick flick, so it is what it\nis. Had a good time watching it thought. Cool mom, to me one of the\nthings that made the movie worth watching and Dad... The thing is that\neverything was so obvious and predictable and still people like to see\nthings happen, especially because you get to see really nice bodies.\nHours and hours at the gym.\n"
"\nI might be in the minority, but I found this film an example for all\nromantic- comedies of the future. It has an extremely self-aware\nscript, which follows the stereotypical romantic comedy formula while\nendlessly mocking it simultaneously. The chemistry between Timberlake\nand Mila Kunis is amazing, and is enough to carry the film at its\nrunning length.The stand-out supporting performers, however, are Woody\nHarrelson and Patricia Clarkson. It is a hilarious film, and is one of\nthe few romantic films which never runs out of passion or steam. Even\nthough it bears many similarities to films like No Strings Attached, it\nactually delivers on its concept better, and its much more likable.\n"
"\nThe acting is  cliché. It's horrible how the cutting is so obvious\nthat the resulting scenes are not quite smooth. I could actually\nimagine the separate takes &gt; and that coming from some one who never\ntook screenplay writing classes. I believe it says something about the\nmovie when audience loose their aesthetic distance and start addressing\nthe technical aspects. <br><br>Some characters come across as chopped off (Jamie's mother, the\nfather). They had potential in my opinion. They could have been very\ncharming if given enough space. Even Jamie (Mila) is quite obscured as\na character, we know about her from others' report but we rarely see\nher development or actual change conveyed through acting instead of\ntelling. <br><br>The city scenery is pleasing. <br><br>_____ my first movie review, sorry if it lacks.\n"
"\nYes, I know it's a chick flick. But on a cross country flight, I had to\npick something to watch on the airplane seat screen, and already saw\nMoneyball the first couple hours of the flight, so I gave this a try. I\ncan't stand Justin Timberlake, and quite honestly he seems like another\ngay guy unsuccessfully trying to pass off as a straight guy, but Mila\nKunis is still a hottie, so at least there's some eye candy. The movie\nis supposed to rip on romantic comedies, but quickly becomes the very\nthing it rips on. It gets quite predictable, and anyone in the audience\ncould have written the ending for it. Also it's more than obvious that\na few L.A. locations were trying to be passed off as New York (like the\nairport scenes). Overall not the worst movie ever, but pretty much\nforgettable.\n"
"\nThe movie gets a rating of 6.6 before I saw it, so I thought it would\nbe decent. Unfortunately, this movie follows the same formula like many\nothers before it. Two adults acting like immature teenagers. If they\nuse actors that look like teenagers, it would at least be more\nbelievable.<br><br>Justin's acting is so-so. the lead actress is not that attractive and\nis heavily covered with eye makeups.<br><br>If you have not seen a \"friends having sex\" type of movie, this would\nbe OK to watch. But if you've seen one, you've seen it all.<br><br>The only things that stands out are the creative ways credits are given\nat the beginning and the end of the movie.\n"
"\nWell, if they ever decide to give an Oscar for a comedy, they should\nuse this film as a guide. Kunis and Timberkale are amazing - who would\never have thought!<br><br>Of course, they could not have been as successful without such a\nwonderful script.<br><br>Always cute, sometimes laugh-out-load hysterical.<br><br>Patricia Clarkson will take those old enough back to the 60s/70s and\nWoody Harrelson is outrageously fantastic as a gay sports editor - a\ntour de force for him!<br><br>Perhaps a bit slow once or twice (but not for long) and maybe a bit off\nscript in one scene; but, altogether - a fantastic movie.<br><br>OK, OK, I know it's a rom-com guys; but, you will really get the humor.\nSee this one with a friend!!!<br><br>What? You're still reading - get up and go see this movie! Enjoy a\nlaugh or two...\n"
"\nThe faults of this movie slightly outweigh the good points. It tries to\nhave an informative SATC type look at relationships. But it kind of\nfeels silly more often. <br><br>Good points: Nice locations in NYC &amp; LA beach. There is some chemistry\nbetween the leads. Patricia Clarkson is different in her hippy type\nrole. Mila is pretty and okay to watch. The part with the father is\nquite touching. <br><br>There are some laughs here and there. <br><br>Bad Points: Too rushed dialog trying to jam in too many jokes in too\nshort a space of time. The sex scenes are a bit like jack rabbits.\nJustin's voice is a bit high pitched and the singing is juvenile. The\nsupporting cast are used kind of briefly and then discarded like Emma\nStone. The screenplay could have been tightened and edited a bit.<br><br>Overall OK for one watch but not one of the better ones.\n"
"\nThis was a very 21st century movie. It seemed like it was trying too\nhard to avoid being cliché, but it just ended up being cliché with a\ntwist. It was enjoyable to watch, and fun to see Justin Timberlake and\nMila Kunis in action. Above all, the soundtrack is awesome; just like\nthe movie hints. The good thing about this movie that stands out\nagainst the rest of its kind is that there's more to it than the title\nimplies. Most people have to learn the hard way in life; few save\nthemselves in time. The ending credits were so much fun that I had to\nsit until the very end. They did a great job on this movie. Few\nromantic comedies nowadays have as much creativity as this movie does.\n"
"\nAs a romantic-comedy, this will automatically have a female\ndemographic, but I reckon many men dragged along to see it with their\ngirlfriends may actually enjoy it, and not just for the sex scenes.<br><br>Yes, it doesn't stray far from predictability and soft comedy, but\nthere are glimmers of hilarity in it. Timberlake's character, Dylan, is\ninteresting and his underlying, endearing mathematics issue provides\nscenes of laugh-out-loud comedy.<br><br>Mila Kunis was very well cast. She brings a casual, natural and genuine\ncool-factor to the film, and one which Dylan is constantly striving to\nbeat. Their chemistry is great, and support from Richard Jenkins and\nWoody Harrelson gives the film a strong cast.<br><br>I haven't yet seen 'No Strings Attached' but I am more interested in\nseeing it now having seen this as I find it hard to imagine how\ndifferent it will be.<br><br>All-in-all, this is one of the better romantic-comedies out there, and\nwell worth a watch for rom-com fans, but I'd urge non-fans to give it a\ntry.\n"
"\nJamie (Mila Kunis) and Dylan (Justin Timberlake) are both successful\nprofessionals, but they just find true love. In frustration, they turn\ntheir friendship into friends with benefits.<br><br>This is built as the anti-rom-com. In fact there is a fake rom-com in\nthis movie where they point out all the movie clichés that they won't\nfall for. There's just something unlikeable about an anti-rom-com.\nThere's a reason why formula rom-com has been successful for so long.\nThe fact that both Jamie and Dylan try so hard to be detached\nemotionally makes this story emotionally detached. They just don't have\nthe chemistry required. There are some pretty funny moments. Patricia\nClarkson plays Jamie's inappropriate mother Lorna. She has some fun\nexchanges with the couple.\n"
"\nThe premise of \"Friendships with benefits\" is not a novel thing in\nHollywood. Some might even say that it is a very old motif and lacking\nin originality. And, \"They\" would be right! More so, when two extremely\nsimilar films are released within the very same year. If you missed it,\nthe other one is No Strings Attached and looks like a carbon copy of\nFriends with Benefits. The punch lines and jokes delivered by main\nleads, Kunis and Timberlake, are often clinical and sound rushed in. It\nfails to connect emotionally, seemingly missing the mark as a romantic\ncomedy; On the other hand, the comedic parts are rather acceptable, due\nto the help of supporting cast- Specifically, a note worthy performance\nfrom Woody Harrelson and amusing cameo appearances by Shaun White. I\nhave no problem believing that Kunis and Timberlake are good off screen\nfriends. But, on screen, they completely lack chemistry thus leaving\nthe stereotyped ending lifeless and unromantic! If you are looking for\na good romantic comedy, this movie isn't it.\n"
"\nFWB is the kind of film you chuck on after a bad day of work, so you\ncan zone out for a couple of hours. It's fun, surprisingly endearing\nand features a stellar cast that's sure to have you giggling.<br><br>After reading the more negative reviews, I think the biggest issue is\nwatching this without knowing what to expect. It's not new, it's not\nthought-provoking, and you can sure as hell guess what the ending is as\nsoon as you read the summary. Yet, it's amusing. It's a happy little\nfeel-good movie, and certainly nothing more. However, what makes it so\ngood is that the film knows that. It never pretends to be something\nit's not, and pokes fun at all the clichés it harbors. The chemistry\nbetween Kunis and Timberlake is enjoyable, the soundtrack is upbeat,\nand the supporting actors, while not as fleshed out as they could be,\nare fantastic.<br><br>Overall a 7/10, and an easily re-watchable film.\n"
"\nFriends with Benefits which has been described as a romantic comedy\nwith plenty of uninhibited scenes, explores the idea that affairs can\nbe carried on satisfactorily without any complicating notions of love\nor commitment. Several to only four writers are credited in this film,\nincluding director Will Gluck, along with five producers, and they've\ncome up with a storyline, a screenplay and some engaging performances\nfrom a first-rate ensemble cast. <br><br>Friends with Benefits was released several months after No Strings\nAttached (starring Ashton Kutcher and Natalie Portman) which are of\nsimilar plots, however Friends with benefits did slightly better at the\nbox office (worldwide), and received far better reviews from top\ncritics. What makes the film good and enjoyable is the chemistry from\nits leads, otherwise the film would have been a predictable and typical\nromantic- comedy which we have seen many times before.\n"
"\nFriends with benefits is complicated. This movie does feature some good\nperformances, including Justin Timberlake, Mila kunis, and woody\nharrelson. The script is alright, cliché at times. You may be surprised\nto know that this movie actually does have a sweet undertone and heart\nfelt moments. Sure, there are racy sex scenes involved, of course there\nare, you know that from the title, but this movie has more to it than\njust that. There are some funny lines, but unfortunately not enough.\nThe movie drags a bit at times, it slows down and you really don't want\nit too, so that's one issue. The sex scenes are comical and hot, and\nthey work for this film. Also the sexual content and nudity isn't too\noverly graphic, so it isn't uncomfortable or awkward in any way. So\noverall a 6/10, almost, but not quite.\n"

"\nThis is the second one of it's kind I have seen this year, with this\nkind I mean friends- having-sex-just-for-fun-but-wanting-more kind of\nflicks, I think both of them are equally good, but in each their own\nway.<br><br>In No strings attached with Natalie Portman as the leading female, it\nis more subtle and sweet, but this has a more becoming Mila Kunis\napproach, loud, dirty, sexy and good. So this has a few other view\npoints, and is essentially the opposite of the other, except they both\nhave the same theme and they more or less end the same way.<br><br>In this the side characters are way better, especially Woody Harrelson\nis great, he is a very fun homosexual male, not to much in any way, but\nenough to make his point and a lot of good remarks. But it is also nice\nto see Jenna Elfman again, it's been a while and even though this\ndoesn't give her the biggest scenes, she does very well and has a nice\nrole.\n"
"\nFriends with Benefits does not redefine the tried and tested rom-com\nformula. It is pretty much the same as any of the other movies from\nthis genre. However, the lead actors Justin Timberlake and Mila Kunis\nhave a mesmerizing chemistry which makes the movie really watchable.\nThe writing is crisp and witty. The story is about two people who\ndecide to have sex without getting in a relationship. However, they\neventually develop feelings for each other without admitting it. The\nfilm separates itself from the bunch by being self-conscious as the\nleads repeatedly mention the fact that their story is similar to a\nHollywood movie. However, some of the melodrama seems contrived when\neverything seemed to be going perfectly well between the two. Mila\nKunis shines in this movie and is extremely likable. Watch it for the\nchemistry and sharp dialog.\n"
"\nThis movie would be different without Mila Kunis. It seems to me like\nit was made for her. Her best act until today for me. She is so good\nacting that it would be the same even the movie is without sound. Her\nacting was full of life, natural... She brings up meaning to this movie\nand Justin Timberlake is from my angle just doing his job. Personally I\nwas waiting to see her in movie like this from \"That '70s Show\" because\nher potential was underrated and positive energy she gives not used as\nshould be.<br><br>Watch this movie, you are going to remember it. Movie could be maybe\nbetter but Mila Kunis no way because again she is so good.<br><br>Good story, great picture, pleasure for eyes !\n"
"\nFirst half was not bad but the second's was totally cliché'! This movie\nmakes you laugh but the real comedy is in the first half of it;the\nsubject seems good &amp; the dialogs are not bad! About the second's i can\ntell you that the romantic part begins &amp; it's just like the cliché\ncomedy &amp; romantic movies but it must be told that the movie itself with\nthe showing of Jason Segel's film tells that the end is so cliché &amp; we\ncould assume that as a difference between this romantic &amp; the others!\nMy suggestion: The movie is not bad to see but you shouldn't have the\nspecial expectations from this film than the other comedy &amp; romantic\nmovies!\n"
"\nAimed squarely at the 14-30 year old crowd, BENEFITS has two young\nprofessionals becoming friends and then sexual partners, the idea being\nthat they will not become emotionally attached. They will not be the\nconventional boyfriend and girlfriend as played out in the movies they\nlove to mock. This sort of relationship is common enough in real life\n-- all one has to do is watch Divorce Court. But for purposes of this\nfantasy, we accept the situation as out of the norm. Justin Timberlake\nand Mila Kunis are the leads, and Jenna Elfman, Woody Harrelson and Pat\nClarkson are on hand for support. Veteran character actor Richard\nJenkins plays Timerlake's dad who is slowly slipping into dementia. The\nsex scenes are tame for an R-rated flick, and played strictly for\nlaughs. They are in no way erotic, for you worried parents out there.\nAlso, for most of the movie, Kunis doesn't look all that appealing. Her\nmakeup and hair are all wrong until the closing scenes, when she\nfinally looks like the attractive actress we know.Perhaps this was done\non purpose. I suspect it was.\n"
"\nThere have been several movies come out within the past few years with\nthis same plot idea. And that's the main problem, this movie was so\npredictable. Basically a guy and girl decide to have a physical\nrelationship with no emotional attachment. And of course, they both\nfall for each other at the end.<br><br>In this case, it's Justin Timberlake, Dylan and Mila Kunis, Jamie, whom\ndecide to start getting it on every chance they get, but no dating is\ninvolved. Woody Harrelson is thrown in for a little comedy, as Dylan's\ngay co-worker. But nothing new is really offered by this movie.<br><br>FINAL VERDICT: If you are a big Justin or Mila fan, I'm sure you'll\nwant to see it, but otherwise skip it.\n"
"\nWithout specific spoilers I'll tell you this: the end isn't a shocker,\nhowever I was pleasantly surprised over all.<br><br>A friend's girl brought this over for movie night, and I'm always\ninterested in something new. I thought the story line was cute and well\nlaid out. The movie moves along quickly and provides some good comedy.<br><br>Patricia Clarkson as the loopy, liberal mom is always good for a\ngiggle. What surprised me was the chemistry between Mila and Justin.\nThey played off of each other very well matching energies and providing\na very believable non-couple.<br><br>As others have mentioned this is similar to a handful of movies that\nhave come out recently in basic plot, no dating- just sex. To be honest\nI'm really not surprised the current 20-30 set is the result of the\ndivorces of the 80's and 90's. Which - in my circle - has led to more\nthan a few commitment shy adults who wouldn't mind this set-up.<br><br>The movie is true to current culture in that aspect and offers a fun\nride while telling what turns out to be a very sweet story.\n"
"\nWhile the movie is aware of the clichés that are thrown into the mix\nwhen making (or watching) a romantic comedy and they also play with\nthem at the beginning (with a kind of harsh comment concerning a Miss\nHeigl), it does fall back on the same \"mistakes\" it criticizes. And\nwhile it does so with a wink (and a great \"number\" towards the end,\nwhich in itself is a great payoff), it does feel a bit like a cheat.\nThe movie should have stuck to its guns.<br><br>But with Mila Kunis and Justin Timberlake it has a great cast, that\nalmost make you forget about those little mishaps. Even a sub-story\nwith Richard Jenkins though, feels a bit forced. There are quite a few\nfunny moments and there is no doubt where this will lead, but it could\nhave been a real good stab at romantic comedies. As it is, it's just\nanother one of them ...\n"
"\nAfter watching the movie \"No String Attached\" I wondered what would be\ndifferent about this movie since both movies share similar premise. The\ndialogue goes in a direction where it tries a bit too hard to be hip.\nThe movie starts out alright but it goes in a really cliché direction\nafter it makes fun to cliché romantic comedies. What it does is bash on\nthe old romantic comedies that goes in a cliché direction but it copies\nall the recent romantic comedies. It seemed the two main characters\ntries to show off how laid back and cool they are, which gets sort of\nannoying after a while. There is just so many today's wannabe hip\ncliché stuff crammed into this and it just doesn't seem all that\nnatural. The chemistry between Justin Timberlake and Mila Kunis was not\nbelievable. I would have preferred Jessica Biel who didn't get the role\nbecause of Mila Kunis. Personally am not really a fan of Mila Kunis the\nchemistry just seemed weak. But tries to atone for it by putting a\nbunch of sex scenes in there. Personally I would have preferred Jessica\nBiel in those scenes.<br><br>5.5/10\n"
"\nThis movie prides itself from being different, but in the mist of it\nbring a fresh take on romantic comedies, it falls under the same\ngarbage we've all seen before. Right down to the favorite song cliché,\nthey watch a romantic comedy that is almost as ridiculous as what I\nwitnessed.<br><br>Pros: Timberlake and Kunis work well together<br><br>It was better than \"No Strings Attached\", if that means anything<br><br>You'll remember \"Jump\"<br><br>Cons: Has to be raunchy to be different than, \"No Strings Attached\" <br><br>Does nothing new <br><br>The gay jokes were okay, but it seemed like there wasn't many.<br><br>Summary: <br><br>While it does nothing new, \"Friends With Benefits\" is still a watchable\nmovie if you are looking for a dumb comedy, to put it bluntly. You\nmight get a few laughs\n"
"\nFriends with Benefits<br><br>The best thing about engaging in a solely sexual relationship with a\nfriend is that you can tell them when the sex sucks.<br><br>Fortunately, the boot-knocking between the buddies in this rom-com is\nthe least of their worries.<br><br>Headhunted by GQ magazine, art director Dylan (Justin Timberlake) moves\nto New York with a little coaxing from the recruiter Jamie (Mila\nKunis).<br><br>Ultimately accepting the position, Dylan and Jamie begin hanging out.<br><br>One night, after eviscerating the structure of romantic comedies, the\npair decides to venture into a physical relationship void of emotional\nattachments.<br><br>Inevitably their experiment fails, and Jamie returns to the dating\nscene.

"\nWhatever it is that made Natalie Portman's No String Attached worked\nout fine, the same cannot be said about Friends with Benefits. The\nmovie just does not cut it and the chemistry is just not there. Not to\nsay the least, I am no admirer of Justin Timberlake's acting talent and\napart from Social Network; the lad has zero acting ability and should\ntake some acting classes. Despite being picture perfect, Mila Kunis\ndoes not add much to her role apart from being beautiful for beautiful\nsake. At the end of the day, Friends with Benefits does not work\nbecause it doesn't walk the talk. From the start the movie pokes fun at\nromantic comedies and the clichés of love, only to go back into the\nHollywood syndrome by the film ending credits. Basically, this film\ndoes not convince me and pretty much an unnecessary affair <br><br>Neo rates it 4/10.<br><br>- www.thehkneo.com\n"
"\nI wouldn't give a rating of 8 over 10 to this movie like almost\neverybody else, but I see some prejudices in some cruel comments, and\non the contrary I believe it worths to watch. Some people just gave 2-3\npoints as if those films, in which we see some visuals, are perfect in\nsense. There are a lot worse movies than this one, and if you think\nthis movie deserves 3 over 10, then, Hollywood must stop the 90 % of\ntheir films.<br><br>Justin's other recent movie, \"In time\", has got 6.8/10, and hasn't\nnobody else seen the toy car crushing scene and the rest of the crap in\nthat movie? So how the hell is this \"Friends with Benefits\" worse than\nthat movie?\n"
"\nFriends with Benefits is another of the friends-sex-drama which tries\njoking around the concept of friends can have non-passionate-sex, but\nONLY for a stress release.<br><br>It follows up in back of other films just the same, like No Strings\nAttached. I'm a big fan of Kutcher, so that kind of put me in a\nfavour-situation, but nevertheless I will be objective.<br><br>FWB starts in the funny way, meeting Dylan who tries getting settled in\nNY. OK, the first 30 minutes have its moments and is kind of funny. And\nI will not criticize the way they introduce the friend-sex-thing, it is\nan (if it is possible to believe) convincing dialog sequence (actually\nall the dialog is not that bad). The problem is that the story and\njokes aren't funny. Except for the first part, I think the homosexual\nguy is the best thing and it ends up with that I only wait for him to\nsay something funny. This is were I think Portman and especially\nKutcher succeeded BIGtime.<br><br>Sorry Kunis, still think you are really good, but you should have\nstayed at That's 70s Show.<br><br>5/10\n"
"\nFWB tries to be a pastiche of romantic movies and, inevitably, ends up\nbeing exactly what it's sending up.<br><br>THe first 25 minutes are simply excellent - witty, fast, furious, and\nfun. However, it totally runs into cliché territory and not in a good\nway.<br><br>There is plenty of spark between the leads and a great supporting cast,\nbut not even they can rescue this by the end. It is harmless and good\nfun, but given the excellent promise of the first half hour you are\nleft cruelly disappointed by the end. Sure it's a romantic comedy, and\na good one, but this is not as new or as innovative in any way.<br><br>Enjoyable, sure, but nowhere near the promise of its excellent\nbeginning.\n"
"\nBUT, the beginning was sooo slow an jumping so fast from scene to scene\nthat I was about to turn the movie off, but I kept watching an it got\npretty cool through the sec half an the last part of the movie.<br><br>Looks play a huge part, because M.Kunis is beautiful an J.Timberlake is\noh so fine!! the two together have a nice humor young like chemistry.\nyes, their acting skills aren't perfect, but it was pretty OK, its not\nlike they've been acting for 30 years...<br><br>I haven't watched romantic comedies in awhile, so I wasn't looking at\ntypical comedies verses others, I just sat back an enjoyed it. I\nlearned something from this movie an I believe it can be true in\nreality that you can be friends an have sex an then choose to be more\nthan friends ex: couple... its possible. it is 2013, so there are new\nrules to life an this movie prove it, in conclusion, besides the\nbeginning being blah with fast all over the place pace, the rest of the\nmovie was pretty cool! great job Kunis an Timberlake!\n"
"\nThis film had such potential. Mila Kunis was adorable. Her character\nwas clever and plucky. Spoiler alert: I loved the subplot involving the\nfamily in California (especially the father suffering Alzheimer's) .\nThe characterization of both hero and heroine was well done. Their\npersonal growth and the inevitable romance made this a cute romantic\ncomedy story.<br><br>However, what ruined this movie for me (and I'm no prude) was the\nexplicit sexual dialog and scenes. It did not move the story forward.\nIt was offensive and disgusting. What saved the movie for me was the\nscene with his father in the airport restaurant. So sweet and touching.<br><br>If you can get through the unnecessarily explicit sex scenes, you will\nenjoy this movie.\n"
"\nI had seen No Strings Attached before I saw this one and everyone\nseemed to think that it was a great movie and that this one was not\nworth watching. I was anxious to watch this one and see if they were\nall correct. In my honest opinion Friends with Benefits blew No Strings\nAttached out of the water. I don't really have much desire to watch No\nStrings Attached again but I would love to see Friends With Benenfits\nmany many more times. I enjoyed the humor in this movie. I love Woody's\nperformance as the gay guy. He did a super job. It was also refreshing\nto me to see Mila and Justin's characters seem so comfortable with each\nother in all ways. They worked well together and brought something new.\nI can't wait to buy this DVD!\n"
"\n8/10. Pretty good and funny. Sometime mild predictable moments but it\nwas forgiving because of the situation. The acting and chemistry\nbetween Justin Timerlake and Mila Kunis was great. There was a good mix\nof drama and comedy and the film wasn't over-done with clichés apart\nfrom when the film deliberately was meant to be cliché as a joke.\nHighly recommended drama/comedy/romance film. If you are a guy, don't\nget put off with the romance aspect of the film, it's not lingered upon\nmuch and is more comedy and drama and enough to appeal to a group of\nfriends who want to see a good comedy film at the cinema or just a\nadult couple who want to see something for a good laugh.\n"
"\nFriends with Benefits may be the first romantic comedy to be just as\nenjoyable for dudes as it is for girls, if not more. The cleverly\nwritten, witty dialogue delivered by the all-around cool guy Justin\nTimberlake and the newest it-girl of Hollywood, the sexy AND funny Mila\nKunis are both amazingly likable in this movie. The on-screen chemistry\nbetween the two is obvious, and the way the characters they play keep\non one-upping each other with witty one-liners is hilarious. Timberlake\nand Kunis are comedic geniuses, and they provide laughs without ever\ntrying too hard or being overly inappropriate. The casting of the movie\nis excellent, I very much prefer this movie over the similarly themed\n\"No Strings Attached\". Watch this not for the plot, but the actors, you\nwon't regret it!\n"
"\nJustin Timberlake has really surprised a lot of people with his acting\nskills. And that he will be around for a long time with the right kind\nof roles he is playing.<br><br>His character and Mila Kunis character are dumped in the form of Emma\nStone and Andy Samberg respectively. As Kunis character is NY based and\nTimberlake's character is LA based. As both at first hit it off.<br><br>Timberlake is trying to land a job. With Kunis as his guide. But they\nhave sexual tension too hot to bear. But the catch is they want to\nremain friends, and nothing beyond that.<br><br>Well easier said than done! As it seems to be the case. Can they remain\nthat way without having their sexual desires get in the way? Really\nfunny and both actors have chemistry!\n"
"\nA film which should suit any age. Romance and comedy which is the\nperfect combination. Most people in live have attempted to have a\nfriend with benefit, and this film tells you why its difficult to keep\nit. With the sexy actor Justin Timberlake and beautiful Mila Kunis, you\nwatch two people who start of having a bit of fun, end up falling for\neach other. It's not all about the sex, a part of Dylan's (Timberlake)\nlive has a secret which can relate to those who are also struggling\nwith someone Alzheimer's. I loved the film and it suits anyone weather\nor not you haven't had a friend with benefit as it just makes you laugh\nthroughout. All my friends have loved this film as it relates to\neveryone so you should watch it too, I highly recommend it.\n"
"\nit's not that strong film but it's so funny to watch it acting very\ngood cast good also i like them both of them but may be there's a very\ngood story then this film but in the end or the summary it's nice watch\nit .....<br><br>the boy so sexy and the girl too i like her and her body :P<br><br>it's a sex movie i think because of that 18+<br><br>but like i said it's cool film and very nice and i like it<br><br>nice watch too you all :* a h m a d<br><br>nice to see you and i don't know what i can say else they want 10 lines\nto write on this review thank you to see my review and nice watch one\nmore time\n"
"\nIMDb had a 6.7 rating for this movie which is usually represents a\nmovie worthy of watching at least once, so I decided to give this a\nshot even though I don't care for JT or his acting at all. Huge\nmistake. The movie was raunchy and totally predictable, it wasn't the\nleast bit funny, and there was no chemistry at all between the lead\nactors (due in part to the fact that JT doesn't talk or act like a\nheterosexual).<br><br>Seriously, is this what passes for a romantic comedy nowadays?. I\nwanted to kick myself for wasting 2 hours watching this garbage, when I\nwould've MUCH rather watched When Harry Met Sally for the 7th or 8th\ntime. But hey, if you liked Forgetting Sarah Marshall (garbage), or\nGood Luck Chuck (garbage except for Jessica Alba in itty bitty Penguin\nunderwear ;)), then maybe this movie is for you. A word to the wise\nthough, don't watch it with your children, regardless of age.\n"
"\nI thought this movie was really good fun and found myself giggling a\nlot while watching it. Especially all the lines relating to multimedia\ntrends, 2011 lifestyle and all that hit right home and were really\nwitty (\"Bible App\"...).<br><br>Timberlake and Kunis have a very good chemistry together and a\nscrewball comedy feel to them. Justin will somehow always be the little\nguy from N'Sync to me, but he managed to parody himself by singing at\nall occasion during this movie. And ... not a bad actor, no.<br><br>Okay, it was crystal clear where the plot was heading, when Justin and\nMila met at the Airport, but still enjoyable and fun movie and one of\nthe better romcoms I'd say.\n"
"\nI want to start by saying that this movie has nothing to do with the\nmovie No Strings Attached even though the plot has some similarities\nit's way better.<br><br>First the script was wonderful written and cinematography i have to say\nwas quite great and thats because cinematographer Michael Grady choose\nsome great lovely,romantic places of New York to shoot the film.<br><br>And also Justin Timberlake for me it was just the right guy for the\nrole because of his young looking fresh style.But we can't forget Mila\nKunis who she was perfect playing that emotonialy damaged girl and also\nher out of the teeth manners and her bizarre sexieness really makes you\nlove the characters and the movie of course.<br><br>So,if you like to see a young fresh comedy i'll recommend this movie\nfor sure.\n"
"\nSexy, smart, and hilarious, FWB is a great romantic comedy for adults!\nThis outrageous film staring the spunky and beautiful Mila Kunis and\nJustin Timberlake will have you smiling throughout the whole movie! It\ngives you all of what a romantic comedy would. Even though it is the\nsame old \"romantic/comedy\" genre it is still enjoyable to watch! FWB\nreally defines true love as well, it teaches you a valuable lesson,\ndon't ever lose your first love! The whole concept of the movie is very\nrelated to a lot of people! Of you love those romantic comedies that\nmake you laugh and cry as well, FWB is the way to go! Even though,\n(like all romantic comedies), it gets serious at the end, it is still a\ngood film to watch! FWB is the way to go if you are craving for a good\nromantic comedy that you haven't seen in a while!\n"
"\nthis film was magnificent. after first reading the reviews on IMDb i\nwas skeptical upon going down to my local movie theater to watch this\nbut i am so glad i did for starters i have only seen justin timberlake\nin bad teacher and i didn't think he played much of a good role there.\nmila kunis however i have seen her in forgetting sarah marshill and she\nis one of the most beautiful actress in the world and on screen these\ntoo main actors make a very convincing story.<br><br>friends with benefits is a sexy funny and an all together good romantic\ncomedy i think the film should of focused more on there relationship\nwith each other towards the end and maybe that could of been slightly\nbetter because you don't want the film to end but all together 9.5/10\n"
"\nThe movie was entirely predictable since it was, after all, a formulaic\nchick flick (Boy meets girl, good moments, bad moments, almost break up\nand then patch up leading to Happily ever after). But it was funny at\ntimes and had some poignant moments thrown in for good measure. Justin\nTimberlake, though he's getting typecast in fast talking smooth\noperator type roles, was good. Mila Kunis was better and they had\npretty nice chemistry together. I like how they broke couple of\nstereotypes (art director, sports editor, who was probably the\nfunniest, BTW). Her mom's character was funny as well. It won't stick\nwith you, but it won't bore you while you're in there either. Good one\nto watch w/ your SO. <br><br>6/10\n"
"\nI went to the movie with no expectations, and was thoroughly\nentertained. A laugh riot from the get go! A very funny movie that\ndeals with dating, friends, relationships, and sex.<br><br>The audience broke into laughter several times throughout the\nmovie--clearly bits and pieces of the movie resonated with one and all.<br><br>Performances by the actors was great--there was spontaneity, chemistry,\nand awesome screen presence. And of course, NYC is at its best. One\ncannot help but fall in love with the characters as they walk in\nCentral Park or gush through Times Square.<br><br>It is a light hearted movie that makes you feel good about life!\n"
"\nBefore to go, thought it was a cheesy movie and was not really \r\ninterested since the trailer is not good at all and doesn't really \r\nbrought out how funny the movie is since it promotes a regular topic. \r\nBut, Still gave it a chance and just came back and i was not \r\ndisappointed at all. It was really funny and i really enjoyed this \r\nmovie, laugh a lot and enjoyed it for the jokes and how reality kicks \r\nin.\r\n\r\nI think the advertisement was of bad quality and don't show the quality \r\nof the movie and i misleading.\r\n\r\nOverall the movie was really good and funny. Also i love Mila Kunis but \r\nthought that Timberlake would be a joke but he was really good as well. \r\nWorth watching !!! (also cant be compared to no strings attached which \r\nwas terribly bad)\n"
"\nI had the opportunity to go see this movie as a sneak preview, and I\nmust say that I was pleasantly surprised. Sure, as one user already\nsaid, this movie has the classic \"boy meets girl, boy breaks up with\ngirl, boy chases girl to get girl back\" feel, but the present it in a\nnew way.<br><br>This movie had me rolling from the beginning... the greatest part about\nit was it had fun poking at itself and other movies of it's genre, as\nwell as inserting cliché's in a way that it even poked fun at the\nclichés.<br><br>I guess the best way to say it is, I just watched this movie free, and\nI'd still go back and way to watch again.\n"
"\nI LOVED this movie! Saw a free preview of it last night and was\npleasantly surprised. I was not expecting much because I'm not a huge\nfan of Justin's but it turned out great and Mila was perfect and\ngorgeous! Very sarcastic, funny, and reminded me of some friends of\nmine. I laughed the whole way through! Only a couple of small corny\nparts that slightly threw it off but you had to expect it because it's\na chic flick. I would actually pay to see this again! I tie it with the\nmovie The Ugly Truth. Wish they had more of Mila's mom and Justin's gay\ncoworker and the ending could have been more like the movie-\nchill/funny/not so mushy. Also, the sexy scenes could have been a\nlittle more... sexxxy ;)\n"
