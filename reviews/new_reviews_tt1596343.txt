this is the film that singlehandedly got me to give the rest of the series a shot for better or worse
its a nice change of pace from the previous films where it abandons the street race angle how far could you have taken that anyway
and goes into the direction of a heist action flick with cars
dwayne johnson is a great addition and really adds to the series embracing the goofiness of its premise
so yeah still the best this franchise had and thats kind of rare for a franchise on its fifth film
the action for the most part is really handled well and a lot of fun to watch
the cast as an ensemble are very charismatic which no doubt makes it more fun for audiences to see a cast that has so much diversity and its not done with generic stereotypes but just a bunch of people with a common interest
overall a very entertaining action flick
this movie was very good and exciting
effects and musics are essential things for this movie series
everything was excellent
i thinkthis movies scenario make this movie one of the best movie series
intelligent and excellent planspeed and expensive cars which are most important things for this movie
in this movie my favorite car is dodge charger
in this movie the best scene is a race for 10 billion dollar which i loved it
in this movie dom showed his experiences about driving
this movie had expensive budget
i am glad to chris morgan and gary scott thompson because of this perfect movie
im waiting for sixth movie which is in this series
when i saw the film loved it too and stills the most wonderful in this film when dominique torito and brian oconnor ptdel large storage before the arrival of the police to them and they are in the way of escape and also the way who conducted by dominique torito rid of men hernan reyes and they are trying to catch its also the atmosphere that was where prevail fbi agent its airport hobbs to dominique torito and words that were taking place between fbi agent hop and dominique torito and also a lot in the shots in this film which won my admiration especially the role of the roman pyrrhus in this film made distinctive nhech this film is being a comedian and lazy and fearful in this film but his role in carrying out the tasks in order to reach hernan reyes is one of the finest tactics that ive seen in my life
yeah exactly
theyve found the key to the success i guess
i am so appreciated myself for being patient watching the first movies of the franchise
i was welcomed by a gorgeous work as ive hoped since watching fast amp furious 2009 4
i advise those who consider starting the franchise to be patient watching the first three nightmares not recommended to skip them because there are some connection to be needed afterwards
its good to focus on theme of the armed actionthriller also including fight rather than racingbased events
it is also one of the movies at which i laugh much
on the other hand some scene of it is seriously touching
action thriller comedy dram doesnt matter what youre interested in
this installment has all
the movie fast five was a very good movie because it had a lot going on through out the movie
and it has a lot of action which i like because it kept you on the edge of your seat because the problems that are happening are interesting
the sound of the cars and everything is really cool because it all combined together well
all the cars and racing was very intense and cool
the actors where the best for the movie because they are tough and suit the personalities of the movie characters
for example dom one of the main characters was big strong and scary so it showed that the people that are racing the cars have to be tough and scary looking
then they have paul walker and he doesnt look like a racer but is and is apart of the family
so overall the movie fast five is a very good movie and deserves good ratings
fast five best one from the franchise
the other ones were very good too
i love fast and furious movies they were always amazing for me
now to the movie it is awesome movie because of the action
the action is just amazing and the cars are sweet
testosterone rock as a new one to the crew is perfect and good old dome is just badass and brian he is just good
i liked that he has way more action then he had it the other movies
paul walker wasnt oscar worthy actor but he did the job and i thing that he managed it very well especially the scenes where he rage in that way i think hes perfect
so the action is totally perfect acting is very good and dialogs are very good too
i love the movie
i love everything about it
its just mind blowing movie
the movie still has its feelings of brotherhood and contains a lot action and nice cars although the movie misses street races the nightlife of illegal street racing like in the first and second fast and furious films
there are some mistakes in the storyline that disturbs me however they are minor errors that are unlikely to be discovered perhaps if you watch it more than 10 times as i did
the movie in general i think is awesome the action sequences and the humor that is absolutely awesome
rip paul
you will be missed you did achieve a lot inspired many
i had always loves the series and enjoyed all of them
this one ships with usual clicha and storyline
the chases are hair raisingdialogs are solidand there are plenty of funny lines
all of this makes fast five a must watch although suspension of belief if always there in hollywood entertainment movies
this film follows a tight script with lots of twists and turns although all of them may not surprise you
plot is really convincing and carried forward by amazing cinematography and editing
director cleverly choose between amazing camera angleswhich editor had turned into a edge of the seat scenes
this film never misses the beat even when there are short emotional moments in the movie
good movie
great story line
however i was very disappointed in the lack of street racing and japanese street cars
when they won all of the cars they should have shown how some of the races when they won them
there was great action scenes and everything besides the lack of street racing was good
2 fast 2 furious had a pretty good amount of street racing making it my second favorite fast and furious but tokyo drift was by far my favorite it had plenty of street racing car driving and drifting i loved it
please put more street racing in next movie make it more like tokyo drift please this one seems to be missing the old fast and furious trademark the driving street racing etc
and make sure to include japanese street cars such as skylines evos supras 350z etc
oh and please make sure paul walker is in it
thanks

finally dominic and brian race for the last time
film is finish
the film was a action film
in my opinion this film is the best film of the action film
first graphs of the scene was very excellent
the film contains famous actress and actor
ludicrous don omarvin dieselpaul walkerjordana brewster and there was many person but my favorite actor was vin diesel because he was mias jordanas brother and he was brother really
he was wonderful driver
i liked two scene
the first one somebody stole the cars from train
the second one big robbery
the end of the film was excellent really
im very excited
i watched with my uncle
everything of the film very beautiful
thanks a lot justan lin
i think you should watch a film
if you arent watchyou can lose
this might just be the best movie of all time
i certainly did not expect this from a fast and the furious movie
the action genre is a dying and dreary one but this movie lifts it from the gutter high into the sky
the mere originality that justin lin delivers is without a doubt one of the most incredible ones i have ever experienced
the acting is solid and believable and for the first time vin diesel actually displayed some emotions
the twist at the end was one of the most psychologically thrilling i have ever seen
do not hesitate to watch this movie they rarely come this good
seriously if youre not a pleb you will totally enjoy this movie so will your girlfriend
i loved this movie
the action scenes are exhilarating too a whole new level
everyone was great in this one no weak links to be found which also made it a great movie going experience
some standoutstyrese gibson from the urban drama classic baby boy really played his character
he was hilarious in every scene he had
the rockdwayne johnson was excellent luke hobbs who was bad ass in his role and looked to be enjoying be apart of the cast
the pivotal scene where he is down and looks to be out help and unexpected is on the way in such a epic guns blazing scene that was so damn good
i almost gave this movie a 10 because seriously it is that good of a movie and by and i dont give movies 10 these days
go see this
its worth it and u wont never regret it
best movie of the summer
a
ok i have never been a fan of f and f series
first one was a good surprise fresh and at some point original 2nd one was really bad maybe cause vin diesel was not participating in that one but in the end it sucked i never saw tokio drift and the last one was a mix of bad acting bad plot barely decent action and some cgi effects that looked very fake
but omg this one has it all from beginning to end is great entertainment nothing more nothing less
its like having together the best parts of the franchise with a touch of oceans eleven and some action scenes that are simply jaw dropping
this is how all the past movies should have been and being this a 5th part that is quit an achievement maybe it is an exaggeration but for me this is the masterpiece of all the 5th parts
definitely worth the price of the ticket and i cant wait to see it in blu ray and replay a few times the last half hour of the movie
fast five is my all time favorite movie
it had great fighting and racing scenes
everything was perfect
your dumb not to like it
vin diesel is a great actor for the movie
hes daring and always prepared
as usual fast five had a great beginning and a great ending
it seemed like a suicide mission but they made anything possible at the end
the seen with the train was very exciting
you always wanted to know what was going to happen
the movie changed a lot to surprise you which made it very suspenseful
they invested a lot of money into this movie with all the destroyed cars
it made it totally worth it
it is a great movie compared to the other fast and furious movies
it makes you want want to see the next sequel because it always keeps you guessing at the end
thats why im positive fast and furious six will be just as good or even better
fast five is a terrific action movie with a well written script
the action scenes are the best in the entire fast series and i rate the fast five a solid 10 stars
for sheer thrills and edge of your seat action dont miss this movie
romance is kept to a minimum a must for action movies and the next chase gun fight etc
is just a couple minutes away
the 110 minutes on the screen went by in a flash another indication of how great this movie is
ive been to movies where 2 hours seem like 2 days
d johnson really held up his part of the movie and was very believable in his dss fbi like role
btw i usually dont rate the movies i really like above a 7 or 8 stars but fast five deserves the entire ammo belt load of 10 stars
if you like action pics duh who doesnt see this movie
fast five is for many the best fast amp furious in the franchise and its not many times that we see a 5th good movie for instance a good day to die hard was disappointing or rocky v was good for me but everyone else hated it
fast 5 has one of the most badass fight scenes from the series im talking about the rock doing the spear at vin diesel also fast cars beautiful women and a lot of chases from rooftop to rooftop
its easy to see why people loved this film and why it still seems to be the best one it was directed in a very good way it was mostly a heist movie but also it was just a better movie than the previous 4 especially 2 and 3
this is how you make a series great where many people were mixed with the first 4 and now they love this one good job people
i did not like the first movie of the fast and the furious
i like 2 fast 2 furious
and i like the fast and the furious tokyo drift
and i like fast and furious new model original parts
but this is better
this movie has a great story line
it also has great acting
it also has a lot of action
7
3 is a good ratting
but this is such a great movie that 7
3 is underrating it
i give it 9
it is a great movie
furious 7 is a better
but still this a great movie
if you like action movies then you will like this movie
this is a movie that you should see
i is a very cool movie
if you do not like this movie thats ok with movie
but if you do not then i do not think you do not like action movies
warning may contain spoilers
this is a good action thriller movie with strong characters
there is a good feeling that these characters care about each other
the director handles the intense action sequences in a good way
they are entertaining to watch
the main villain is a bit weak
i didnt really feel threatened by him
the film has a pretty good soundtrack that fits into it well enough
the ending leaves you wanting another movie
i just finished watching fast amp furious 4 and now im starting this installment fast five
i must say so far this has been the very best transition from one installment to the next so far
much better than any of the previous installments
i loved the introduction of the rock in this installment as well as the fact that all of the originals were back
now the stunts in this installment was were the best up until this point in the franchise library
vince
it was nice to have brian save vince in the last one vince was in part 1 because after that here in fast five they got along pretty well
let me buckle down and tune in to this one
i think i can recall much of this one and i recall it being pretty entertaining
time for me a beer and movie time
ill add more if need be
yes bring in the team
yes this is when it got back good
im loving it
the mix of all the best from each installment prior to this one and its on
this was the best one after 1
i usually finish movies  even bad ones  but this is worse than bad
girl im pregnant
boy youre kidding me
or this mission just went from mission impossible to mission insanity
yes thats the kind of completely braindead dialog thats commonplace in this holyhellcrudfest
this is a movie whose story and dialog has the sophistication of a grandtheftaudio video game
it features ludicrous action sequences terrible direction and equally bad acting and line deliveries
there are lots of good looking people on screen with stilted cuecardbad linedelivery take your pick of any actor involved
before even starting this stinkfest you knew who the target audience was for by the pg13 rating
to top off the music is lifted from old miami vice episodes
not worth your time
a true turkey
how would i describe fast five
preposterous
ridiculous
absurd
the film is riddled with oneliners and stunts that would kill the average humanexcept for chuck norris but is he really human yet it is entertaining for a summer popcorn film
i have seen all of the series except for the fast and the furious tokyo drift and this one seems to be the worst of all
it is like they said lets take all the good parts of all the previous films and through it together
unfortunately it does not work
this film was about them stealing cars but they dont show many cars in the film and they hint at races but skip to the next scene so we dont actually see the races
we meet some characters but only for as minute and then they almost disappear for the rest of the film
as i stated above it is still entertaining but
just check your brain at the door
if you are a big fan of the fast and furious franchise
then i recommend this movie to you
it has all the actionfoot chasesand best of all
who doesnt want to miss out on two buff dudes beating each other senseless
the acting is okand to be honest the stunts are just crazy insane
i hope my review helped a little bit
im just hoping this is really the ending to fast and furiousbecause i believe this a brilliant ending to a brilliant franchise
thusim really excited to get the movie on dvd when it comes out
anywayi hope my review helped out a little bit
and im hoping to see some more movies from justin lin in the future
the fast and furious franchise always gave a fun time thats full of rush from the very first movie to this its always fun to watch and you will always have fun if your a classic fan of the franchise now those who criticize this movie cant deliver everything you want i mean yes its definitely not the godfather
and you certainly wont expect anything of that magnitude in this movie but than again this movie is all about having a good time and checking out fast cars and hot babes
thats how its always been and always will be people will be satisfied with this movie because it delivers what you expect and more
the classic chase and thrills and to add up the excitement there are some extra materials that i wont give away so if you are fan of rush and excitement and just wanna have a good time  this is the movie for you
now i am not a fan of racing movies but this was not a racing movie
although that may disappoint some fast and furious lovers action movie lovers rejoice
fast five is full of exciting action scenes gorgeous women and fast cars
if you come to the theater with a hunger to see someone get the living hell beat out of him you are going to leave full and satisfied
vin diesel and dwayne johnson both play amazing roles and their actual personality shines through their characters which truly makes a movie a good movie
fast five is in chronological order with the other movies and is just what long time fans would expect from a fast and furious movie
even the ending is a huge twist and is hard to see coming
should you go see fast five
yes
i have no problems suspending my disbelieve but this movie pushed it too far
i like the transporter and crank movies because they are ridiculous but also very entertaining but this movie was a piece of crap
the whole safe pulling sequence was so horrible and stupid i couldnt believe my eyes
also the movie is boring the acting and the script are insulting
who ever really likes this movie has some serious problems or is 5 years old
sorry but its true
people who think movies like this are good are the reason hollywood will continue to make drivel like this
my tenth line starts here
this movie sucked from start to finish actually i fell asleep watching it the first time
so had to watch it again well from the part i fell asleep
no spoilers only so much the acting is total rubbish clicha like and painting the the average american stereotype totally over the top
fampf 3 was rubbish already badly cut totally incoherent lousy acting and so on
vin diesel i do expect more of you
dreadful piece of movie junk the production team must have gone to town on the movie rating here on imdb 7
8 yeah right you gotta be a a total numb nut american finding this trash good or b from the production team to give this garbage more than 1
do not waste your time
unless you do not have anything better to do
i confess to not being a big fan of the fast
series
i do enjoy a good action film
i didnt enjoy this one due to it exceeding my ability to suspend disbelief quotient
cars cannot do those things
if you show the stars having their first hot meal in a while eating like hungry dogs then how do they later afford the stuff they need for the job
how in a country run by the criminal they rob do they get fake passports
fast five is too full of these issues for my mind to sit there on idle
it wakes up and busts out of the jar i put it in prior to going in to thee movie and kicks the inside of my skull
stop it
get out now
but no i stayed to the end
rental only
this one was too much even for the fampf franchise i would call mcguiver and jammy bond maybe even braddock
and many places didnt look like brazil which has almost no passenger railways at all maybe therere three or four no more than 200 miles i guess what to say tgv or something looking like it i really cant figure what was that
second it was more like mexico if i know something about that
finally i dont know where they found so many import cars for those do exist in very very limited quantity
and just a dozen in the entire country are designated as patrol units for use of senior officers who arent seen around driving them
well theres no fun in driving a vw fox or a fiat with 79hps uh
fast five
action packed thrill ride gun firing explosion blowing wow of a film
you would think that after all the other four films that five would be pushing the sequels too far
now i can see that however fast five is by far the best one out of all of them
i guess because they have put much more money into this film the budget was an estimated 125000000 the film was well advertised and people were more aware of this film coming to the cinema and there was a big hype about it coming out
i think the hype towards this film was the audience responding to all the characters from the previous films are now featured together as one big family and working together as a team to do this last job
this films got it all comedy action thrill suspense muscle and guns and girls in next to nothing washing beautiful cars i mean seriously can anything top that
watch and see yet another must see film and will rock your night at the cinema
great action scenes destroyed cars and mayhem
these words describe the movie best
more or less you know whats gonna happen at the end but there are key facts that this movie is a successor
the direction of the film is great even in the most unrealistic scenes you can feel the tense in which case you feel certain that youre actually physically there
i think that the fun part begins on the second half of the movie
and of course i must not forget to mention the epic fight between luke hobbs the rock amp vin diesel xxx
i wish luke hobbs wore less sun tanning lotion amp babyoil
a personal remark to mr hobbs you look too shiny dude
relax
we know you got muscles
besides some minor mistakes and some bad acting i think that this movie is worth watching
the expectation is always great when is a film in the franchise fampf
all previous films were great could not be different with fast 5
yeah it has many unrealistic scenes but what makes this movie good are these exaggerated as the final scenes where brian and don hold a multiton safe in their cars
the performances were great as always and the soundtrack is another great thing in the film
one of the few things i dislike in the plot was this not to be the last film in the franchise
had a great end
but instead we find something else to make a new movie
a good idea with the return of a character lost but that could have been discarded
with a few races forget it if expected a movie full of speed as 2 fast 2 furious
but for fans its a good chance to see three movie stars in action in a single movie
after i have read all the positive international reviews i thought this must be a real action movie and above all the best one of this franchise
but i was wrong because in my opinion there were only three great respectable scenes with full of adrenaline
the remaining story was too long
the running time could have been reduced at maximal 95 minutes
there were dialogs where i felt nearly asleep
the characters and actors didnt convince me
then i missed a fresh and intelligent story with intriguing mysterious or adventure elements to take me definitely on a great ride in rio
the story is so simply sticked as in the expendables or swordfish
thats why this movie is far away from blockbusters such as die hard terminator james bond or the bourne identity series
i am so disappointed and i wont give another chance in future
too overrated on imdb
my vote is slow five out of ten
waatching the previous fampf movies
i thought this movie dint live up to expectation
they tried to get all the old stars but many of them look quite old
and seriously dint have the tedious race sequences as it was more abut robbery
whatever it sure is good in terms of the attitude and the final sequence of chase is simply awesome
especially loved it when the truck right in between the road to surprise its true reason for being on roads
sure is worth a watch
among all the previous fampf movies i guess the tokyo drift is the best of movies i have ever watched
find it really hard for any of the movies to come close to that
i guess the next part of the movie they should pick up some of the latest model and told something about the latest car
in fact they should bring in those aston martins bugatis formula1 cars allthose re completely missing
if you watch transporterseries they focused so much on the car even fampf needs something more amp abit extra xfactore
i loved this movie it was exciting and constantly surprised you
i think vin is gorgeous and brian and mia are such a cute couple
my boyfriend and i couldnt figure out which movie it was where the chick shot the guy in his penis
im pretty sure it was fast five but i dont remember
i do have one question that i need answered for this debate i tried looking it up online and nothing helped
in the scene where dominic and brian and mia are running from the cops didnt agent hobbs agent chick elena pataky shoot some guys and one in the penis
please help my email is hellonurse16hotmail
com thanks
who else thought this was the best fast movie yet
the end is what made me sooo excited for the 6th one
for those of us who watched all of the fast and the furious series simply the thought of having most of the main characters from the past editions in one movie is a valid reason to pay
the result is just what we expect of a fast and furious stunts rides and babes
the atmosphere of rio is a refreshing alternative to american centered filming
however ultimately the film goes over the top
by telling the story through the view of the not that good guys the bad guys and also a third perspective that of a team of elite fbi agents led by the rock time worthy of boiling oil and pumping adrenaline is lost
instead we get more of the sitathome workoutplan kind of scenes that are often unnecessary
nevertheless a true fan of cars and action will find fast five very enjoyable
excellent movie with as expected great hip hop music
the movie was pretty much up to the mark
sexy cars hot chicks and a full fledge action pack what else can you think about such titles
loved the movie as a whole
got a little bored in middle but climax was just outstanding this movie is in a sequel to the previous fampf
vin diesel as usual rocks the rock added a lot of spice to action
guess what vin got a new girl friend
the best piece i liked was dodge cars all over the movie and the best flick was when these guys actually stole the whole bank out of the building and tossing the traffic with that safe
great idea
great movie but didnt close up to the expectations
as usual the base cast was great
vin diesel was awesome as expected
the rock was rocking in the movie his character matched his true personality
as in the previous movies stunts performed were mind boggling and full of thrill cant wait do do them myself
cool and solid cars as in previous movies
chicks wearing bikinis and riding hot bikes
has some irrelevant superman fighting sequences but what about it every movie needs it
good casting everyone fits well in their characters
full of awesome stunts from the start to the end
one can never fall asleep while watching such a movie
the heist plot is very difficult to predict till the end which keeps your mind on the movie and not on the chick on the next seat
full of thrills and twists
not the best of fast and furious seen better but still a must watch as the previous flicks
ill give it a 3 out of 10 for at least showing something that was visually pleasing
but other than that it was complete garbage
lets put of team of people that are already wealthy to act out as criminal masterminds that want a lifetime lumpsum of money for multiple people
this movie was one of those stop making these movies
the actions scenes in these movies were less believable than die hard or charlies angels full throttle
the writing and directing tried to make a super movie by bringing everyone back from the first and second to play in this movie
if you dont believe me on how ludicrous this movie is no pun intended
prepare for the fast and furiuous 6 introduction at the end of this one
it might make you want to stab your eyes out
i dont even know if we can call it cinema
this is full of clicha sex money women big cars muscles american imperialism etc
and action scenes totally surrealistic
and once again the americans think they can go in a foreign country and rule as if they were back home
i mean by that when the american police crew led by the rock arrive in brazil they behave like they have jurisdiction and an authority there
they come in and talk like xxxx to the brazilian police and start giving orders all around in a foreign country like if its even remotely possible
only americans can like this kind of thing and not find it suspicious
im not even gonna start with the actions scenes or the scenario which are like bad science fiction or i could write 10 pages
anyway i put 3 stars because there is some humor and if you really dont know what to do you can waste 2 hours watching this with friends to have a good laugh not only at the jokes but at the movie overall
my opinion
this movie was so bad
not worth 1 star
if it wasnt for all the sexualizing of women and all the girls in revealing clothes walking around zooming in on girls it may have been a half decent movie anorexic looking girls in skimpy outfits half the movie is all about
it just doesnt do it for me
its just wrong
if you they need to use that much crap in it for it to get ratings well it mustnt be that good
i thought it was awful
i cant wait to see a movie where they have guys walking around in g strings the whole time
zooming up on their privates
you almost never see that
its just getting tiring
it definitely could have been better without the girls
as you should know before you read more i only rate movies 1 or 10
so pass on this one there are many other films like this that things blow up there is a silly plot twist at the end like two safes yes it was silly and it could not save a pathetic film
all the cops in brazil are less corrupt then the ones in the good old usa
what are you crazy
i saw fast five and the steroid actors from usa were way better than all the crooked brazilins with spanish accents so thick that i i had a flash back thing all the nazis have british ascents but the british fought the nazis and the americans only came in at the end of the war after all the money was gone in selling to the nazis
well the dumbest thing about the film is the cars try out driving a caraochi in rio you may as well speak paulistia portuguse
the film is a waste of film and so full of bull that it can only continue to reinforce a stereotype that is apparent as i aint no uncle tom but
the amount of plot holes in this movie make it difficult to classify it as an action movie
much has been written here about the absurdity of the script
just to give one extra example sneaking into a police station to examine a safe by blowing up the mens room and breaking a man size hole in the wall and still letting your audience believe it went unnoticed it is to silly for words
so i tried to look at it as a comedy but it didnt fit either
the only objection i want to add to the list is the way luke hobbs shoots a defenceless man begging for help even though he is the bad guy in this movie
i know its the american fairytale the good guys shoot the bad guys and everybody lives happily ever after but this is the glorification of brutal murder
you cant do that not even in silly movies like this
im not upset that people make movies this horrible
im upset that i trusted imdb with a 7
3 rating and managed to waste an hour of my life watching this piece of crap movie
im embarrassed for those of you that enjoy films like this unless of course you are 12 years old or younger
in that case please dont try to drive like these people when you get your license
im not upset that people make movies this horrible

what a movie this was
i watched it and now its scenes are not getting out of my mind
this movie has everything unlike other remakes were not having that much as they would have expected
but this one will surprise you all
it has speed n cars for which fast amp furious series is known
along with this it has the perfect story twists amp turns
and if i talk about action that this movie has got so much in it
jonathon was great in his role n all others played their roles very well
so dont waste your time in reading reviews just go and watch this movie
it will take you on a long ride of excitement and fun
and do not forget to vote this movie after watching it because these kind of movies deserves you votes and love both
