1044
actually a good well acted movie till the end
ben affleck was excellent and rosamund pike had me 100 convinced she was evil incarnate
carrie coon as bens twin sister and kim dickens as the lead detective also gave excellent performances
as for the story i can deal with sad endings where the hero dies like braveheart cool hand luke and endless others
when the credits came up on gone girl i could only regret spending over 2 hrs to watch a movie that left me that angry
i would have preferred she had just killed ben affleck and gotten away with it
assuming the book had the same ending i would have thrown it across the room upon finishing it
i enjoyed the movie up till the end but that completely ruined it for me
thought this would be a good thriller but ultimately it was draining and depressing
would think any man who sees this film would never want to have sex again
it portrayed womanwomen as being monstrous and men as passive sexcrazed zombies
the story had so many loose ends and unbelievable scenes such as where she returns home covered in blood
then shes at the hospital  there had to be an exam then giving an interview to detectives then comes home still covered in blood
how much time elapsed during these scenes and who would allow her to drive around carry on covered in blood for all that time
with great emphasis on crass words for women violent sex scenes and a score that sounded like a synthesizer importing screeches from an airport runway this was one depressing film
the only place it was believable was in its depiction of the media and how they revel in tragedy and perversion
if this becomes our prime form of entertainment we are in big trouble
need to watch a pre1960 film or musical now
never again will i trust the metascore
big fan of david fincher but let me tell you this movie was spectacularly bad
the score was ham handed and clashed with the film itself and i was embarrassed for the actors at some points that they had to say the ridiculous lines in the terrible script
i felt every single minute of this 149 minute movie
at one point my husband turned to me and whispered this is really bad and we started laughing
then we started rewriting the story and recasting
for example ben affleck could have played his own twin sister and it wouldnt have made the movie any more ridiculous
you might love it
i really really did not
gone girl had the potential for a great plot and movie the plot was given away very early on as you knew he didnt do it because of the bar scene with his sister then i sat there bored with a couple of moments of interest
seemed to have some resemblance to the lacy peterson case in other words lost some otherwise originality
so you know what is going to happen what you didnt know was all the details of why which found dull i like more of a traditional mysterydrama
personally didnt see any academy award acting
the ending was way to far fetched just absolutely unbelievable that 3 law enforcement agency would just take a position of oh well the group grope to interview her was totally unrealistic i really was wondering if this was such a low budget film they just didnt have enough funds to complete the movie and they had to jam multiple plots in a single scene
i think the hype this is getting is why people believe our entire world is contrived we cant all be crazy
the movie was a loser
spoiler alert  in a time when we are supposed to be more aware of mental illness along comes this highlycrafted movie with high production values and a big budget whose whole story is based on the machinations and manipulations of a psychopath
really what would hollywood do without psychopaths
they might have to come up with an original story that actually had something to say about life the state of the world etc
this movie is purely a fiction to waste a few hours it wont make you ponder or reflect on anything save the bizarre ending and the inevitable question why did nick stay
it doesnt matter
this story has nothing to do with real life
luckily i watched this soulless piece of crap as part of awards season screenings which means i didnt pay for it
i cannot believe this is the shooting script they signed off  the amount of plot holes and continuity gaffes is staggering
i cannot believe that all these highly talented people agreed to be in this hollow piece that uses all of its 148 minutes to say absolutely nothing
david fincher is clearly a talented director in full technical control of the medium but after watching this and having watched most of his previous films i have to conclude that his films very often have nothing relevant to say
technical prowess counts for nothing if the film has no soul which is what i think of gone girl
i gave it a 4 for the acting it is the only aspect worth noting here
the end is absolutely appalling character development is shallow and that graphic extended murder scene was pretty gratuitous horrid and unnecessary
but what else could i expect from a director who chose to remake an already perfect film girl with the dragon tattoo
i really like david fincher as a director and some of his previous movies are my favorite e
g
seven
gone girl is a dull movie with totally no surprise or tension
everything in this movie is so predictable
actually from the very first minutes of the movie you know that the wife is responsible for all what is happening and that she faked it all herself to make the husband look bad  as a revenge for their unsuccessful marriage
on top of that we have really really bad fake acting especially ben affleck
the story isnt realistic and sometimes behavior of the characters or their actions seem simply stupid
the idea for the movie is actually quite interesting and could turn into a really great movie
but well
it is what it is
please dont waste your time or money on this hypedup piece of garbage
i dont think ive ever been as disappointed in an ending not that the beginning and middle were all that great as i was with this stupid illogical movie
the only spoiler i have is one of the biggest plot fails ever
shes escaped her captor by slitting his thread shes virtually covered with blood and the hospital simply allows her to go home where she coyly showers it off
totally amazing that this movie has gotten the positive press and reviews it has received  if this doesnt make you realize how incredible hollywood hypemarketing system is at distorting reality nothing will
i only wish i could give it a zero
avoid this couple at all costs  they are very toxic
gone girl is a misleading title since amy is not a girl
she used to be a childhood storybook celebrity named amy but there is nothing girlish like about her in this movie
in fact she calls herself the cword
david fincher has made some of my favorite movies fight club zodiac etc
but this is not one of my favorites
this movie is all the things i dislike in a movie  tedious depressing unlikeable characters dark photography moody music strange casting smug dialogue
this might work with the girl with the dragon tattoo but come to think of it  that was no girl either
i cannot believe how disappointed i was watching this film
form all of the reviews i thought i was about to see a modern classic
in instead i watched a movie so lacking in common sense that the last hour was almost unwatchable
the plot is very obvious even the ending
without giving away any plot lines it seems that in this film common sense and the trail of evidence does not exist once the real story is revealed
as the last hour of the movie dragged on and on i was hoping for some redeeming scene that would make everything right or at least make sense
unfortunately this did not happen
maybe one of the worst good movies ive ever scene
if this is what people think is good plot twists then the iq of movie watchers has gone down into the single digits
the most satisfying thing about this movie is writing this review
whilst im a firm believer in the adage to each his own and i certainly mean no disrespect to others opinions i do worry over consumers standards that moviegoers are able to say anything redeeming about this film
many other reviewers have nailed the stupidity of the plot and the absurdity of most aspects of the storyline so ill leave that alone
suffice to say that at the end i felt as violated as amy dunne claimed she was
i cant believe that such a large group of professionals watched the rushes and felt satisfied with what theyd created
oh and about the foul language  how did bogart wayne heston lancaster kirk douglas davis and crawford ever make an impact without the filthy language
oh yeah  they call it acting
i rate myself as reasonably intelligent and im no prude but i like a bit of subtlety which i believe any true art form allows for
this was rank nonsense and i gave myself an uppercut for watching it but am slightly redeemed now
insipid
tepid
vacuous
the first 30 minutes are the most pretentious script ever written in the history of film making
please somebody burn every copy of this film ever distributed
to try to sit through this film to its uninspired and tired read lame ending challenges the endurance
okay lets start with the actors ben affleck has not made a good movie i
e
a movie a viewer might be able to sit through since jay amp silent bob strike back
who forcedcorralled rosamund pike into making this
who willingly makes movies with affleck besides jennifer lopez
really
i was sitting on the couch with my wife for the first 30 minutes of this movie and was forced to hit the pause button an physically leave the room for minutes at a time during the first thirty minutes
god help america hollywood acting and moviemaking
well well well thanks a lot for spoiling 150 minutes of my life i still dont understand why this film is so highly rated
i guess i should not believe in ratings of imdb anymore  please dont watch this trash its such a waste of time a girl  to avenge the betrayal gets hold of her husband by planting a successful crime scene that can happen only in movies and that girl ends up patching up with him again if this all had to happen then what was the fun of making that dirt of 150 mints so awful ending
those who rated it 10 must be banned for further rating the most disgusting movie i have seen in my life and yes what happened to police in the end  they knew she was criminal but they couldnt do anything wow u think we are buffoons  get a life mr director and please dont breed regards
quite honestly this was one of the best movies ive ever had the privilege of seeing
not sure why there are so many negative reviews
it seems to me that most of the negative reviewers are trying not to follow the crowd and seem unique in their unrealistic absolute hatred of this film
everyone is entitled to their opinion
but jeez even if this film isnt your cup of tea it is incredibly entertaining
and this is coming from someone who usually is one of those dont follow the crowd people
i reluctantly took my girlfriend to see it a week after release since she had been begging me since we saw the previews
the theater was entirely sold out even having been out a week at that point and the entire theater was on the edge of their seats and gave quite the standing o at the end
im just saying in my humble opinion even if you dont like the movie you certainly wont feel as if youve wasted your time
never again will i trust the metascore
big fan of david fincher but let me tell you this movie was spectacularly bad
the score was ham handed and clashed with the film itself and i was embarrassed for the actors at some points that they had to say the ridiculous lines in the terrible script
i felt every single minute of this 149 minute movie
at one point my husband turned to me and whispered this is really bad and we started laughing
then we started rewriting the story and recasting
for example ben affleck could have played his own twin sister and it wouldnt have made the movie any more ridiculous
you might love it
i really really did not
i had a pleasant surprise over the last weekend free hbo cinamax time
so i caught up on some films i had heard about but havent seen
this was one of them
i wish i had read other member reviews
i wouldnt have wasted my time
it wasnt the acting
it was the completely convolutedimplausiblemistakeriddencrappy plot that stunk
really bad
it annoys me that supposed art and film professionals are so wound up in their own little worlds they cant see the terrible stuff they produce
just read most of the other reviews
dont they use focus groups or something to get feedback before the release
if so the groups must be drinking the same water as the production staff can you say so cal
glad it was free and the only waste was the 227 of my time
dont bother seeing this
in one scene the word fucking was used over and over and i wonder where american movies are going to go next some of the language was disgusting
i had to engage subtitles to understand much of the mumbled dialogue rosemund pike has a lovely natural speaking voice what a shame to see her speaking like she does in this movie how on earth does this get a good rating
as for the story it is so improbable in parts as to be laughable we used to have some great movies from america but things are gradually getting worse
it seems only money matters in hollywood now thankfully the odd one still pleases but not much to look forward too i prefer to watch a top british series on tv
reasonable plot development that builds in intensity throughout with strange and interesting elements added and developed as the movie progresses
culminating in a crap ending
i dont care about book comparisons because a film should stand on its own merit
neil patrick harris is a bright spot in this whole effort and it surprised me that he was so good
as an actor unless hes portraying a cigar store indian ben affleck should stick to directing
which hes pretty good at
rosamund pike was good but it is not an oscar winning performance
others in cameo supporting roles were just ok
it gets pretty intense and somewhat gory as the plot unfolds and i found the film to be overly long unnecessarily
what a mess
if the concept of the faked murder appeals to you skip this trainwreck and go watch ashley judd bruce greenwood and tommy lee jones do it somewhat well
its not happening here
the hidden baseline is a parody of what tv reality news does to shape public opinion most of which is consumed as the truth by the ignorant masses
that i can agree with
heck it describes all of politics today
but the story itself is such junk  especially how the cops are complete idiots  and this womans crazy schemes are consumed as truth
my favorite is when the investigators who question her toward the end hush up the cop pointing out the huge holes in her nonsense story because of all shes been through
cmon guys you cant write better than that
if you want something suspenseful that will exercise your brain this will completely disappoint you
if it wasnt for some decent acting of this garbage script id award it zero stars
imho
with all due respect i have come to the conclusion that i really disliked this movie
when i got home from the theater people asked me and i said it was pretty good but the more i thought about the more ridiculous things kept coming to mind
the stereotypes of the cunning women was unwelcome
amys sudden turn to violence was absurd
prior to slashing doogie howser all shed been guilty of was fraud
how do you go from fraud to coldblooded and very bloody firstdegree murder without batting an eye
also all the cops were skinny dudes with ordinary haircuts
been up close to a police force any time in the past 30 years
theyre all skinhead bullies nowadays not cleancut geewhiz dogooders like in this movie
and then nick wordlessly ends up staying with amy
just awful
the only mystery here is why people thought this was any good
the movie seemed like a mystery thriller where the husband plays detective to find his wifes killerkidnapper and there will be the plot twist
thats how the trailer looked like
too much ineffective character build up that took 90 mins of the film
the plot was like an easy murder case from a dateline episode and i am sure everything wrong with the story has been enumerated on previous reviews
and i cannot believe how dumb the policemen were portrayed
the plot really sucks
when the credits started rolling this movie left me with anger
if the story in the book is the same as the movies then i am really glad that i didnt read it
after 30 minutes you are still not interested
the 30 minute time frame is the cutoff for interest
the lines in the movie are so idiotic that a three year old could have written them
i think people that wrote good reviews actually were getting paid to do it
my wife likes chic flics but this one is so stupid and the dialogue is so stupid that only an idiot could like it
the scenes are ridiculous the police in the story are stupid and do not act like police
the main character which happens to be ben aflec of should i say aflac is searching for clues that his wife left after she disappeared and how can i say how bad the script is
it is for an emotional response from women
men do yourself a favor and do not watch
a drama in the beginning became a thriller by reasoning
the best muse i felt was the setting which provided the inspiration for the switch
the best actor in the movie was ben affleck with best face  confused state of mind
the storyline really i felt catered to the wellinformed because it changed
its meant for those that anticipate watching the whole movie not just parts
it requires attention and attention to detail thought provoking
it used a favorite quality of mine called thinking outside the box with a retrospect to the innermost thoughts of a killer
the metaphor and plot formed in the folds of that relationship making this a unique book to movie thriller
i finally got around to watching gone girl
with all the hype i figured it might be worth watching
it wasnt
my opinion is that this movie fails due to poor directing awful acting lousy continuity lack of plausibility zero suspense
the biggest issue was ben affleck
come on people he cant act
he doesnt act
i believe he could be replaced with a cardboard cutout
rosamund pike was little better but that may have been a direction issue
kim dickens and carrie coon were the only two that brought game
spoiler alert in my opinion watching this move will spoil your day
the rest of this is just filler
it seems that imdb thinks reviews have to be long and boring
your review does not contain enough lines  the minimum length for reviews is 10 lines of text
please see the guidelines
attempts to pad the comment with junk words can result in your account being blocked from future submissions
the acting and the script is so bad in this movie it almost seems like some surreal dream with so many twists and turns in such a drawn out movie it just does too much and too little at the same time however that is possible i have no idea but it manages that theres a lot of scenes this movie could do without and if youve seen it youll probably know which ones and not to mention the message that it puts across
seems to be that there are very little good movies around these days and we cannot even rely on established directors and producers for a good film anymore
steer clear of this movie it is ben affleks worst performance to date and that is saying something
the amazing performance by cate blanchett in the movie blue jasmine was explained for the mass audience
plus the women dominated movie was narrated from a male perspective so everything in the world could be normal again
it was fairly predictable and most of it has been seen in so many movies before
only the last quarter there was a glimpse of great acting from the woman lead role yet nonetheless it was not enough to convey a message or unleash an emotion
it was a typical ben affleck movie with a meaningless ending and no message whatsoever
dull and unfinished
it is something that has been seen so many times before that has lost all of its meaning
this really is a very poor plot indeed  but it would be unfair to list the many logical flaws here and so spill the story
but you can look up other websites for the synopsis if you want to discover what i mean
in summary though not only does the plot defy all reasonable logic and expectations of a true police investigation but its as if the author gets so far and doesnt know how to end the story and after dragging it one for nearly 2 12 hours panics and ends it all abruptly very unsatisfactorily
the characterisation suddenly implodes at the end and the main character played by ben affleck who has been stable and consistent the rest of the movie within the last 5 minutes suddenly changes 360 degrees to become a completely different character which again makes no sense
it really is a waste of time and money to buy this dvd
i believe 90 of anyone who buys this dvd would not also be disappointed with their purchase after viewing
this started of as an intense absorbing thriller
it really is an absorbing plot we see the steady deterioration in their marriage and then the love affair that ruined it
at times were with him at others with her
the plot has numerous weaknesses but generally carries itself quite well
i watched it and considered any number of ways the story would end
was he really the bad guy and she a poor mentally abused wife
was she a crazed psychopath who would kill him in the dying embers of the film
and in the words of docking having prepared for everything i was not prepared for nothing
this film has the worst weve really run out of ideas ending in cinematic history
what a huge 2hr and 30min let down
im surprised at the viewer reviews of this movie
every review ive seen for pages has been either a rating of 1 or a rating of 10 and im amazed that what i considered a pretty mundane film is evoking such impassioned opinions
the storyline of a wife framing her husband for her murder is a tale that has been told many times before and often told much better imo
the plot was farfetched with plenty of holes as many reviewers have pointed out however although i wasnt on the edge of my seat i was reasonably entertained
the antagonist was definitely despicable and i was rooting for ben afflecks flawed yet good guy and his twin sister
allinall i would sum it up as unremarkable  worth watching on video on a rainy night when you just want to enjoy it for what it is without thinking too hard
if this movie deserves a rating of 1 out of 10 or for that matter 10 out of 10 what do we have left for the truly awful or truly masterful movies
lacked drama and suspense
why did she disappear
i asked myself what was the whole point
at first i thought it was going to be similar to the lacy peterson story and i watched it to find out what the hype was all about
no hype here
watch something better
this movie was too long boring and annoying
i am so disappointed
everyone recommended it and i cant see why
the only thing i can say is that ben affleck played a good role as a clueless and dumb husband
the character amy had nothing better to do
she was miserable and clearly insane
i started this review a little before the movie ended it made me that bored
bored
i wouldnt recommend this movie to anyone sorry
i have not read the book but will now just in the hope of finding something that justifies the hype around this story
the film was like a farce which to me verged on the comical with the cartoonesque type characters
another reviewer comments that had this been billed as a dark comedy it might have just cut the mustard and with that i agree but a tense psychological thriller
no way
it was not cleverly written there were plot holes galore the diary really bugged me
even after slight burning i think they could have told that it had been recently writtenand the whole of amys escape story was just utter hogwash
the acting was abysmal with the exception of carrie coon margowho presented the only sympathetic and remotely realistic character in the whole thing not my cup of tea at all
this film wasnt as bad as some people say it was
it was actually good
it was a pretty nice psycho thriller
it had me guessing at times and there really werent any dull moments
this film was well done with just enough suspense to keep me interested
the acting in this film was great as well
now im not a big fan of tyler perrys films but his acting is good
he had a wonderful performance in this film playing tannor bolt nick dunnes ben affleck lawyer
he was really perfect for the part
for me it was kind of weird seeing neil patrick harris playing a serious roll as the crazy ex boy friend of nick dunnes ben affleck wife amy dunne rosamund pike
rosamund pike and the parts she were in were well done
i mean she pulled that roll off
amy dunne rosamund pike was allegedly killed by her husband nick dunne ben affleck
from the beginning nick dunne ben affleck is the suspect and the craziness starts from there
if you like mysteriesthrillers you wont be disappointed with this one
the story has revenge  meticulous planning  cruel manipulation and lies everywhere
the lost lady looks very charming in first meeting
i would blame husband for disappearance of his wife
the news hungry media tears apart husband under investigation
the message is  it is human nature to take advantage and nobody is a saint
also laws are in womens favour who can frame their husband or lover if they dont obey
example  consensual sex can be reported as abuse and alleged offender has nowhere to go
there are some marriage lessons here  first dont take your partner for granted
second  stay faithful
parents should give little freedom to children lest they feel burdened under ideal behaviour expectations
i was actually excited to see this movie because it was rated over 8
0
if there were not so many huge holes in the story line and if they didnt wreck the plot halfway through the movie it could have been alright
they started by making you think that the husband had something to do with the wifes disappearance then it was revealed that the wife framed her husband
they should have just finished the story by having him get revenge on her but instead they get some ex lover involved to take the blame for everything and get killed too
the husband and wife live happily ever after at the end of the movie
how could he even live in the same house with such an evil manipulative psychotic murdering bitch
how stupid are the police and detectives in this movie
i could go on and on but you can read the other bad reviews to see how ridiculous the plot and entire movie actually is
so many things made no sense at all
we were very disappointed
why did some of you give it such a high rating
so implausible
there is really nowhere to begin
the acting was adequate but the plot was so full of holes it was just sad
this movie averaged 8
2 on imdb based on the input of over 300000 viewers
very troubling
i guess the biggest problem i had was once her plan became obvious to nick and correct me if im wrong but did she not leave a note with the punch and judy dolls admitting to the whole thing
nick doesnt go right to the police and say here i solved the case for you the whole thing from then on was ruined
ok even if there wasnt a note confessing to all the crimes and ending the mystery and the movie still when they found all that stuff in his sisters shed
why would they not go to the police then no normal human being let alone two would think that the police wouldnt find it or try to hide it for a minute
its crazy
how do the actors not say hey wait a minute this could never happen
im so mad i stayed up to watch this hunk o junk that i felt compelled to write my first review ever
so bad
well thats two and a half hours of my life i wont get back
settled down to watch this film with high expectations
i love a good clever thriller which has you guessing all the way through
this one is not
its dreadful
half an hour in you realise it is meant to come across as an arty intelligent piece all about control rather than the edge of the seat thriller it is billed to be
we persevered still thinking it may improve and half way through it picked up a little and left us thinking if the ending is good it will have been worth it
it wasnt
loose ends all over the place poor plot and merely acceptable acting will leave you scratching your head and still asking questions even at the end
mainly along the lines of why did i bother
this is just an example of awesome filmmaking
everything worked for this movie
the acting was impeccable every actor did their job beautifully and each character was so complex in the film
everyone had two sides to them or at least you come to find out
rosamund pike was amazing as our lead actor very well deserved oscar nomination and golden globe nomination
and lets not forget ben affleck our other star
he did a great job of playing the somewhat disturbed and confused husband
this mystery thriller had soo many twists and turns throughout the whole thing
that is what i love surprises
i was very shocked to see tyler perry involved in this but he did very well with his material and so did neil patrick harris
warning if you get unsettled at rough violence or sex this probably is not the one for you the whole story is very eery and somewhat dark
oh and the ending is mind bending
very exciting ending
ive never wrote a review before but
this was awful
do yourself a favor learn from my mistake and do not watch it
lame beginning cheap ending
there were a good 30 minutes when i thought the investigation will save the movie a little but no
nonrealistic scenes and decisions
annoying from the beginning
cant find enough bad words

love love loved this movie
read the novel by gillian flynn and was amazed by how sick and twisted the story line was i could not stop talking about it and the fact the movie was coming out shortly after
let me start out by saying the book to screen adaption was spot on
the movie did not leave out a lot of information from out of the books which normally is the case
ben affleck and rosamund pike were the ideal couple i had pictured from the novel their performances couldnt have been done better by anyone else
very happy with the casting
kept my attention the whole time and could not wait for that twist
it was everything i had imagined
very impressed with this movie
one of my favorites most definitely
go see this and watch it 100 times more after that if you love the kind of movies that f with your mind
there is not a thing i did not like about this film
i watched it winter 2014 at avenue malls cineplexx in osijek during its release date in a croatian european union part
this is according to my opinion ben afflecks acting of a lifetime
i was astonished by rosamund pikes marvelous acting as well
the plot was greatly interpreted by david fincher even greater than he did in a 1997 the game film starring michael douglas
i adored the scenery in the film and the overall atmosphere was spooky in a rather good way
i will never forget the posh scenery in and around a stone house with a wine cellar and rosamund pikes throat cutting
there was a point at which i thought this movie is brilliant
i never saw that coming
it had me secondguessing my own perspective as a viewer
the plot was incredibly well thought out
then it went to far
it wasnt just too long in terms of runtime it was too long in terms of the number of plot twists before the end
it got too incredibly outlandish clicha and sensational
in the end i had no idea what the artful manipulators end game was
what was the motivation
i dont know what you want
this movie like its character should have quit while it was ahead
still i think this is one of those stories thats going to stick with me
ill find myself mulling over it in my head for a while to come
so my wife inspired by favorable critical as well as popular fanfare having bought and finished reading the book exclaimed  now we have to watch the movie
upon the films conclusion she looked at me and said  yeah the book was no good either
we agreed that this flick is fodder for middleofthenight lifetime channel viewing and thats not a knock against lifetime because we both enjoy the sordid salaciousness of many of their films however most of the programming would never be confused with brilliant filmmaking which is what apparently happened with the gg franchise
i see a lot of user ratings at 1 and while i understand that score both affleck and pike are skilled actors not low on the charisma scale
i can only believe that they didnt realize the story would play out like an episode of  the edge of night  penned by tristan tzara
i will say that i anticipate the mst3k version with great relish
i loved the movie more than the movie i only loved the book
if i had not read the book before i watched the movie the ending would have been a bigger surprise factor for me like it was for my fellow viewers
the movie kept me hooked till the end and i couldnt wait to find out what will happen next even if i already knew it
the doze of excitement and entertainment this movie gives you is remarkable
the actor choices were amazing i would not be able to pick a better amazing amy myself
the movie was mind blowing
what i also loved is that they kept they script so close to the book
they really made an effort to present as a movie that was so close to the descriptions in the book
not only the characters but also the environment
i had heard so much about this film
it lived up to its buzz
the movie is clever funny suspenseful erotic and heartbreaking at times
rosamund pike deserves all the reviews that she received for this film
she chews up the scenery
while ben affleck is often miscast in films he is perfect here
it has been a long time since i have enjoyed him in a film
the second and third acts really give him material to sink his teeth in
the movie had so many twists and turns which i love in movies
gone girl is one of the best movies i have seen recently
david fincher takes you on a ride that will stay with you long after the credits end
i really struggled not to rate this movie as one despite being extremely awful but then i realized i have seen a lot worse movies
maybe the reason i wanted to rate this movie as one so bad is to offset of the mindblowing gigantic bubble rating of 8
2
to be fair to actors they did what they were supposed to do but with such extremely bad no point shallow script there is no way this movie could be even close to being acceptable even if the naked covered in bloodshower scene was performed by julia roberts and anthony hopkins
i mean that could have explained the high number of views and reviews but not the rating
with such hype and high rating chances are you will probably watch this movie however if you are one of those who actually value their own time and try to spend it on something worthy then this is a one you should not waste your time on
more like a list of things wrong with this film
probably the most disappointed ive ever felt after watching a film
its only february but id be surprised if i saw a worse film this year
the amount of plot holes actually annoyed me
amys character wasnt at all consistent
so much doesnt make sense
you feel nothing for the characters for the most part
some bad casting choices were made
is that really how the case would be portrayed on television
did amy really think that her final plan made any sense and wouldnt be found out
shes supposed to be both intelligent and meticulous
leaving hospital covered in blood
the cameras in the home
im speechlessutterly without speech therefore taking the time to write my first movie review ever
not so bad that i wasted 2 12 hours on this turkey who hasnt done it before
and id probably have wasted it anyhow on something else but that the critics consensus is somehow so high for this pos film
i venture to guess that theyre rationalizing the film in whole to be as good as certain segments probably from subconscious fear of suffering the same letdown that the more objective viewers i
e
myself are meaning they just cannotdo notwill notbelieve this movie could go from bad to good to great to bad to just plain terrible effing lousy so fast
i almost dont blame them my head still wants to explode and its been over for half an hour
good thing i stream
id be sooooo p

d had i paid money to see this but wouldnt have in the first place if damn rotten tomatoes hadnt steered me wrong
well hows this for a terrific soap opera
all too clever by half and with so many new century thriller films paints itself into a corner that cannot be redeemed in the running time
here is a great modern destructive thriller with an ending that completely undoes the whole film
drone character husband meets cryptic woman manipulator who scores a 1010 for bitch mayhem
wealth allows plot points and absurd new characters to be hired to glance sideways
injoke about deception sees gay actor hired as hetero obsessed stalker lover
ice blonde proves to be better temptress than all the men mired in ghastly double dealings
oakie rednecks prove to be the smartest characters in wasp thriller
stay gasping until the 139th minute
admire the frank lloyd wright architecture
toss food at the screen
shake head as credits roll
in all disappointing film
the movie does have some merits
first half of the movie was interesting and with a half of the movie left i was genuinely curious to know where this would go
unfortunately it went downhill from there
acting was pretty good especially pike
script was believable and while you could give it the benefit of the doubt in the first half after watching the whole film i realize it was actually poor
in the first half some scenes make little sense but you hope that the rest of the movie will reveal the truth
it only gets worse
the movie is full of plot holes and very illogical actions
it becomes laughable in the end and i dont think that was the intention
the argument over the best suspense thriller director in recent times ends with david fincher
after successfully directing the girl with the dragon tattoo fincher presents another unpredictable thriller gone girl also adapted from a book with the same name
gone girl starts with a cozy pace gradually getting the audience interested with a story based on disappearance of amy inspiration to amazing amy series
amys husband falls into the suspect list as their bad marriage relationship emerges
as the movie progress the captivated audience is made to believe in something absolutely defying added with an even more dubious ending
fincher intermixes tense relationship with violence to create a spectacular mystery
the show stealer performance by rosamund pike is notable and justifies her character beautifully
it feels so good that fincher never disappoints with his work
i read the book and it was excellent i absolutely love her writing when i heard it was coming to the big screen i was worried about the casting but i think rosemund pike was an absolutely perfect choice
she was amazing
the way the movie was presented had all of the suspense and surprise of the book you literally never see each part coming the first half you are sure he did it then when it goes through the account step by step of how she basically planned it all perfectly until she made the one mistake your mouth drops open  for someone that hasnt read the book i think it was an excellent adaptation and i hope they do another of gillian flynns books
was looking forward to this film had read positive reviews etc
very disappointed after seeing this film
i admit its not completely horrible but definitely not in the same category as other top rated films on this site
this is not an 8 or 9 imo
story and acting reaches a comedic level where at one point during the film i thought i was watching a satirical dark comedy
definitely a watchable film but not close to deserving the hype and attention it received
rosamund pike was certainly memorable and in my opinion gave a much better performance than patricia arquette in boyhood but again at times i found the story downright laughable and implausible
we went to watch this movie because of many people recommending it and of course because of david fincher
i was very surprised why it got so much acknowledgment
a big part of the runtime was unnecessary
in comparison to his movie game in which every minute something utterly extraordinary was happening and it kept the audience in extreme suspense this one was mostly just fillers
ben afleck was just himself he didnt need to do any acting here while some of the cast were actually not bad so at least something to watch
all in all not what i expected
we left the cinema very disappointed
didnt really worth it
some parts were alright i dont want to spoil anything though so thats why im giving it a six
but mostly it was very predictable
david fincher is a master in making good filmsespecially thrillers
gone girl is one of them
the atmosphere is dark and the film unrolls slowlyfull of surprises
ben affleck is very good at his roleso is carrie coon and tyler perry but the true revelation of the film is rosamund pikes performance
her character is full of surprises and twists
half of the film is a puzzle to the viewer and thenpiece by piece the puzzle is complete
during the film you may start wondering about how things are not always what they seem to be
the films soundtrack is also enigmatic and matches completely with the plot
i think its an excellentmysterious film from the very beginning till the end and will absolutely excite thriller fans
okay from where do i start
first when i heard ben affleck was in it something told me movie would suck amp it seems my inner voice was right lol
at first movie seems weird no intense moments nothing like that
i keep watching in hope something interesting comes but in vain
its just so dead empty amp jumbled that lacks everything
oh by the way there are lots of mistakes im not going to mention all but a few for example she is interviewed at the hospital were she arrived covered in blood telling the story that she was raped
and nobody cleans the blood of her in the hospital and she is in a room with lots of cops plus husband lawyer etc etc
then she leaves with her husband that was accused of murder and they go home together
its just an enormous junk heap of illogical and nonsense movie
oh and movie is so stretched
its 230 minutes of boring uninteresting amp unrealistic plot
its as bad as finchers fight club which is another overrated piece of junk
just avoid this movie do no waste your time on it
actually a good well acted movie till the end
ben affleck was excellent and rosamund pike had me 100 convinced she was evil incarnate
carrie coon as bens twin sister and kim dickens as the lead detective also gave excellent performances
as for the story i can deal with sad endings where the hero dies like braveheart cool hand luke and endless others
when the credits came up on gone girl i could only regret spending over 2 hrs to watch a movie that left me that angry
i would have preferred she had just killed ben affleck and gotten away with it
assuming the book had the same ending i would have thrown it across the room upon finishing it
i enjoyed the movie up till the end but that completely ruined it for me
thought this would be a good thriller but ultimately it was draining and depressing
would think any man who sees this film would never want to have sex again
it portrayed womanwomen as being monstrous and men as passive sexcrazed zombies
the story had so many loose ends and unbelievable scenes such as where she returns home covered in blood
then shes at the hospital  there had to be an exam then giving an interview to detectives then comes home still covered in blood
how much time elapsed during these scenes and who would allow her to drive around carry on covered in blood for all that time
with great emphasis on crass words for women violent sex scenes and a score that sounded like a synthesizer importing screeches from an airport runway this was one depressing film
the only place it was believable was in its depiction of the media and how they revel in tragedy and perversion
if this becomes our prime form of entertainment we are in big trouble
need to watch a pre1960 film or musical now
never again will i trust the metascore
big fan of david fincher but let me tell you this movie was spectacularly bad
the score was ham handed and clashed with the film itself and i was embarrassed for the actors at some points that they had to say the ridiculous lines in the terrible script
i felt every single minute of this 149 minute movie
at one point my husband turned to me and whispered this is really bad and we started laughing
then we started rewriting the story and recasting
for example ben affleck could have played his own twin sister and it wouldnt have made the movie any more ridiculous
you might love it
i really really did not
gone girl had the potential for a great plot and movie the plot was given away very early on as you knew he didnt do it because of the bar scene with his sister then i sat there bored with a couple of moments of interest
seemed to have some resemblance to the lacy peterson case in other words lost some otherwise originality
so you know what is going to happen what you didnt know was all the details of why which found dull i like more of a traditional mysterydrama
personally didnt see any academy award acting
the ending was way to far fetched just absolutely unbelievable that 3 law enforcement agency would just take a position of oh well the group grope to interview her was totally unrealistic i really was wondering if this was such a low budget film they just didnt have enough funds to complete the movie and they had to jam multiple plots in a single scene
i think the hype this is getting is why people believe our entire world is contrived we cant all be crazy
the movie was a loser
spoiler alert  in a time when we are supposed to be more aware of mental illness along comes this highlycrafted movie with high production values and a big budget whose whole story is based on the machinations and manipulations of a psychopath
really what would hollywood do without psychopaths
they might have to come up with an original story that actually had something to say about life the state of the world etc
this movie is purely a fiction to waste a few hours it wont make you ponder or reflect on anything save the bizarre ending and the inevitable question why did nick stay
it doesnt matter
this story has nothing to do with real life
luckily i watched this soulless piece of crap as part of awards season screenings which means i didnt pay for it
i cannot believe this is the shooting script they signed off  the amount of plot holes and continuity gaffes is staggering
i cannot believe that all these highly talented people agreed to be in this hollow piece that uses all of its 148 minutes to say absolutely nothing
david fincher is clearly a talented director in full technical control of the medium but after watching this and having watched most of his previous films i have to conclude that his films very often have nothing relevant to say
technical prowess counts for nothing if the film has no soul which is what i think of gone girl
i gave it a 4 for the acting it is the only aspect worth noting here
the end is absolutely appalling character development is shallow and that graphic extended murder scene was pretty gratuitous horrid and unnecessary
but what else could i expect from a director who chose to remake an already perfect film girl with the dragon tattoo
i really like david fincher as a director and some of his previous movies are my favorite e
g
seven
gone girl is a dull movie with totally no surprise or tension
everything in this movie is so predictable
actually from the very first minutes of the movie you know that the wife is responsible for all what is happening and that she faked it all herself to make the husband look bad  as a revenge for their unsuccessful marriage
on top of that we have really really bad fake acting especially ben affleck
the story isnt realistic and sometimes behavior of the characters or their actions seem simply stupid
the idea for the movie is actually quite interesting and could turn into a really great movie
but well
it is what it is
please dont waste your time or money on this hypedup piece of garbage
i dont think ive ever been as disappointed in an ending not that the beginning and middle were all that great as i was with this stupid illogical movie
the only spoiler i have is one of the biggest plot fails ever
shes escaped her captor by slitting his thread shes virtually covered with blood and the hospital simply allows her to go home where she coyly showers it off
totally amazing that this movie has gotten the positive press and reviews it has received  if this doesnt make you realize how incredible hollywood hypemarketing system is at distorting reality nothing will
i only wish i could give it a zero
avoid this couple at all costs  they are very toxic
gone girl is a misleading title since amy is not a girl
she used to be a childhood storybook celebrity named amy but there is nothing girlish like about her in this movie
in fact she calls herself the cword
david fincher has made some of my favorite movies fight club zodiac etc
but this is not one of my favorites
this movie is all the things i dislike in a movie  tedious depressing unlikeable characters dark photography moody music strange casting smug dialogue
this might work with the girl with the dragon tattoo but come to think of it  that was no girl either
i cannot believe how disappointed i was watching this film
form all of the reviews i thought i was about to see a modern classic
in instead i watched a movie so lacking in common sense that the last hour was almost unwatchable
the plot is very obvious even the ending
without giving away any plot lines it seems that in this film common sense and the trail of evidence does not exist once the real story is revealed
as the last hour of the movie dragged on and on i was hoping for some redeeming scene that would make everything right or at least make sense
unfortunately this did not happen
maybe one of the worst good movies ive ever scene
if this is what people think is good plot twists then the iq of movie watchers has gone down into the single digits
the most satisfying thing about this movie is writing this review
whilst im a firm believer in the adage to each his own and i certainly mean no disrespect to others opinions i do worry over consumers standards that moviegoers are able to say anything redeeming about this film
many other reviewers have nailed the stupidity of the plot and the absurdity of most aspects of the storyline so ill leave that alone
suffice to say that at the end i felt as violated as amy dunne claimed she was
i cant believe that such a large group of professionals watched the rushes and felt satisfied with what theyd created
oh and about the foul language  how did bogart wayne heston lancaster kirk douglas davis and crawford ever make an impact without the filthy language
oh yeah  they call it acting
i rate myself as reasonably intelligent and im no prude but i like a bit of subtlety which i believe any true art form allows for
this was rank nonsense and i gave myself an uppercut for watching it but am slightly redeemed now
insipid
tepid
vacuous
the first 30 minutes are the most pretentious script ever written in the history of film making
please somebody burn every copy of this film ever distributed
to try to sit through this film to its uninspired and tired read lame ending challenges the endurance
okay lets start with the actors ben affleck has not made a good movie i
e
a movie a viewer might be able to sit through since jay amp silent bob strike back
who forcedcorralled rosamund pike into making this
who willingly makes movies with affleck besides jennifer lopez
really
i was sitting on the couch with my wife for the first 30 minutes of this movie and was forced to hit the pause button an physically leave the room for minutes at a time during the first thirty minutes
god help america hollywood acting and moviemaking
well well well thanks a lot for spoiling 150 minutes of my life i still dont understand why this film is so highly rated
i guess i should not believe in ratings of imdb anymore  please dont watch this trash its such a waste of time a girl  to avenge the betrayal gets hold of her husband by planting a successful crime scene that can happen only in movies and that girl ends up patching up with him again if this all had to happen then what was the fun of making that dirt of 150 mints so awful ending
those who rated it 10 must be banned for further rating the most disgusting movie i have seen in my life and yes what happened to police in the end  they knew she was criminal but they couldnt do anything wow u think we are buffoons  get a life mr director and please dont breed regards
quite honestly this was one of the best movies ive ever had the privilege of seeing
not sure why there are so many negative reviews
it seems to me that most of the negative reviewers are trying not to follow the crowd and seem unique in their unrealistic absolute hatred of this film
everyone is entitled to their opinion
but jeez even if this film isnt your cup of tea it is incredibly entertaining
and this is coming from someone who usually is one of those dont follow the crowd people
i reluctantly took my girlfriend to see it a week after release since she had been begging me since we saw the previews
the theater was entirely sold out even having been out a week at that point and the entire theater was on the edge of their seats and gave quite the standing o at the end
im just saying in my humble opinion even if you dont like the movie you certainly wont feel as if youve wasted your time
never again will i trust the metascore
big fan of david fincher but let me tell you this movie was spectacularly bad
the score was ham handed and clashed with the film itself and i was embarrassed for the actors at some points that they had to say the ridiculous lines in the terrible script
i felt every single minute of this 149 minute movie
at one point my husband turned to me and whispered this is really bad and we started laughing
then we started rewriting the story and recasting
for example ben affleck could have played his own twin sister and it wouldnt have made the movie any more ridiculous
you might love it
i really really did not
i had a pleasant surprise over the last weekend free hbo cinamax time
so i caught up on some films i had heard about but havent seen
this was one of them
i wish i had read other member reviews
i wouldnt have wasted my time
it wasnt the acting
it was the completely convolutedimplausiblemistakeriddencrappy plot that stunk
really bad
it annoys me that supposed art and film professionals are so wound up in their own little worlds they cant see the terrible stuff they produce
just read most of the other reviews
dont they use focus groups or something to get feedback before the release
if so the groups must be drinking the same water as the production staff can you say so cal
glad it was free and the only waste was the 227 of my time
dont bother seeing this
in one scene the word fucking was used over and over and i wonder where american movies are going to go next some of the language was disgusting
i had to engage subtitles to understand much of the mumbled dialogue rosemund pike has a lovely natural speaking voice what a shame to see her speaking like she does in this movie how on earth does this get a good rating
as for the story it is so improbable in parts as to be laughable we used to have some great movies from america but things are gradually getting worse
it seems only money matters in hollywood now thankfully the odd one still pleases but not much to look forward too i prefer to watch a top british series on tv
reasonable plot development that builds in intensity throughout with strange and interesting elements added and developed as the movie progresses
culminating in a crap ending
i dont care about book comparisons because a film should stand on its own merit
neil patrick harris is a bright spot in this whole effort and it surprised me that he was so good
as an actor unless hes portraying a cigar store indian ben affleck should stick to directing
which hes pretty good at
rosamund pike was good but it is not an oscar winning performance
others in cameo supporting roles were just ok
it gets pretty intense and somewhat gory as the plot unfolds and i found the film to be overly long unnecessarily
what a mess
if the concept of the faked murder appeals to you skip this trainwreck and go watch ashley judd bruce greenwood and tommy lee jones do it somewhat well
its not happening here
the hidden baseline is a parody of what tv reality news does to shape public opinion most of which is consumed as the truth by the ignorant masses
that i can agree with
heck it describes all of politics today
but the story itself is such junk  especially how the cops are complete idiots  and this womans crazy schemes are consumed as truth
my favorite is when the investigators who question her toward the end hush up the cop pointing out the huge holes in her nonsense story because of all shes been through
cmon guys you cant write better than that
if you want something suspenseful that will exercise your brain this will completely disappoint you
if it wasnt for some decent acting of this garbage script id award it zero stars
imho
with all due respect i have come to the conclusion that i really disliked this movie
when i got home from the theater people asked me and i said it was pretty good but the more i thought about the more ridiculous things kept coming to mind
the stereotypes of the cunning women was unwelcome
amys sudden turn to violence was absurd
prior to slashing doogie howser all shed been guilty of was fraud
how do you go from fraud to coldblooded and very bloody firstdegree murder without batting an eye
also all the cops were skinny dudes with ordinary haircuts
been up close to a police force any time in the past 30 years
theyre all skinhead bullies nowadays not cleancut geewhiz dogooders like in this movie
and then nick wordlessly ends up staying with amy
just awful
the only mystery here is why people thought this was any good
the movie seemed like a mystery thriller where the husband plays detective to find his wifes killerkidnapper and there will be the plot twist
thats how the trailer looked like
too much ineffective character build up that took 90 mins of the film
the plot was like an easy murder case from a dateline episode and i am sure everything wrong with the story has been enumerated on previous reviews
and i cannot believe how dumb the policemen were portrayed
the plot really sucks
when the credits started rolling this movie left me with anger
if the story in the book is the same as the movies then i am really glad that i didnt read it
after 30 minutes you are still not interested
the 30 minute time frame is the cutoff for interest
the lines in the movie are so idiotic that a three year old could have written them
i think people that wrote good reviews actually were getting paid to do it
my wife likes chic flics but this one is so stupid and the dialogue is so stupid that only an idiot could like it
the scenes are ridiculous the police in the story are stupid and do not act like police
the main character which happens to be ben aflec of should i say aflac is searching for clues that his wife left after she disappeared and how can i say how bad the script is
it is for an emotional response from women
men do yourself a favor and do not watch
a drama in the beginning became a thriller by reasoning
the best muse i felt was the setting which provided the inspiration for the switch
the best actor in the movie was ben affleck with best face  confused state of mind
the storyline really i felt catered to the wellinformed because it changed
its meant for those that anticipate watching the whole movie not just parts
it requires attention and attention to detail thought provoking
it used a favorite quality of mine called thinking outside the box with a retrospect to the innermost thoughts of a killer
the metaphor and plot formed in the folds of that relationship making this a unique book to movie thriller
i finally got around to watching gone girl
with all the hype i figured it might be worth watching
it wasnt
my opinion is that this movie fails due to poor directing awful acting lousy continuity lack of plausibility zero suspense
the biggest issue was ben affleck
come on people he cant act
he doesnt act
i believe he could be replaced with a cardboard cutout
rosamund pike was little better but that may have been a direction issue
kim dickens and carrie coon were the only two that brought game
spoiler alert in my opinion watching this move will spoil your day
the rest of this is just filler
it seems that imdb thinks reviews have to be long and boring
your review does not contain enough lines  the minimum length for reviews is 10 lines of text
please see the guidelines
attempts to pad the comment with junk words can result in your account being blocked from future submissions
the acting and the script is so bad in this movie it almost seems like some surreal dream with so many twists and turns in such a drawn out movie it just does too much and too little at the same time however that is possible i have no idea but it manages that theres a lot of scenes this movie could do without and if youve seen it youll probably know which ones and not to mention the message that it puts across
seems to be that there are very little good movies around these days and we cannot even rely on established directors and producers for a good film anymore
steer clear of this movie it is ben affleks worst performance to date and that is saying something
the amazing performance by cate blanchett in the movie blue jasmine was explained for the mass audience
plus the women dominated movie was narrated from a male perspective so everything in the world could be normal again
it was fairly predictable and most of it has been seen in so many movies before
only the last quarter there was a glimpse of great acting from the woman lead role yet nonetheless it was not enough to convey a message or unleash an emotion
it was a typical ben affleck movie with a meaningless ending and no message whatsoever
dull and unfinished
it is something that has been seen so many times before that has lost all of its meaning
this really is a very poor plot indeed  but it would be unfair to list the many logical flaws here and so spill the story
but you can look up other websites for the synopsis if you want to discover what i mean
in summary though not only does the plot defy all reasonable logic and expectations of a true police investigation but its as if the author gets so far and doesnt know how to end the story and after dragging it one for nearly 2 12 hours panics and ends it all abruptly very unsatisfactorily
the characterisation suddenly implodes at the end and the main character played by ben affleck who has been stable and consistent the rest of the movie within the last 5 minutes suddenly changes 360 degrees to become a completely different character which again makes no sense
it really is a waste of time and money to buy this dvd
i believe 90 of anyone who buys this dvd would not also be disappointed with their purchase after viewing
this started of as an intense absorbing thriller
it really is an absorbing plot we see the steady deterioration in their marriage and then the love affair that ruined it
at times were with him at others with her
the plot has numerous weaknesses but generally carries itself quite well
i watched it and considered any number of ways the story would end
was he really the bad guy and she a poor mentally abused wife
was she a crazed psychopath who would kill him in the dying embers of the film
and in the words of docking having prepared for everything i was not prepared for nothing
this film has the worst weve really run out of ideas ending in cinematic history
what a huge 2hr and 30min let down
im surprised at the viewer reviews of this movie
every review ive seen for pages has been either a rating of 1 or a rating of 10 and im amazed that what i considered a pretty mundane film is evoking such impassioned opinions
the storyline of a wife framing her husband for her murder is a tale that has been told many times before and often told much better imo
the plot was farfetched with plenty of holes as many reviewers have pointed out however although i wasnt on the edge of my seat i was reasonably entertained
the antagonist was definitely despicable and i was rooting for ben afflecks flawed yet good guy and his twin sister
allinall i would sum it up as unremarkable  worth watching on video on a rainy night when you just want to enjoy it for what it is without thinking too hard
if this movie deserves a rating of 1 out of 10 or for that matter 10 out of 10 what do we have left for the truly awful or truly masterful movies
lacked drama and suspense
why did she disappear
i asked myself what was the whole point
at first i thought it was going to be similar to the lacy peterson story and i watched it to find out what the hype was all about
no hype here
watch something better
this movie was too long boring and annoying
i am so disappointed
everyone recommended it and i cant see why
the only thing i can say is that ben affleck played a good role as a clueless and dumb husband
the character amy had nothing better to do
she was miserable and clearly insane
i started this review a little before the movie ended it made me that bored
bored
i wouldnt recommend this movie to anyone sorry
i have not read the book but will now just in the hope of finding something that justifies the hype around this story
the film was like a farce which to me verged on the comical with the cartoonesque type characters
another reviewer comments that had this been billed as a dark comedy it might have just cut the mustard and with that i agree but a tense psychological thriller
no way
it was not cleverly written there were plot holes galore the diary really bugged me
even after slight burning i think they could have told that it had been recently writtenand the whole of amys escape story was just utter hogwash
the acting was abysmal with the exception of carrie coon margowho presented the only sympathetic and remotely realistic character in the whole thing not my cup of tea at all
this film wasnt as bad as some people say it was
it was actually good
it was a pretty nice psycho thriller
it had me guessing at times and there really werent any dull moments
this film was well done with just enough suspense to keep me interested
the acting in this film was great as well
now im not a big fan of tyler perrys films but his acting is good
he had a wonderful performance in this film playing tannor bolt nick dunnes ben affleck lawyer
he was really perfect for the part
for me it was kind of weird seeing neil patrick harris playing a serious roll as the crazy ex boy friend of nick dunnes ben affleck wife amy dunne rosamund pike
rosamund pike and the parts she were in were well done
i mean she pulled that roll off
amy dunne rosamund pike was allegedly killed by her husband nick dunne ben affleck
from the beginning nick dunne ben affleck is the suspect and the craziness starts from there
if you like mysteriesthrillers you wont be disappointed with this one
the story has revenge  meticulous planning  cruel manipulation and lies everywhere
the lost lady looks very charming in first meeting
i would blame husband for disappearance of his wife
the news hungry media tears apart husband under investigation
the message is  it is human nature to take advantage and nobody is a saint
also laws are in womens favour who can frame their husband or lover if they dont obey
example  consensual sex can be reported as abuse and alleged offender has nowhere to go
there are some marriage lessons here  first dont take your partner for granted
second  stay faithful
parents should give little freedom to children lest they feel burdened under ideal behaviour expectations
i was actually excited to see this movie because it was rated over 8
0
if there were not so many huge holes in the story line and if they didnt wreck the plot halfway through the movie it could have been alright
they started by making you think that the husband had something to do with the wifes disappearance then it was revealed that the wife framed her husband
they should have just finished the story by having him get revenge on her but instead they get some ex lover involved to take the blame for everything and get killed too
the husband and wife live happily ever after at the end of the movie
how could he even live in the same house with such an evil manipulative psychotic murdering bitch
how stupid are the police and detectives in this movie
i could go on and on but you can read the other bad reviews to see how ridiculous the plot and entire movie actually is
so many things made no sense at all
we were very disappointed
why did some of you give it such a high rating
so implausible
there is really nowhere to begin
the acting was adequate but the plot was so full of holes it was just sad
this movie averaged 8
2 on imdb based on the input of over 300000 viewers
very troubling
i guess the biggest problem i had was once her plan became obvious to nick and correct me if im wrong but did she not leave a note with the punch and judy dolls admitting to the whole thing
nick doesnt go right to the police and say here i solved the case for you the whole thing from then on was ruined
ok even if there wasnt a note confessing to all the crimes and ending the mystery and the movie still when they found all that stuff in his sisters shed
why would they not go to the police then no normal human being let alone two would think that the police wouldnt find it or try to hide it for a minute
its crazy
how do the actors not say hey wait a minute this could never happen
im so mad i stayed up to watch this hunk o junk that i felt compelled to write my first review ever
so bad
well thats two and a half hours of my life i wont get back
settled down to watch this film with high expectations
i love a good clever thriller which has you guessing all the way through
this one is not
its dreadful
half an hour in you realise it is meant to come across as an arty intelligent piece all about control rather than the edge of the seat thriller it is billed to be
we persevered still thinking it may improve and half way through it picked up a little and left us thinking if the ending is good it will have been worth it
it wasnt
loose ends all over the place poor plot and merely acceptable acting will leave you scratching your head and still asking questions even at the end
mainly along the lines of why did i bother
this is just an example of awesome filmmaking
everything worked for this movie
the acting was impeccable every actor did their job beautifully and each character was so complex in the film
everyone had two sides to them or at least you come to find out
rosamund pike was amazing as our lead actor very well deserved oscar nomination and golden globe nomination
and lets not forget ben affleck our other star
he did a great job of playing the somewhat disturbed and confused husband
this mystery thriller had soo many twists and turns throughout the whole thing
that is what i love surprises
i was very shocked to see tyler perry involved in this but he did very well with his material and so did neil patrick harris
warning if you get unsettled at rough violence or sex this probably is not the one for you the whole story is very eery and somewhat dark
oh and the ending is mind bending
very exciting ending
ive never wrote a review before but
this was awful
do yourself a favor learn from my mistake and do not watch it
lame beginning cheap ending
there were a good 30 minutes when i thought the investigation will save the movie a little but no
nonrealistic scenes and decisions
annoying from the beginning
cant find enough bad words

love love loved this movie
read the novel by gillian flynn and was amazed by how sick and twisted the story line was i could not stop talking about it and the fact the movie was coming out shortly after
let me start out by saying the book to screen adaption was spot on
the movie did not leave out a lot of information from out of the books which normally is the case
ben affleck and rosamund pike were the ideal couple i had pictured from the novel their performances couldnt have been done better by anyone else
very happy with the casting
kept my attention the whole time and could not wait for that twist
it was everything i had imagined
very impressed with this movie
one of my favorites most definitely
go see this and watch it 100 times more after that if you love the kind of movies that f with your mind
there is not a thing i did not like about this film
i watched it winter 2014 at avenue malls cineplexx in osijek during its release date in a croatian european union part
this is according to my opinion ben afflecks acting of a lifetime
i was astonished by rosamund pikes marvelous acting as well
the plot was greatly interpreted by david fincher even greater than he did in a 1997 the game film starring michael douglas
i adored the scenery in the film and the overall atmosphere was spooky in a rather good way
i will never forget the posh scenery in and around a stone house with a wine cellar and rosamund pikes throat cutting
there was a point at which i thought this movie is brilliant
i never saw that coming
it had me secondguessing my own perspective as a viewer
the plot was incredibly well thought out
then it went to far
it wasnt just too long in terms of runtime it was too long in terms of the number of plot twists before the end
it got too incredibly outlandish clicha and sensational
in the end i had no idea what the artful manipulators end game was
what was the motivation
i dont know what you want
this movie like its character should have quit while it was ahead
still i think this is one of those stories thats going to stick with me
ill find myself mulling over it in my head for a while to come
so my wife inspired by favorable critical as well as popular fanfare having bought and finished reading the book exclaimed  now we have to watch the movie
upon the films conclusion she looked at me and said  yeah the book was no good either
we agreed that this flick is fodder for middleofthenight lifetime channel viewing and thats not a knock against lifetime because we both enjoy the sordid salaciousness of many of their films however most of the programming would never be confused with brilliant filmmaking which is what apparently happened with the gg franchise
i see a lot of user ratings at 1 and while i understand that score both affleck and pike are skilled actors not low on the charisma scale
i can only believe that they didnt realize the story would play out like an episode of  the edge of night  penned by tristan tzara
i will say that i anticipate the mst3k version with great relish
i loved the movie more than the movie i only loved the book
if i had not read the book before i watched the movie the ending would have been a bigger surprise factor for me like it was for my fellow viewers
the movie kept me hooked till the end and i couldnt wait to find out what will happen next even if i already knew it
the doze of excitement and entertainment this movie gives you is remarkable
the actor choices were amazing i would not be able to pick a better amazing amy myself
the movie was mind blowing
what i also loved is that they kept they script so close to the book
they really made an effort to present as a movie that was so close to the descriptions in the book
not only the characters but also the environment
i had heard so much about this film
it lived up to its buzz
the movie is clever funny suspenseful erotic and heartbreaking at times
rosamund pike deserves all the reviews that she received for this film
she chews up the scenery
while ben affleck is often miscast in films he is perfect here
it has been a long time since i have enjoyed him in a film
the second and third acts really give him material to sink his teeth in
the movie had so many twists and turns which i love in movies
gone girl is one of the best movies i have seen recently
david fincher takes you on a ride that will stay with you long after the credits end
i really struggled not to rate this movie as one despite being extremely awful but then i realized i have seen a lot worse movies
maybe the reason i wanted to rate this movie as one so bad is to offset of the mindblowing gigantic bubble rating of 8
2
to be fair to actors they did what they were supposed to do but with such extremely bad no point shallow script there is no way this movie could be even close to being acceptable even if the naked covered in bloodshower scene was performed by julia roberts and anthony hopkins
i mean that could have explained the high number of views and reviews but not the rating
with such hype and high rating chances are you will probably watch this movie however if you are one of those who actually value their own time and try to spend it on something worthy then this is a one you should not waste your time on
more like a list of things wrong with this film
probably the most disappointed ive ever felt after watching a film
its only february but id be surprised if i saw a worse film this year
the amount of plot holes actually annoyed me
amys character wasnt at all consistent
so much doesnt make sense
you feel nothing for the characters for the most part
some bad casting choices were made
is that really how the case would be portrayed on television
did amy really think that her final plan made any sense and wouldnt be found out
shes supposed to be both intelligent and meticulous
leaving hospital covered in blood
the cameras in the home
im speechlessutterly without speech therefore taking the time to write my first movie review ever
not so bad that i wasted 2 12 hours on this turkey who hasnt done it before
and id probably have wasted it anyhow on something else but that the critics consensus is somehow so high for this pos film
i venture to guess that theyre rationalizing the film in whole to be as good as certain segments probably from subconscious fear of suffering the same letdown that the more objective viewers i
e
myself are meaning they just cannotdo notwill notbelieve this movie could go from bad to good to great to bad to just plain terrible effing lousy so fast
i almost dont blame them my head still wants to explode and its been over for half an hour
good thing i stream
id be sooooo p
o
d had i paid money to see this but wouldnt have in the first place if damn rotten tomatoes hadnt steered me wrong
well hows this for a terrific soap opera
all too clever by half and with so many new century thriller films paints itself into a corner that cannot be redeemed in the running time
here is a great modern destructive thriller with an ending that completely undoes the whole film
drone character husband meets cryptic woman manipulator who scores a 1010 for bitch mayhem
wealth allows plot points and absurd new characters to be hired to glance sideways
injoke about deception sees gay actor hired as hetero obsessed stalker lover
ice blonde proves to be better temptress than all the men mired in ghastly double dealings
oakie rednecks prove to be the smartest characters in wasp thriller
stay gasping until the 139th minute
admire the frank lloyd wright architecture
toss food at the screen
shake head as credits roll
in all disappointing film
the movie does have some merits
first half of the movie was interesting and with a half of the movie left i was genuinely curious to know where this would go
unfortunately it went downhill from there
acting was pretty good especially pike
script was believable and while you could give it the benefit of the doubt in the first half after watching the whole film i realize it was actually poor
in the first half some scenes make little sense but you hope that the rest of the movie will reveal the truth
it only gets worse
the movie is full of plot holes and very illogical actions
it becomes laughable in the end and i dont think that was the intention
the argument over the best suspense thriller director in recent times ends with david fincher
after successfully directing the girl with the dragon tattoo fincher presents another unpredictable thriller gone girl also adapted from a book with the same name
gone girl starts with a cozy pace gradually getting the audience interested with a story based on disappearance of amy inspiration to amazing amy series
amys husband falls into the suspect list as their bad marriage relationship emerges
as the movie progress the captivated audience is made to believe in something absolutely defying added with an even more dubious ending
fincher intermixes tense relationship with violence to create a spectacular mystery
the show stealer performance by rosamund pike is notable and justifies her character beautifully
it feels so good that fincher never disappoints with his work
i read the book and it was excellent i absolutely love her writing when i heard it was coming to the big screen i was worried about the casting but i think rosemund pike was an absolutely perfect choice
she was amazing
the way the movie was presented had all of the suspense and surprise of the book you literally never see each part coming the first half you are sure he did it then when it goes through the account step by step of how she basically planned it all perfectly until she made the one mistake your mouth drops open  for someone that hasnt read the book i think it was an excellent adaptation and i hope they do another of gillian flynns books
was looking forward to this film had read positive reviews etc
very disappointed after seeing this film
i admit its not completely horrible but definitely not in the same category as other top rated films on this site
this is not an 8 or 9 imo
story and acting reaches a comedic level where at one point during the film i thought i was watching a satirical dark comedy
definitely a watchable film but not close to deserving the hype and attention it received
rosamund pike was certainly memorable and in my opinion gave a much better performance than patricia arquette in boyhood but again at times i found the story downright laughable and implausible
we went to watch this movie because of many people recommending it and of course because of david fincher
i was very surprised why it got so much acknowledgment
a big part of the runtime was unnecessary
in comparison to his movie game in which every minute something utterly extraordinary was happening and it kept the audience in extreme suspense this one was mostly just fillers
ben afleck was just himself he didnt need to do any acting here while some of the cast were actually not bad so at least something to watch
all in all not what i expected
we left the cinema very disappointed
didnt really worth it
some parts were alright i dont want to spoil anything though so thats why im giving it a six
but mostly it was very predictable
david fincher is a master in making good filmsespecially thrillers
gone girl is one of them
the atmosphere is dark and the film unrolls slowlyfull of surprises
ben affleck is very good at his roleso is carrie coon and tyler perry but the true revelation of the film is rosamund pikes performance
her character is full of surprises and twists
half of the film is a puzzle to the viewer and thenpiece by piece the puzzle is complete
during the film you may start wondering about how things are not always what they seem to be
the films soundtrack is also enigmatic and matches completely with the plot
i think its an excellentmysterious film from the very beginning till the end and will absolutely excite thriller fans
okay from where do i start
first when i heard ben affleck was in it something told me movie would suck amp it seems my inner voice was right lol
at first movie seems weird no intense moments nothing like that
i keep watching in hope something interesting comes but in vain
its just so dead empty amp jumbled that lacks everything
oh by the way there are lots of mistakes im not going to mention all but a few for example she is interviewed at the hospital were she arrived covered in blood telling the story that she was raped
and nobody cleans the blood of her in the hospital and she is in a room with lots of cops plus husband lawyer etc etc
then she leaves with her husband that was accused of murder and they go home together
its just an enormous junk heap of illogical and nonsense movie
oh and movie is so stretched
its 230 minutes of boring uninteresting amp unrealistic plot
its as bad as finchers fight club which is another overrated piece of junk
just avoid this movie do no waste your time on it
