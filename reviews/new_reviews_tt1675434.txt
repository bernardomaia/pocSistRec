just seen last night amazing movie great performances from actors particularly from omar and cluzet is great as usual
photography of images are great supported by good choice of locations supporting actors are all good and natural so doing a great job to give a great solid base to the story
rich of emotions on a simple story where ordinary people become extraordinary
good representation of social differences in france without being too heavy on it
simple beautiful efficient like a good french cuisine making a great dish full of tastes magically mixed  most to be watched and even more emotional when you know its based on true story
this was for sure one of the top5 or top10 movies ive ever seen
the actors the ambiente the story
simply everything was in a perfect combination
this film is for me in a league with films like the elephant man but for a much wider audience
and as the title say after this film i really have to consider to reduce my ratings for several films because it seems a bit unfair to put them on the same level as this film although i dont have anything to criticize on them at all
all the persons in the film are very authentic played
and both main characters surprised me with a brilliant performance
i would say that both actors are really what they are playing in the film
if i would see franaois cluzet in the street i would be surprised not seeing him in a wheelchair
the emotions shown in the last sequence of the film are so brilliant
this is one of the best movies we have ever seen
my wife and i see 3 movies a week on average over the past 40 years
saying it is one of the best is quite a statement
this french movie with sub titles is simply spectacular
the storyline involves a man crippled in an accident his wife has passed away and he cannot find adequate help which he requires 247
until he meets the most unlikely of people to care for him
the acting by omar sy amp mr
cluzet is the very best
the movie has everything you want in a movie
it has compassion and is spectacularly funny
run to see this movie
the two prime actors must be recognized for a whole host of awards
wow
the actors give good performances here but the script and the movie ultimately is ridden with clichas and not terribly sympathetic
anyone paralyzed in this manner deserves sympathy but if you have a vast fortune an army of caretakers and every imaginable comfort and resource you may need less sympathy than some others
why did the filmmakers transform a north african muslim
caretaker into a senegalese
why is this black africans conformity to every clicha  potsmoking violent rap music he even dances well  supposed to be refreshing either to philippe or the viewer
so much was simply artificial  dressing philippe like a doll playing with his beard and hair the caricature of the other applicants the behavior of the adopted daughter  or further clichas  e
g
the police
mildly amusing at times way too long just watchable
i saw this title and i was really skeptical to the storyline  another comedy drama that will neither make you live the story alongside the characters feel their emotions nor will it make you laugh that is what i thought
but men was i wrong
i love the way franaois cluzet and omar sy play in this movie  so natural  so good
i lived every second of the movie like it was my life
i came to like driss and philippe as real characters and now at the end of the movie i wonder where did they go
that is the kind of emotion this movie generates
it has everything you could expect from a great movie  story characters laughs and cries tension and so on
you wont regret seeing this movie alone or with someone
i appreciate great work when i see it and this film made me take into consideration seeing more french movies as it improved my opinion on them
enjoy this movie and every frame of it d
intouchables is a very nice movie about a man in a wheelchair and his caretakerbuddy who injects life in the boring life of the man
the performances are really good and in the case of omar unexpectedly good given his little experience
there are many humorous scenes in this film but the overall climate is depressing
the reason i give it a 7 is because it isnt deep enough and you dont get to know the characters very well maybe a little more screenplay time would be for the best
also the ending wasnt really satisfying and left you a bit incomplete
but overall you wont regret watching intouchables i guarantee you that
after watching this beautiful film i felt two things
shame at my prior laziness for avoiding any nonenglish speaking films and excitement for the wealth of films i am about to discover
there is a film world outside of the uk and usa
anyway i havent much to say about the film youll get a good incite into it by watching the trailer
from the subject matter i assumed at some point during the film i would need tissues to dry my tears which would have made reading subtitles difficult but thankfully i didnt
at times its sad but is also uplifting throughout
its just a lovely film and may throw caution to the wind by watching it again without the subtitles
watch it to see what lifes all about
watch it to find out what friendships all about
watch it to hear some amazing music
watch it to see how to live your life even when you think its too hard sometimes
watch it if you still dont believe life is wonderful
watch it if youre bored with your life if you think theres no point or no hope
watch it if youve stopped enjoying simple things
the plot is simply thrilling the acting as wellwith a large amount of extremely good humour plus a great deal of equally amazing music
you have to be careful however as once youve watched the movie for the first time you will not be able to keep your mind off it and the beautiful music makes it even more difficult
watch it
this movie is so good that we watched it twice in two days
such friendship honest true and natural is something to be jealous about in the most positive way
a big surprise so it needs a lot of very positive comments because you do not want to miss this one
although you may think this is a dramatic movie it is actually more a very warm movie loaded with very good humor
the trailers advertisement and also the dutch tittle actually first put us of to watch this movie
then it is also a french movie so normally that comes with a lot of not too positive expectations
this all is easily overwon within just the first few minutes of the movie but gets totally shattered the longer the movie lasts
this is a truly excellent french film which highlights themes from love to comedy
i really enjoyed the music which went with the movie as it captured the mood of the based on a true story storyline
the main piece was fly by ludovic einaudi
the actors play a splendid role to depict the life of the real paralysed man and real carer
i only watched this last night and i watched the original  in french
it is a very recent film filmed in paris and i find this film suits any watcher for the reason that it contains both highup posh lifestyles compared to chavs smoking and speeding maseratis
the humour is captured best in the original version as i would imagine a few humorous jokes may not work in translated english
i loved it
if u only could see one movie from 2012 u should pick this one
this is a wonderful film about the relation between two persons who you never could think would be friends
omar sy and francois cluzet is the perfect choice of actors
what really touched me was the sort of honesty their relation proceeded in and that its not always the conventional way who is the best way to go you always have to understand that all people are and should be treated as who they are and not by a manual
the change in omar sys character is wonderful to watch and he well deserved won a cesar for hes performance
all the characters in the film are very likable and i strongly recommend this movie for all ages this is a feelgood movie with a ll the right stuff in it
another great film from the french film industry that made a great echo all over the globe
all this with a low budget and a story inspired by true events
the tetra person was played very convincing by franaois cluzet
omar sy delivered a surprising and respectable performance
i find that the intouchables should deserve at least an oscar
i laughed a lot about all the funny jokes and adventure scenes
each one of the sequences had lot of emotions and every detail of the handicapped man was well studied
the running time was not too long for me
i didnt expect such a beautiful happy end
just see it and let you surprise how nice it is
1010
its quite rare to find and have the pleasure to enjoy a genuine movie blending comedy and drama with such naturalness thats why intouchables is undoubtedly a rare authentic picture and the fact that the story is inspired by a true one helped make the movie more involving
funny and touching at the same time the picture evolves with simplicity but strong pathos with the merit of avoiding every pathetic or melodramatic attitude theres brutal honesty in representing the real condition of philippe as well as drisss initial uncompassionate attitude
there are touching moments there are true amusing moments both accompanied by a forceful soundtrack
acting proves brilliant to say the least and the pairing between francois cluzet and omar sy sparkles and captures the viewers attention
i was swept away by drysss genuine smile as well as by philippes melancholic eyes and the moments when they are together filled me with an authentic feelinggood sentiment
definitely a mustsee picture
this one is excellent movie
i am from india i dont get too much foreign titles in theaters
but i watched this movie last night it was too good
its a comedy between friendship and trust and its based on a true story
its not an innovative story or highly budget flick but it guarantees good humour and pranks
now its one of my favorite movie
brilliant acting by every one of them not too much sentiment or comedy
my rating is 1010
this is one of the movie you should watch before you die
thanks to its strong cast and some remarkably sensitive directiona movie or rather true story of two men who should never have meta quadriplegic and a street con
franaois cluzet as philippe and omar sy as driss make you sit tight on chair for the whole movie because its a plausible enchantment
im not one for leaving reviews and i shall not attempt to describe the intouchables from a technical standpoint as is often the case with reviews in terms of lightning and cinematography etc as im not the best judge in that sense
i do feel compelled however to comment on the film simply because i have not enjoyed a movie as much as this in a long time especially a foreign language film which is very much a minority in my viewing history
its a wonderful heartwarming story of two people from polar opposite walks of life who form the strongest of bonds living in each others pockets and it is also at times hilarious and i have not laughed so much for as long as i can remember
i found it to be very well acted and the two leads are both very well suited to their roles it is thoroughly worth watching and can only leave you feeling good at the end
a true film which offers a story that makes the viewer filled with emotions
the untouchables is a gorgeous story that breaks cultural barriers and shows the human side of relations
i liked the movie for its honesty as it was pragmatic
the cinematography is beautiful and the acting is outstanding
the story follows a quadriplegic aristocrat who is looked after by someone who comes from a deprived background but knows what really matters
the characters of both philippe and driss perfectly complement each other although they come from different worlds
their relationship is strengthened as the film progresses in a poetic way filled with humour
totally recommended
this is a dont miss film if there ever was one
any age will find this film to be one of the best films they have seen in years
even teenagers who typically only want to see action films will be drawn to this film
one does not even remember the film was subtitled
this is the story of a quadriplegic who continually needs to find new caregivers because of how badly he treats them
he finally finds the most improbable candidate and hires him
this begins a fantastic and very funny relationship that kept me spellbound for the whole movie as it did the entire audience
when it ended the audience all clapped loudly
see this movie if you want to laugh a lot and if you appreciate the development of a true unique friendship
if you have a chance to see this moviedo it
this is the best movie ive seen in years
the story is touching yet funny
it made me both laugh and cry
actors are just plain excellent they are very talented and they show spirit
the script was written magnificently with great conversations and humorous touches
you can really tell a lot of effort was put into this project
i have nothing but words of praise for this movie
and those critic reviews about this movie being racist are completely false
so maybe this movie shows that a black guy smokes pot and lives in a poor family but why is that racist
maybe it is a clicha that a black guy is poor
but remember its based on a true story
so trust me when i say go and watch this movie right away
before watching my only expectation was that it really is a comedy not a drama with two laughs in it
turns out it was a comedy with very subtle touch of drama it is a movie worth every second of your time
does it have flaws
i dont know i was too busy enjoying every minute of it
captivating actors beautiful script and great sense of humor
this is one of those very rare movies that make a tiny change deep inside you and youll know it happened when the movie is over
watching this you can laugh at a tetraplegics shortcomings without feeling bad because it is in absolutely good spirit you can laugh at the serious things in life because they cant kill you and somehow can always find a way to have some fun no matter what
ive never submitted a review before but this was absolutely outstanding
the dialogue is excellent with many unexpected responses especially in the beginning
the characters are exceptional especially in their social contrastbut when the inevitable social comparisons are made they are either handled with genuine surprize or else expertly buffooned
some of the obvious exchanges are handled so well and so unexpectedly that there are guffaws from the audience
the story is wonderfully touching without any syrup
that it is a true story makes it even more surprizing and appealing
i dont know which other contemporary movie i would rate a perfect 10
well done
my wife was frightened when i was suddenly burst laughing at omer sys spontaneous acting scenes
i enjoyed watching this masterpiece
omar sy is a great actor and he deserves an oscar for his role in this movie
i found omar sys role much more challenging and unusual than jean dujardins
of course few people make silent films today but the character itself was incredibly stereotypical
as for the intouchables i really liked the film and found it entertaining and thoughtful at the same time
the chemistry between the two leads is wonderful
not quite as insufferably retro as it sounds the formulaic film gets a boost from the endearing performances of its leads a particularly sy whose exconturnedservant instructs his cultured boss on the pleasures of 70s soul classics and potsmoking before cleaning up nicely
the racial politics remain as sketchy as the sitcomstyle jokes and harvey weinstein smells a hit having bought both the movie and alas the rights to remake
i have never seen a more beautiful movie
brought me to tears at many points such a great story
loved both of the main characters and there were many funny serious and heartwarming parts all throughout the movie each of them done amazingly
the soundtrack for this movie was beautifully
the last scene was just so moving the smile on driss was just the most genuine and pure thing ive seen while they share their final moment together and both move on to better things
i still have the ending song playing and it just makes me think of so many beautiful things in life ive changed how i look on life because of this movie appreciating so many things like art classical music nature etc
things that i normally dont really look into but now i just have utmost respect for them
couldnt recommend a movie more i literally made an account on this site just so i could write this review thats how much i truly loved it
this is the only film i manage to watch 3 times in 24 hours
i was so thrilled with the originality and humor that i couldnt stop watching and talking about it for days
both characters are genuine witty and original
scenario has enough of intelligent humor and it is such a refreshment in the ocean of bad comedies
the film has the tragic note but also it shows we should use every moment of our life
the fact that the film was based on real persons and events makes it even more special
i would recommend it for every audience  each person can learn from the film
its a story of life love daily problems tragedy but it shows that we can change our perspective and experience the maximum
also it shows how two totally opposite people can build an amazing relationship
we just need to forget the prejudice we have about each other
im planning to watch it for the fourth time in short notice  thats how good the film is
this was a truly amazing story about two people in france from totally different culture and lives coming together to become friends and to help each other out along the way
i believe that both of the leading actors should have won academy awards
this film was so good that it should have won best picture
it is amazing how two human beings with all of their differences can come together in world that is divided to do something awesome when people to not expect the friendship to last
i love watching these lower budget films because a lot of the time they are better than the big budget hollywood movies that they seem to manufacture every year
this touching film is why i go to the movies to experience something amazing like this
i have been so annoyed by movies about miserable black people from the ghetto who are transformed by sweet gentle caucasians
finally the roles have been reversed
finally the media is graced with a movie about a miserable caucasian who is transformed by a sweet gentle black person from the ghetto
i love to see the underdog maintain a positive outlook a childlike exuberance and an optimistic approach that is contagious
yes the blind side had a similar theme but the intouchables supersedes it because a black person from the ghetto does not need to be mentally delayed to have a good heart
i recommend this movie to all those who dont mind reading captions for a good story
the acting was phenomenal and the fact that it is a true story just enhances the beauty of this movie
this movie is one of the best and the best comedy movie i have ever seen
humorous dialogues activities without foolishness and love for someone are really amazing to see
i was feeling this movie when i was watching it as i was a character of the movie
the starting of the movie was very good that started to feel me thrilled
but when i understood the thing my eyes were watering because of laughing i was feeling pain in my belly because extremely funny dialogues among characters
the acting of driss was amazing and mesmerizing
his impressions and movements was very energetic and funny
his dialogues sometimes make him funny but not a fool
the locations cars artworks and characters were perfectly matched to make this great movie
thanks very much to the director actors and all crew who made this epic movie for us
i heard about this movie for such a long time and when i finally saw it last night i realized how right were the people that talk good about this movie
the dynamic of the movie is really interesting and every character is well composed no one at the end has his story incomplete or anything like that
was also amazing to see at the end of the movie the small video with the real philippe and driss
is amazing just to think about the real story of those people i can say that i tried to substitute the character i got in my head after have seen the movie with the real person i saw at the end
the story of driss family i was afraid was going to be used too much to change the character or just to make him look in a different way through the movie luckily it didnt
this movie is definitely going in my best movies list
a man who hasa lots of moneyattendantsa nice big palace and unfortunately a body which is good for nothing
yes he has everything but he need a real friendhe need to meet with somebody who will love and take care of him not just for his money
and there is an another man who had lived a poor lifeand who has been living a poor lifewho knows the difficulties of lifewho came from mean surroundings
and you will see this two different man in the same pictureyou will see their unbelievable friendship
you will love this excellent movie
you have to watch this emotionalcreative film if you didnt done it yet
honestly it wasmaybe the best film i have ever seen
thank you
i was slightly pessimistic going into this movie as it was french with english subtitles but as i got into it the french didnt make any difference
this movie was a brilliant heart warming story and i really enjoyed it
it kept me entertained throughout and i was really disappointed when it finished
the acting was really brilliant and there was numerous very funny parts too
there is also a lot to learn morally from this movie such as not to judge a book by its cover and so on
overall i thought it was a very clever film and i would really recommend it
i rated this movie 9 out of 10 because it was very entertaining from start to finish
so i saw this movie in french class
and i dont regret i did
its got to be one of the best french movies ive ever watched
its a really great feelgood movie
its full of laughs tears and emotions beyond anything
and im really impressed as this is omars first lead role in acting he played it off really well not just in the funny parts but as well in the emotionally acted parts
this is defentily a movie i would watch over and over again and recommend to all my friends
definitely one of the best french movies ive seen in a while
im so glad i saw it
you should too
everythings good
the storyline the screenplay and the directing
the acting is great as well and the humor would probably go well in all countries not just france
its worth a watch and deserves an 8
really enjoyed this film and even though the subtitles always feel like a bit of a chore there arent too many lines to disturb the actual viewing of the film
driss omar is just perfection and couldnt have been played by anyone else
his personality shine through and you just want to keep watching him
once the film is over you feel like you want to know what happens next where did they go what did they become
the closing credits do offer a bit of information but you want to keep watching regardless
without giving too much away the ending makes the film complete
i felt like my heart was going to burst  when i realised what happened
and just how good it makes you feel
if anyone enjoyed this film as much as me for the same reasons i did that you can actually feel good about watching a man who can move nothing at all from the neck down then read me before you by jojo moyes
stunning
this is not just the shoe in for the best foreign language film at the 2013 oscars if there was any justice in the world the best film best actor and best supporting actor it is that good
i have no intention of spoiling anybodys enjoyment of this film by spoiling it
but this film does jokes the way you and i eat the popcorn in the cinema
from the soon to be classic dance sequence to the down right hilarious in a wicked bad taste way tash monologue
what should be a dour tragic tet a tet between a down at heals algerian immigrant and a upper class french billionaire is nothing of the sort its uplifting its got a heart and above all it propels french film into the super star bracket
yep its that good however dont believe me get down to whoever wherever its being shown and bathe yourself in a piece of cinema magic
loved every single second of it lt3
it is so moving and inspiring and moreover teach you the principles
briefly if you are in true love and you cant express it somehow this love will be exposed in a good way no matter if you are disabled or old black or white rich or poor
destiny also take place in this movie to show that you faith is kept for better days
we cant forget the importance of the family in our life even if you are not a 100 related and we can see this from the movie these are called principles
simply the best movie ive seen in a while and i would give it more than 10 if am allowed to do so
btw this is my first time writing a review
human interaction is like a note played on the piano
the right combination of keys go together to get a note running
not every note makes it to the top but the intouchablesthe name is quite deep do
the movie in its entirety shows a sublime harmony of an honest relationship between an accidental handicapped gentleman and a street smart blunt smoker black guy
there is not much to describe the plot its more about feeling it
nothing that we have not seen but still the life interactions shown here is a rare phenomenon in our everyday busy life
the movie does not make use of the beautiful parisian landscape outside of the closed doors but rather stays inside to explore the warm fuzzy feeling in a marriage between a quadriplegic and caregiver
watch it and figure how humor and charm can destroy the overcast brought by being dead serious in life
there is a time when we will die but till then live life
i really recommend this movie not only to those who love dramas or movies based on true stories but to everybody because i honestly think that this remarkable and educational but still story full of humour will love everyone
i havent met yet a person that didnt like it
i cried and laughed at the same time
this movie really touched me and it is definitely one of the best movies i have ever watched
actors did pretty good job like the whole film crew
althoug it is a french movie and most of us are used to those in english or our maternal language while i was watching it i totally forgot that so if maybe that is the reason why you still considering it just stop
everything about this movie is great and all i can say is enjoy
im usually not a fan of dramas but in this case i was absolutely blown away
plays by both of the leading actors were phenomenalthey really showed us emotions and identification with real people which is this story based on
from beginning of the movie jokes are where they should be  short and amazingly funny for this kind of movie
omar sy was great at his performance of rude african dris who came into the mansion and changed his daily life buy also changed the life of quadriplegic millionaire phillipe and brought this story to the whole new level
francois was brilliant at staying focused and becoming so realistic at playing disabled man trying to live normal life
film is great  lots of fun and good humor i would totally recommend this to every one like me who doesnt like drama but will have fun watching this for sure
the movie reminds you the good sides of humanity that we tend to forget in our daily life
it makes you feel comfortable and gives warmth to your heart while watching
there are many lessons to get from this movie
the relationship between these two different generation lifestyle economical difference culture is shown professionally
the movie is a reminder for all of us to cross these boundaries and build up strong humanitarian relationships with each other
the lessons you may get from this movie are priceless
especially when you watch it before your 30s it might change the way you look at life and your social network
it might actually help you to overcome stereotypes and see the real world
the movie shows us that socio economical class race culture background does not mean much when you can trust the person next to you
so give it a shot
the film goes to the bone and masterfully portrays stereotypes of peoples attitude towards the handicapped and those with criminal records
the greatest aspect of this movie lies in the interaction between the main actors where every sentence feels like exchanged respect understanding love and acceptance in a really brilliantly written mix of comedy and realism
the scenes are in good quality and the actors especially the main duo completely spectacular
omar sy is fantastic in his role as evidenced by three awards at various festivals
their chemistry on screen is great it is hard to believe that these two men are not the best friends in real life
intouchables is a very touching and beautiful story of an unusual friendship
intouchables is a french dramatic comedy this film is one of the nonenglish movies which is the most seen in the world
the very high score of intouchable is truly deserved
the plot is based on the true happened story of a philippe pozzo di borgo and abdel yasmin sellou
in the film the story is about philippe a rich quadriplegic man who tries to find a carer to help him in his daily life
he meets driss an black unemployed immigrant
driss has no competence to take care of philippe but nevertheless he accepts the job
while the context is very serious immigrants unemployment handicap
the atmosphere is decontracted
drisss tactless manners procures us a very good moment
you cant stop watching and you cant stop laughing
even if youve seen it a lot of times
the main actors omar sy and franaois cluzet plays their role perfectly
you get attached on the characters and on the story
i will not reveal too much but if you havent seen it yet and i doubt there are many then i warmly recommend it to all of you
another great movie that was made aain france
this is proof that a good film do not need 3d special effects and big budget
the film is excellent in all aspects
omar sy is perfectly played its role troubled guy who is trying to make ends meet
neither the the rest of the cast is not behind the of him
then every joke is funny
i do not remember when i laughed so hard because of the film
all thanks to great omar sy
but the best thing is not acting or humor but the story
the story which was done by real characters can not leave anyone indifferent
excellent story about friendship between two completely different people
the movie is excellent and i recommend everyone to see
i went into this film not really knowing what to see and was delighted
its subtle humor and honesty are refreshing amid overlycheesy movies this is because its actually based on a true story
two men find friendship when everything in their respective cultures says otherwise
it showcases the vast socioeconomic differences between driss and philippe and how these barriers are overcome
when we think of paris and france in general we do not think of the slums outside the major cities the poverty and brokenness housed just outside the city of love
this movie runs the gamut of emotions
the moments of tenderness and truth speckled between scenes of laughter and sometimes tears
overall i thought this movie was eye opening touching funny and thought provoking
give this title a shot
its not often i go to the cinema and am both captivated and uplifted from start to finish
the story the characters the cast everything works beautifully with driss playing the lead roll to perfection
you cant fail to love that guy regardless of his faults
the humour translates well and the jokes remain as funny in subtitles as they do in its original language
the fact that this is a true story tops off an already perfect combination
if there were more films like this the world would be a better place and the only problem i have now is that im always expecting a similar level of entertainment as this at every subsequent visit to the cinema
other recent films i put on par with thisfor varying reasons are  a royal affair the hunt la grande belleza sound city searching for sugar man
if you have not seen this film you are in for a treat
when a film is in a foreign language and is subtitled you know it has to be a very good film for you to enjoy it and i have to say i absolutely loved this film
im usually not one to watch these type of films i usually prefer action films however the humour this film gave along with the strong storyline was presented very well making me laugh and smile throughout the whole of the movie
i would really recommend this film to many different audiences especially to those who wouldnt usually watch this type of film because it is so unique and gripping
the actors were perfect for the parts and they played there roles very well
the realistic story line was key to the success of this film and i will be sure to watch this more than once it is that good
the french film the intouchables is a very moving story based on true to life characters
it is directed by olivier nakache and eric toledano
and it is written by olivier nakache and eric toledano as well
the story involves a wealthy quadriplegic man who is aided by a black man of little means
the plot quickly evolves and is checkered with bits of comic relief as in many of shakespeares plays
there are moments of tearfulness as well as outright laughter interspersed in such a way as to make this a very satisfying experience
i can highly recommend this french film with subtitles for its humanity that is quite evident from beginning to end
in addition the sound track of cars racing down the road give ones sound system a vigorous workout
