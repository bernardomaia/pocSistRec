401
where do i begin
of course the length
its just ridiculously long without anything that would make the viewer interested in without principles or a cause
the main protagonist is a dumb little girl who cant even fathom her convictions let alone hold on to them
she has a guy loving her working in the mines while shes pretending not to like the parade of her and her victorious boyfriend from the games and all the posh showoff that happens
when the guy opens up to her and shows her that more than she matters and the fact that he wont just run off with her while all the rest stay in misery all she can do is just leave
then theres the other long part of the movie where she just starts to create this whole different relationship while her lover is left behind the screen
what sort of morality is this movie trying to portray
is this what the western world is moving towards to
just awful
this is the worst movie i have ever watched a time waster and also money waster
to much talk less action
as soon as action starts to be evolved the movie finishes
and the ending was weird
i think its to get people thinking whats going to happen but the whole movie was boring i was falling asleep kept looking at my phone
i personally think this movie should not have been put out in cinemas because it doesnt really grab the audiences attention
well it seems right seeing as the first movie was bad to i think every next movie they produce will turn out worst then the other
so this what my opinion is
this is an appalling film my wife suggested it she was quite embarrassed by 60 minutes at putting me through something so inhuman and by the time they fought monkeys she was positively apologetic do yourself a favor if you want a chick flick watch bridget jones or something and if you want a good film in the society gone mad survival genre watch battle royale
or if you have no choice but to watch hunger games catching fire and you are not a 12 year old girl do yourself a favor and set yourself on fire before hand the pain of healing burns will at least distract you from this piece of over budgeted under written turd
1 in the film i was watching part ive never read the books but boring i do not mean this term because people with real film culture does not use such a large organization
i found the movie lacking in most important thing was action
only the last 4550 minutes of the movie action had
te film into the stagnant and uninteresting until then developments passed
in addition the desperation of the people in the film at the very front was the plan
they were so desperate that every event has a really unhinge and has reduced the credibility of the film
the visual effects and in the last section action was very nice
i understand that action 3 intense in the film so shall it be
rate a film based on the very bottom
the particular thr the hobbit by the desolation of smaug of
all personalm thinking
sincerely
spoilers within this one had pretty nice cgi but only one character had any meat jennifer whom was based on shuya from br2 though in this she was usually sad or concerned or confused but down down down
there are many wonderful actors in this from phil to natalie dormer to julianne to the first hawkeye pierce to woody to tucci to liz but none of them had much to do and did it with a mediocre script that they dont seem to care is an abject ripoff
i even kept falling asleep with this slow pace reminiscent of a soap operas snails pace
it seems this is part three of a fourpart trilogy speaking of oddities and it is just a book turned around into mediocre movies
havent read the book but cant wait for the predictable fourth installment in which katniss will surely beat snow and his henchmen with sheer force of goodness and steely will
im getting ready to yawn and nod off as i write
with any luck i wont go to mockingjay part 2
horrid
wheres the 5 rating
jlaw proved she cannot act
if this is one of her best works it really isnt saying much cuz her other ones are certainly no better or worse than this
a flat voice no emotion
i like donald but even here he doesnt do much for the film
t ake a look at battle royale 2 revenge 2000 with riki takeuchi and tell me it is not the same
i watched the hunger games catching fire last night and when it came to the fight scene with the clock arena i thought ive seen that before i mean exactly like that scene
are there no rules against this kind of plagiarizing
the movie unfortunately drags out the pacing to fit three movies making even donald sutherland so beyond boring that i watched a lot of it at 1
5 speed great feature
the story isnt interesting at all
at first i thought this should be good but it never gets going
a movie can be slow and not boring but not in the case
it was hard to stay awake and i watched it during the day
hollywood should never try to be as ambitious to tackle films like battle royale 2
american morality eventually gets in the way
such attempts are cringeworthy
do not bother watching hunger games 2 unless you like talentless eye candy type films
watch the original instead
what is it with hollywood anyway
they shamelessly copy from oriental cinemabollywood and try to pass it off as their own
you cant help but feel disappointed
it was a massacre of the cultish battle royale 2
you have to have a strong stomach to stomach some of the things that happen in battle royale
its like bollywood was sugar coating the themes in battle royale and what do you end up with
a version which your granny can watch with you without feeling too offended
if that was the case then hunger games should never have been made
well it shouldnt have
catching fire fails to bring any of the creative fun of the first battle royale movie
this second one is pretty juvenile coming across as mainly a trite rehash of the official br sequel and a bore
jennifer lawrence who was captivating in the first hunger games is too fine an actress to be treated to such a thoughtless and obvious rip off
i suppose we will watch the third installment in two parts just to see how br2 turned out but hopefully the creators will make a production that exceeds this bythenumbers copy job
an absolutely horrible movie
wheress the fighting to the death
no violence no particular plot line to follow
very poorly made movie
the only thing that impressed me about this movie was that i managed to stay awake for the whole thing
i enjoyed the first ripoff but catching fire never did
the first 45 minutes or so of this movie should have been boiled down to about 15 minutes seriously
i grew very weary waiting for something anything to happen
we need more br reenactments and definitely more liam hemsworth who is wasted here
the rest of the movie wasnt much better and if the next 2 installments follow suit theres just no point to continue watching these films
the hunger games catching fire was essentially just a placeholder for the third movie in the series whenever that comes out
there was not a whole lot of meat just a lot of subtle plotbuilding that doesnt resolve at the movies open ending
i already know they screwed this movie up they sugar coated it by making it pg13 and they probably took out the sin city feel to it that the book had and they took out all the blood and gore and toned down the mayhem again bad move gt
now im just hoping they wont screw up the third movie because the third book was insane and i expect the movie to be that way too
i hope the third movie will be insanely gory just like the book and i really hope it will get an r rating both parts 1 and 2 since they split it in half if they do screw up the third movie which im seriously hoping they wont do i am not going to be a happy camper at all
i purchase this title based on the 7
9 score given on imdb
it was perhaps the most lack luster unexciting movie ive seen
i found myself using the fast forward on my remote
the hype over the movie was all it had going for it
i saw the first hunger games and would give that a 6
i guess i expected more
the acting was good but the movie seemed to drag and i lost interest quickly
the special effects were good but they couldnt save the very poor story line
i dont think my criteria for at least a good movie is out of touch with the rest of the world
many of my coworkers said the same
it was boring and difficult to get interested in
some movies i have like promethius ive watched over and over
i dont think my standards are over the top
very disappointed
this is a movie made for money profit only
first one was made with passion and believe to make a good movie and thats the only reason why people actually went to see the second movie
unfortunately the story is rather boring and similar to the first movie
not much happens when you think the movie is going to start or really reveal some story they just end it mid scene
it was a true pain to the eye if you dare to be honest and not react in a way like well everyone says it was good so i think alike
i strongly recommend not to go see this in theater and wait for the last one in the hope they dont screw that over as well
sure we know it was going to end in an open ending but this movie does not follow the structure every book or movie should have beginning middle plotend scene
this is a good movie to watch on a lazy afternoon with you brain capacity on half speed
all this movie does is give hollywood another shot at more money
this is not the end of the districts only the middle
when a movie ends and leaves you with wondering how the next movie will turn out is pure profit for the movie makers
this movie is just part 2 of 5 movies soon to come to a theater near you
plus is jennifer she is awesome
want to leave the theater wondering what happens next
watch this one
i actually fell asleep to awake wondering if i missed half the movie and to my amazement it was only 5 min
some cool parts but predictable
and who are these other people that we want to survive but then again wonder if they are evil
this movie i feel is a scam
a scam to get you to go to another movie that is to be announced down the road
just like breaking bad
sometimes its best just to end the movie and move on
i just cant imagine if there was a worse movie than  the hunting game catching fire too long too boring and no plot n story
dont waste your time and money on it
it really looks that too much money has been spent on making this movie but it is too confusing movie that many people started leaving the theater in the middle of the movie
i just cant imagine if there was a worse movie than  the hunting game catching fire too long too boring and no plot n story
dont waste your time and money on it
it really looks that too much money has been spent on making this movie but it is too confusing movie that many people started leaving the theater in the middle of the movie
not a good movie at all
how it gets an 8
2 average imdb rating ill never know
the dialogue is written for and maybe by
12 year olds the story is to be kind contrived and the actingdirection make you feel like youre watching one of those tv shows that somehow manages to have a huge budget but also low production values
dont waste your time
of course the movie will haul in a ton of money and so everyone involved in making it will receive attention and accolades but this turkey is definitely not going home with any of the big prizes this award season except maybe a razzie
how can the reviewers above think that this schlocky film is anything even remotely approaching some sort of cinematic masterpiece
studio plants thats the only explanation that makes sense right
i have read all 3 books and the first movie was good but this time round there was a lot more in the book that was not in the movie so the movie to me was not the best at all
i am hoping that the last movie will be a lot better than this movie
in a way i think they should rethink the movie and do it over and they just might get it right like i said there was thing in the book that could have been put into the movie
this time i would have to say the book is way better than this movie will ever be
sorry people but stay home and read the book and save your money
3 out of 10 is all i would give this movie
oh yes even my dad was not very happy with this movie as well
to be fair  the first was borderline but id heard good reviews for this
dont listen to them
just utter drivel
a poor mans battle royal
and thats ok as films go
concept is quite good but fails miserably in the delivery and story
cant wait to miss the 3rd instalment
apparently i need another 6 lines of text to point out the flaws in this film
well i suppose we could start with asking did she fire six arrows or 42
maybe a few extra were found that werent necessary to include in the story
then lets also look at the physicspower of a bow the size of a reel of cable and other such stupidity thats included in the film
fine its fantasy but at least try to obey the basic laws of physicsmass etc
first of all i have to start by saying i thought the first movie was a total rip off from a japanese movie called battle royale
same plot about some kids who are chosen to kill each other
the only difference between the two is that hunger games is a total hollywood funded movie and battle royale is not
i didnt see anything different in the 2nd film than the first
i feel bad because my wife had paid for our movie tickets and i did not enjoy the movie at all
i dont see what the big hype and excitement is over these films
i also only read books about actual facts instead of fantasy so reading the books would serve no purpose
if you thought the first movie was mediocre then dont waste your money seeing the 2nd
with the cost of going to the movie theater your better off staying at home and maybe renting or downloading this when it comes out
im giving it a 110 and would give it a zero but the bar wont go that low
the hunger games was great
catching fire is a masterpiece
jennifer lawrence is brilliant as katniss and josh hutcherson is great as peeta
this film is a large improvement over its predecessor with less shaky can and more scenes in district 12
they also toned down the love triangle which is great
the addition of phillip seymour hoffmans plutarch heavensbee is great and the storyline is good as well
the games were portrayed very well and the action was pulsepounding
however the careers were much less of a threat than in the first film and katniss doesnt do handtohand combat at all
those are the only bad stuff i can think of since the film was great and there wasnt a single dull moment in it
all the new tributes were interesting especially finnick johanna and beetee
this film is great and is a mustwatch
totally dont understand why people give this movie such a high rate
most boring movie i ever watched in this year
i know this movie is trying to express a lot insights controlling love friendship or whatever
but obviously at least i dont go to threat to learn a lesson i go to theater to have fun
first hour totally make me feel asleep
game started after 1
15 hour and only last like 25 minutes
a lot strange person wear strange cloth didnt find any beauty about that
wedding dress is pretty though
give this movie 2 points instead of 1 is because the actress played a good role at least she expressed her emotion pretty well though she is not pretty
i thought the original hunger games was stronger than this bloatedfiller of a 2nd movie
not that the original was a great movie but its story was better intact
no longer are trilogies good enough as standalone movies and director francis lawerences hunger games catching fire is a case in point
like the hobbit movies these movies seem more and more like tv episodes
in catching fire there is an awful 1st half followed by a weak retread of the same mindless reality tv survivor themes
finish that off with a gaping ending
spoilers what are audiences treated to
try a pack of baboons electrocution and acidfog
is this the best storytellers can come up with
this movie is a shameless moneygrab plain and simple
it offers little freshness compared to the original which was itself a 610
not recommended  410
is the general public getting dumber or what
seriously an 8 out of 10
i really wanted to love this movie as i really enjoyed the first film
catching fire had no fire to it
it felt too slow most of the movie and then when it got somewhat interesting it was rushed in like 30 minutes
the ending was terrible the director and the writer should be ashamed
a true artist actually cares about the work they put out more than about the money
there was no real story to this movie its more like a transitioning filler movie from the first to the third movie
it was lacking substance and it had no life to it
i think this movie had a lot of potential into being a great movie but it was ruined
i do however think that the acting was good and the costumes were great
overall i think it was a waste of money
this film is
um
well to any fan of the first film this is a sabbath
if you are like me skip it
i was dragged to this film by my family
after a while i realized this film is more of the romance bulls
seriously
yes this is a new director which means no more shaky cam which kind of improved on this movie but not that much
while this is not the worst movie i have ever seen there still is the garbage pail kids movie but this is no django unchained my alltime favorite movie or fight club
but now this movie is on the top 250
yet it is at 220 but still does catching fire really match up as one of the best films ever
no
jennifer lawrence is obviously the best thing about the hunger games franchise and she is at her peak in catching fire
many other supporting are outstanding also including elizabeth banks philip seymour hoffman josh hutcherson and woody harrelson etc
even before the whole games start we go into great action scenes that will make you jump out of your seat
when we then get into the games oh boy
it will make you shiver jump out of your seat again amp again etc
i love this movie a lot as a popcorn flick and i dont really have any flaws with this movie except maybe a few and this gets a gets a 910 jennifer lawrence action scenes hunger games shaky cam a bit
the book hunger games was published in 2008 and the film released in 2012
it shows a sophisticated society
although it is impossible not to notice all the similarities with the japanese film battle royale ii released in 2003 five years before
in this film students are kidnapped in a excursion trip and wake up with a headexplosivecollar
they were selected to a life and death game with only one survivor or none at all
each one receive a backpack with food drink lantern and one weapon or survival device
each six hours they are informed about the dead and the danger zones to be avoided in order not to explode their necks
alliances are made and death follows the smallest suspicion
previous infatuations and enmities are explicit
enfasis centers in the animal inside all of us and how thick is the civil layer of our personalities and our survival willingness
hunger games is much more complex however it is impossible to deny so many similarities
first let me say i like jennifer lawrence
i think she is beautiful
she seems like a kick in the butt on and off the set
however i never understood how she was chosen to play a kid who grew up in the most starved district of a starving world
i can suspend disbelief for some things but all i ask when i see her on screen for these movies isshe was born in a starving world and has been starved all of her life yet somehow she grew to be 59 and weigh in the neighborhood of 130 pounds
again i like her not in these hunger games tripe but shes about 10 pounds away from being type cast as the next big teen hits mom
i was really disappointed
the movie is really long more than 2hours and the action only starts after 145
i was really sleepy when it finally start and i finally i fell asleep at the end
its only a prequel to the next one
and the ending cuts really harsh just in the middle of the story
really i should have seen another movie at the theater there was a lot more better choice
really wondering why it gets 8
4
i expect a lot more from all the publicity this movie gets and im really not happy from that movie
i should expect that from the first one its just a big remake of battle royal and it couldnt go so good with a sequel
the story is quite cool just i dont like how its constructed and how it finish
top of all 4 on 10 i dont recommend that and im big cinephile
the movie was well shot and camera angle really nice and the decors too but thats almost it
i enjoyed this movie
i read all the books a long time ago
i hate katniss
in the books i only liked gale
the second book i felt was just trying to keep the hype from the first book
there was no need for a second hunger games
she could have went a different way with that
anyway i thought lawrence did well like before
nothing too fancy but the costumes and locations were good
above average movie that kept me entertained
this is such an intense and emotional ride and you better get on
the reason this is my favorite is because i believe katniss has developed so much in this movie as a character
spoiler warning she ends up having to go to the hunger games again
and when she does she shows that she will not let the capital defeat her no matter how many times she gets knocked down
i love the relationship between her and peeta
he was always my favorite and he develops as a character as well
spoiler warning i love the new addition of the character finnick and he firsts seems like an enemy but than he turns out to be a good guy
this is such an action packed movie and it has a lot of heart
really love this movie
i read the first couple pages of this book just to see where the author might go after the first story ended
i have never been hooked so quickly and so hard as i was by catching fire
it ended up being a page turner for me and actually renewed my interest in reading
as a film i thought this was a fairly bland translation
i didnt much like the casting or the lookthe way it was filmed the colors the costumes everything
it didnt need to be any better than it was to be successful because the book was so well written but as a companion i find the film to be extremely disposable
i watched it once just to see the story in live action but i wont revisit it
on a side note i almost never enjoy dystopian fictionespecially sci fibut like i said this book drew me right in
the second movie of the hunger games series finds katniss yet again on the battle field this time fighting other victores of the games
the film started well enough with the presence of power and the fear of the revolution being introduced as the main idea even though the protagonist resist it as long as it takes
and that resistance leads to too many proof that the capitol is rotten and needs to be brought down
the love triangle between katniss and the two boys is meaningless even though it becomes stronger and stronger towards the end
you can easily guess of course what it will happen next and even the secret role of some of the characters in the film is quite obvious
the second hunger game battle is like wanting to repeat something that it was very successful and might be revised
however i dont know how much blame can be set on the movie for following the books story line
the performances were good and the special effects as well as the costumes were excellent
and so i give this movie a 4 out of 10 because the feeling of deja vu was there the whole time
just like some others here i was waiting for this movie almost a year
when i left the cinema it was with a unhappy feeling
the movie was very slow and took too long
the characters where superficially and the story ended abruptly
on the positive side i noticed the good acting of the main characters
there where some beautiful scenes on the tour their took around the different districts and the speeches they gave
but i never felt involved in the story in this film
it seemed a summary of facts with no real consistency
the background of the other participants in the 75th hunger games was not elaborated
i dont understand that this movie got and 8
i actually was not going to write a review but after reading all those best movie ever comments i felt the responsibility to write something
i watched the movie at an imax where even the worst movie looks ok but there was nothing visually spectacular
character development phase is not that bad but there was no character that i could like including katniss
actually especially katniss
there was nothing special about the performance of jennifer lawrence to say the least
she really needs to work on acting and expressions
she was really boring
the other characters dont even have an impact
when it comes to the story it is somewhat not so believable
i am a huge fan of scifi and fantastic movies but the story of hunger games has never been appealing to me
anyway do not trust that super positive reviews
this is an average movie with an average story and average acting
catching fire is the 2nd movie in the series starring the same cast from the previous movie
this is how you make a sequel you put laughs drama and action you mix them up and you make a masterpiece
the film is full of great performances characters and action and also music
the director is doing a much better job than the previous one did with the first film also there is a much better plot in it even tho its another hunger games this time is different the characters have some experience which it can help them take out their enemies faster
the hunger games catching fire is the sequel that set the bar too high since none of the next 2 made the same amount of money or got the same critical reception as this one did
catching fire the second installment in the hunger games trilogy was by far the best movie in the series that i have seen so far
this film goes more in depth with the story and the characters feelings than the first one did and explains more about how life is in the districts
it seems like the camera work make up lines the writing and what they did a did not cut out of the movie from the books was done with more care and thought than before
catching fire was somewhat like the book and kept me on the edge of my seat until the end of the movie and i have seen it about 6 times sense 2013
the actors really put their hearts into this one and gave off a believable performance especially jennifer lawrence and i am usually not impressed by her
it left me wondering what was going to happen next and my anticipation for the next film was at an all time high but that was for nothing but that if for me to talk about at a later timeand i really got into the story
catching fire deserves i higher rating than it received in my opinion
being one of those people who dont read the books but watch the movies to me it was an okay movie
even though this is my 3rd time watching it i thought i might as well do a review on it
this one was much better then the first one
it had better special affects to me seemed more entertaining also they did much better with the camera work  in the first movie in some scenes the camera work was a little shaky the basic for all the hunger games is people killing each other
some other directors could have gone all out with the blood and gore but this director francis lawrence did an excellent job if directing
he never made it to gory but gory enough that it was still intriguing
by the end of the movie they made a lot of improvements that they did wrong in the first movie so i am happy with that
the sequel fails to convince us for its true goals
the cast is strong woody harrelson elizabeth banks and lenny kravitz are all fabulous but the whole project fails because of the scenario
the second part catching fire is obviously a try to make it look like the v for vendetta but the result is not the same
the satirical and futuristic views of the movie combined with moments of melodrama cannot persuade us by using clichas for the serious issues is dealing withlike inequalitynew world ordertotalitarian regimes government control etc
katniss everdeen jennifer lawrence and peeta mellark josh hutchersonwill come back to the arena after an unfair decision of the games committee
even the performances are good the scenario is predictable from the first moment
what is not predictable is the heartbreaking emotional conflict katniss experiences standing between her lover and peeta
i was expecting much more from the second part because it has been based on a brilliant idea
lets hope the third part will be better
in my opinion this film is not as good as the first one
the actors are marvelous
jennifer lawrences performance is excellent
believable intense with layers
ive read the books
its written in first person from katnisss perspective only
the movie could develop the story from other peoples angles too
it has so much potential to explore from different perspectives
and it fails to do that
i will have to put the blame on the director
the arena scenes are very disappointing
less excitement than the first movie
overall i am quite disappointed
the dialogue between prim and katniss in the trailer which i liked very much is partially edited out in the actual movie
you gave me a chance
to live
no
to do something
i am all for suspension of belief but its a bit tough to get into the whole plot of the hunger games
the whole idea of the entire human race being okay with watching people and kids kill each other come on  yet everyone loves katniss our favorite polyandrist
part of the problem is i couldnt ever find myself rooting for her i dont know if its lawrence or the character but i didnt find either likable i found myself rooting more for peeta and finnick
going into it the majority of the movie feels pointless and when the games actually do start its something weve already seen a reverse slasher  except you know who wins
to its credit it does get better towards the end and i thought this one was better than the first
however between stanley tucci in the ridiculous purple wig the baboon attack and lenny kravitzs glittery eyeliner you would think the plot itself could not be the most cringeworthy thing about the movie
the second installment of the hunger games trilogy was really a bit of a letdown
i was anticipating a really good movie after reading all of the rave reviews on imdb but was sorely disappointed
the first half of the movie moves really slow and by the time you get to the action scenes at the end of the movie it feels rushed
the movie probably needed an extra 30 minutes or so in order to give you a better feel for the new characters introduced in this movie
they deviated from the book in several scenes but nothing that was too horribly distorted
the acting in this movie also took a step back
the characters didnt seem as believable in this film and you dont get enough time for this movie to develop the supporting roles
overall it was okay but it was by far the best book and unfortunately it fell way short of expectations
it was a really good movie over all but i didnt like the end the ending was a bit off and we didnt even get to find out what happened to peeta mellarkbut it was a really good movie but it had some flaws and it and ive never read the book but the move as a big let down and the movie was really a let down the effect in the movie were amazing like the fog and the lighting bolt at the end that destroyed the arena done and sum scenes in the move seemed to go on forever when you wish their was some action but it was all sad and depressing scenes for example the snow bit after gale gets wiped and prym and katniss everdeen
katniss everdeen is the girl on firethe victor of 74 hunger games
she never thought again to be a tribute in hunger gamesbut quater quell make her to do it
capitol was in bloodthirsty
because of her best friend gale she get into a serious problem with president snow
her pretend lover peeta makes the audience amazed at the quater quell interview
something is happening but katniss nor peeta didnt knowand what is it
revolution has been started and all wanted the mocking jay alivebut who is the mocking jay
katniss wants to save peetas life for somehow peeta wants to save hers and all the other tributes wants to save katniss life but the question is why
as scorpeeo so rightly puts it you have to read the book in order to appreciate the movie
that being said i didnt care one bit if any character lived or die mainly because i didnt read the book
the main problem with the movie is that the director did not take enough time to create characters the we could care for
the movie does not live up to the hype of the first one and being a movie of blockbuster status it should appeal to all audiences and not just the fans who read all the books
i hope the decision to split the final book into two films will help us understand fully about the revolution and the role katniss plays in it and increase our interest in the main characters
i dont get why this film is receiving so much hate
it is a sequel that is better than the original
the new director definitely helps the franchise
the whole cast shines jennifer lawrence is great as feisty katniss woddy harrelson is superb as drunk haymitch and elizabeth banks is superb as the eccentric effie
the special effects are superb and i especially the arty kind of effect when you see the arena for the first time
the only negative thing i wouuld have to say would be the slightly fast and the cliffhanger like ending which makes you scream for the next one
it is a great sequel and it surpasses the original because the first on e was slightly disappointing
the outfits and costume design is amazing and donald sutherland is mesmerising as the calculating as president snow
