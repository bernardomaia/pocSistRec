"\nLovely performances makes this far too clean and neat story, not merely\npalatable but enjoyable. We know by now that the plight of the\n\"colored\" in the South wasn't that clean cut or gentle in any way or\nshape. Here we can sit and watch discovering the depth of he ordeal in\nthe wonderful face of Viola Davis. But, it all remains in the mild\nmargins of the real story. Entertaining yes but I couldn't forget\ndocumentaries of the period or \"The Long Walk Home\" with Whoopi\nGoldberg and Sissy Spacek. Sissy Spacek is in \"The Help\" too and she's\nvery funny. It also shows Bryce Dallas Howard under a new light. The\nbitchy, almost evil light. She's better here than she's ever been. Emma\nStone is lovely and the wonderful Allison Janney in a disturbingly\nrecognizable character raises the film to unexpected levels. I felt the\nfilm was too long and too careful not to offend anybody and that's were\nits weaknesses lay. But, I do recommend it.\n"
"\nI saw a preview of this film a few weeks ago in Philadelphia. I am huge\nfan of the book and could not wait to see the movie. I was not\ndisappointed. I LOVED this movie. I have not seen anything more moving\nor more real in such a long time.<br><br>The movie stays very close to the book. The book has a bit more\ndetails, but all the parts of the book that make it so great were in\nthe movie. There was not a thing missed in the screenplay.<br><br>The characters come alive on the screen. There is no stretch of\nimagination. The casting is perfect.<br><br>Go see this, you will not be disappointed!\n"
"\nThis movie wasn't badly made, it's just bad that it was made. In it\nevery character is a cliché cartoon in support of a fictional rose\ncoloured glasses version of 60's America, where almost every white\nperson is a villain and every black person loves fried chicken. If this\nis how America learns its history (and judging by the reviews where\nmany have viewed this film as having a positive and accurate message of\nhope and struggle????), then no wonder the western world is in trouble.\nIs it worse that a story about the struggle of black people to overcome\noppression in racist 60s America is centered on a privileged white\nwoman on the road to New York success? Marginalized yet again it seems.\nThis movie started out as passable entertainment but by the time it\ncrossed the finished line it had stepped full force into misguided and\noffensive. And shockingly many people seem to not know the difference.\n"
"\nAfter reading the book, I was anxious to see how well the actresses\nmatched the characters. I absolutely LOVED Emma and Viola. They made\nthe movie realistic and followed the characters from the book exactly.\nI don't think many actresses could have pulled it off. Also, it was a\nrelief to see that Hilly was a lot less intimidating in the movie than\nin the book. What I like most about The Help is that it wouldn't be a\nhuge deal to not have read the book; the movie would suffice (creating\nthe same emotions in both film and book). Two side notes: (1) even\nafter seeing the movie, read the end of the book regarding the author.\n(2) Emma is awesome--would love to work with her!\n"
"\nThis movie is a gem among a field of roses that the last year has given\nus. There have been tons of great movies in the last few seasons,\nhowever, this movie has created its own ranks. Beyond the shadow of a\ndoubt, The Help entices every second eyes hit the screen.<br><br>Having not read the book, and knowing just how often that I can\nhonestly say that the books are way better than the film, I cannot see\nhow the book could be better! If it is, then I have gotta say, best\nbook ever written.<br><br>I was crying, laughing, getting angry, clapping, and every good thing\nyou could evoke into an audience at a movie theater. If I wasn't so\nshy, I would have given a standing applaud at the end of the movie.<br><br>I recommend this to anyone and everyone, it will not disappoint.\n"
"\nThis is like one of those afternoon made for TV \"life affirming\"\ndramas. Full of sugar, whimsy and wholesomeness but totally lacking in\ntruth and bite. Ugh! The performances are almost uniformly two\ndimensional - even Allison Janney opted for cartoon like\ncharacterisation. The period detail is sometimes accurate but\noccasionally glaringly inaccurate. For example no girl in the early 60s\nwould have worn her hair in Emma Stone's hopelessly anachronistic\nstyle. I blame Tate Taylor who was credited with the screenplay and\ndirection. Apparently Taylor was born in Jackson and is a close friend\nof Kathryn Stockett. Can this really be how Ms Stockett wished her\nnovel to be brought to the screen? But there again I haven't read the\nnovel. Could it be full of the same yukky apple pie philosophy?\n"
"\nLook folks, I'm not the one to go watch a movie and then come and write\na review. This is very rare, in fact this is the first time. First of\nall, I'm a black middle-aged male living in Australia. I'm not into\nthat black-white-red-yellow affirmative action, divide or whatever you\ncall it and I have not experienced that American slavery or racism\nhistory except seeing it presented one-sided or biased on TV.<br><br>Now having proclaimed my neutrality above, I will tell you this: this\nis one powerful movie that will sure touch and move you in one way or\nanother whatever your political lining. The casting, directing and\nacting are top-of-the-shelf superb A+++. When my wife first told me\nabout it, I said OK whatever. Man was I wrong! I cried and laughed at\nthe same throughout the movie, and I'm a dude and where I come from men\nare not supposed to show their soft side. All I can say is go see the\nmovie and it will be worth it.\n"
"\nThis is the most wonderful movie. I enjoyed everything about it. I\nadore the characters and the story line. Excellent movie!!!!! I think\nit is well told and it is a very moving story. It is a slow paced movie\nbut I found myself intrigued by each moment. The only thing I found\nmyself wanting at the end of the movie was more story line. This is a\ntouching endearing movie, I cried and laughed. I haven't seen a good\nmovie like this in awhile. Though most will consider this a \"chick\nflick\", I think men could enjoy it just as much. A must see! I would\ncompare this movie to \"Life as a House\" and \"Evening Star\". A story\nthat just captures you heart and you don't want it to end.\n"
"\nI watched this film without any presumptions as to what it would show\nme. And have no prior knowledge of the text. So after watching The Help\ni thought i'd go and do some research, naturally the first thing that\npops up is IMDb and i am genuinely shocked that everyone is so gushing\nabout what to me was at times mere dross and at others actually\ninsulting. But mostly quite sad.<br><br>If i was to rent starship troopers then it would be fair for me to\nassume that depth, pathos and any kind of layered motivation wouldn't\nbe on the menu. yet when you watch a film set at one of the most\nvolatile and important eras of the last 500 years and it basically is a\nRom-com by numbers except black people are the shy guy who gets the hot\ngirl in the end and the 'mean-girl-who-doesn't-get-her-way' is the\nsymbol of indolent white middle-class racist. I expected better,\nclearly i'm looking in the Wong place and i apologise i will stick to\nbooks in the future. \"i loves me some fried chicken\" - \"you can have a\njob here for life\" oh really thanks.\n"
"\nWhat a horrible movie. Everything so new and clean. Mississippi and the\nsouth and the north weren't that clean. Freshly painted buses for the\nmaids to be taken to the white folks? Cars with no dirt on them?\nDresses of the rich folk and the po' with no wrinkles? Oh, come on.<br><br>What is it with Skeeter's hair? It appears to be curly from the\n2000's...not realistic....when was that curly hideous hairstyle\npopular? We had no maids in the 50's and 60's, so I can't comment on\ntheir treatment by the white folk. I'm sure they must have put them\ndown.<br><br>A job is a job, unfortunately, whether it is working as a maid for a\nwhite family or a slob in a factory. You suck up to the bossman or\nbosslady. Of course it is demeaning, but it is that for everyone.<br><br>A very hard movie to make it through...just too fake.\n"
"\nPerfect. A movie about the civil rights movement in the 1960's responds\nwith a light hearted approach to the chaos whilst conjunctively\naddressing the hardship of 'The Help'. Whilst the in-story author\nrequires help from the help, to right about the Help may seem\ndisorienting, Tate Taylor (Director) does this in a way that no other\nDirector seems to be able to do correctly. Great camera work located at\nabout 30 minutes, where the camera spirals upwards, following Emma\nStone up the spiral staircase is a shot that has been remembered by\nmyself and is something I look for within movies today. However, this\nshot and the shot at the end credits place it comfortably - in my\nbooks, as the shot which is on par with final shot from 'The\nPassenger'. The end credits in particular allow the actors the right of\nrecognition which they all deserve. Keeping to the underlying message\nright down to the point. A film which is undeniably rare for our time,\na perfect 10 out of 10, 5 out of 5, masterpiece.\n"
"\nHow many times have we searched in vain for a \"good movie\". We all say,\n\"they just don't make good movies anymore\".<br><br>THIS is one of them. I watched it from start to finish. I would watch\nit again and tell others to watch it. It was one of the finest movies I\nhave watched in a long, long time. The entire cast did a fantastic\nbelievable job in making this story come to life.<br><br>It was something you could watch with the entire family. It literally\ngives you an inside view of how \"hired help\" was treated back then. It\nalso showed you what it was like to be part of the upper elite and how\nso many dared not speak their opinions for fear of being cast out.<br><br>It showed you that not only did the help do their jobs but some of them\nhonestly cared for members of the family they worked for.\n"
"\nI was disappointed by this light Movie version of a great book, which\nit is not 100% true to. The light, fluffy, glossy look and woeful\nacting (from a good female ensemble cast) strips away the suffering and\nhardship reducing the feeling for the characters (which should be it's\nfocus). Instead of staying truly serious to the subject matter this is\nflipped into an ugly light-hearted entertainment journey (trying to\ncreate the Helps versus the nasty white housewives).<br><br>The film was interesting but limited, with most of the second half\ngiggling and obsessed with a 'poo pie' and failed to show the 'Help's'\nas anything other than minimally reluctant nannies (not slaves).<br><br>I would wash away my small memories of this film, in a way that would\nsum up this forgettable, washy, disappointment of a film. I think too\nmuch fun was had, and ultimately was the focus, of a Mississippi\nhistory lesson that never took off. 'To Kill A Mocking bird' this most\ndefinitely isn't!\n"
"\nI just watched for the filmography of Emma Stone and found this movie.\nI didn't think about racism and even the feminism. Nowadays these two\ntopics are hot for discussing in our country. The racism are still\nremained to our lives and feminism is ahead for the progress. The woman\nEmma stone played was really progressive person. She even gave up her\nlove for fixing the wrong culture. I could know the phases of the times\nshe lived. I thought that the racism was removed in the world's\nsociety, but from the surfing the internet, I could find many examples\nof 'still remained race discrimination. Also this movie made me to\nstart having interests about feminism and the rights of women are not\ntotally implemented. This movie's story was full of touched and I could\nsee the steps that many people experienced from the times to have their\nrights.\n"
"\nThis film is phenomenal. Truly one of the best I've seen in a long time\nand I attend movies weekly. It's an inspirational, courageous and\nempowering story about very different extraordinary women in the 1960s\nSouth who build an unlikely friendship around a secret writing project\nthat breaks society's rules and puts them at risk.<br><br>The movie is filled with poignancy, humor and hope. Also brings forward\nmessages that all audiences should take heed of, regarding who we are\nas people,skin color is not a factor.<br><br>All performances were outstanding,deserving of even more public\nrecognition, awards and credits received. Should have won the Academy\nAward for sure.<br><br>I saw this movie a few years ago but can still convey to friends and\nacquaintances my favorite scenes that made such a lasting impression on\nme. Mostly those with a comedic flair that packed such a powerful\nstatement.\n"
"\nThe audio book version of the novel \"The Help\" is award-winning, done\nby 4 (3 main) different actresses that really bring it to life.<br><br>I wasn't quite ready to let go of the characters and watched this\nmovie, hoping to prolong the experience. Unfortunately, it's a much\nover-simplified version of the story and the people involved. The\nadaptation to be a much shorter on-screen story is not bad - facts and\nevents are shifted around to basically tell the same essential plot.<br><br>Overall, I found it kind of cheesy, especially coming from the\n*excellent* read version, which goes much deeper.<br><br>If you're coming to the film without reading/listening to the novel,\nit's probably more enjoyable.\n"
"\nI finally caught this on TV the other night and stayed up very late\nbecause I couldn't shut it off. What a great movie. It definitely lives\nup to all the hype I remember from award season a couple years ago.<br><br>Set in Mississippi during the 1960s, a southern society girl returns\nfrom college determined to become a writer and proceeds to turn her\nfriends lives and a Mississippi town upside down when she decides to\ninterview the black women who have spent their lives taking care of\nprominent southern families. <br><br>The entire cast is so flippin' fantastic; (Allison Janney, Emma Stone,\nJessica Chastain, Nelsan Ellis, Sissy Spacek, Viola Davis.) And while I\ncan't remember who won the academy award(s?) I will tell you who\nsurprised me was Bryce Dallas Howard as the bitchy society girl. I just\ndidn't expect that sort of range from her, what an evil woman but again\neveryone involved was great. I'll admit to being uncomfortable and\nangry with certain scenes (as I was meant to be) but also proud because\nthe world is a changing. 01.07.14\n"
"\nI love this movie for it's message. It's also a great way to remind\npeople what America was like in that time period. I feel as if this\nmovie extends further from segregation and more towards the fact that\nwe are all created equally. The story is wonderful. The comedy was\ngenius. I love everything about this movie. One person wanted to stick\nup for those that weren't being treated fairly and so she did. It was a\nbrave thing to do. Especially when it turned her into an outcast. But\ndid that bother her? Of course not. She set her own personal values\naside in order to make a difference. This movie had me laughing. It had\nme crying. It had my heart breaking. Then it had me leaping for joy. I\nthink everyone should at least give this movie a chance. It could\nchange your entire perspective on life.<br><br>You is Kind. You is Smart. You is Important.\n"
"\nI absolutely and wholeheartedly loved this film. To start, any film\nstarring Emma Stone is my favorite. I believe that the directors\ncreated this film with so much respect to all races. No matter what\nrace you are, so much can be learned from the story line of this film.\nAlthough this film was based on times that we no longer live in, it did\nan excellent job portraying it in a way where viewers could relate,\nunderstand, and be entertained. This film is not just to bring\nawareness to past history, but it is also a film that contains\ndifferent scenes that will make you laugh so hard, scenes that will\nmake you fall in love, and scenes that will make you cry of both sorrow\nand joy. It is unbelievable that such a great, appropriate, and family\nfriendly movie, can contain all the factors that us as viewers enjoy to\nsit back and watch. I definitely recommend this film to everyone! It is\na film that will open your eyes, and also bring unity within different\nraces, and appreciation for bold people who one day took a stand for\nfreedom and equality.\n"
"\nWords cannot express how excited and anxious I was while watching this\nfilm. With mysteries lurking in ever corner, the audience just didn't\nknow what to expect, except the unexpected! Emma Stone's role was\nplayed extremely well; the writer who's trying to do her research by\ninterviewing the black servants in America during the 70's. Octavia\nSpencer, who played the role of \"Minny Jackson\" did a smashing job of\nserving a plate of well do I really have to say? Anyway, the\nantagonist, Jessica Chastain who played Celia Foote was most definitely\nasking for it! In fact, everyone who were following the path of\nApartheid were! I must say, I normally read the books before the films\nbut 'The Help' seemed to funny judging by the trailer to postpone\nwatching it! Fantastic, filled with fun and enigmatic encounters, this\nis a definite must watch! Everyone will definitely enjoy it, without a\ndoubt!!! Watch the film and make up your own mind!!!\n"
"\nI saw \"The Help\" at the movies with a group of female friends. The\ncharacter development in this film is really a great match for the\nstory line. I have a list of my favorite characters which you likely\nagree that they are all an enterprising bunch. The storyline is in a\nremarkable setting brought to life from a time of racism. I love that\nthe movie presents the perspective of a number of the characters\ninstead of just being from the perspective of just one character. It\ndefinitely has some hilarious moments and even some tear-jerking\nmoments. Its definitely not just a film for women or women of a\nparticular race. It's a film that all can enjoy. They couldn't have\npicked a better cast to play these characters. They really sold the\nstory line to the viewers leaving us wanting to know more as it was\nserved. It's a fan favorite movie that I can definitely watch again and\nagain.\n"
"\nThe Help. An aspiring author played by pretty Emma Stone during the\ncivil rights movement of the 1960s decides to write a book detailing\nthe African-American maids' point of view on the white families for\nwhich they work, and the hardships they go through on a daily basis.\nSubject is sensitive but treatment is not. In fact most of the time it\nis balanced, comical take on the racism that makes it an easy watch\nrather a shocking watch. If we talk about performances, Octavia Spencer\ntreats big time with her delightful portrayal of Minny Jackson for\nwhich she was awarded an Oscar. Viola Davis also stands tall with her\nsincere portrayal of Aibileen Clark. Whole movie is crafted like a\ngirl's movie so there is very less for male actors to show-off here.\nMovie makes its point but never hits you hard so you may not think much\nabout what you experienced after end credits have gone down.\nNevertheless, it's nicely crafted easy watch.\n"
"\nYesterday, I had a 3 hour break in-between classes, and a free movie on\nmy AMC Stubbs card, so I went to the movies. Unbelievably the only\nthing playing at my time was one of the movies I didn't want to see,\nThe Help. Isn't it funny how the movie you never want to see always\nturns out to be great? The Help is based on a book by the same title,\nand follows a young writer, in the mid 1960s, looking for an idea. At a\nparty, she notices how horrible people are to the African American help\nand decides to write their story. Of course it's a scandalous idea that\ncan get them all killed, but Skeeter finds one woman brave enough to\ntell her story. This movie is funny, heartwarming, and inspirational,\nnot to mention the acting is top notch. Viola Davis deserves an Oscar\nnomination for her performance, which is one of the strongest I've seen\nall year. The Help is an amazing story, with a terrific cast, and a big\nupside. It has a unique and inspiring story that takes us back to a\nvery tumultuous time in American History, and I can't recommend it\nenough!\n"
"\nJust watched this very compellingly historical drama with my movie\ntheatre-working friend who seen it twice before. We both enjoyed this\nfictional account of many of the African-American female maids and\ntheir stories they tell to an aspiring author named Skeeter (Emma\nStone). Among those female servants, Abileen (Viola Davis) and Minny\n(Octavia Spencer) provide the most interesting of their trials of\nworking for their employers. The most mean of the white employers is\none Hilly (Bryce Dallas Howard) who gets most of her comeuppance in the\nmost dirty ways one can imagine. Then, on the other side of the tracks\nis Celia (Jessica Chastain) who somehow becomes Minny's savior and vice\nversa. There's also good supporting turns from Sissy Spacek, Cicely\nTyson, Mary Steenburgen and especially Allison Janney. Since I haven't\nread the book, I'm sure there are some details I haven't been privy to\nthat I'm sure might have made this movie even more compelling. But what\nI've seen is good enough for me to highly recommend The Help.\n"
"\n...this is one of the best films I've ever seen.<br><br>I've been told I haven't written enough so my review won't be shown.\nFor goodness sake. I find reading long reviews tedious and boring. This\nis a great film, worthy of Oscars for Best Film, Best Actress, Best\nSupporting Actress (so many to choose from in this film).<br><br>I have to write ten lines of text for the review to be taken seriously.\nI'd like to know why? It's a great film go and see it! It's a great\nfilm go and see it! It's a great film go and see it! It's a great film\ngo and see it! If I fill the review up with junk words 'they' will\ndelete my account. Do you know what, I don't care. IMDb is obviously a\npompous lot and need to review themselves. It's still not long enough\nfor a review apparently so I'll keep up the twaddle in the sure\nknowledge my account will be deleted. Hooray, I'll stick to twitter.\n"
"\nI won't venture in to great detail about the film; I just really felt\ncompelled (after seeing the film half an hour ago) to express my\nheartfelt thoughts on such a beautiful and touching film. Not only did\nit bring tears to my eyes (and cheeks, and chin, and blouse!) it made\nme laugh, made me contemplate and also reflect greatly on the history\nand thought provoking truth that the film so touchingly, and truthfully\ndepicts. It was beautifully directed, fantastically acted and above\nall, this films ability to touch the hearts of all those in the theatre\nreally made it a magical experience. Not only is it a film with an\nhistorical message, it is a film with a mood; hope. I could go on, but\nI won't. All I have left to say is please go and watch this incredible\nfilm.\n"
"\nThe Help, based on the novel of the same title, deals with the rise of\nthe black help in the 60's in the overall quest for equality between\nthe races and more specifically the equality of civil liberties. The\nfilm plays out as a neat 3-acter with barely any surprises along the\nway. For a film dealing with these sorts of issues it is surprisingly\nblack and white and straightforward. The soundtrack is nothing more\nthan sugarcoating for the overly pretty sceneries and often annoys.\nSome roughness to the film seems sorely lacking, it almost plays out\nlike a cartoon. Fans of the film should also want to check out the 2007\nfilm 'The Great Debaters' (Denzel Washington, Forrest Whitaker) with a\ncomparable premise which suffers from the same, in my opinion,\nweaknesses.<br><br>6/10\n"
"\nI wanted to see this film earlier,but the length of it made me postpone\nit.I was wrong.It was so good.It shows how black people are treated by\nthe white and it is so sincere.I wish people weren't so\nracists.Although we live in the 21st century,nothing has changed since\nthe ages of caves.Women,black people and weak people are treated really\nbad.I liked that the author was white but in reality no white would\nlose his/her friends to defend black people.I liked the cake Bryce\nDallas Howard ate.It was so funny.Unfortunately,injustice will always\nprevail.\n"
"\nThe Help is an incredibly beautiful film that focuses on the racial\ninjustice of the 60s. The good characters are very likable and the\naudience can empathize with them very easily as they can connect with\nthe story's emotional impacts. The overall film is one that I cry at\nevery time I watch it. I would definitely recommend this film that has\nOscar-worthy acting.\n"
"\nThis movie was fantastic! It was so critical of the 1960s while\nremaining funny and entertaining. The relationship between Eugenia,\nMinny, and Aibileen is so heartwarming and beautiful. They lived in a\ntime that discriminated against blacks and women. To be women who took\na stand against the injustice they saw and expressed is an example to\nall. I loved the movie and it's message and will be watching it again.\n"
"\nAn Movie that told a Story about black women who stood up for\nthemselves. I think the team shows on a good and impressive way how the\nblack people make true, even in the 60's and in some places even now.\nThe choice for the actors was a good choice. It look like they live in\nthat time en they came of the screen with a lot of confidence. They\ngive you a good feeling so you understand where the movie is about.\nEven with a bit of humor.\n"
"\nThis was so wonderful showing both side black and white, I couldn't\nstop crying. Viola is my hero and love all her work. She takes you with\nher in whatever part she plays. The whole cast was awesome. I couldn't\nbelieve there are people still living like this. I would recommend this\nmovie to see.\n"
"\nThis was a brilliant film about life in the segregated 1960s America. A\nlady in Mississippi named Skeeter decided to write a book about the\n\"Help\" given by black servants, and, boy, does she get enough help! The\nmovie is dedicated to her character, the black ladies in the film, and\nall the perspective she gains from them while writing it. She also\ninteracts well from the other people in it.<br><br>This has an an impressive cast with Emma Stone, Jessica Chastain, Viola\nDavis, and others. I loved the final scene and the s*** pie scene. This\nis a must-view for anyone and very realistic. I loved it and so will\nyou.<br><br>*** 1/2 out of ****\n"
"\nA very well developed story. It is definitely bound to move you and it\nputs across beautiful messages that defy any racist stereotype about\ncolored people. I recommend it to anyone who is fond of social movies\nand want a happy, funny and cozy film with tremendous meaning behind it\nthough.\n"
"\n« The Help » is a drama film by Tate Taylor. The movie takes place in\nJackson, Mississippi during 1960', during segregation. It was on screen\nin 2011, it last 146 min.<br><br>Skeeter an aspiring writer wants to write a book to denounce\nsegregation and the life of \"the helps\". She will be helped by Aibeleen\nand Minny.

Hilly who is agree with the segregation will fight\nagainst Skeeter's project.<br><br>I think that this movie is very interesting. Despite an annoying\nsoundtrack which dragged on too much, the storyline is believable and\ndeep, with funny moments. The acting is amazing and the actresses are\nvery convincing. In my opinion it's an entertaining movie and I advise\nyou to go watch that movie.\n"
"\nThe world is a combination of species that do not necessarily need to\nbe mixed, but if you need to create together, the framework that gives\nyou that magical texture to today. The history of Mankind is perfectly\nprepared, personalized, in fact every crazy thought and benevolent, but\nthat mixture of thought, is where the new born and most beautiful human\nbehavior. Each story is a time of learning, a time where many people\nwas the sacrifice for us to learn a lesson, how sad is when some forget\nwhen some break the chain of knowledge that has cost both to mankind.\nThanks \"The Help\" We can still remember the lessons learned and help\nthose even after so long not been able to learn from our past, that we\nare all part of the great network called humanity.\n"
"\nI found this movie sad. It depicted the way colored people were treated\nand they were treated as sub-human. Those parts of this film made me\nangry actually. I did really like the revenge parts of what the one\nmaid did to her employer... Without adding spoilers to this, the other\nrevenges which took place...It was a very good film actually and with\nvery good acting...I was very much moved by the film and at times\nalmost to tears with some parts...Octavia Spencer and Viola Davis were\nawesome in the film...I would recommend this movie to be watched..It\ndoes tell the true way of how colored people were badly treated and\nregarded as slaves to racist white people.\n"
"\nLucky #13 for 2011 !! This little film came in right after a dozen\nblockbuster movies for year's best grossing films. Any guesses as to\nwhy.. every talent and casting agent will readily tell you. Guaranteed\nwithout one name attached, it does not come anywhere near as close (and\nher part in this production is limited). There's only a small number of\nnames that incite you to search out what other work they would have\ndone.. she is one. As for this film, she brought the audience to the\ntable, and it is a very worthwhile experience for those who might not\nhave gone there without her participation. The number of individuals\nlabeling themselves 'actor' is huge... but those who are truly\ntalented, in addition to being a full-fledged 'movie-star'... now\nthat's a minuscule number.\n"
"\nA film with a sensational idea and a good direction. His two and a half\nhours pass extremely fast, the film holds and excites you to see the\nwhole course of history and consequently the end. <br><br>I would say that he sins in places, such as at Skeeter's relationship\nwith Stuart, as well as other things that should not be counted. Common\nsins in large parts of the movies and that at no time compromises the\nfilm. <br><br>The performances are very good, especially Emma Stone, Viola Davis,\nBryce Dallas and Jessica Chastain, doing striking scenes. The Help is\nvery clever, funny, and yet, extremely critical and sensitizing. <br><br>Worth watching and reflect!\n"
"\nIf you're looking for an informative Civil Rights movie, this probably\nisn't for you. Although the movie does give its viewers a good idea of\nsome civil rights issues during the 60s, I think that the dramatization\ntakes away from the history of the era. It's more of a drama about\nrelationships, than a historical film. The movie revolves around\nSkeeter, a white journalist, searching for black maids who are willing\nto share their stories with her. I thought it was interesting to learn\nabout the crucial role that the maids played in the families that they\nworked for. They practically raised the children, and yet they were\ntreated horribly and received very little pay. Despite my interest in\nthe maids' stories, the \"white savior\" aspect of the movie bothered me.\nSkeeter rescued the maids, and in the end she advanced in her career as\na journalist when she earned her dream job. Although it is powerful and\ninteresting, I think that the movie is a bad representation of\nimportant history.\n"
"\nThis was a wonderful and moving film. Throughout the duration of the\nmovie, I laughed, I cried, I clapped, I cringed with discomfort and\nsquirmed with anticipation. The range of emotions I experienced can be\ncredited to not only the excellence of the story writing but the\nquality of the acting and the personality of the actors chosen to\nportray each role. I especially appreciated that the focus was to\ndevelop the characters of the maids as opposed to the white ladies that\nthey worked for. This allows for a consistency between the main\ncharacter's goal to write from the Negro perspective and the goal of\nthe film itself. Unfortunately, it seems that some critics think that\nthis film and storyline are not realistic. It has been criticized for\nsimplifying the complex race relations and omitting the various forms\nof violence that characterize the time period.\n"
"\nThe Help is a story about black maids in Jackson, Mississippi who are\nmistreated by their white bosses. However, there is a young white\njournalist who wants to help them by writing a collection of stories of\nwhat their life is like. Originally she has a hard time getting people\nto volunteer to share their stories, because it is very risky. However\nshe manages to get lots of volunteers in the end and she published her\nbook. Fortunately for the maids, they aren't punished because their\nbosses are afraid to admit that the stories are about Jackson, because\nthere are embarrassing stories. Specifically about how one of the\nbosses ate a pie made out of her maids poop. This is a great movie for\nseeing how African Americans were mistreated in the South for so long.\nIt is ridiculous that the whites believe that they can't use the same\ntoilets as blacks because they carry certain disease, yet they allow\nthem to take care of their children.\n"
"\nI thoroughly enjoyed this movie. It's a nuanced depiction of a certain\naspect of American racial segregation (domestic 'help' provided by\nblack women to white families) on the journey into the civil rights\nmovement.<br><br>Unlike other films on this topic, this isn't a dark or unsettling\nmovie. None of the characters meet a tragic demise. The Hell is moving,\nyes and doesn't shy away from realism, but it's produced in an upbeat,\noften very funny, style.<br><br>In fact some of the scenes are laugh out loud funny. There's a\nbrilliant, pivotal moment where the disturbing practice of getting\nblack women to go outdoors when they need the toilet, is turned into a\nhilarious opportunity to humiliate a domineering white socialite.<br><br>It was also nice to see a film in which all the lead actors and the\nmain supporting actors were female. I thought they all played their\nparts perfectly, including a deserved Oscar-winning performance by\nOctavia Spencer.<br><br>This is a great little gem of a movie that really surprised me.\n"
"\nThis was a very good movie. It was interesting to see what's life was\nlike for African- Americans back then and what they had to go through.\nIt was crazy that they were treated that way and that they couldn't\neven use the same toilets because they thought it would spread disease.\nIt was cool and inspirational to see how one person could make a\ndifference just by telling other people about what it was like. It was\nalso strange to see how dangerous it was just to share their\nexperiences and how it could have very serious consequences. It was\ninspirational though that they were brave and did it anyways,\nespecially Skeeter who didn't really have anything to gain by\nchallenging the norm. Overall it was a very good movie, even though it\nwas pretty sad.\n"
"\nThought this film, there are many main ideas that bring out the reality\nof the Solid South during the times of civil rights and integration.\nAlthough the reality of the South was much worse than the movie\nportrays, I believe the movie carries out all the ideas it involves\nwith great proficiency. The Help shows an attitude of love even towards\nthose who hate and hurt those you love and even yourself. It shows a\npersevering way of life and creates an environment of hardships and\ndespair with JFK's assassination and the death of the main characters\nson, to demonstrate how awful life was, especially for African\nAmericans, in this time. Furthermore, nonviolent ways of life is shown,\nallowing the historical fact that nonviolent actions were what changed\ngenerations (ie, the actual book The Help written in the movie).\nOverall, I greatly appreciate the timeline and plot of this movie and\nfind it to be incredibly inspiring.\n"
"\nThe Help is an inspiring movie about African American discrimination\nand is based on the book by Kathryn Stockett. It goes through the lives\nof numerous people in Jackson, Mississippi. Although the transition\nfrom book to movie isn't perfect, the writers did a good job at\nincluding all the story lines and characters, showing the importance of\neach one no matter how little a role they had. A really emotional part\nwas when Aibileen had to say goodbye to Mae Mobley at the end of the\nmovie, knowing that she was the only good influence in the girl's life\nand that her mother wasn't able to take care of her the way she\ndeserved. This scene was put together well and had just as much emotion\nin it as it did in the novel. The writers did a good job at showing the\nstruggles Aibileen and Skeeter faced when trying to coordinate and get\ntogether to write the book about the poor conditions of \"The Help\" in\nwhite households. Overall, this movie is a good representation of what\nAfrican Americans had to go through in the early to mid 1900s and I\nwould recommend it to anyone.\n"
"\nThe Help, before it was turned into a movie, was a great book. Though\nit painted the conditions of the South during this era in clean, easily\ndigestible strokes, it told a great story of life in that situation.<br><br>The movie, on the other hand, was more than just a great story. It\npayed justice to the book, and then some. The actresses and actors did\na fantastic job fleshing out the characters, and giving more depth into\ntheir character development. They gave them a new life, picking up the\nfew two-dimensional characters and turning them into characters we\ncould sympathize and identify with.<br><br>My only issue is that the movie leaned on the portrayal of a \"great\nwhite savior.\" It plays on the fact that \"only the young white girl can\noffer salvation\", and also leans on some stereotypical caricatures that\nHollywood is all to fond of using. <br><br>Altogether though, it was a good story, with both comedic and tragic\nparts. I would recommend the book, though, before the movie.\n"
"\nAfter some resistance, Skeeter is able to record the testimonies of\nseveral African American women who work as \"the help\" for white,\nSouthern families. They reveal how they are treated as well as the\nsecrets of the families they work for. This film in set in the 1960's\nCivil Rights era. It is two-sided in that it shows there were white\nfamilies and people that were in favor for equal treatment of African\nAmericans. The film is able to convey messages of equality in an\nuplifting tone through use of comic relief. The scenery of Mississippi\nprovides beautiful views throughout the film. Emma Stone is a fun\ncharacter and seems really genuine with the interviewees. Viola Davis\n(who plays Abileine, a maid) is an amazing actor making the film more\nrealistic. In summary, I would recommend this film to those who are\ninterested in historical films as well as people who enjoy Emma Stone\nas an actor.\n"
"\nI and my family enjoyed watching this film. It's a delicious blend of\nlaughter and tears, hope and fear, and ended with a good message. Just\nlike everyone else, I agree that this is a great cast, many of them\ndelivering subtle and powerful performances. Although there are sad\nmoments, heartbreaking moments, there are also very funny moments too.\nYou can feel humanity resonating here and there. The story is not dark.\nThere is hope, there is a trust in the good side of people, a warm\nfeeling from friendship and humanity that comfort your heart a whisper\nthat says \"love will conquer in the end.\" The villain, Hilly, was an\nexcellent example of the pharisees and their hypocrisy.She presents\nherself as the most godly woman in the community but actually she is\nthe most godless person among them. Hilly is presented in contrast with\nCelia, who is a little crazy and unmannered, but very sincere and\nsweet. This film shows us love, hatred, patience, honesty, courage, and\nafter all...love your enemy. :)\n"
"\nIn my opinion, The Help is a nice introduction to how women were\ntreated/perceived in the 1960s, and more importantly a good way to\ninstigate a conversation about the civil's right movements with young\nkids because this movie touches these subjects without getting too deep\ninto it. It's the Disney version - meaning it's not gritty and raw -\nit's neat and clean, meant to not offend anybody but the everything is\nthere even when it's only hinted.<br><br>The movie's long, over 2h30, but it has a lot of ground to cover and\nbefore I looked it up I didn't even thought it was that long. It can\nonly mean that it is a smooth experience. I don't mean smooth as in\nit's a blend, monotonous movie because it's not, you are pulled into\nthe story and get emotionally invested without getting too riled up -\nit's Disney after all.<br><br>The source material is good but the cast really did an amazing job.\nEach and everyone of them portrayed their character, however\nstereotypical some of them might have been, brilliantly. It was simply\ngreat ensemble that director.<br><br>@wornoutspines\n"
"\nThe help is a movie about a girl who wants to be a journalist and who\nwrites a book based on the experiences of the black maids that work for\nher friends. The movie handles a difficult subject really well,\nbringing lightness to it, so that it won't get tiring for the audience,\nbut, at the same time, it doesn't robes the subject off it's importance\nand seriousness. The story follows the lives of many characters, not\nonly the main ones, but it doesn't gets confusing, as many movies with\nmore than one stories to show gets, and, as I said previously, it\ndoesn't gets tiring to watch. The performances were great and that\nhelped a lot the film to be as good, but the set and the costumes\ncontributed as well. There was only one thing I didn't like, and that\nwas the ending, because it didn't keep up with the movie and got stuck\ninto the corny happy triumph that many movies have as an ending. Other\nthan that the Help is a great movie, so 8 out of 10.\n"
"\nGreetings from Lithuania.<br><br>\"The Help\" (2011) is very well made, strongly acted motion picture\nabout things, that we usually don't see on screen. I'm not saying that\nintolerance, racism is something rare in pictures, but it's a rare\nthing to see it shown from this angle. It's not entirely gruesome or\nvillain actually, \"The Help\" is a good feel type of a picture, which\nshows the very gentle side of that part of history, the most gentle if\nyou ask me. But it worked for me, i was involved in characters, i was\nmoved couple of times and that makes this picture good.<br><br>Overall, 8/10 for \"The Help\" as i has some stellar acting (including\nOscar winning role), very good directing and i say not traditionally\ndirecting, and good script. This is definitely not a gruesome look at\nthose hard topics of our society, and therefore some are going to like\nthis movie even better. Solid picture, definitely of those must see\nmovies not entirely for a groundbreaking movie-making, but for the\nimportance of the subject.\n"
"\nI sometimes feel like Academy Award nominated films do not necessarily\nappeal to the masses. Some require a lot of thinking. Some require a\nlot of emotional commitment. <br><br>The Help is so powerful because rarely is anything written by the point\nof view from these maids who practically raised children from the 60s\nwhile their own kids were farmed out to relatives back on their side of\nthe tracks. Davis and Spencer were perfectly cast as two women with\nextremely different character traits working to fulfill the same goal.\nThey were the perfect yin and yang and it was beautiful to see their\nstrength and courage portrayed on the screen.<br><br>That said, The Help has managed to simultaneously generate Oscar buzz\nwhile appealing to demographics across the board.<br><br>Twitter @zackisthe\n"
"\nWhen I first heard about the movie and listened to people talk about\nit, I had expectations. I expected that it would move me, capture me\nand take me a place only few movies do. And it did. Through\noutstandingly performances, Viola Davis, Octavia Spencer, Bryce Dallas\nHoward, Emma Stone .. the entire cast actually, down to every single\nperson. Along these stunning performances, the story, this unbelievable\nstory is both realistic, heart-breaking, eye- opening and moving\nstories ever to be written. <br><br>It is the harsh reality of which real circumstances people have lived\nunder. It gives perspective in those peoples life, and most certainly\nin how they got treated. The fact that humankind saw and perhaps still\nsee some people as nothing, and that they wouldn't become anything...\nIt is horrifying. And this movies has an amazing message. Which entered\ndirectly in my heart. <br><br>One of the best movies I've seen, and every time people ask me for\nsuggestions of movies to watch I always say this one. And my entire\nopinion about the subject. <br><br>10 of 10 !!\n"
"\n\"The Help\" is a must see. It tells of the extremely uncomfortable to\nwatch, racist, beyond 'Jim Crows', mistreatment of all the maids in\nJackson, Mississippi. The acting is great. The picturesque setting is\nin contrast to the ugly goings on in the domestic lives in the\nhouseholds of the middle class southerners life. The good 'White Folk'\nare evil doers when it comes to matters of race, and the blacks are all\nangelic good innocent victims. I find it hard to believe that even in\nthe deep south's racist capitol of Mississippi, their wasn't a\nrighteous family to be found in Sodom... But sometimes you need to\nexaggerate to the extreme to get a point across, and Hollywood is good\nat that.\n"
"\nFrankly saying that I know nothing about racist. I'm too young and was\nnot born in a country which people hate each other just because of\ntheir races. I've heard about Martin Luther King Jr. and his speech but\nI didn't care about it...until I watched this movie due to my teacher's\nsuggestion. \"The Help\" is something that I can't imagine. We have maid\nand some of us treat their maids well but some will not and maids in my\ncountry are somehow respected because it's difficult to find a loyal\nand good maid now. Those black people, they would not turn bad if their\nmasters wouldn't treat them as a property. They are all people, we are\nall people. I just can't imagine how you can treat the others that bad!\nI cried at the end of the movie :'(\n"
"\nBy far the best movie I've ever seen in my life. I definitely recommend\nthis to everyone. The titanic didn't make me cry, the vow, or the\nnotebook. but I can honestly say this movie impacted me more than any\nother. amazing acting, amazing actors were chosen. just over all, props\nto everyone that had to do with the making of the movie. I'm not even\nan African American, and this just made me cry for a good 30 minutes.\nif you are trying to decide weather to watch this movie or another one,\nthis one is definitely the one for you :) It doesn't matter if your\nheart is sensitive or not, i guarantee you will cry. So if you don't\nwant to cry, don't watch it :) thanks for reading!\n"
"\nThe Help (2011)<br><br>Definitely a great movie about a writer telling the point of view of\nthe African-American maids who works for white people in the 1960. I\nthink the only problem with this was the begging because it was a\nlittle bit slow, but this is an excellent drama with a twist of comedy\nsometimes, is brilliant and really good, the performances are beyond\nperfection, a clever screenplay and the plot will \"touch\" your heart\n(or maybe teach you something) after seeing a little bit of what people\npass in the past just for be black but also the love others can show\neven when they don't have to. <br><br>For more info: www.facebook.com/elementarytips\n"
"\nOkay... So a lot of people lot this movie and a lot of people don't\nlike it! I for one love this movie... It's even more special to me\nbecause a lot of the movie was filmed in my town! I know just about\nevery thing/place you see! I knew a lot of people that helped in the\nmovie or had their house, car, children, etc. <br><br>This movie is based in the 60's about racial issues! It really is a\ngreat movie movie it's not just a chick-flick it is also a movie that\nhistory buffs or just the average person would love! It really does\ntell a great story! And if you still have not seen this movie you\nreally should! I know the movie has been out for a while now and I'm\njust now making a review but better late than never right?!?! Well I\nreally do recommend you see this movie! And if you really do love this\nmovie then you would probably like this the old historic small town it\nwas filmed in! It's small and not too much to do but there is the blues\ntrail that will take you all around Mississippi! So any way you would\nprobably love this movie\n"
"\nThis film is not a masterpiece by any means. The characters are very\npoorly constructed and there are clear antagonists and protagonists\nwhich follow all the clichés of Hollywood canned products. However, I\nstill though it was a good film, since:<br><br>1 - Emma Stone is hot. 2 - The acting was very good, despite the poorly\nconstructed characters. 3 - I find racism a very interesting subject.<br><br>The United States is a country which had a very interesting cultural\nphenomena: systematic racism between ethic groups. And I like movies\nthat portray this phenomena, such as this one. Even though from a\ntechnical point of view, I should have given this film a 4/10 or 5/10,\nsince it is really mediocre and I wouldn't recommend it for someone who\nharbors no interest in racism.\n"
"\nThe Help<br><br>I just finished watching this movie - - - I usually do not watch this\nkind of films. I saw trailers and all I can say is - - - - Exceptional\nfilm making. <br><br>Casting was perfect, Emma Stone delivers. It was pure pleasure to watch\nher in this movie. Not to mention all the other of the cast. <br><br>The characters were well written, and you really feel for them. Script\nitself was also very good. The whole movie shows a glimpse in to the\nworld we regular mortals do not know. <br><br>I recommend this movie to everyone who like this genre - - - or not. In\nany case it is well made for people of all tastes - - - - One more\nthing about Emma Stone - - - <br><br>I think that she is underrated actress, and she showed here, that she\nis mature enough to deliver in tough roles. I am looking forward seeing\nher future projects. There are too many so called actors who really\nsuck royally - - - One example was that expressionless Kristen Stewart\n. . . <br><br>All in all I give it 10 / 10\n"
"\nIt is very rare that I come across a movie that I cannot stop thinking\nabout afterwards; and it is very rare that something that received\nindustry awards was not some pretentious nonsense. However, this movie\nis actually fantastic. It made me laugh, it made me cry and it made me\nshake my head in disgust that human beings were ever treated in this\nmanner. The film had a strong political and social message throughout\nwithout actually making it intrusive. Instead, the excellent\ncharacterisation engages to the extent that you almost miss them when\nthe end credits finish. You care what happens to these women. This\nshows racism for exactly what it is: completely ridiculous, cruel and\ndisgusting. If you cannot see humanity in others, you lack it in\nyourself. I would recommend this movie as a must see.\n"
"\nThis is a really good movie. It has a funny, entertaining plot. Emma\nStone, plays Skeeter, a privileged white girl that attends all the\nfunctions and is popular with all the other girls in town. She wants to\nbe a writer and comes up with an idea to write a book with tales from\nthe town's maids. The story takes place in Mississippi at a time when\nit was illegal to even think about civil rights. So, Skeeter meets the\nmaids in secret.<br><br>So, the book is about the stories and how Skeeter is ostracized for not\nbeing as racist as most people in town. It's just original.<br><br>FINAL VERDICT: A must see\n"
"\nA captivating story about an ambitious young white female writer in\n1960's Mississippi, who decides to compile the trials and tribulations\nof the African-American maids working in her hometown, into a book. Set\nduring the volatile Civil Rights Movement, the film mingles a fictional\nnarrative within actual historical events. The film is charged with\npersonal, societal and racial conflicts adding several layers to its\nplot. The dialogue is rich with Southern dialects and colloquialisms.\nThe assortment of diverse characters makes the film interesting and the\ninteractions between them add substance to the story. Furthermore the\nexceptional performances by the ensemble cast and the commendable\ndirection makes this an absorbing and heartfelt film.\n"
"\nI'll keep this short. Having read the book and loved it I was very much\nlooking forward to watching this film. I have to say I was\ndisappointed. <br><br>The book goes into much more detail than the film (as books always do).\nThe film doesn't go into the depth of friendship between Skeeter and\nAibeleen in the way the book does. As a film regardless of the book it\nis alright and worth watching. Emma Stone does a good job as Skeeter\nbut the Hilly character is all wrong. She just isn't evil enough. Minny\nand Aibeleen are also well cast.<br><br>Basically it's worth a watch if you haven't read the book, if you have\nit's not worth it.\n"
"\nBefore I watched this movie, I would have said Emma Stone, who? What a\ngreat performance. A sublime performance from Viola Davis. I could\nmention the majority of the cast. I will have to mention Sissy Spacek;\nas a child I loved her performances, with this film there was no need\nfor rose tinted spectacles.<br><br>I joined this site to write about probably the worst film that I had\nseen.<br><br>Now I write about an excellent film. It's great to see a film without\nmale leads that's not a chick flick it's just about being somebody. It\nhad me in the film very quickly and didn't let me go until the credits\nrolled.<br><br>The casting was superb and the pace of the film was spot on.<br><br>Just watch this movie and enjoy the acting, the scenes and the carnage\nthat unravels. I will tell you all if you are unsure to read the review\nfrom deborahjwood. It's a great summary.\n"
"\nThe Help is more than just the civil rights struggle in the early\n1960s. By focusing on a small community but giving us both breadth and\ndepth it covers a lot of territory. We get to see how it is possible\nfor one human to believe it's OK to treat another just because they\ncan, or worse, believe they should.<br><br>This is a strong well-made ensemble film, particularly notable for\nstrong, well drawn female characterizations - if fact there are almost\nno male roles here to speak of, but it resolutely not a \"chick flick\" -\nthis is a good drama with purpose, insight, humor, and shock.<br><br>All in all this is one of the more rounded dramas of the year and is\ndefinitely worth your time - the acting is superb from all involved and\nmake it a rewarding watch.\n"
"\nMy husband and i both just finished watching and loved this movie. The\nacting and the filming are SUPERB! And by no means just a chick flick.\nFilled with surprises and emotion that rivet the soul. I grew up in the\ndeep south during this time period and i know what the \"race\" struggle\nwas like. But this movie is not just about \"race\". A lot has to do with\nupper class house wives. I am white and always knew that African\nAmericans were given a raw deal. This movie will shock you,make you sad\nand warm your heart in a wonderful way.It is a lengthy film but it\nflies by because you just don't want it to end. Loved every minute of\nit! The props and costumes for this era were spot on! You will enjoy\nthis immensely,no matter your age! I would watch this movie AGAIN. It\nhas so much substance and emotion with a climax that will leave you\ncheering! One Academy award was not enough for this movie!\n"
"\nBeautiful, inspiring and heart-wrenching!<br><br>The movie, based on the controversial best-selling novel by Kathryn\nStockett, is enjoyable and heart-warming at the same time. The story\nshows how in the 60's, even though slavery wasn't there, \"coloured\"\npeople didn't have much freedom, opportunities, etc. and how so much\ndiscrimination still existed.<br><br>The screenplay could have been a little tighter and challenging, and\nthe characters could have had a little more depth. But, all those\nshortcomings are overcome by the powerful acting and the interesting\nprotagonists &amp; antagonists. I don't want to point out any one\nparticular actor's performance. The casting is just perfect and\ncouldn't have been better.<br><br>The last words Aibileen tells Hilly in the last scene of the movie,\n\"You a Godless woman! Ain't you tired, Miss Hilly? Ain't you tired?\"\nhad the impact and feel the climax needed.<br><br>A Must-watch!\n"
"\nThis movie, it is one of these movies that go deeper and deeper into\nthe subject. The whole movie is a big drama, welded with a real touch\nof class, from the director to the actors and actresses. There is\nsomething wrong about some actresses. I could say 50% of the white\nwomen of the movie, over act, kicking all the hard work that the rest\nof the cast has done to do this master piece. It is a long movie, but\nyou never get bored, because talks about the real life all the time.\nYou will not find cheap violence, in fact you will not find any violent\nscene at all, something that it is almost impossible in US films these\ndays. Remember; to me this is one of the top 3 movies of 2011.\n"
"\nThe Help is a story about a young woman who goes to Jackson,\nMississippi. She goes in search of a job, especially journalism. When\nshe arrives she meets her childhood friend, who is a complete utter\nracist. But she then shows sympathy to the black maids known as the\nhelp and has an idea to write a novella about the p.o.v of the help.\nBut her meticulous friend has other plans.<br><br>Now, this movie is show stopping, the acting by Viola Davis and Octavia\nSpencer is FLAWLESS. With Oscar buzzing all over the place for this\nmovie, I wanted to know why? So I went to see this movie with high\nexpectations from all of it's five Oscar nominations and I found it to\nbe a wonderful, beautiful account about racism and chance and most of\nall revenge for nothing. I hope this movie will come along the lines of\nsuch classics like Forrest Gump.<br><br>This movie is a \"thematic\" movie. Although this movie is not perfect,\nit is still a great movie 4 1/2 movie reels from me. I hope you like my\nreview. Thatmoviecritic101.\n"
"\nThis is an amazing film which is so moving and makes you feel that the\nstory is true and not fake.<br><br>When you don't think people could be that mean you start to feel hatred\ntowards them and would not want to back down from the horrors you might\nface for answering back.<br><br>This film will move you so much you would want to tell people how you\nfeel about the story line and how it expresses your emotions to a level\nyou have not seen before yourself.<br><br>The film shows you that there is no wrong or right to what people\nbelieve in but everyone has their own views on life whether racism is\nright or wrong depending on how it is expressed and shown as.<br><br>I believe this film would change many people's perspective on life and\ntry to imagine people in more difficult position than themselves and\nrealise that their own life is not that bad and concentrate on others\nlives that are not so brilliant.<br><br>This film might be long but is an amazing film which you need to watch\nas it focuses on the helps side rather than the bosses side.\n"
"\nThis film has a very good blend of warm and cold, dramatic and heart\nfelt scenes. It's a classic story of bad versus good, and progress of\nhumankind, therefore I don't think its right to emphasize this whole\nracial issue just alone. It's kind of like with Schindlers list, which\nis a Disney version of the holocaust. Never the less, the feeling when\nleaving the theater, teary eyed, it's worth going to see it, and\nrealize \"the help\" existed back than. Very well made and amazing\nperformances, but perhaps too much of a \"film\" to relate to history and\nits discussions that follow and which you can read in other reviews.\nJust enjoy it for what it makes you feel. Human.\n"
"\n\"The help\" is movie about emotions,in fact it's an emotional roller\ncoaster ride.It's a movie about courage or rather discovering the\ncourage hidden inside one's self.It's about doing what's right no\nmatter what circumstances you are in.I really felt motivated after\nwatching the movie.<br><br>Emma stone is great as a budding journalist,so is Viola and\nOctavia.Octavia's role as Minny is really worth watching.I am a big fan\nof Emma Stone;it may be her good acting skills which make me like her\nor it's just her big big blue eyes. <br><br>I rated this movie a 8/10,b'cause it was successful in delivering the\nmessage for which i think it was made.I don't wanna sound gay but it\nmade me cry a few times.So go ahead and see for your self.Trust me you\nwon't be disappointed*.<br><br>*Conditions Apply.\n"
"\nTHE HELP works. And it works because of a rally good script by Tate\nTaylor, based on an incredible novel by Kathryn Stockett. It works\nbecause director, Tate Taylor skillfully and effectively was able to\ntranslate a novel, loved by many, on to the screen. No easy task.<br><br>Most of all The Help works because of the tight knot ensemble cast.\nEach worthy of a mention - Emma Stone, Viola Davis, Bryce Dallas\nHoward, Allison Janney, Anna Camp, Eleanor Henry, Emma Henry, Cicely\nTyson, Mike Vogel, Sissy Spacek, Brian Kerwin, Octavia Spencer, Jessica\nChastain, Ahna O'Reilly, Chris Lowell. They all delivered real and\nhonest performances. <br><br>The music by Thomas Newman , who has done very fine work in the past,\nmost notably in The Debt, was perfect for this type of relationship\nbased material.\n"
"\nI'm a male 17 years.<br><br>It's funny, I never really liked dramas, I was with friends on Skype as\nusual and I thought why don't I get a movie I saw allot of commercials\nand heard allot about it.<br><br>I started the film, and without even knowing what its about I started\nwatching, I noticed in the first 10 minutes it was about the difference\nin skin color and how it was in the past years. The movie is just so\nbeautiful and I to be honest cried several times.<br><br>I never thought such a movie could bring me such emotions, also I never\nread saw or anything about the difference in skin color I knew it was\nawful but after seeing this I looked at it at the different angle. It's\njust so sad.<br><br>This isn't just a movie, you watch cry on and say it was beautiful this\nis a movie you learn from, and for me I could say I learned allot of\nthis. I hope everyone will watch it and I'd rate it 11/10 I have really\nno words for this.<br><br>I loved it ;)\n"
"\nThe Help is an inspiring and hilarious journey of racial tension in the\ndeep South. This movie shows both sides of the racial segregation in\nthe 1960s. It shows the hardships of the African-American maids and how\nthey coped with their situations. Likewise the movie also showed the\nCaucasians' moral dilemma as they were faced with either siding with\nthe truth that ingratiation is the answer or continuing with the old\nways of segregation. While racial tension plays a major role in The\nHelp, it contains comic relief to alleviate the harsh tone of the\nmessage communicated by the movie, but also maintaining the message's\nintegrity.\n"
"\nGreat movie. Painful situations that hopefully in this day and age are\ncorrected. I wish some caucasian people would have to be maids to\nAfrican Americans. There should be a movie about that. You will note\nthat I write in the manner of the late Andy Rooney; dry humor and\nirony.<br><br>The two actresses who portrayed the main maids looked wonderful at the\nGolden Globes. I cannot remember their names, but they are excellent.\nThey were both up for awards, I think, and one of them won. They looked\nso wonderful as their real selves, all glamorous and youthful.<br><br>Some of this movie reminded me of Driving Miss Daisy and Fried Green\nTomatoes. There was a Southern feel to the movie and portrayals. If\nthey say tomatoes are in the pie, watch out for the real ingredients.\nIf you have recently committed some sins toward someone, you will get\npaid back big time.<br><br>10/10\n"
"\nThis movie was the buzz of the summer last year (2011) and a dozen\npeople told me I \"had to see it\". I never got the chance to catch it in\ntheaters but when the Blu Ray came out in February I snatched it up and\nwatched it. I was captivated from the beginning to the end. One of the\nbest ensemble casts ever assembled and Viola Davis and Octavia Spencer\nboth deserve Oscars, as does Emma Stone who brought tears to my eyes\nwhen she found out what really happened to her childhood maid\nConstantine Jefferson, played by Cicely Tyson. This film has\neverything, tremendous acting, a great script, drama, heartbreak and\nsome of the funniest moments on film. Best Picture of 2011!\n"
"\nThis movie is the break though film of the year. Set during the Civil\nRights movement, the story follows two African American maids and an\naspiring writer as the try to make a Change by documenting the lives of\nthe minority race and their place in a white run society. At this time,\nthis movie has won 4 major awards ( one at the Golden Globes, three at\nthe SAGs), all which are well deserved. Octavia was fantastic as the\nCaring,but domineering, Minnie, and Viola Davis lead the the movie with\na role so convincing, it completed the atmosphere. Actually, the entire\ncast deserves recognition for their great work. Defiantly a movie worth\nwatching, as Spencer is as funny as she is serious. Wishing the cast\nand crew luck at the Oscars, even though, with a movie such as this,\nthey need to luck, they've got it in the bag.\n"
"\nThe Help is a great movie to see that I would definitely recommend to\nanyone! It was written and directed by Tate Taylor. The Help is an\nentertaining, funny, touching, and moving film that keeps your\nattention the whole way through. It opens up our minds and takes us\nback to that time period of the Civil Rights Movement. The movie takes\nplace in the South where the whites are upper class. The actors did a\nphenomenal job with portraying their characters. One of the main\ncharacters played by Viola Davis is a \"maid\" to a white family. But as\nthe movie goes along a viewer soon realizes that the term \"maid\"\nbecomes irrelevant. The maids are more like nannies than anything else.\nNot only do they cook and clean, but they also raise the children in\nthese families like they are one of their own. I definitely recommend\nit to anyone, the whole production team produced a great film and you\nreally felt as if you were taken back to that time period.\n"
"\nI read the book first, which I loved. I usually think books are better\nthan the movie version but that wasn't the case here - I thought the\nmovie was equally good. <br><br>The story and power of the human spirit is very moving and inspiring.\nThis movie was sad, uplifting, funny, heart warming, and dramatic all\nat once...I thought that made for a very powerful movie.<br><br>There is superb acting in this movie so it draws you into each and\nevery character. You won't be able to decide which actor is best. This\nis a movie I've watched multiple times and each time I love it even\nmore than the last.\n"
"\nAnother film based on a novel. This story, written by Kathryn Stockett,\ntakes place in the '60s era and touches the delicate matter of racism.<br><br>The place, is Mississippi. The matter, is the other side of the coin.\nThe Help, needs to express and have its voice heard. Emma Stone\n(Skeeter), in search of her dream in being a writer, gives the chance\nto plenty African-American maids to introduce their view and tough\nexperiences they have to deal every day.<br><br>It's a really emotional film and you can feel the nerve-braking that a\nlot of people had to go through on both sides of the \"game\". Viola\nDavis (Aibileen Clark) does a truly magnificent work, so is Octavia\nSpencer (Minnie Jackson).<br><br>The photography is bright and the locations beautiful. Even though the\ncharacters are going through some hard times, it keeps reminding you\nthe beauty of colors and their uniqueness. The music lineup is equally\nworthy, featuring artists such as Bo Diddley, Ray Charles, The Orlons,\nWebb, Pierce, Four Seasons and others.<br><br>Sweet story, with a humanitarian-historical importance.\n"
"\nTitle says it all. 2011 started out just so so with films and in my\nopinion saved the best for last! Way to go!<br><br>The book was fantastic. Could not put it down for a minute let alone\neven a second.<br><br>Found myself instantly hooked, even took a bath with it. I love the\ndisgusting humor of the chocolate pie! Brought tears to my eyes\nlaughing so doggone hard almost wet myself. This movie has it all, many\ndifferent kinds of love, trust, hate, gossip and revenge = \"The Perfect\nFilm\" I highly recommend it to any and all ages both men and women.\nSchools may want to look into it for book report material as it does\ncontain some timeline of actual events.\n"
"\nSet back in the early 60s, the story evolves around several young\nwomen, who have grown together in a rich neighborhood, but have chosen\ndifferent paths in life; and their \"help\"  black housemaids, who are\nthe heart and soul of their misuses peaceful households, but on the\nother hand are treated as inmate objects. It is a great mix of history\nof social change, touching family moments and thoughts on one's value.\nThis is a story about parents and how they often fail to be the right\nrole models for their kids. This is a story of great female solidarity,\novercoming time boundaries and skin colour. This is a story of a young\nwhite woman and an elderly black lady, both overcoming the stereotypes\nand limits imposed on them by the society. <br><br>And gosh, all those old school outfits/hair/cars/posters looked so\nawesome.\n"
"\nTHE HELP was much better than I expected. The acting is what makes this\nfilm so touching and believable. Would have loved to have seen more\nscenes and more about Constatine. This period piece really looks the\nperiod. Early 60's. Kudos to the art direction. While all the ladies do\nan outstanding job with their roles, it's Jessica Chastain as a Marilyn\nMonroe ditz character who really shines. See her in THE DEBT and then\nthis. You'd never know it's the same actress. The New Meryl Streep. For\nall those who compare this and all movies based on novels: This is a\nmovie...NOT THE BOOK. Any movie adapted from a book is just a condensed\nReaders Digest version of said title. No way can any movie include\neverything that the book entails. Take PEYTON PLACE. The movie is much\nbetter than the book even with many characters and actions left out.\n"
"\nWhen I first saw the trailer for this movie I was hooked but before I\nWanted to see the movie I read the book which is a good read. And I saw\nthe film and wasn't disappointed and it's pretty close to the book. The\nacting in this film is excellent Octavia Spencer, Viola Davis Emma\nStone, Jessica Chastain, Bryce Dallas Howard, Allison Janney and Sissy\nSpacek all deserve a Big awards for this film and personally Spencer\nand Davis deserve their Oscar and Golden globes for their performances.\nIn the end this film made me laugh at some parts and almost cry and and\nalso had some serious issues. It's one of the Best Films of 2011!! See\nit!\n"
"\nEmma Stone and Viola Davis both deliver great performances (as well as\nthe rest of the cast). The story is well crafted and the characters all\nfeel authentic -- even the racist antagonists feel genuine -- and they\ncould easily be caricatures.<br><br>Jessica Chastain is really special in this movie. I'd seen her in Take\nShelter, and she is such a different character in this movie. She\nreally does have fantastic range and she creates a memorable character.\nKudos to her.<br><br>The movie is slick and well shot. And there was a nice balance -- all\nthe white people weren't \"bad\" . . . and all the black people weren't\n\"good.\" There was obviously a lot of attention to detail -- and in a\nstory like this it'd be easy to fall into clichés and melodramatic\nmoments -- kudos to the writer/director for mitigating much of this.\n"
"\nhi my name is Emily and i am 13 years old i love in rode Island i just\nwatched \"The Help\" on demand and i loved it i cried a lot it was very\ninspiring. The help is a very good educational movie too. i rated this\nmovie a 10 out of 10 because i thought it was very good i never fell\nasleep during it i never got bored i loved watching every minute and\nevery second of it. i recommend this movie to ages 13-70. my library is\ngetting the book \"The Help\" next week i can not wait because i want to\nread it. So go see \"The Help\" on demand MY NEW FAVORITE MOVIe<br><br>BASICALLY THE STORY IS ABOUT MAODS THAT GET TREATED VERY BAD BY WHITE\nOWNERS AND A GIRL WRITES A BOOK ON THEM AND HELPS THEM JUST GO SEE It\n"
"\nSPOILERS<br><br>I have no doubt that this is one of the best movies ever made. The only\nregret I have is not reading the book before I watched the movie. I re-\nwatched this masterpiece so many times I can't even count. It's an\nauthentic way to show the audience the suffer afro-American women had\nin the past. The story as so relate-able, touching and the characters\nare full of soul. The story of Minny and Celia has leaved me in such a\nemotional rage. I loved the dynamic between those two characters that\nare so different. The performance of Jessica Chastain and Octavia\nSpencer were flawless. The end scene were Celia made the dinner for\nMinny telling her she will always have a home and place to work was so\ntouching. Or the scene were Celia told Minny about her miscarriage.\n"
"\nThe Help was brilliant and fantastic. The nominations and awards for\nthis movie and its cast are well deserved.<br><br>I hate that a movie like this should or could be made. I watch in\ncomplete shock that a world like this could even exist...such idiocy\nand hatred. And yet, I have seen many movies similar to this before,\nand that doesn't diminish The Help's storyline or cast in anyway.<br><br>As previously stated, the cast of The Help was wonderful in executing\nthe storyline. The movie was written exceptionally with a fantastic\nstoryline/plot. The movie kept me highly interested. Overall, a ugly\nand beautiful tale worth watching!\n"
"\nI like the cinematography, beautiful visuals and nice movie poster. I\nalso applaud Director Tate Taylor for having the courage to make a\nmovie about such a topic, but this movie is not drama but pure Sci-Fi\nand comedy.<br><br>BUT, for a topic such complex and dark of the American history, it\nshould be treated with more care. Also, this movie is all over the\nplace.<br><br>There is something that one of the maid does in this movie that at time\nor today wouldn't be possible to do without going to jail no matter\nyour race.<br><br>Viola Davis is a terrific actress, but you don't get to see that in\nthis movie, better watch her in Law Abiding Citizen. Octavia Spencer\nget's to do a terrific job though.<br><br>This movie is highly overrated, lacks depth and is just a joke and is\ndisrespectful to movies like Driving miss Daisy and The Color Purple.<br><br>Acting: 7/10 Story: 5/10 Directing: 7/10 Visuals: 8/10<br><br>Overall: 7\n"
"\nHaving heard the good reviews coming from this movie, I knew it was a\nmovie to watch. I had no expectations for this movie. I thought it was\ngoing to be just a typical racism movie. But no, it was so much more.\nWith tremendous performances from Viola Davis and Emma Stone, it\nbrought tears just hearing the words they say. The acts of selfishness\nfrom the main antagonist Hilly is quite harsh. It made me think that if\nit were me, I would fight right back. But this movie is not just very\ndramatic. It had very funny moments where a maid bakes a pie for Hilly\nand says that it is her feces although it isn't. The help is an example\nof what we don't realize. We don't realize what goes on in our real\nlives. We don't see that people are getting abused behind our backs. <br><br>But what the help really is trying to tell us is that with certain\nhelp, the unheard voices are heard. The help ,which is found through\nSkeeter(Stone), gives the maids a chance to be heard. To be\nappreciated. We need to respect everything. It may be hard but with the\nright help, anything is possible.\n"
"\nThe performances are brilliant. This is a great credit to the director,\nwho let the actresses, work.<br><br>So let's get this out of the way. Viola Davis should be given every\naward on the planet, and others should be invented and given to her. As\ntrue a performance as I have seen in a long, long time. <br><br>Octavia Spencer. Same. Stellar performance. Hand these two ladies every\npossible award and recognition right now. They are that good. No,\nbetter than that good.<br><br>Cicely Tyson. Transcendent. It is one of those moments where every\nsecond she is on screen, you cannot take your eyes off of her.<br><br>The story. As well written as you are going to get. Ever.<br><br>Emma Stone. She brought her A game. She had no choice... to keep up\nwith the other ladies who delivered stellar performances. <br><br>The physicality that Ms. Davis, Ms. Spencer and Ms. Tyson brought to\ntheir characters is masterful. <br><br>Direction. It is excellent when we are able to experience this level of\ntalent. Give the director whatever he wants. Top shelf.<br><br>Overall, a superb film.\n"
"\nlet me start with telling how much i enjoyed the book, it was funny,\ninformative, and touching. Just like the movie. Tate Taylor did a very\ngood job in both directing and the screenplay. Emma Stone was a good\nchoice, and of course the Oscar nominated Voila Davis did a spectacular\njob. Davis is a great actress, no one could argue with that. To my\nsurprise, Jessica Chastain and Octavia Spencer performed amazingly.\nChastain really showed us in this movie that she is versatile, she was\nable to make us sympathize with her as a vulnerable wife in \"The Tree\nof Life\" opposite Brad Pit, in this movie she showed us she can also\nplay the sexy, southern, naive wife. Also, to my surprise, Spencer\nshocked me that she can combine both good acting and being funny, it\nwill be after this movie that Octavia Spencer will be in movies that\ncould show us more of her talent. Watch out for the Oscars, some of the\nladies in this movie \"may\" be competing against each other at Academy\nAwards in 2012.\n"
"\nI loved it! i had just recently read the book not knowing it was going\nto come out as a movie and at first didn't think they would be able to\npull off the emotion that the book creates but I was wrong. The actors\nwere amazing especially Emma Stone this was definitely her best\nperformance yet. <br><br>in my opinion the movie was just as good as the book which doesn't\nhappen very often. Emma Stone is not the only good actress in this\nthough all the actors added to the films including Bryce Dallas Howard\nwho portrayed 'hilly' amazingly. <br><br>By the end of the movie I was in tears it is such a powerful movie that\nreally makes you think about how different things were in the 60s. <br><br>This movie inspired me definitely a must see!\n"
"\nThis cast was first off, awesome, and I was just pleasantly surprised\nthat it was as good as it was. I must find the book and read it!!! Talk\nabout courage and friendship, what an understatement. I couldn't\nimagine living back when people had such small minds but that's how it\nwas. This movie was touching and very real, with a no hold back on\nfeelings and the actors portraying them. Back to Bryce was amazingly\ncunning and bitchy while Emma was the sweetest but stood her ground!\nSissy was hilarious in her small role that had a massive impact. Viola\nDavis drew me in and took me along for her ride of heartbreak and\ntriumph. Oooohh don't forget Octavia Spencer, she was AMAZING! What a\ngreat story to show how the world has changed and continues to do so!\n"
"\nWent to this movie at the request of my wife, and am not sorry I did. I\nrecommend it to anyone. One of the best movies that addresses racism\nrealistically - You know, not everyone was evil while some were\n\"evil\"... much like the real world. The movie, was for the most part\nnon- confrontational while accurately demonstrating a dark time in\nhistory... and shining the light on a person or group can make a\ndifference and pride in ones self isn't a bad thing. The movie is well\nover two hours but keeps your interest the whole way... The movie takes\nyou through several emotions and is very entertaining. GO see this\nmovie!\n"
"\nI really wanted to love the movie as much as I loved the book.\nUnfortunately, the movie fell short of the book by quite a bit. While I\ndid enjoy watching it, I found that some of the story lines as well as\nthe depth of some of the characters, especially Elizabeth Lefolt,\nsuffered from the necessity of shortening the story to fit it into a 2\nhour and 17 minutes movie. The acting of all main characters was solid,\nwith my favorites being Minnie Aibeleen and Mrs. Walters. It is an\nentertaining movie to watch, but it does not measure up to the book.\nWhat made the movie fun to watch that one cannot experience reading the\nbook was the soundtrack and the gorgeous cars.\n"
"\nI had high expectations before seeing the film. I had just read the\nbook and liked it a lot, one of the best I read in 2011.<br><br>So, therefore the movie made me disappointed. The film taking several\nshortcuts and simplifying the story too much. The perspective of the\nbook (Skeeter's) was changed to be the perspective of the maids, mainly\nAibileen and Minny. I felt Skeeter was reduced to a bi-stander and not\nthe driver of collecting the interviews and writing the book as in the\noriginal text. Take the story of Skeeter and Stuart. It had been cut\ndown so it did not make any sense why he was so gloomy, drinking to\nmuch.<br><br>I urge you all, movie audience and the film makers, to read the book!\n"
"\nI wanted this movie to be good but I was disappointed at how we saw\nmore about the white families than about the maids and their families.\nIf the filmmakers wanted to be an historically accurate think-piece,\nthey really should not have made the trailers make the movie seem like\na comedy. If they wanted it to be a comedy, they shouldn't have\nincluded some of the more vicious racial elements. It ended up being a\nmovie that made you laugh at parts and really made you squirm in your\nseat at other parts but left you feeling like you were robbed of\nsomething that could have been really great. <br><br>All that being said, however, it was a pretty good main-stream movie\ntouching on the subject of household help and the racial tensions\ninvolved in the nascent Civil Rights era of the 50s and 60s that I\nhaven't seen before. It was interesting to see how these women so\nbonded with their employer's children and how the children saw their\nmaids as their second (or even \"real\") mothers.<br><br>Basically, it was a good movie but don't expect to learn much from it.\n"
