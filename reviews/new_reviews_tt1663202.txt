i cannot believe how many people think this is a good movie
watching a guy struggle to survive for 2 hours
come on people
i know there are not many good movies being made but my word
so many things are unbelievable
the bear attack carrying a near dead guy out of the wilderness up a mountain
going over a cliff on a horse and not getting hurt
spending long periods of time in freezing cold water
surviving extreme cold overnight inside a dead horse
my god the list is endless
and for leos so called acting dont get me started
a lot of crawling and moaning and groaning
the whole thing was a letdown and really a waste of time
also tell the director to back the camera up a bit on those facial closeups
they were also ridiculous
trust me save your money and go see the hateful eight
utter utter utter utter waste of 2
5 hours of my life
one of the most boring films ive seen
unintelligible dialogue and no real story
leonardo di caprio is a fine actor and should have been given an oscar for wolf of wall street instead of this tripe where he hardly has to act
ok the conditions were harsh but not as harsh as having to sit in a cinema and watch this
tom hardy was mumbling as ever and seemed to be a baddie for the sake of it
after an hour i was looking round the cinema to see if anyone else was as bored as i was
di caprios character glass is mauled constantly frozen and wet starved dehydrated witnesses in his delirium his son being murdered and rides off a cliff and yet i didnt really sense the suffering
bilge
it is a travesty
the scenery shots are boring and carelessly tacked on to create a disparity between the violence and serenity of nature i assume but its really badly done
i think its supposed to be arty
if you watch the trailer google some pics of canadian landscape and youtube that scene from star wars with the tauntaun you have basically watched the movie
dont waste your money
it is soulless oscar fodder and brings nothing new to cinema so if you want to watch the same old story of a guy surviving against all odds because revenge and manpain are powerful driving forces go for it
youll probably enjoy it
if you want to watch something with beautiful editing or scenery or costume design there are way better films out there that do all of this a lot better and have a more original storylineprogressive way of showing that storyline
i found it very dull and leo does not deserve an oscar
maybe tom hardy does
but mad max was better so he should win it for that
shot using all natural light the revenant is one of the most gorgeous films you will ever see
leonardo dicaprio deserves his first oscar for his incredibly dedicated performance easily the best of his career and tom hardy gives an oscar worthy performance for his role as the haunting beast john fitzgerald
the first act of the film was definitely the most impressive
with stunning visuals and flawlessly crafted intense action scenes i felt like i was watching real footage from the 1820s
then the vast snowy wilderness kicked in the majority of the time it was breathtaking
but at times the revenant got a little lost in the wilderness and sometimes felt a bit repetitive its still an unpredictable and suspenseful adventure with many surprises
its no doubt one of the years best films
one of if not the worst movies if ever seen
wanted to leave after 30 minutes but stuck it out for thirty more hoping it would get better
when it became obvious that glass would survive and get his revenge after another hour and a half of boring action we left
plot is boring and obvious
wish i could get my price of admission back
sadly a big waste of time and money
is this the best the film industry can do
hopefully not
would not recommend this to anyone
actually am embarrassed to admit i stuck it out for as long as i did
terrible
terrible
terrible
spoiler alert
really
plot is so obvious
dialog is stupid
character development nonexistent
etc
etc
etc
may contain spoilers
im sorry hollywood but life threatening injuriesshattered bones severed major veinsarteries and smashedslashed tendons dont just healup by themselves
this and this alone made me give up on reverent shortly after he and his horse went over the cliff
early on when dicaprio cauterized the deep wounds on his neck with fire i told my buddies that ill bet hell be walking soon
without a cane
well i was right
miraculously his busted up foot and hand were healed in a couple days
i told them when i shattered my femur i should have crawled through the bushes waded across the stream and crawled thru the woods behind my property for a few days and i couldve came out strutting like nothing had happened
but i dont live in hollywoodland where life threatening injuries simply disappear
additionally no one can swim in freezing water without inducing hypothermia
cheeez
suggestion when this movie comes out on television youd be better off watching gilligans island reruns
this film should have been edited down by forty minutes
we got the message of man vs
man vs
nature very quickly
nature is beautiful but cruel and man in his natural lawless state is more cruel than that
sure the photography is beautiful and the actors are props not much different than the cg bear
the only character shown in closeup was glassdicaprio all the others are blurry bearded faces given sparse barely articulate dialogue
the indianlanguage words are accompanied by subtitles but so should have been the words spoken in english
and you could hardly write a spoiler because there is a resolution to only part of the main characters adventure
i personally found this movie to be boring
definitely one of the most boring movies ive ever seen
yes it looks good visually but thats all it has going for it
even when something was happening nothing happened
they easily could have cut an hour out and it still would have been boring but at least it would have been so long and drawn out
i feel that this is probably one of those movies that people will claim to like because its the popular thing to do
but seriously how many times can look at cg trees and still be amazed at how real they look
in the end this was two and a half hours of my life that ill never get back
immediately forgettable because no emotional connection is established between the characters and audience
as you are watching you find yourself asking why isnt this working
and as you walk out of the theater youre still wondering why
one answer is the characters are single dimensional another the editing is confused chopped
a third scenes of nature the outdoors environment locale etc that should be integral to the emotions but are not evocative and seem to have been filmed then interspersed periodically for no reason and to little effect
david lean could use the locale to tell the story
this director cannot or does not
im sorry to say these things because i was really looking forward to the movie
after all the praises about this film i took time to watch all of it
it was basically a film about how beautiful winter scenes and weather can be
other than the nature scenes i found this boring distracting stupid to the point idiotic in certain circumstances also where hardy can hardly be understood and his character is ridiculous and the fact that leos character did not die of hypothermia
you have to watch the movie to see what i am talking about the jest of this movie is the story of a mans survival in the wilderness
i will say that the bear scenes were astounding graphic and very realistic to the point that it was amazing that he even survived the attack
if you want to watch it be my guest but i will not watch it again
and i would recommend to my friends not to waste their time on this movie
the film i would recommend watching is  man in the wilderness 1971 staring richard harris and john huston who was also the director this film is so much better
nonsense
there was more hope
cheap worthless leo a bad filmmaker
the film is artificially adjusted to receive an oscar
very disappointed leonardo di caprio play
the role did not oscar
many plot blunders
for example a horse gutted and when he left not cut off from her meat
he does not know that horses eat or a fastidious
the main actor played very simple
so would any mediocre actor played
and it is not the role of the father
he looks too young
well played by another actor  the role of the villain in terms of dramatic games
the second time is not particularly want to watch this movie
the second time is not particularly want to watch this movie
many artificial unreal tense rescue the protagonist
suddenly there was some kind of lone indian
he eats raw meat sitting next to the three fires
honestly i think i just watched a dude crawl in snow for 2 hours trying to kill another dude with minimum words said
the performances where epic by both tom amp leo
there is no doubt in that but the plot is just so boring there is nothing interesting about the story other than how the hell glass survived i wanted to leave in the first like 10 mins but i always hoped that it would get better but it didnt the trailer doesnt reflect the movie well because from the trailer the movie seems epic but really the movie is just boring boring boring it got all the acclaim for the wonderful performances and the amount of work done in the field of cinematography they focused on that much but forgot to focus on evolving the story and the characters i didnt emotionally connect with the movie what so ever i am very disappointed
boy i had a difficult time watching this movie
it is just to much of the same thing and the same emotion
dicaprio had an easy time learning his lines because not many words came out of his mouth a lot of grunting instead that gets annoying quite quickly
there was a lot of laughter amongst the audience not because the movie is funny but is is at many times over the top and highly unlikely
yes the nature is beautiful but id rather watch an episode of bbc earth that is a lot more uplifting
overall the movie was quite disappointing
i dont get the praise at all
the script can be summarized in one page and that is not a good thing
awful movie
the worst one i watched this year
so far
i cant imagine how sick and perverted someone must be to make such a crappy and repulsive film
average scenario flat dialogues no acting game at all
just rivers of blood everywhere
too much for my taste and also for the tastes of many people in the cinema theater  today half of them just left after the first disgusting scene
and they were so many of them
what was the idea of the movie  some kind of exotic punishment for the audience
i think the revenant is appropriate for people who love blood aggression and killings but it is not for mentally sane people
watching this movie was totally waste of my time
this film ranks as one of the very worst films ive ever seen its down there with birdman blair witch and the that piece of tripe about eva peron with madonna in it
ive walked out of films better than all of the above
seriously folks dont waste your lives on this unmitigated garbage
i thought the bear was brilliant the snow was pretty etc
the dialogue seemed to be predominately unintelligible mumbling no im not deaf or hard of hearing continuity was rubbish too i
e
beard growth ability to light fires immunity from the effects of cold
all in all i couldnt bear it i think the beast was trying to do us all a favour by attempting to kill the main character just my opinion of course no offense meant
another indiangood  white manbad movie
too long
too draggy
too politically correct
why was the indian kid such a little bitch
why was he screaming like that
the bad bad white guy had a real point there
the french were bad
the angloes were bad
they drove off the spaniards apparently
good thing we can all turn to the noble savage for instructions on clean upright living
i thought it was really pathetic that they had to mention how many hours went into the making of the movie like theyre supposed to get kudos and awards based on effort instead of outcome
after floating down a river a few times sleeping in a makeshift sweat lodge sleeping in a horse carcass for no real reason writing graffiti in an pseudoigloo digging climbing falling cauterizing baking freezing puking crawling the sob probably died of tetanus
how long can you watch this sort of thing and continue to be entertained
three hours
nope
oh i know this guy is supposed to be just so sympathetic based on the fact that hes almost an indian that were all riveted
nope
if what you would want to see in a movie is beautiful cinematography hung in an ansel adams frame this is the movie for you
if you want gritty historical movie with ample gore this is the movie for you
if you want a realistic plot and realistic survival situations you may want to pick another movie
some of the implausible survival situations sucks you right out of the movie willing suspension of disbelief blown while you try to get back into the movie
if this happened only once perhaps i could be more forgiving but all i could think of was dicaprio jumping up and saying its just a flesh wound
it got comical and ridiculous
be sure you can forgive many mistakes before you go see the movie
the revenant is beautifully shot but the story is poorly told
one hour into the movie i still had no care for any of the characters
which makes it extremely dull for me to get through
it is like watching a documentary without introduction narration or storyline
other than the cinematography i have nothing positive to say about this film
i cannot understand why this movie get so much appraise
it should have been edited down to a 30min shortfilm and not be two hours and thirtysix minutes long
this is two hours and thirtysix minutes of completely wasted time i cannot get back
you can ask me why i use my time writing about it
answers is
so you have a chance to avoid wasting time on this movie
just to say a little i watch a lot of movies
i know when a movie is technically sound and when a script is mediocre
i was excited about going to see this movie
everything seemed interesting dicaprio tom hardy alejandro as director
however this movie was not engaging throughout the movie
the first 35 minutes of the movie are good then around the second act it gets crucially dull then the last 35 minutes are good but the plot of the script of this movie is not intriguing
the movie could have been shorter and it would have been better in my opinion
the characters were very flat however tom hardys character was by far the most multidimensional and characteristic
the cinematography was astonishing in every aspect the acting was great but the story was monotonous and slow paced
i would not recommend this movie
this films exposes leonardo dicaprio as a mediocre actor
never at any point is the viewer able to get past his awkward overacting and be drawn into the film
dicaprio was entirely miscast in this role
he still looks too young to have a teenage son and the makeup and hair in this film doesnt change that perception
none of it is convincing
he even manages to make the real stunts look fake
aside from that the film is terribly slow and isnt over when you want it to be
its gratuitous to a comical level in its violence which cheapens it and makes it gimmicky
i actually laughed during the films climax because it was so absurd
tom hardy stole this movie however
watch this movie for his performance because everything else will let you down from the acting to the plot and the dialogue
even the bear phoned it in
ugh this movie was so disappointing and it bothers me that so many people loved it
i hated this movie
there arent very many movies i can say that about either
i couldnt understand a single word the southerners were saying
they had subtitles for all the other languages i feel like i needed it for english as well
thats not even the worst part about it
everything was so random and just one thing after another nothing seemed to make sense
for some reason i have to give 10 lines but try not to give anything away
i hate how movies this one as well glorify rape
i hate how they show animals getting shot point blank
this guy gets shot he lives he gets mauled by a bear lives gets buried alive lives goes over a waterfall lives
i finally walked out after the rape scene and wish i could get my money and time back
its 2
5 hours of worthless trash
this film and is awful
the worst film ive ever seen in my whole life
what is it even about
leonardo crawling about the snow after being attacked by a bear and getting his son killed
crawling about injured half dying like a smack head from drumchapel shopping centre eating creatures and raw fish
then miraculously gets strength to fight back and kill people to get revenge for his sons death that he caused in the first place
nah tom hardy should have gutted him like the pikey he is and left him not even bothered to finish him never mind be kind enough to dig him a grave
i was looking forward to this film and am so disgusted i wish bear grylls would jump out a tree and rip leonardos face off hope tom hardy finishes the job
leonardo should have just let the bear finish him and then his son would not have died
i have a new ending
leonardo is attacked by the bear and everyone else just eats him and lives happily ever after x
awesome movie that will surely get many oscar awards for best actor leonardo dicaprio supporting actor tom hardy cinematography and makeup best director and best picture possibly costume design and editing
the bear attack scene is monumental and memorable i do not remember having seen a bear attack described so well in all its wildness in any film or documentary
the many landscapes of wild nature are very beautiful
leonardo dicaprios wounds and tormented face are so well rendered i do not know how one can lose the oscar for makeup
throughout the film leo plays absolutely brilliant with tom hardy also excellent
the movie is very well built in details it has memorable scenes like the one when jumping on the horse from the cliff and surviving in the freezing night that followed and depicts very well the struggle to survive in harsh natural conditions in frontier areas in those times
awesome cinema experience for a viewer  congratulations to the whole film crew for a job well done
let me start by saying that i thought leonardo dicaprio was terrific in this film and well deserved his oscar for the role
however there is so little plot in the movie and some really really improbable situations where his character is rescued andor escapes that my overall feeling was one of real disappointment
tom hardy spends most of the movie talking like hes got a mouthful of hardtack and even when you can clearly understand him isnt really saying much
the director to me at least seemed to understand how little plot and story there actually is in the movie by using scenes of a river or clouds as links between scenes and then lingering and lingering on those scenes of a river or clouds
there is also gore aplenty to help stretch out the running time
aside from dicaprio the praise heaped on this movie mystifies me
an enthralling story with fabulous scenery and brilliantly acted  dicaprios oscar was totally deserved
to counter this the film could have been at least halfanhour shorter possibly more with several drawnout scenes which did nothing to enhance the tale and were meaningless in terms of character development
the intense and enthralling finale was totally ruined by a constant highpitched and extremely irritating whistle only to be replaced by some maniac banging on a piece of sheet metal which left me on edge and unable to devote full attention to the thrilling denouement
i was left feeling that i had wasted 2 12 hours of my life watching a film which i could have enjoyed so much more
this film is the worst
i caught this when i was on a movie binge
i was super excited to see it because of the surrounding buzz
the film is trash
leo received a pity oscar because of the internet
his performance is about the same as it ever was
i would look to tom hardy as the films saving grace but just another generic role in a based on true story film
i ended up finding myself fast forwarding through parts of leos overacting
pure trash manufactured for the masses and something to fill out the award shows
im not gonna waste anymore time on it and you shouldnt ether
if youre a tom hardy fan i suggest bronson or locke
they will be a much better ride than this flat generic film
revenant is way overrated
this movie is unrelentingly grim and lacking any point
leo di caprio didnt do much that could be called acting
grimacing moaning yowling grunting
maybe 10 lines of dialogue most if it in pawnee supposedly jim hardy really deserved an award
something better than an oscar for his incredible characterization of fitzgerald the evil antagonist
he stole the show for me
if i ever watch it again it will be for the incredible beauty of the cinematography and jim hardys performance
i still love inarritus work but his mystical touches didnt work in this film so this was not his best
well
youd think that by now i would not fall for the 8
0 review on imdb but once again we commit ourselves to being tortured by the most dullest and pointless film that ive seen in a while for 2
5 hours of our lives trying to make out any kind of dialogue over the most nasty noisy background of what sounds like wee wee trickling into a urinal or the screech of a thousand nails across a blackboard
was there any point in watching it im none the wiser the only reason ive given it two stars is for the scenery cause if that wasnt in it then st me
how these pieces of dung get nominated for oscars is beyond me
id rather spend 2 and a half hours watching my sons animations using those connecting plastic bricks rolls eyes at least there is a flipping story and far more entertainment
whoever has rated this film 8
0 is deluded
a total utter pile of depressing horse manure which you could watch 10 minutes of and experience the same thing
x
i walked out of this movie about 23 of the way through
as a historian i was looking forward to this film
the true account of hugh glass is an incredible survival story
unfortunately most of the story is a pure fabrication and there is a strong political slant attached
while i have a great deal of sympathy for native americans it is obvious that the makers of this film went above and beyond to vilify frontiersmen
furthermore there were incidents in the movie in which glass came across as nearly being a super hero
what a shame
there is some decent acting and good cinematography but the story is just too too lame
star studded cast but the movie leaves too little to be desired
the revenge was too little too late
the film definitely not oscar worthy
the film begins with a 1823 quasimilitary hunting party of trappers and hunters hunting for pelts in the unsettled wilderness of the louisiana purchase under the command of their captain andrew henry
hostility from the native american arikara indians leads to an ambush of the hunting party
only about half of the hunters manage to escape on one of their rafts salvaging as much as they can while still under fire from the attacking arikara
henry leads the escaping party knowing that they are still being pursued by the pawnee
the party is further slowed down when hugh glass  one of the experienced hunters stumbles on a mother grizzly bear and her cubs while he is separated from the rest of the party
okay this is a really good action film but its too gory and predictable
fitzgerald is an irredeemable bad guy
the entire scenario was too good to be true
leonardo dicaprio was terrific in acting the part but his character had not 9 but 10 lives in this movie
how is it possible for a person near death to survive so many ordeals
the one with jumping off a cliff and surviving the fall when still very much not in great shape is remarkable and unbelievable to me
of course i knew the fate of the captain at the end before viewing the last scenes and dicaprios trick to get fitzgerald at the end was used in a previous movie
this flick reminded me of the one with robert redford in jeremiah johnson
tom hardy played fitzgerald very well but it was difficult at times for me to understand what he was saying
loosely based on the life of 19th century frontiersman hugh glass the revenant is a brutal yet visually stunning western with one of leonardo dicaprios best performances yet
the film follows glass after he is mauled by a bear and left for dead by his fellow fur traders
one of the frontiersmen john fitzgerald kills his son and glass voyages over 200 miles to exact revenge on him
the revenant is one of the most violent movies ive seen from 2015 although the incredible scenery and cinematography also make it one of the most astonishing movies to look at
it combines some intense difficulttowatch scenes with amazing scenery which makes it one of the most beautiful violent films ive seen
leos committed and demanding performance is certainly one of the best of his career especially because of the lack of the dialog in the film
the 156 minute running time relentless brutality and limited dialog does take a bit of a commitment to finish but the revenant is a masterfully directed film that makes the most of its subject matters intriguing story
the short summary of the movie above basically is the movie
a frontiersman on a fur trading expedition in the 1820s fights for survival after being mauled by a bear and left for dead by members of his own hunting team
and then he comes back and gets his revenge
and they drag this on for 2 and a half hours
no wonder there are so many shots of they sky
best actor
for what
eating raw liver
is that all it takes to get best actor thesedays
no interesting dialogue or confrontation
this is just a bad movie
bad directing
acting wasnt bad but certainly wasnt oscar worthy
or maybe it is worth it since oscar is worth garbage thesedays
yeah a hollywood actor can survive the mauling by a huge bear
can survive being buried halfdead in freezing temperatures
can survive alone and half dead and wounded in freezing temperatures without food and weapons swimming in freezing cold water surviving in wet clothes in freezing temperatures
miraculously this hollywood actor can suddenly run when necessary while he limped just a second ago
though finally arriving at a safe spot still half dead  he is immediately able to go out again and fight his enemy
half of the movie i closed my eyes because i had no desire to watch the gore fest the beautiful scenery with stolen ansel adams images did not make up for the rest
i should have followed my initial instinct
after watching a preview i thought that this was not a movie for me and i was right
never again will i fall for the hype
unbelievable
disgusting blood orgy
dont get me wrong because ive given this movie such low rating
ive always loved dicaprios performance
prior to release when i read the synopsis and bit googling about hugh glass i started eagerly waiting for the movie
however after watching all i could think was even if this movie wasnt ever made nobody wouldve cared
the problem is not with the acting or direction cinematography etc
i just dont think it was needed to be made as theres nothing great about it
now i know there are plenty of movies out there which we dont care about
but when leonardo dicaprio is starring in a movie its like you must watch it and enjoy
all this movies about is survival which isnt highlighted as id hoped for and revenge
the problem is that these 2 things are sort of ignored by the director
we see lots of red indians french bla bla
its hard to explain perhaps someone with a better command of language can explain better after watching
this movie was so awesome that it actually convinced me of writing my first review
lets start with the good very nice winter scenery with top notch acting from leonard dicaprio
theres also lots of action scenes but did not find myself caring too much about the outcome
the bad very slow paced story about chuck norris crawling in the snow in the 1800s
first 2 hours are about glass surviving a bear maul attack being left for dead in a frozen forest with no water or food survives being dragged in a freezing river for miles survives falling on a horse of a cliff etc
come on really
then the revenge part takes about 20 minutes the bad guy flees an army fort with all the money and only 2 people go after him
really
i was so bored i actually noticed the sound track being really weird it sounded like a broken dripping faucet and it left me wondering if thats really a sound that can be heard in a frozen forest during winter
anyway to sum it up im really disappointed for wasting 2
5 hours to see this
contains spoiler it was expected from this movie in my opinion that doesnt contain a revenge story and rather contain one based on coping with nature and more survival
furthermore the dream scenes of the main character were awful and they did not create a good relation with the atmosphere of the movie
if it wasnt for these defects i would give this movie a 10
though the tow main actors did play their role skillfully and dialogues were brilliant the movie could include more captures of the spectacular landscapes and thoughtfully conversations
lets face it everything leo did in this movie i could have done
eat raw meat raw fish
no prob
crawl inside a fake dead horse
brave bad weather
what did he do that the average actor couldnt do
i literally laughed out loud when he swung his wobbly arm trying to chop a branch with a tomahawk
you see the muscles confused when called upon to do this manual labor
toss him upon a pile of supermodels and hes a natural but grab a shovel
which end
compare leo with spencer tracy or steve mcqueen two actors from real life
they worked served in the military etc
when they do things i believe they are doing things
leos oscar lowers the standard of acting excellence to whoever can bear extreme conditions when theyre otherwise used to yachts caviar and wolf of wall st
living
inarritu worked around this for the sake of the dicaprio brand but imagine keaton spitting and screeching his way through birdman
are you saying he would have won
let me put it to you this way and then ill thank you for your time leo dicaprio cannot act
leonardo dicaprio and tom hardy star in this 2015 drama based on the novel and inspired by true events
this takes place in the 1800s and dicaprio titanic plays hugh glass a frontiersman who leads a hunting expedition
soon glass is injured by a bear and left for dead by one of his men john fitzgerald hardy who not only betrays him but murders his son
glass struggles to survive the wilderness while regaining his strength and health to find fitzgerald
this is a great film with suspenseful and heartfelt moments dicaprio definitely gives an oscarworthy performance and theres beautiful remote settings
the film also shares similarities with the grey deliverance and cast away
i recommend this
dont even half to watch the full movie to know how terrible it is
looking at the trailer it seems almost unrecognizable from the book which i happened to read in two days
the main idea of the story was him being a ruthless fighter but it changed the whole prospective and added in characters of all sorts that werent needed
first of all he does not even have a son and his girlfriend not wife died while at sea who was not at all aboriginal
this was supposed to be based on a real mans story and they totally disregarded that and changed his history
they most likely used this to add a love interest or some sort of positive ethnicity image since a lot of the natives were portrayed as bad it was unnecessary and just sad
it took away the whole idea of proving himself to the people that left him to die
not surviving only to get revenge for his son and wife
it erased the whole meaning and i suggest giving a book a try
its a whole lot better then this st
wow just wasted 2
5 hours on watching this
was inclined to stop 20 minutes in but sucked it up
this movie tries too hard to be too many different genres slyly and to use all the techniques film has to the directors disposal
but no
this won best oscar
its a plainasday example of hollywood illuminati control fodder
leo is a bad actor wow
to be honest would of liked to of seen a young shatner because he is an actor
and this isnt a nature documentary this isnt a horror film dont use cameras and audio like it is and you are a desperate freshman film student showing his chops
and whoever wrote this or directed this
its bad
in not so many words historical and natural inaccuracies throughout clicha and failed homages and it takes a lot more skill to break the fourth wall as is popular now than was put into this piece of bullshit  310
the beginning is ok but the rest is crap
a man is mutilated by a grizzly bear and evil men let him lye dying and almost buried
but he soon very fast recovers unexpectually and can do everything in the wilderness
i expected to see an interesting and exiting movie but it turned out to be exceptional bad and boring  one of the worst movies i have ever experienced
how in the world can this ridiculous unwillingly funny movie get so good reviews
sudently he stands up and walks and talks and crawles along this lengthy movie
i can see a purpose in this film but my god it is weitten in capital letters
i did not feel anything about him just laughing at this rediculess and unsatisfiing movie
what a turn off
i really like leo and he does give a fine performance in this average movie but the ever annoying tom i can do ameeericannn accents hardy really racks me off
so if you want a treat the check out
man in the wilderness 1971
in the early 1800s a group of fur trappers and indian traders are returning with their goods to civilization and are making a desperate attempt to beat the oncoming winter
when guide zachary bass is injured in a bear attack they decide hes a goner and leave him behind to die
when he recovers instead he swears revenge on them and tracks them and their paranoiac expedition leader down
this story line sounds familiar
richard harris and john huston brilliant
sorry for the ones who loved the film but here is somebody who did not like it at all
in the end its just a typical you hit me bad but i will get you in the end wrapped up in beautiful cold landscapes and some historical background
i like leonardo a lot as an actor but that does not mean that all his films are good
in this one when if you daze away for a moment not difficult with those long scenes
you wake up and you could think you are watching first blood
i expected something much more epic not a simple revenge story
by the way was it really necessary to kill that bear
was she not just protecting her baby bears
is it really so necessary to show us so much violence dont we see already enough on the news
i am not sure if we really need those kind of film directors
i have seen movies with di caprio far better than that
good acting by leo but a boring boring movie
anyway leo has become a much better actor than what he was in his beginning there is no doubt about that
nice plots i like nature and violence scenes
ok
not for an oscar definitely
but as always
not always the best getting the oscar
they owe leo an oscar
and they should have given it earlier
that is why this movie gave him an oscar
just for that
same story with julia roberts
i really got disappointed
an average of 8 for a boring movie like that is strange
heightful 8 is much better with a better plot
i cannot believe how many people think this is a good movie
watching a guy struggle to survive for 2 hours
come on people
i know there are not many good movies being made but my word
so many things are unbelievable
the bear attack carrying a near dead guy out of the wilderness up a mountain
going over a cliff on a horse and not getting hurt
spending long periods of time in freezing cold water
surviving extreme cold overnight inside a dead horse
my god the list is endless
and for leos so called acting dont get me started
a lot of crawling and moaning and groaning
the whole thing was a letdown and really a waste of time
also tell the director to back the camera up a bit on those facial closeups
they were also ridiculous
trust me save your money and go see the hateful eight
utter utter utter utter waste of 2
5 hours of my life
one of the most boring films ive seen
unintelligible dialogue and no real story
leonardo di caprio is a fine actor and should have been given an oscar for wolf of wall street instead of this tripe where he hardly has to act
ok the conditions were harsh but not as harsh as having to sit in a cinema and watch this
tom hardy was mumbling as ever and seemed to be a baddie for the sake of it
after an hour i was looking round the cinema to see if anyone else was as bored as i was
di caprios character glass is mauled constantly frozen and wet starved dehydrated witnesses in his delirium his son being murdered and rides off a cliff and yet i didnt really sense the suffering
bilge
it is a travesty
the scenery shots are boring and carelessly tacked on to create a disparity between the violence and serenity of nature i assume but its really badly done
i think its supposed to be arty
if you watch the trailer google some pics of canadian landscape and youtube that scene from star wars with the tauntaun you have basically watched the movie
dont waste your money
it is soulless oscar fodder and brings nothing new to cinema so if you want to watch the same old story of a guy surviving against all odds because revenge and manpain are powerful driving forces go for it
youll probably enjoy it
if you want to watch something with beautiful editing or scenery or costume design there are way better films out there that do all of this a lot better and have a more original storylineprogressive way of showing that storyline
i found it very dull and leo does not deserve an oscar
maybe tom hardy does
but mad max was better so he should win it for that
shot using all natural light the revenant is one of the most gorgeous films you will ever see
leonardo dicaprio deserves his first oscar for his incredibly dedicated performance easily the best of his career and tom hardy gives an oscar worthy performance for his role as the haunting beast john fitzgerald
the first act of the film was definitely the most impressive
with stunning visuals and flawlessly crafted intense action scenes i felt like i was watching real footage from the 1820s
then the vast snowy wilderness kicked in the majority of the time it was breathtaking
but at times the revenant got a little lost in the wilderness and sometimes felt a bit repetitive its still an unpredictable and suspenseful adventure with many surprises
its no doubt one of the years best films
one of if not the worst movies if ever seen
wanted to leave after 30 minutes but stuck it out for thirty more hoping it would get better
when it became obvious that glass would survive and get his revenge after another hour and a half of boring action we left
plot is boring and obvious
wish i could get my price of admission back
sadly a big waste of time and money
is this the best the film industry can do
hopefully not
would not recommend this to anyone
actually am embarrassed to admit i stuck it out for as long as i did
terrible
terrible
terrible
spoiler alert
really
plot is so obvious
dialog is stupid
character development nonexistent
etc
etc
etc
may contain spoilers
im sorry hollywood but life threatening injuriesshattered bones severed major veinsarteries and smashedslashed tendons dont just healup by themselves
this and this alone made me give up on reverent shortly after he and his horse went over the cliff
early on when dicaprio cauterized the deep wounds on his neck with fire i told my buddies that ill bet hell be walking soon
without a cane
well i was right
miraculously his busted up foot and hand were healed in a couple days
i told them when i shattered my femur i should have crawled through the bushes waded across the stream and crawled thru the woods behind my property for a few days and i couldve came out strutting like nothing had happened
but i dont live in hollywoodland where life threatening injuries simply disappear
additionally no one can swim in freezing water without inducing hypothermia
cheeez
suggestion when this movie comes out on television youd be better off watching gilligans island reruns
this film should have been edited down by forty minutes
we got the message of man vs
man vs
nature very quickly
nature is beautiful but cruel and man in his natural lawless state is more cruel than that
sure the photography is beautiful and the actors are props not much different than the cg bear
the only character shown in closeup was glassdicaprio all the others are blurry bearded faces given sparse barely articulate dialogue
the indianlanguage words are accompanied by subtitles but so should have been the words spoken in english
and you could hardly write a spoiler because there is a resolution to only part of the main characters adventure
i personally found this movie to be boring
definitely one of the most boring movies ive ever seen
yes it looks good visually but thats all it has going for it
even when something was happening nothing happened
they easily could have cut an hour out and it still would have been boring but at least it would have been so long and drawn out
i feel that this is probably one of those movies that people will claim to like because its the popular thing to do
but seriously how many times can look at cg trees and still be amazed at how real they look
in the end this was two and a half hours of my life that ill never get back
immediately forgettable because no emotional connection is established between the characters and audience
as you are watching you find yourself asking why isnt this working
and as you walk out of the theater youre still wondering why
one answer is the characters are single dimensional another the editing is confused chopped
a third scenes of nature the outdoors environment locale etc that should be integral to the emotions but are not evocative and seem to have been filmed then interspersed periodically for no reason and to little effect
david lean could use the locale to tell the story
this director cannot or does not
im sorry to say these things because i was really looking forward to the movie
after all the praises about this film i took time to watch all of it
it was basically a film about how beautiful winter scenes and weather can be
other than the nature scenes i found this boring distracting stupid to the point idiotic in certain circumstances also where hardy can hardly be understood and his character is ridiculous and the fact that leos character did not die of hypothermia
you have to watch the movie to see what i am talking about the jest of this movie is the story of a mans survival in the wilderness
i will say that the bear scenes were astounding graphic and very realistic to the point that it was amazing that he even survived the attack
if you want to watch it be my guest but i will not watch it again
and i would recommend to my friends not to waste their time on this movie
the film i would recommend watching is  man in the wilderness 1971 staring richard harris and john huston who was also the director this film is so much better
nonsense
there was more hope
cheap worthless leo a bad filmmaker
the film is artificially adjusted to receive an oscar
very disappointed leonardo di caprio play
the role did not oscar
many plot blunders
for example a horse gutted and when he left not cut off from her meat
he does not know that horses eat or a fastidious
the main actor played very simple
so would any mediocre actor played
and it is not the role of the father
he looks too young
well played by another actor  the role of the villain in terms of dramatic games
the second time is not particularly want to watch this movie
the second time is not particularly want to watch this movie
many artificial unreal tense rescue the protagonist
suddenly there was some kind of lone indian
he eats raw meat sitting next to the three fires
honestly i think i just watched a dude crawl in snow for 2 hours trying to kill another dude with minimum words said
the performances where epic by both tom amp leo
there is no doubt in that but the plot is just so boring there is nothing interesting about the story other than how the hell glass survived i wanted to leave in the first like 10 mins but i always hoped that it would get better but it didnt the trailer doesnt reflect the movie well because from the trailer the movie seems epic but really the movie is just boring boring boring it got all the acclaim for the wonderful performances and the amount of work done in the field of cinematography they focused on that much but forgot to focus on evolving the story and the characters i didnt emotionally connect with the movie what so ever i am very disappointed
boy i had a difficult time watching this movie
it is just to much of the same thing and the same emotion
dicaprio had an easy time learning his lines because not many words came out of his mouth a lot of grunting instead that gets annoying quite quickly
there was a lot of laughter amongst the audience not because the movie is funny but is is at many times over the top and highly unlikely
yes the nature is beautiful but id rather watch an episode of bbc earth that is a lot more uplifting
overall the movie was quite disappointing
i dont get the praise at all
the script can be summarized in one page and that is not a good thing
awful movie
the worst one i watched this year
so far
i cant imagine how sick and perverted someone must be to make such a crappy and repulsive film
average scenario flat dialogues no acting game at all
just rivers of blood everywhere
too much for my taste and also for the tastes of many people in the cinema theater  today half of them just left after the first disgusting scene
and they were so many of them
what was the idea of the movie  some kind of exotic punishment for the audience
i think the revenant is appropriate for people who love blood aggression and killings but it is not for mentally sane people
watching this movie was totally waste of my time
this film ranks as one of the very worst films ive ever seen its down there with birdman blair witch and the that piece of tripe about eva peron with madonna in it
ive walked out of films better than all of the above
seriously folks dont waste your lives on this unmitigated garbage
i thought the bear was brilliant the snow was pretty etc
the dialogue seemed to be predominately unintelligible mumbling no im not deaf or hard of hearing continuity was rubbish too i
e
beard growth ability to light fires immunity from the effects of cold
all in all i couldnt bear it i think the beast was trying to do us all a favour by attempting to kill the main character just my opinion of course no offense meant
another indiangood  white manbad movie
too long
too draggy
too politically correct
why was the indian kid such a little bitch
why was he screaming like that
the bad bad white guy had a real point there
the french were bad
the angloes were bad
they drove off the spaniards apparently
good thing we can all turn to the noble savage for instructions on clean upright living
i thought it was really pathetic that they had to mention how many hours went into the making of the movie like theyre supposed to get kudos and awards based on effort instead of outcome
after floating down a river a few times sleeping in a makeshift sweat lodge sleeping in a horse carcass for no real reason writing graffiti in an pseudoigloo digging climbing falling cauterizing baking freezing puking crawling the sob probably died of tetanus
how long can you watch this sort of thing and continue to be entertained
three hours
nope
oh i know this guy is supposed to be just so sympathetic based on the fact that hes almost an indian that were all riveted
nope
if what you would want to see in a movie is beautiful cinematography hung in an ansel adams frame this is the movie for you
if you want gritty historical movie with ample gore this is the movie for you
if you want a realistic plot and realistic survival situations you may want to pick another movie
some of the implausible survival situations sucks you right out of the movie willing suspension of disbelief blown while you try to get back into the movie
if this happened only once perhaps i could be more forgiving but all i could think of was dicaprio jumping up and saying its just a flesh wound
it got comical and ridiculous
be sure you can forgive many mistakes before you go see the movie
the revenant is beautifully shot but the story is poorly told
one hour into the movie i still had no care for any of the characters
which makes it extremely dull for me to get through
it is like watching a documentary without introduction narration or storyline
other than the cinematography i have nothing positive to say about this film
i cannot understand why this movie get so much appraise
it should have been edited down to a 30min shortfilm and not be two hours and thirtysix minutes long
this is two hours and thirtysix minutes of completely wasted time i cannot get back
you can ask me why i use my time writing about it
answers is
so you have a chance to avoid wasting time on this movie
just to say a little i watch a lot of movies
i know when a movie is technically sound and when a script is mediocre
i was excited about going to see this movie
everything seemed interesting dicaprio tom hardy alejandro as director
however this movie was not engaging throughout the movie
the first 35 minutes of the movie are good then around the second act it gets crucially dull then the last 35 minutes are good but the plot of the script of this movie is not intriguing
the movie could have been shorter and it would have been better in my opinion
the characters were very flat however tom hardys character was by far the most multidimensional and characteristic
the cinematography was astonishing in every aspect the acting was great but the story was monotonous and slow paced
i would not recommend this movie
this films exposes leonardo dicaprio as a mediocre actor
never at any point is the viewer able to get past his awkward overacting and be drawn into the film
dicaprio was entirely miscast in this role
he still looks too young to have a teenage son and the makeup and hair in this film doesnt change that perception
none of it is convincing
he even manages to make the real stunts look fake
aside from that the film is terribly slow and isnt over when you want it to be
its gratuitous to a comical level in its violence which cheapens it and makes it gimmicky
i actually laughed during the films climax because it was so absurd
tom hardy stole this movie however
watch this movie for his performance because everything else will let you down from the acting to the plot and the dialogue
even the bear phoned it in
ugh this movie was so disappointing and it bothers me that so many people loved it
i hated this movie
there arent very many movies i can say that about either
i couldnt understand a single word the southerners were saying
they had subtitles for all the other languages i feel like i needed it for english as well
thats not even the worst part about it
everything was so random and just one thing after another nothing seemed to make sense
for some reason i have to give 10 lines but try not to give anything away
i hate how movies this one as well glorify rape
i hate how they show animals getting shot point blank
this guy gets shot he lives he gets mauled by a bear lives gets buried alive lives goes over a waterfall lives
i finally walked out after the rape scene and wish i could get my money and time back
its 2
5 hours of worthless trash
this film and is awful
the worst film ive ever seen in my whole life
what is it even about
leonardo crawling about the snow after being attacked by a bear and getting his son killed
crawling about injured half dying like a smack head from drumchapel shopping centre eating creatures and raw fish
then miraculously gets strength to fight back and kill people to get revenge for his sons death that he caused in the first place
nah tom hardy should have gutted him like the pikey he is and left him not even bothered to finish him never mind be kind enough to dig him a grave
i was looking forward to this film and am so disgusted i wish bear grylls would jump out a tree and rip leonardos face off hope tom hardy finishes the job
leonardo should have just let the bear finish him and then his son would not have died
i have a new ending
leonardo is attacked by the bear and everyone else just eats him and lives happily ever after x
awesome movie that will surely get many oscar awards for best actor leonardo dicaprio supporting actor tom hardy cinematography and makeup best director and best picture possibly costume design and editing
the bear attack scene is monumental and memorable i do not remember having seen a bear attack described so well in all its wildness in any film or documentary
the many landscapes of wild nature are very beautiful
leonardo dicaprios wounds and tormented face are so well rendered i do not know how one can lose the oscar for makeup
throughout the film leo plays absolutely brilliant with tom hardy also excellent
the movie is very well built in details it has memorable scenes like the one when jumping on the horse from the cliff and surviving in the freezing night that followed and depicts very well the struggle to survive in harsh natural conditions in frontier areas in those times
awesome cinema experience for a viewer  congratulations to the whole film crew for a job well done
let me start by saying that i thought leonardo dicaprio was terrific in this film and well deserved his oscar for the role
however there is so little plot in the movie and some really really improbable situations where his character is rescued andor escapes that my overall feeling was one of real disappointment
tom hardy spends most of the movie talking like hes got a mouthful of hardtack and even when you can clearly understand him isnt really saying much
the director to me at least seemed to understand how little plot and story there actually is in the movie by using scenes of a river or clouds as links between scenes and then lingering and lingering on those scenes of a river or clouds
there is also gore aplenty to help stretch out the running time
aside from dicaprio the praise heaped on this movie mystifies me
an enthralling story with fabulous scenery and brilliantly acted  dicaprios oscar was totally deserved
to counter this the film could have been at least halfanhour shorter possibly more with several drawnout scenes which did nothing to enhance the tale and were meaningless in terms of character development
the intense and enthralling finale was totally ruined by a constant highpitched and extremely irritating whistle only to be replaced by some maniac banging on a piece of sheet metal which left me on edge and unable to devote full attention to the thrilling denouement
i was left feeling that i had wasted 2 12 hours of my life watching a film which i could have enjoyed so much more
this film is the worst
i caught this when i was on a movie binge
i was super excited to see it because of the surrounding buzz
the film is trash
leo received a pity oscar because of the internet
his performance is about the same as it ever was
i would look to tom hardy as the films saving grace but just another generic role in a based on true story film
i ended up finding myself fast forwarding through parts of leos overacting
pure trash manufactured for the masses and something to fill out the award shows
im not gonna waste anymore time on it and you shouldnt ether
if youre a tom hardy fan i suggest bronson or locke
they will be a much better ride than this flat generic film
revenant is way overrated
this movie is unrelentingly grim and lacking any point
leo di caprio didnt do much that could be called acting
grimacing moaning yowling grunting
maybe 10 lines of dialogue most if it in pawnee supposedly jim hardy really deserved an award
something better than an oscar for his incredible characterization of fitzgerald the evil antagonist
he stole the show for me
if i ever watch it again it will be for the incredible beauty of the cinematography and jim hardys performance
i still love inarritus work but his mystical touches didnt work in this film so this was not his best
well
youd think that by now i would not fall for the 8
0 review on imdb but once again we commit ourselves to being tortured by the most dullest and pointless film that ive seen in a while for 2
5 hours of our lives trying to make out any kind of dialogue over the most nasty noisy background of what sounds like wee wee trickling into a urinal or the screech of a thousand nails across a blackboard
was there any point in watching it im none the wiser the only reason ive given it two stars is for the scenery cause if that wasnt in it then st me
how these pieces of dung get nominated for oscars is beyond me
id rather spend 2 and a half hours watching my sons animations using those connecting plastic bricks rolls eyes at least there is a flipping story and far more entertainment
whoever has rated this film 8
0 is deluded
a total utter pile of depressing horse manure which you could watch 10 minutes of and experience the same thing
x
i walked out of this movie about 23 of the way through
as a historian i was looking forward to this film
the true account of hugh glass is an incredible survival story
unfortunately most of the story is a pure fabrication and there is a strong political slant attached
while i have a great deal of sympathy for native americans it is obvious that the makers of this film went above and beyond to vilify frontiersmen
furthermore there were incidents in the movie in which glass came across as nearly being a super hero
what a shame
there is some decent acting and good cinematography but the story is just too too lame
star studded cast but the movie leaves too little to be desired
the revenge was too little too late
the film definitely not oscar worthy
the film begins with a 1823 quasimilitary hunting party of trappers and hunters hunting for pelts in the unsettled wilderness of the louisiana purchase under the command of their captain andrew henry
hostility from the native american arikara indians leads to an ambush of the hunting party
only about half of the hunters manage to escape on one of their rafts salvaging as much as they can while still under fire from the attacking arikara
henry leads the escaping party knowing that they are still being pursued by the pawnee
the party is further slowed down when hugh glass  one of the experienced hunters stumbles on a mother grizzly bear and her cubs while he is separated from the rest of the party
okay this is a really good action film but its too gory and predictable
fitzgerald is an irredeemable bad guy
the entire scenario was too good to be true
leonardo dicaprio was terrific in acting the part but his character had not 9 but 10 lives in this movie
how is it possible for a person near death to survive so many ordeals
the one with jumping off a cliff and surviving the fall when still very much not in great shape is remarkable and unbelievable to me
of course i knew the fate of the captain at the end before viewing the last scenes and dicaprios trick to get fitzgerald at the end was used in a previous movie
this flick reminded me of the one with robert redford in jeremiah johnson
tom hardy played fitzgerald very well but it was difficult at times for me to understand what he was saying
loosely based on the life of 19th century frontiersman hugh glass the revenant is a brutal yet visually stunning western with one of leonardo dicaprios best performances yet
the film follows glass after he is mauled by a bear and left for dead by his fellow fur traders
one of the frontiersmen john fitzgerald kills his son and glass voyages over 200 miles to exact revenge on him
the revenant is one of the most violent movies ive seen from 2015 although the incredible scenery and cinematography also make it one of the most astonishing movies to look at
it combines some intense difficulttowatch scenes with amazing scenery which makes it one of the most beautiful violent films ive seen
leos committed and demanding performance is certainly one of the best of his career especially because of the lack of the dialog in the film
the 156 minute running time relentless brutality and limited dialog does take a bit of a commitment to finish but the revenant is a masterfully directed film that makes the most of its subject matters intriguing story
the short summary of the movie above basically is the movie
a frontiersman on a fur trading expedition in the 1820s fights for survival after being mauled by a bear and left for dead by members of his own hunting team
and then he comes back and gets his revenge
and they drag this on for 2 and a half hours
no wonder there are so many shots of they sky
best actor
for what
eating raw liver
is that all it takes to get best actor thesedays
no interesting dialogue or confrontation
this is just a bad movie
bad directing
acting wasnt bad but certainly wasnt oscar worthy
or maybe it is worth it since oscar is worth garbage thesedays
yeah a hollywood actor can survive the mauling by a huge bear
can survive being buried halfdead in freezing temperatures
can survive alone and half dead and wounded in freezing temperatures without food and weapons swimming in freezing cold water surviving in wet clothes in freezing temperatures
miraculously this hollywood actor can suddenly run when necessary while he limped just a second ago
though finally arriving at a safe spot still half dead  he is immediately able to go out again and fight his enemy
half of the movie i closed my eyes because i had no desire to watch the gore fest the beautiful scenery with stolen ansel adams images did not make up for the rest
i should have followed my initial instinct
after watching a preview i thought that this was not a movie for me and i was right
never again will i fall for the hype
unbelievable
disgusting blood orgy
dont get me wrong because ive given this movie such low rating
ive always loved dicaprios performance
prior to release when i read the synopsis and bit googling about hugh glass i started eagerly waiting for the movie
however after watching all i could think was even if this movie wasnt ever made nobody wouldve cared
the problem is not with the acting or direction cinematography etc
i just dont think it was needed to be made as theres nothing great about it
now i know there are plenty of movies out there which we dont care about
but when leonardo dicaprio is starring in a movie its like you must watch it and enjoy
all this movies about is survival which isnt highlighted as id hoped for and revenge
the problem is that these 2 things are sort of ignored by the director
we see lots of red indians french bla bla
its hard to explain perhaps someone with a better command of language can explain better after watching
this movie was so awesome that it actually convinced me of writing my first review
lets start with the good very nice winter scenery with top notch acting from leonard dicaprio
theres also lots of action scenes but did not find myself caring too much about the outcome
the bad very slow paced story about chuck norris crawling in the snow in the 1800s
first 2 hours are about glass surviving a bear maul attack being left for dead in a frozen forest with no water or food survives being dragged in a freezing river for miles survives falling on a horse of a cliff etc
come on really
then the revenge part takes about 20 minutes the bad guy flees an army fort with all the money and only 2 people go after him
really
i was so bored i actually noticed the sound track being really weird it sounded like a broken dripping faucet and it left me wondering if thats really a sound that can be heard in a frozen forest during winter
anyway to sum it up im really disappointed for wasting 2
5 hours to see this
contains spoiler it was expected from this movie in my opinion that doesnt contain a revenge story and rather contain one based on coping with nature and more survival
furthermore the dream scenes of the main character were awful and they did not create a good relation with the atmosphere of the movie
if it wasnt for these defects i would give this movie a 10
though the tow main actors did play their role skillfully and dialogues were brilliant the movie could include more captures of the spectacular landscapes and thoughtfully conversations
lets face it everything leo did in this movie i could have done
eat raw meat raw fish
no prob
crawl inside a fake dead horse
brave bad weather
what did he do that the average actor couldnt do
i literally laughed out loud when he swung his wobbly arm trying to chop a branch with a tomahawk
you see the muscles confused when called upon to do this manual labor
toss him upon a pile of supermodels and hes a natural but grab a shovel
which end
compare leo with spencer tracy or steve mcqueen two actors from real life
they worked served in the military etc
when they do things i believe they are doing things
leos oscar lowers the standard of acting excellence to whoever can bear extreme conditions when theyre otherwise used to yachts caviar and wolf of wall st
living
inarritu worked around this for the sake of the dicaprio brand but imagine keaton spitting and screeching his way through birdman
are you saying he would have won
let me put it to you this way and then ill thank you for your time leo dicaprio cannot act
leonardo dicaprio and tom hardy star in this 2015 drama based on the novel and inspired by true events
this takes place in the 1800s and dicaprio titanic plays hugh glass a frontiersman who leads a hunting expedition
soon glass is injured by a bear and left for dead by one of his men john fitzgerald hardy who not only betrays him but murders his son
glass struggles to survive the wilderness while regaining his strength and health to find fitzgerald
this is a great film with suspenseful and heartfelt moments dicaprio definitely gives an oscarworthy performance and theres beautiful remote settings
the film also shares similarities with the grey deliverance and cast away
i recommend this
dont even half to watch the full movie to know how terrible it is
looking at the trailer it seems almost unrecognizable from the book which i happened to read in two days
the main idea of the story was him being a ruthless fighter but it changed the whole prospective and added in characters of all sorts that werent needed
first of all he does not even have a son and his girlfriend not wife died while at sea who was not at all aboriginal
this was supposed to be based on a real mans story and they totally disregarded that and changed his history
they most likely used this to add a love interest or some sort of positive ethnicity image since a lot of the natives were portrayed as bad it was unnecessary and just sad
it took away the whole idea of proving himself to the people that left him to die
not surviving only to get revenge for his son and wife
it erased the whole meaning and i suggest giving a book a try
its a whole lot better then this st
wow just wasted 2
5 hours on watching this
was inclined to stop 20 minutes in but sucked it up
this movie tries too hard to be too many different genres slyly and to use all the techniques film has to the directors disposal
but no
this won best oscar
its a plainasday example of hollywood illuminati control fodder
leo is a bad actor wow
to be honest would of liked to of seen a young shatner because he is an actor
and this isnt a nature documentary this isnt a horror film dont use cameras and audio like it is and you are a desperate freshman film student showing his chops
and whoever wrote this or directed this
its bad
in not so many words historical and natural inaccuracies throughout clicha and failed homages and it takes a lot more skill to break the fourth wall as is popular now than was put into this piece of bullshit  310
the beginning is ok but the rest is crap
a man is mutilated by a grizzly bear and evil men let him lye dying and almost buried
but he soon very fast recovers unexpectually and can do everything in the wilderness
i expected to see an interesting and exiting movie but it turned out to be exceptional bad and boring  one of the worst movies i have ever experienced
how in the world can this ridiculous unwillingly funny movie get so good reviews
sudently he stands up and walks and talks and crawles along this lengthy movie
i can see a purpose in this film but my god it is weitten in capital letters
i did not feel anything about him just laughing at this rediculess and unsatisfiing movie
what a turn off
i really like leo and he does give a fine performance in this average movie but the ever annoying tom i can do ameeericannn accents hardy really racks me off
so if you want a treat the check out
man in the wilderness 1971
in the early 1800s a group of fur trappers and indian traders are returning with their goods to civilization and are making a desperate attempt to beat the oncoming winter
when guide zachary bass is injured in a bear attack they decide hes a goner and leave him behind to die
when he recovers instead he swears revenge on them and tracks them and their paranoiac expedition leader down
this story line sounds familiar
richard harris and john huston brilliant
sorry for the ones who loved the film but here is somebody who did not like it at all
in the end its just a typical you hit me bad but i will get you in the end wrapped up in beautiful cold landscapes and some historical background
i like leonardo a lot as an actor but that does not mean that all his films are good
in this one when if you daze away for a moment not difficult with those long scenes
you wake up and you could think you are watching first blood
i expected something much more epic not a simple revenge story
by the way was it really necessary to kill that bear
was she not just protecting her baby bears
is it really so necessary to show us so much violence dont we see already enough on the news
i am not sure if we really need those kind of film directors
i have seen movies with di caprio far better than that
good acting by leo but a boring boring movie
anyway leo has become a much better actor than what he was in his beginning there is no doubt about that
nice plots i like nature and violence scenes
ok
not for an oscar definitely
but as always
not always the best getting the oscar
they owe leo an oscar
and they should have given it earlier
that is why this movie gave him an oscar
just for that
same story with julia roberts
i really got disappointed
an average of 8 for a boring movie like that is strange
heightful 8 is much better with a better plot
