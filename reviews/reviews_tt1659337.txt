"\nWent to an advance screening expecting your usual \"shy kid in high\nschool learns to stick up for himself\" sort of feel-good drama. This\nmovie is so much more than that - I was truly blown away by the mature\nthemes and moving characters. Mental illness, sexual abuse, drugs and\nalcohol... I think the writer/screenwriter/director said it best in the\nQ+A after when he said it was a film that looked at the emotional\naspects of that point in life without being sentimental. I really cared\nabout these three teens - Charlie, Sam, and Patrick - and their story\nnever felt cheesy. Just real, and moving, and touching. Go see this\nmovie!\n"
"\nSaw this movie at TIFF and after watching the trailer was thinking I\nwas going to enjoy this movie. Those expectations now are so very low,\nthis movie is amazing. It speaks on many different levels of being a\nteenager, dealing with death, loneliness, and how awkward it can be\ntrying to fit in. I haven't seen a move like this in a very long time\nand was very refreshing. The highlight of the film for me at least from\na acting stand point is Ezra Miller really funny, but very heartfelt at\nthe same time. Don't get me wrong the whole case is amazing (Emma\nWatson was perfect for this after HP) but Ezra really stands out.\nStephen Chbosky really cared about this book, and it really shows in\nthis film. Him Directing and writing his own book was a amazing idea. <br><br>It's going to get many comparisons to a John Hughes film, and\nrightfully so this movie is heart felt and just amazing. <br><br>I will definitely being seeing this film again.\n"
"\nI saw the preview of this film and thought it was intriguing. I went to\na screening last week and was totally BLOWN AWAY......this film has\neverything. I grew up in this era were the internet highway was just\nabout to expload and I felt this film had EVERYTHING -great beginning =\ngrabbed your attention, then acceptance, then the complex happened and\nyou just didn't know where this film was going to go and then the film\nclosure or was it? This has to be the BEST DRAMA/LOVE STORY ....coming\nof age I have seen. I would recommend this film to ANYONE....LOVED IT\n!!!!!! PLEASE go see this film. I feel due to lack of advertisement\nthat it will be overlooked with other big blockbuster films but I\ntotally related to this film and LOVED IT !!! I haven't even heard\nabout this film until I was invited to a screening...saw the trailer\nand really wanted to see it but the trailer does not do it justice. If\nyou are looking for something to do on a weekend ...get out of the\nheat..please see this film\n"
"\nI just saw the movie at the Pgh premiere and it was amazing. I was\nhoping I wouldn't be disappointed because I loved the book so much. The\nmovie is very true to the book. A few things have been omitted or\nchanged but it doesn't change the mood of the story. I think the\ncasting choices were spot on. Emma Watson has a scene in which she\ntears up and cries and it was amazing. I also appreciate how Chbosky\nmade the parents thoughtful people, unlike most teen comedies. I am\ndefinitely going to see this movie again because there was so much to\ntake in. Very well done.<br><br>It's also lovely to see my hometown as the backdrop. Pgh is a beautiful\ncity and coming out of the Fort Pitt tunnels into the city is an\nexperience that isn't quite captured well enough in the film. It's\nstill a powerful scene and I teared up watching it.\n"
"\nMostly a trite and clichéd high school picture. Logan Lerman is miscast\nas a moody high school freshman (who looks like he' at least 16) who\nbefriends a group of seniors (Ezra Miller, Emma Watson and Mae Whitman\nchief amongst them) who help him come out of his shell. That's not too\nunbelievable, but it becomes increasingly silly when Whitman becomes\nromantically involved with him, and Stone, on whom Lerman is crushing,\nwould probably be game if she weren't already involved. This plays out\nlike a fantasy, not reality. If you've ever been in a high school as an\nadult the maturity difference between freshmen and seniors - Hell,\nfreshmen and sophomores - is hugely pronounced. Even among\nalterna-kids, no 18 year old girl is going to even think about dating a\n14/15 year old. I couldn't quite get over that, but that's hardly the\nonly flaw. Ezra Miller is definitely the stand-out. His homosexual\ncharacter is a bit cliché, but I was happy that they actually weren't\nafraid to give him a sex life (though not graphic, I'm surprised it\ndidn't land an R-rating because of it).\n"
"\nI'm not sure. I wanted to like this film, but I felt like I'd seen it\nall before elsewhere and better. The narrative is a little too crowded\nfor it's own good - and no one gets full attention, though all deserve\nit. Unlike some, I think the script might have benefited from being set\nin a specific time and place (it is, 1990's Pittsburgh - but it is\nnever stated). Like so much of this MTV book of the month selection, it\ntries to be universal instead of specific - even in it's characters.\nJoan Cussack is billed, but her role amounts to two scenes at the VERY\nend of the film, so (although she's no 'star' attraction) you spend\nmost of the time thinking \"I thought Joan Cussack was in this?\" But I\nguess this film is meant for a generation who doesn't know Joan\nCussack, is texting during the credits, and doesn't know Pittsburgh,\nand wasn't alive in 1990.\n"
"\nFirst world problems of rich suburban kids: The Movie. Or basically, a\nfeature-length episode of Degrassi.<br><br>This movie is filled with such whiny, pretentious, self-righteous,\nself-pity wallowing, predictable, teenage melodrama, that is so falsely\nattributed to be 'deep' and 'on point' that it's just plain hard to\ntake seriously in any stretch of the word. It's also an enigma; it's a\nfilm that many teenagers pretend to identify with, even though its view\nof typical teenage American life is so hollow, vacuous and\nfalsified...not to mention, very exploitative of real insecurities that\nteenagers feel, which are only used as superficial character 'defining'\ntraits, never to be elaborated on, to gain audience sympathy. It also\nonly touches on teenagers that live in wealthy suburban areas, making\nfor a very narrow field of their target demographic to represent. It\ncomes across as so insincere and manipulative that it's actually rather\ninfuriating and insufferable.\n"
"\nMovies like this are a disservice to real life kids in actual high\nschool today. No manic pixie dream girl (and her inclusive sidekick)\nreally exist, certainly not in high school, and no unsuspecting nerd is\ngoing to be swept up into a whirlwind of acceptance and parties and\nlove affairs. If this movie weren't about something people everywhere,\nthroughout all time, ever didn't experience for themselves, maybe it\nwould be entertaining. But they do. So it's just insultingly\nsaccharine. This movie should be categorized under fantasy, it's\ncertainly not relatable for kids, I think it only really serves as a\nguidebook for the MPDG wannabe's. IE: it's tripe. Thank goodness I\ndidn't see this while I was actually in high school and actually\nstruggling or this would have made me feel worse.\n"
"\nIt was a very well made movie, i started watching the Movie &amp; read the\nbook which i finished in 5hrz. i was into it perhaps the movie made me\nwanna read the book more. It a really interesting way of writing a\nbook. I'd encourage for anyone to read the book &amp; Watch the movie. I\nthought Emma Watson looked really good, Hot even &amp; I loved Logan\nhere...Ezra was just good, great even.<br><br>It hurt because i found relations to it, perhaps that's why i cried.\nthat moment when Sam (Emma Watson) touches Charlie's lap (Logan Lerman)\nwith that look in his eyes i knew something was wrong &amp; i cried.<br><br>Some of the songs are a good pick, some are just Duh!<br><br>Asleep by The Smiths (Oh Lovely track)<br><br>Love always JC\n"
"\nNirvana had it right. This film, set in the grunge heyday, was full of\nthe teenage angst that sells films and albums, but that leaves a empty\nspace when life moves on. Sure, it is an interesting coming of age\nstory, but I am bored with it's redundancies. Not much has changed from\nthen to now so there is not so much a kudos on it being a period piece,\nas many reviews had suggested, and in the places where it should have\nshown a difference in that age and this, it was not so accurate. Also,\nas much as I love Emma Watson, she seemed timid and her American accent\nwas flimsy. The best part of this film was the character of Patrick,\nwhich is a given. The book seemed so much more profound when I read it\nin my teens, but I can't say if it is the story that had changed for\nthe film, or just me changing with age.\n"
"\nA friend of mine recommended the book, but it was really difficult to\nfind it in my country. I don't know the book, but the movie is almost\nperfect. Emma Watson (Harry Potter) is amazing and, in this movie, is\nthe perfect partner for Logan Lerman. They both alone have that spark\nneeded to be in front of a camera but together are an explosion of\nfeelings. <br><br>Regarding the subject, when you start watching the movie, you feel that\nit will be another typical High-School movie but it is not. This movie\nwill catch you every 5 minutes with different wonders. After watching\nthe movie you will not be able to know how to feel.\n"
"\nThe Perks of Being a Wallflower is a movie adapted from the epistolary\nnovel written by Stephen Chbosky about Charlie played by Logan Lerman,\na teenager who lives his freshman year of high school. He has to cope\nwith struggles such as the suicide of his best friend, his difference\ncompared to the others teenagers, problems with his family,... During\nthe year, Charlie will get closer to Sam and her step-brother, Patrick\nplayed by Emma Watson and Ezra Miller. During the movie, you learn more\nabout Charlie's life and that he has to cope with more than high school\nproblems. This story shows many teenagers' issues.I think that many\nteenagers could relate to it. I really recommend this movie or even the\nbook, because it is a very moving story.\n"
"\nWhile this film might not be for everyone I think it's great for the\ntime that we are in. For me the film excellently portrays a story about\nbeing socially disconnected. It touched me because I can relate and I'm\nsure (especially based on other reviews) that is has touched a lot of\nother people as well. <br><br>Acting was very good if not great. Emma Watson clearly has potential\nand put in a good shift. Ezriel Miller was the standout in my opinion\nand adds more depth to the film with his character contributing so the\noverall story line and message of the film.<br><br>Definitely a must watch film for anyone looking to see a good storyline\nand take a break from all the big budget movies.\n"
"\nActually I don't think there was a single shark attack. I kept thinking\nthroughout the film, \"maybe this is where the shark will come and\nattack.\", but i don't even recall a scene where any characters were\neven near the ocean. The whole story takes place around Pittsburgh,\nwhich is in western Pennsylvania. This is an area world renowned for\nhaving no sharks. The cast was great, Ezra Miller being the standout,\nbut I feel like they shouldn't sell a movie on a marketing campaign\naround shark attacks, and then have no gosh darn shark attacks. The\nmovie felt as if it were leading up to a trip to the ocean, where Logan\nLerman's character would be attacked by a shark. This motion picture\nwas almost all build up with no payoff, the payoff here being that\nthere were no sharks, and no shark attacks. Jaws was a good movie,\nbecause it promised shark attacks, was suspenseful, and had shark\nattacks. That is how you make quality cinema.\n"
"\nThis is my first review and its brief. I do not understand the need for\nlengthy reviews. After watching this four times in six days i felt\ncompelled to give my own ten pence worth. I've never seen a film like\nthis where i have loved all the characters. The cast are brilliant and\nstory moves along at a nice pace. The soundtrack is amazing. I love\nmovies and its very rare that one comes along like this that works on\nso many levels. I am not usually one for this sort of genre and came\nclose to taking this back before actually watching it. I am so glad i\ndid not. Its going to be a very long time before something tops this.\nThis is a feel good movie with some disturbing undertones. If you love\nmovies and want something that moves you emotionally then this is for\nyou.\n"
"\nEvery once in awhile a movie comes along that completely surprises you.\nAfter sifting through all the major blockbusters that come out every\nyear there is always a movie like \"Perks of Being a Wallflower\",\nwritten and directed by Pittsburgh's own Stephen Chbosky, that\nsurpasses everyone's expectations and ends up being one of the best\nfilms of the year, despite being an independent film. \"Perks\" does so\nmany things right. Chbosky assembled a cast and then knocked this thing\nout of the park. He does something big blockbuster so often don't do,\nhe makes you characters that genuinely care about which makes the film\nas powerful as any other you will see this year. I highly recommend\n\"Perks\", if for no other reason than that it's by far one of the most\nheartfelt and original films you will see this year.\n"
"\nBad acting and a script that lacks any credibility. A high school\nfreshman mixing to this degree with a group of seniors? An outwardly\ngay student not getting any abuse, especially in the era the film\ndepicts? Charlie wearing a tie so often? Wine always available to these\nkids at their parties? Charlie the only one eating the hash brownie and\ntaking the hit of acid? How could the fight scene go on so long in the\nschool cafeteria without any teacher/monitor ever present? Even with\nthe built-up rage Charlie had inside, how could this scrawny kid stop\nthe gang beating underway? These are a few of my many questions for the\nfilm makers and those who wrote all the positive reviews of this very\nweak film.\n"
"\nYet another movie that I am baffled by the rating and positive\nresponse. The acting is very awkward and forced. Logan does a pretty\ngood job... he didn't talk a whole lot. He would just say his one line\nand looks would be exchanged and then end scene. Emma's accent was\nhorrendous. I swear there were moments of actually pauses and silence\nin her scenes because the three actors must not have spent enough time\ntogether because their friendship didn't seem real at all. I hate when\nmovies have to cram all these scenes from the book into a short movie,\nit hardly ever works out for the fans. I just wanted MORE from it! I\ndidn't get that deep emotional feeling I got from reading the book.\n"
"\nFirstly,i want to say i love actors in this movie.I know Emma Watson\nfrom Harry Potter movies.She was a hardworking and pretty girl in Harry\nPotter.But now,she is a reckless girl.Already,Ezra Miller and Logan\nLerman are successful of their job.Absolutely,they're talented\npeople.Other than this,they are together in harmony. Also,the plot is\nvery absorbing.I think it's best one type of teenage movies.It's so\ndramatic for me.I cried but i was a little bit happy after watch\nit.We're watching to the story of a teenager boy finding himself.It's\nreminds me when you found yourself,you will catch the real\nhappiness.Maybe,someone makes you feel better in high-school. So,you\nshould watch this film and go find yourself!\n"
"\nThis film has changed my life, if I could compare myself with a movie\nit was this. Sometimes you feel bad, sometimes good,but when I watch\nthis film gives me a sense of relief again. Every time I cry at\ndifferent times. I help myself with it to let go emotionally. I really\nloved the book, but the characters were so perfect for each roll.\nSometimes i wish i could have friends or even someone that share the\nmind of me. ( with this movie and the feeling i got when i watch it.\nand also why i watch it ( and so much ) it really hits me every time.\nit makes me feel so much at once. my favorite movie.<br><br>I am proud to be a wallflower.\n"
"\nI think this movie resonates with a lot of people for a lot of reasons.\nI think everyone relates to these moments, in one way or another. Maybe\nwe see ourselves in these characters, maybe we relate to the importance\nof friendship and being loved at this time in our lives. I don't know\nif everyone feels the way I do about it, but I know that the movie has\nthe ability to elicit strong emotions, good or bad.<br><br>I love how the author of the book adapted it for the screen. It feels\nmore authentic,a true vision. He's able to craft a handful of really\nbeautiful moments, and wrap them in a story that I find emotional and\ncomforting. I love the actors in all the roles, they really brought\nthese characters to life.<br><br>The final moments are just gorgeous, and it's the main reason for my\nDavid Bowie avatar.\n"
"\nI think it is one of the bests.I saw this movie because I like Logan\nLerman a lot.But I don't know why all his films should have a bad end\nand I should cry every time |: . If i want to recommend a movie to a\ngirl actually I recommend this. Bur if I want recommend to a boy I will\nshow him Fury. It is as nice as this of course. Emma Watson was good\ntoo but better than Mr.Lerman But there is some mistakes.In theater we\ncan see some Ideas that advertises Sexual promiscuity.Or having freedom\nin everything. It cant be true and I disagree.But I learned a lot of\nlessons of this movie.Being happy...showing my feeling without fear or\nanything else.Thank you to read\n"
"\nNot your average coming-of-age teen movie!<br><br>Stephen Chbosky's novel \"The Perks of Being a Wallflower\" marks malls\nand search engine results even before it was released. The trailer\nalone is already making a buzz in and around the media. Emma Watson's\nface caught my attention at first glance on it aside from the apple\ngreen background.<br><br>Since it is an adaptation, I find it quite rare to hear good reviews\nfrom people who have read the novel. It is about 15-year-old Charlie,\nan endearing and naive outsider, coping with first love Sam, the\nsuicide of his best friend, and his own mental illness while struggling\nto find a group of people with whom he belongs. The introvert freshman\nis taken under the wings of two seniors, Sam and her step-brother\nPatrick who welcome him to the real world new experiences, new\nfriends, music, and drugs.\n"
"\nIt doesn't sound like a promising title but it turns out that it's a\nsurprisingly engaging and charming film. <br><br>The film occasionally lapses into narration which is probably the only\nminor irritation. I understand that the original book of the same name\nuse a letter writing device and I suspect that the film makers were\nrather too fond of the idea. <br><br>The three central characters play their characters very well and\ndeserve the cabinet full of awards they have won between them. Emma\nWatson, being the best know, probably has a harder job but pulls it off\nwith the aplomb of a true professional. <br><br>It's nice to see the gay character of Patrick (Ezra Miller) being\nportrayed in a positive light and challenging issues of mental health\nand suicide being handled in a direct but sensitive way. <br><br>A quality production definitely worth multiple views.\n"
"\nDirected by Stephen Chbosky, based on his own bestseller, \"The Perks of\nBeing a Wallflower\" tells the story of a group of young \"Wallflowers\" a\nterm for people extremely introvert, shy, that avoids being part of or\nrather exclude themselves from most common social circles and therefore\nfeel a hard time making friends. In this film ,in particular, the\norigin of these disorders is often of sexual nature, although this is\nnot the central aspect of the story. In the same line of \"Dead Poets\nSociety\" (1989 ), this film reminds the adolescence and the\nunforgettable friends who pass through our lives and make us \"feel\ninfinite.\" Almost like Remy's cooks in \"Ratatouille\" (2007 ), this film\narouses feelings and memories that are not always present, but are\ndeeply rooted in the depths of our souls. A love story, a story of\nfears and insecurities, but most of all a self-discovery therapy.\n"
"\nThis movie accurately can describe to teens how they can be both happy\nand sad. It will help them understand their feelings and mentality much\neasier than any counselor. They will no longer feel alone. They will\nlearn the struggles of their peers. Also it will teach kids that being\ngay is not easy so why pick on those who are? It will help them\nunderstand why they may have bad relationships. You accept the love you\nthink you deserve. And you can only start being happy when you learn to\naccept your past for what it is. So if you are a high school student\nthat has gone through a lot this movie might be for you. If you are\nboth happy and sad then this movie is definitely for you.\n"
"\nThis is my all time favorite movie!! The plot is so relatable and I\nrespect that. I have watched this so many times and every time I watch\nit I get the same enjoyable experience as the first time I watched it\n:) I cannot rave about how much I love this enough!! It is an emotional\nroller coaster and it is like you are going through it along with\nCharlie. I always recommend it to my friends if they have not seen it\nand make them watch it with me so I can experience it with them. It is\nvery similar to the book and I enjoy that because a lot of movies in\nthe past have ruined the books. This movie kept me captivated and\ninterested the entire time. Best 102 minutes of my life and for that I\ngive it a 10/10!!\n"
"\nI got this movie recommended by a girl in my media class and after\nseeing that it got a pretty good rating i decided to give it a chance.\nThe movie takes on some pretty big issues/themes as sexual abuse, drug\nand how tough it is to be a teenager, but i feel like we don't get to\nreach through the surface and are only briefly introduced to these\nthings which makes it kinda \"meh\" And i love \"me and earl and the dying\ngirl\" but this movie just didn't get the same emotions through, it had\ngreat potential to be one of my all time favorites but it kinda slips\nseveral times. 6/10 because i liked the theme and it was slightly above\naverage\n"
"\nIf John Hughes and Cameron Crowe had made a movie together it would\nprobably have been very similar to 'The Perks Of Being A Wallflower'.<br><br>The older I get, the more these kinds of teenage melodramas grate on my\nnerves, but I was gob smacked by how emotionally invested I became\nhere. The bulk of the credit goes to the cast (particularly the three\nyoung leads; Logan Lerman, Emma Watson and Ezra Miller), who at first\nseem too poised and too pretty to play these broken characters, but\nonce the story begins to peel back the layers they really shine, and\nconsequently so does the movie.<br><br>For teenagers this is required viewing. For adults your mileage may\nvary.\n"
"\nI'm a 60-year-old guy who's never been lucky enough to fall in love but\nI love watching other people, especially kids, fall in love. This film\nwas perfect for me. It took you through every imaginable emotion that\nteenagers would experience. It covers a range of themes, including\ndrugs (a little) and homosexuality (a little more).<br><br>There are many funny moments and it was touching throughout. All the\nyoung performers are superb in their roles. These are performances they\nwill always be proud of. I got so involved with the main characters, I\nwas gripping my seat a couple of times. I don't want to give away any\nof the main plot points. I'll just say that it is a heartwarming story\nvery well told. If you were a teenager once or you're just a sucker for\na good story about young love, don't miss this movie!\n"
"\nThis stands with the best of the classic movies about growing up - The\nBreakfast Club, Pretty in Pink, and Some Kind of Wonderful, while all\nthe while being loads more real than any of those films. This is a\nfunny (easily a dozen times where the audience laughed out loud),\nprofoundly moving, and inspiring piece of film.<br><br>The performances are near-perfect - beautifully raw, genuine, and\nlacking in self-consciousness. Any doubt that Emma Watson can't be\nanything but Hermione goes out the window here; she's lovely, aching,\nalive, and spot-on. Logan Lerman has a palpable vulnerability that\nmakes you root for him to become the creative being you know he can be.\nEzra Miller has the sweetly manic energy, charisma and bright smile\nthat gives his character a live-wire presence. <br><br>And kudos for touching on the importance that surroundings have on\nyoung lives: the city and it's features (tunnels, bridges, hillsides)\nbecome effective drivers of what these kids are going through as they\nemerge into fully emotional beings. Buy a ticket, and see this one.\nNow.\n"
"\nI won't be saying much about this film I just want to recommend it, I'm\na film student and I'm recently writing a screenplay about people that\nwe think they don't exist but have much to tell.<br><br>the character development is pretty well made, directing, and acting\nare OK, even though i wasn't pleased with Emma Watson's accent, Ezra\nMiller proves he can be a great actor cause his character is very\ndifferent from \"We need to talk about Kevin\", the Photography was too\nglossy for my taste, not a perfect choice, soundtrack is amazing.<br><br>in general if you are looking for a film about characters and emotion\ndevelopment this is your type of movie, a comedy drama that develops\nquite nice, a very good effort for a second time director.\n"
"\nAs I downloaded this film from iTunes, I didn't have great expectations\nfor it but thought it would be a fun watch to pass some time. After\nonly a few minutes I was drawn in and immersed in a rich cast and\nstory.<br><br>The movie not only follows the main character through his social life,\nbut also through his thoughts as he struggles with a problematic\nchildhood memory which, for me, made the film. The flashbacks give an\namazing view of the character and help to define his personality and\nmake him very human to the point I could relate very well.<br><br>Through the highs and lows of the detailed times, the viewer is swept\nthrough emotions with the character. I, personally, finished the film\non the verge of crying a mixture of tears of sadness and joy.<br><br>The casting is absolutely perfect and I cannot imagine anyone better to\nplay the parts, which heavily supports the story and makes the\ncharacters more 'real'.<br><br>This is a must watch film for everyone out there.\n"
"\nThis should be a drama about young people lost in loneliness, their\nroles as outsiders &amp; how they handle their difficult situation. But it\nturns out that the movie is actually about some spoiled kids born into\nwealth, feeling absolutely confident &amp; comfortable in their dandy-role,\ndoing cool stuff all the time, partying hard &amp; even win the hearts of\nthe ones they want to. I expected a little bit more than a 90min story\nwithout ANY problems &amp; aggravated circumstances. The story has no\nclimax &amp; no turning point at all which makes it absolutely redundant\ntelling it in movie-length. you might get bored after 30min, expecting\na sweeping change in their lives &amp; relationships but you are definitely\ndisappointed after 90min when nothing of that happened. I have to ask:\nwhere is the drama &amp; why these kids have no problems to speak about?\nAmerican drama? American irrelevance.\n"
"\nAn internal look at the life of teenagers in high school in the 80's\nUnited States, a special world of intolerance, humiliation, pain, drugs\nand love. The lovely performance from the young actors create a true\nempathy towards them and especially to the main character, whose\nbehavior is hard to understand. 7/10.\n"
"\nnot a regular teen movie, where all is about getting a girl/guy, sex ,\nor drugs have more than that Emma , and Logan Lerman have done well and\nthey carry the movie . the film have a good mood in itself , i would\nrecommend to watch this movie alone and to enjoy the theme of film , at\nsome points movie have some regular annoying spots but they were\nrequired and they were not stretched out , at all its a good movie to\nwatch ,( it's my first review let me know hows it )\n"
"\nYou will hate this movie. There's no question about it. You will hate\nit because you will find it stupid and/or boring... or you will hate it\nbecause you relate to it so much. In the case of the second one, the\nhatred will be caused by the disconnection from reality as real life is\nrarely this perfect for an introvert. <br><br>If you're neither, then I find not point for you watching this. It's\nwell made and rather well acted, however relating to this, adds so damn\nmuch that regular watching might just seem stupid. <br><br>I've watched it a couple of times and it's true on all levels... even\nthe awkwardness. No complains from me, but then again, I am a light\ncritic.<br><br>I have to give this movie one thing for sure... it does capture the\nmind quite perfectly. Our mind is the biggest source of our troubles\nand this movie shows it quite nicely.\n"
"\nKARLA<br><br>The main characters are Charlie, Sam, and Patrick. I think the actors\nwere very good throughout the whole movie. the y looked liked they\nreally connected with the character they were playing. They looked\nreally focused and it actually seemed like they were really living the\nmoment.<br><br>My favorite part was at the end where they are in the tunnel. I like\nthat part because I feel like Charlie finally knows where he belongs\nand does not feel lost anymore. Also because I feel like in that part\nthey really are connected with each other and they are finally living\nthe moment being happy and proud.<br><br>I think I liked the book more because it had more details and you\ndefinitely get stuck on to the characters. It's like if you were to be\nable to relate to their situation and actually know them as person.\nAlso because since you get more detail in the book you can somewhat\nimagine the scenes better.<br><br>On a scale of 1-5 I would give the movie a 4 because it didn't show\nmuch detail like the book. Overall the movie was good and engaging\nwhich i really liked.\n"
"\nThe movie perks of being a wallflower is a movie about a 15 years old\nteenager named Charlie. He is an introverted person and has mental\nissues. He was molested during his childhood by his aunt. He blames\nhimself for his aunt's death. As he struggles through his freshman year\nin high school, two seniors, Sam and Patrick help him. They introduce\nCharlie to the real world. Charlie falls in love with Sam in their\nfirst meeting. He tries to be restraint to his feelings but that leads\nto much bigger conflicts. He had a disorder called dissociative\ndisorder.(The movie doesn't mention it). Finally, he manages to learn\nhow to cope with his mental illness. I highly recommend this movie for\npassive teenagers.\n"
"\nFantastic role play by all the actors in the movie. The best thing\nabout the movie is that the story line. In the story it is shown that\ncharlie was very silent and because of the some past events he was\nalways depressed. When he joined the high school it was very difficult\nfor a fresher in the first year without friends. But he got support\nfrom his English teacher and some days later he met few friends Patrick\nand Sam and fell in love with Sam but couldn't express his love as he\nthought she loves Craig. But at the end Sam and Charlie fell in love\nwith each other few days later Sam left for her college so, again\nCharlie became depressed and gone to do suicide. But his family took\nhim to doctor and after few months of treatment he decided to live. In\nthe end of the movie Sam and Patrick came to Charlie's house and then\nthey left for a night out. At that time Charlie feels like infinite.\n"
"\nThe Perks of Being a Wallflower is a great screen adaptation by an\nincredibly gifted author, screenwriter, and director; Stephen Chbosky.\nHe has masterfully brought enjoyment, and a feeble attempt of depth, to\na story of a teenager coming to terms with himself. Played by Logan\nLerman, the main story driver, the audience is exposed to a wild ride\nof emotions, and vulnerable situations. Emma Watson, the star capture\nof the movie, brings little to the plate, and seems replaceable.\nRegardless, it tries very hard to make sense of life's hard lessons,\nand is willing to breach the taboo lines. The Perks of being a\nWallflower is a dramatically cute story.\n"
"\n\"The perks of being a wallflower\" is a warm movie through all its cold\nand bitter moments and truths. It tells the story of Charlie, fresh to\nHigh School, who didn't have much luck with friends so far and who\nsuddenly finds himself in a group of people he seems to belong to, yet\nit also causes him some trouble to really take a stand for himself.<br><br>Of course you could argue that in some point the movie seems a bit like\nthe typical Hollywood Popcorn cinema but I do believe that it carries\non an important message. Maybe it can give hope to some lonely hearts\nout there and show them that wherever there are bad people, there are\nalso some good around.<br><br>As you can already see from my description, the film moves along a thin\nline between beauty and cliché but I have to say that for me it stayed\non the beautiful side more often and so, all in all, I do recommend to\ngive it a try and see if you can draw something out of it.\n"
"\nThere were times when i thought it would be a little cringy and\nclichéd. This fear was *almost* entirely unwarranted. The lead actors\ndelivered a convincing performance of some very interesting and multi\ndimensional characters. I engaged well with the story even though\nAmerican high school movies aren't usually my cup of tea. Special\ncredit to Emma Watson for shaking of Hemionie as she will probably\nalways be remembered for harry potter. Even the coldest heart will feel\na tear forming in some places although you have to watch the whole film\nto understand what i mean. It is no good watching it in small parts as\nit is very much a film which provokes a strong emotional response in\nthe audience since everyone can identify with someone/something in the\nfilm over a slowly moving, but none the less compelling plot.\n"
"\nThis is a beautiful movie and was so very candid. There are movies made\naround the high school theme which give you a feeling that its just\nanother grind of a teen flick formula. But then something like this\ncomes and blows out your mind - imagine characters as fleshed out as\nthe one in Archies comics coming together in the 80s and you have\nactors like Ema watson - Perks of being a wallflower is of this kind.\nThe movie was so captivating that the audience will become those\nteenagers from the 80s-90s and if you have lived long back during those\nyears, the movie is very relatable and plaudible. It brings back your\nhigh school romances or would have beens ;) - friendships, ..everything\nwith minute glimpses but still keeping an underlying story element till\nthe end. Must watch for fans of this genre and kind. Cheers!\n"
"\nI absolutely loved this movie and it's characters, but some aspects of\nit were odd. Such as the dead friend of Charlie sure he writes to him\nsometimes in the movie and he mentions him when he is high. Other than\nthat we only get flashbacks of his Aunt Helen which I get must be\ntragic. But if one of your best friends shoots himself and your left\nalone in high school wouldn't we see some sort of flashbacks or other\nmentions of it other than when he's high on pot and when he's writing\nto him? We never get to know the friend. Besides that it's a really\ntouching movie and I would definitely recommend watching it if you're\nin high school. It also shows the many types of people you will meet in\nhigh school along with appealing to romance lovers such as myself. Very\ngood watch.\n"
"\nthat's my first Review and i can't believe i'm writing it. this movie\nf**ked me up seriously. I completely felt the whole movie. the acting\nis so so so amazing,music etc...... this movie describe my half life\ntill now. <br><br>I kinda wish someone had warned me about this film, and at the same\ntime, kinda happy I had no idea what was coming. If I had known exactly\nwhat this film was about, I may have been slightly reticent to go see\nit by myself, but I think I would have been equally as embarrassed to\nhave seen it with other people.<br><br>Why? Because five minutes in, the film managed to grab hold of me on an\nemotional level like no film has done in decades, forcing me to fight\nagainst tears tooth and nail right through until the credits began to\nroll. And I am not exaggerating. Not even remotely.\n"
"\nI've got this movie for a long time, and I've never watched it and at\nthe same time I couldn't get rid of it cause my friends kept telling me\nthat it's a great movie. I thought the movie's a boring and childish\nhigh school themed sort of movie that does not worth my time! two weeks\nago, out of nowhere I decided to watch it. I had no idea what sort of\ntreasure I've been keeping in my archive !! the novel's story is\nbeautifully pictured, the actors are incredibly talented (bravo to the\nactor choice) , the whole movie is unbelievably beautiful.God knows I'm\nsearching for the best words to describe this masterpiece , but once\nyou watch it, you're gonna be wordless like me. I've watched the movie\n3 times so far, and I believe everyone should watch it at least twice.\np.s: Logan Lerman is brilliant and Ezra Miller's act in this movie,\nmade him one of my favorites!\n"
"\nCharlie starts high school after going through some mental health\nissues and he ends up being the wallflower. I haven't read the book, so\nmy opinion is only based on what I have watched only. As a Logan Lerman\nfan, I wanted to see him pull off a character more complex than his\nprevious ones, and he manages to get Charlie through, without overdoing\nit. The rest of the cast were excellent as well. The soundtrack was a\nreason of it's own to make someone watch the film, as well as the\nstory. The only problem was the story line. For me, I would rather had\nCharlie's character being unfolded earlier in the film, than just in\nthe end, and even that it wasn't explained very well. The flash backs\nwere tiring at some points, too. So 7 out of 10.\n"
"\nThis move will excel all preexpectations you have of it, whether they\nbe good or bad. It is a film which speaks to people on all different\nlevels, and blends so many different deep and emotional aspects\ntogether (drugs, mental illness, sexual abuse...) in perfect fashion.\nThe acting from the entire cast is flawless from start to finish, and\nlike films of this nature and calibre should, you genuinely grow\nattached too and feel for the main characters. I have watched this\npicture several times and am still blown away by the superiority of\neverything from the cinematography to the soundtrack. I would strongly\nadvise everyone to watch this film; it is real, it is poignant, and it\nis truly heartwarming. 10/10.\n"
"\nAlmost the whole movie i had seen before in others. Yet something kept\nme hooked. The characters are so likable.<br><br>Sam (Emma Watson) and Patrick (Ezra Miller) are 2 seniors, who are step\nsiblings, who take freshman ,Charlie (Logan Lerman), under their wing\nand out of his comfort zone. Charlie is a very awkward and quiet guy.\nSam and Patrick are the completely opposite. The underlining story and\ntone to this movie is surprisingly dark. As much as you think it will\nbe just another Coming of age/Highschool Drama, it's not. Everyone of\nthe characters has their issues. The twist honestly was one that I had\nnot seen coming.\n"
"\nAn introvert freshman (Logan Lerman) is taken under the wings of two\nseniors who welcome him to the real world.<br><br>It baffles me that kids who are so into underground music seem to have\nno idea who David Bowie is. That makes no sense. But I completely get\nwhat they were about. This is something I can identify with in many\nrespects, liking underground music and being in the outcast clique. We\nnever had gay drama, and I am not big on Rocky Horror (though many\nare), but I can see this.<br><br>Not a bad story overall, and it is really driven by having Emma Watson\nplay Sam. With or without her, it would be a good film, but I think she\nprovides the star power and the emotional vulnerability that really\nsell the character. She is really the only big star in the film, other\nthan those who were left to be little more than cameos (Paul Rudd, Joan\nCusack). Incidentally, great casting of Tom Savini... what the heck is\nhe doing here?\n"
"\nGreatest movie I have ever seen. Could relate to Charlie on so many\nlevels. Also, I would recommend Chbosky's book as well. The acting was\nterrific. I particularly enjoyed the love story between Emma and\nLogan's characters. I like the issues that it touched on. One of the\nonly movies I am willing to re-watch. The movie makes you re-think the\npeople around you. This is the only movie I have ever given a 10/10 out\nof over half a thousand as even its flaws can be viewed as purposeful\nand necessary to the work as a whole. The movie will pull on your\nemotions in every which way from the very on-set until the figurative\ncurtains are drawn.\n"
"\nI looked forward to seeing this and wanted to love it. I really did. It\nlooked like an intelligent, deep story.<br><br>But, it was painful to watch. I felt like I was watching a series of\nacting-class vignettes performed by students who paid Dylan McDermott\nto watch the scenes and critique their work.<br><br>Too bad, too, because the premise of the story is quite solid and\ninteresting. An introverted teenager comes out of his shell with a\nlittle help from his friends, who have their own major issues. A shame\nit was all ruined by acting-class caliber performances.<br><br>Like I said, I really wanted to love it, but ...\n"
"\nThis movie is beyond amazing and relates to most of all teenagers. See\ni'm a loner and a wallflower, and this movie explained everything. It's\nalmost as if Logan Lerman was reading out my diary as Charlie. I\nrecommend this movie to anybody that feels like a loner, wallflower, or\nshy. I also recommend this title to any teenagers. This movie amazed me\nit portrays the different types of best friends and basic teenage\nproblems. This title is heartfelt while also being funny. Ezra Miller,\nLogan Lerman, and Emma Watson made an amazing performance. Some might\nfind this movie dramatic or maybe cheesy, but it's not at all. Ever\nsince I watched this movie I began to understand that it's okay.\n"
"\nI have created my IMDb account just to give this movie 10 stars. <br><br>The story is so beautiful and so touching, that you will actually feel\nall the emotions running through the film. You can connect with the\ncharacters so easily. The truth is I watched this film only for Emma\nwatson, but the performance of Logar Lerman took my breath away. I have\nno words to describe how much I was impressed by his performance. Emma\nwatson has also done an amazing job in this film. She is definitely\ngrowing as an actor in every film and you can feel that in her\nperformance. <br><br>The introvert, shy boy who has an awful childhood meets a guy and a\ngirl who change his life completely. They take him under their wing,\nbecome his friends, and shows him the true meaning of friendship. It's\na very sweet story in which the boy fells in love with the girl but is\ntoo shy to tell her. I won't take away your chance to enjoy this\nwonderful movie by telling you the entire story. Go and watch this\nmovie, I assure you, you will most certainly like this movie.\n"
"\nWow! This movie is so great. It suits for anyone, all the actors and\nactresses were great. I cannot stop thinking about this movie, like I\nam blown away by how great this movie was. In fact, no exact words can\nexplain how amazing this movie is. I know it's already late but this is\nwell recommended to watch for those who haven't watched it yet because\nyou don't have any idea what you are missing for. I've already watched\na lot of movies close to it's genre and some of them are also good but\nthis one is different in a way that everyone can relate with it and\nwill inspire a lot of people which makes it exceptional. You can't\nactually compare it to others, it's just really great.\n"
"\nThe perks of being a Wallflower is without doubt one of the best movies\nI have seen in a long long time. Everything from the Characters to the\nSetting was excellent and I find it difficult to fault at all. The\nsoundtrack in my opinion was superb, and fitted the theme of the movie\nexcellently. (though I can see how it doesn't suit everyone's taste).\nIt may come across as I am being biased to this film, but as a person\nwho hasn't read the book, I can honestly say it was fantastic as a film\non it's own. It has definitely made me want to read the source\nmaterial. All of the actors I thought played the parts very well and at\nsome select points on the film, I found myself empathising with Charlie\non multiple occasions. This film will make you laugh, cry, and intrigue\nyou for the time it is on and make you think about it long after the\ncredits roll. Overall a superb film and well worthy of a watch for most\naudiences. Please, please, please bear my thoughts in mind and go and\nsee this movie, you will not regret it. <br><br>10/10, Easily. (:\n"
"\nThe perks of being a wallflower is a very great movie! it displays many\nof the problems thats among very many teenagers, but in a good way.<br><br>The movie follows the high school freshman Charlie and his journey\ntrough freshman year. The movie is about the great ups and the low\ndowns about being in high school.<br><br>The cast of this movie i incredible ever actor is so in to their\ncharacter and it is a perfect match. This shows that it is a life for\nEmma Watson outside Hogwarts.<br><br>The movie adaptation was maybe a little week from the book, some scenes\nthat i thought was important was missing, but all in all this is one of\nmy favorite movies. So i would call this the best high school movie so\nfar.\n"
"\nThe movie is worth watching. Although it seems a teenage movie, it can\nalso be watched from more variety of people. The soundtracks are really\nqualified. Also, the movie gives great stories from lives of the\ncharacters with bunch of many different emotions; sadness, happiness,\ncraziness. These emotions can be easily followed from the characters\nbehaviour and sayings. The movie is converted from a book. I did not\nread but there are also positive comments about the book. -spoiler- -\nWe accept the love we think we deserve - Can we make them know they\ndeserve more? - We can try. -spoiler- \"you can't be yourself until you\nbe yourself with someone else together.\"\n"
"\nI am watching this movie again as I write. It really is a story of\nlove, acceptance and friendship. It is about overcoming bad things that\nhappen to you and finding out who you are. A great message. We can all\nrelate to Charlie's attempt at trying to fit in. There are a lot of\npoignant scenes in this movie and a lot of funny little things like\nmaking us older people remember about how important it was to make a\n\"mix\" tape to show your love for someone. Ezra Miller is a great young\nactor and I'm sure we'll be seeing a lot of Emma Watson as she becomes\none of the few child actors that succeeds as an adult. Looking forward\nto seeing her and Logan Lerman in \"Noah\".\n"
"\nThe Perks of Being a Wallflower came recommended to me by a friend\nafter I revelled in the watching of The Spectacular Now. My limited\nknowledge of the book led me to believe it would be the standard\nintrovert kid turned popular high school socialite, like many a title\nbefore it. However, the film presented me with a tortured protagonist\nwho finds his place amongst another bunch of misfits. It is the\nrelationship of this band of friends, which is so expertly interwoven\nwith the main storyline that captured my imagination. These\nrelationships, coupled with an excellent soundtrack, helped me to reach\na profound examination of society; a realisation that despite our own\nself-doubts, that we are part of a society where everyone has their own\nissues. It is in no way a life- changing film, but it is one that will\nleave you contemplating your own social decisions.\n"
"\nDrugs, Alcohol, Depression, this movie expresses the Pros and Cons of\nbeing a teenager, a shy kid, a wallflower. I was very surprised with\nLogan Lermans performance, he showed a lot of passion and sincerity in\nhis performance. This film also showcases that Emma Watson isn't that\nlittle sorcerer from Harry Potter. Ezra Miller is an excellent actor\nwhom definitely fills the role of Patrick. I have read the book and\nwhile I the movie isn't as good as the book it is pretty dang good. It\nshows teenagers have many secrets, many hardships but all together\nstick together while they find themselves in their high school journey.\nThis movie is one of my favorites and deserves to be given a 10. It\nmade me feel different after watching, more calm in a way. Watch it and\nyou wont be disappointed.\n"
"\nI absolutely loved this film - specifically the acting, music and even\nat times the cinematography. Steven Chbosky captured the spirit of the\nbook and the characters magnificently - Ezra and Logan give exceptional\nperformances that deserve major credit. Emma gives a strong performance\nas Sam - you can tell that she really understands the character,\nhowever she does struggle a bit with the American accent. Not to worry\nEzra is hilarious but not gimmicky, and can flip to a somber tone at a\nmoment's notice and have everyone spellbound. Also great performances\nfrom Mae Whitman, Nina Dobrev and Johnny Simmons. The young cast is\ntruly the heart of the film and are all really great. There is a lot of\nhumour, emotion, honesty, everything it needed, and also an excellent\nsoundtrack to back it up.\n"
"\nThis film was a huge and pleasant surprise for me to see, and I'm sorry\nI didn't see it in 2012 when it had originally come out. The critical\nreviews were good but not great, and when there's so much out there,\nyou try to make the best choices you can on the information that you\nhave.<br><br>I didn't see the surprise end coming at all. It really blew me away.\nEmma Watson was also extremely compelling and charismatic in this film.\nAnd while of course there were a few lines spoken by high school\nstudents in the film that were a little too mature/clever for their\nages, it doesn't go overboard like in Juno or Brick, and of course\nmovies are made to entertain.<br><br>I really thought they \"got\" a lot of what high school was about and\nbeing that age. It's been awhile since I graduated from there, and I\nstill thought it was great, so I feel confident saying this movie has\nthe potential to please just about any age group.\n"
"\nA movie that at first seemed like it might be just another movie about\na group of high school kids and their drama. As soon as I started it\nthat thought was quickly proved false. You learn of the feeling of\nsolitude of Charlie. When I started this I was a little distracted not\npaying to much attention. But as the movie went on, my interest in the\nmovie grow drastically. During the intense scene that was the fight in\nthe lunchroom, the DVD started to skip and pause. I found myself\nyelling, \"NO!\" as I quickly took the disc out and cleaned it. Luckily\nit no longer skipped. They did a very good job with the character\nbuilding and I found myself really caring about Charlie. Why is he\nhaving these blackouts? What do people mean when they say that Charlie\nhasn't seen things lately or that he has been doing really well since\nhe met his new friends? I highly recommend this movie.\n"
"\nIt defiantly deserves more recognition. Stephen Chbosky's book is a\ncritically acclaimed book, but the movie did live up to his book,\nseeing as he wrote, produced, directed etc. Logan Lerman as Charlie was\namazing. I saw this at the cinema straight after I re watched Percy\nJackson &amp; The Lightning Thief, and I don't think there's a role he\ncan't pull off ie. Jack &amp; Bobby when he was just a teenager, 3:10 to\nYuma, and he was also very believable in Riding in Cars with Boys. Ezra\nMiller was also wonderful, he made you laugh, and he made you cry, and\nhis character was so beautiful written. I've never seen a full Harry\nPotter film, but what I've seen of Emma Watson in them and in this\nfilm, she's a wonderful actress.<br><br>I highly recommend it, one of the best films I've ever seen.\n"
"\nA delightful movie. Everybody will find something or someone to relate\nto. The mood of the movie remains so mellow even while dealing with\ncertain dark issues that it feels like you're in a dream. The great\nsongs featured in the movie are another plus. <br><br>Logan Lerman, Emma Watson and Ezra Miller turn in extremely mature\nperformances. I wish there was more for Paul Rudd to do in the movie.\nIn my opinion, he is one of the most underrated actors of our times.\nAlso an honorable mention of all the other friends and Lerman's family\n(including Nina Dobrev of the Vampire Diaries fame as his sister) who\nmake up a good supporting cast in a well-rounded film.<br><br>Oh and also, Pittsburgh, PA continues to maintain the tradition of\nbeing associate with great movies. Go Pitt! :)\n"
"\nHaving read the novel 'The Perks Of Being A Wallflower' by Stephen\nChbosky and loved every sentence, I was quite sceptical about watching\nthe film. I worried it would not live up to my expectations after the\nnovel but I am glad to say I was pleasantly surprised. The film\nsucceeded to not only meet but exceed my expectations. First of all,\nthe soundtrack was perfectly selected. It displayed Charlie's confused\nemotions throughout. Being a music student (and aiming to be a music\nsoundtrack supervisor or work in the film music industry) I admired the\nchoice of songs and felt it truly reflected Charlie's character.\nSecondly, I enjoyed how well the script was acted by all of the actors.\nThey portrayed an honest awkwardness as young adults often have and yet\ntheir relationships and friendships were relatable and realistic.\nThirdly, I feel obligated to mention my respect for Logan Lerman as an\nactor and must mention how greatly he played Charlie. His\ncharacterization of such a troubled teenager was spot on and he\ndeserves great praise for portraying Charlie fantastically.\n"
"\nThe Perks of Being a Wallflower is an excellent coming of age film that\ndeals with many of the situations teenagers face during the time of\nlife while in high school. The young talented actors make the film a\nreal treat to watch. The entire cast does a fantastic job of making\ntheir characters real. Emma Watson is unbelievably good at playing her\nrole. Ezra Miller shines as the older brother to Emma Watson's\ncharacter. Logan Lerman plants himself in the role as the Wallflower\nand truly blooms as an actor. This ensemble cast should have been\nnominated for The Screen Actors Guild acting awards. As a member of the\nScreen Actors Guild I would have voted for this cast to win the Best\nEnsemble award.\n"
"\nUsually, i prefer books to their movie adaptations, but this time i was\nblown away by this masterpiece. When i first saw the trailer for this\nfilm i suspected another generic coming-of-age movie with too little\nplot and too much cheese. This is something else entirely, Charlie is a\nvery diverse character, and Logan Lerman brings him to life superbly.\nEmma Watson is a brilliant Sam and the pairs on screen relationship is\nso much more believable than in the novel. All of the cast have great\ncharacter development and Logans story is particularly harrowing. The\naccuracy with which the world of high school is presented is staggering\nand the tension of the film gradually increases right up to the heart\npounding climax. This is sure to become a cult classic, a vibrant story\nof friendship and i highly recommend it to anyone who remembers the\ntrials of childhood.\n"
"\nThe Perks of Being a Wallflower is one of my all time favorite movies.\nI read the book before I watched the movie and absolutely loved it.\nWhen I read the book I felt a connection with Charlie, the main\ncharacter. But the first time I watched the movie it was like meeting\nan old friend. Much of the characters personalities were the same which\nhelped me feel more connected. I love the way this film was shot and\nthe way the book was written, using letters to an anonymous person. I\nhave heard many people say that this movie deals with serious topics in\nan insensitive way. I do not think that is the case. I see Charlie and\nother characters react to situations the same way I think I would. With\nthat said, I highly recommend this movie to anyone and everyone.\n"
"\nwell, the movie is pretty good but for me personally the book was\nbetter, they took out some important things. *SPOILERRRRR.* for example\ni believe in the book his sister get pregnant, the boyfriend leaves\nher, she tells him it was a false alarm and he wants to get back\ntogether. in the movies that never happens which for me was a point in\nthe book where Charlie and his sister really got along which was\nimportant to me. same for everything with his family, it wasn't in the\nmovie and just little things just like that. if you haven't read the\nbook have fun, but if you have then it's probably just like a regular\nbook to movie adaptation.\n"
"\nPure genius, the way that the story is told is absolutely fantastic.\nThe angles, time and script truly impressed me. You have absolutely no\nidea of several facts that are massive important to the history. The\ndirector chose to tell you something out of context, with a raw and\nshocking style, and that makes the story amazing. I'm really happy that\nI've watched this, even more after i thought it was a cheesy movie with\nno concept. I was really, really wrong. Thank you Stephen Chbosky.\nAnother beautiful surprise, that made the movie even better, is the\namazing soundtrack. I'm a big The Smiths fan. It's like the movie\nactually tells many stories that Morrissey tried to tell us all these\nyears, \"Asleep\" was a perfect choice for this.\n"
"\nI absolutely adore this movie. It contains the best message: Be\nyourself and never be ashamed of that. You are you so don't ever let\nanybody change that. The Perks of Being a Wallflower made me think\nabout life in a whole other perspective. I may not have the most\namazing life, but I do have at least of few people around me that love\nme. They care for me and comfort me and that's all I can ask for. Think\nabout the Perks of Being a Wallflower if you ever feel like no one\nunderstands and you will find hope again. Perks is about how hard life\ntruly is, but also how life can be so incredible in that littlest\nmoment. Remember those little moments and life will be that much more\namazing.\n"
"\n'the perks of being a wallflower is great movie for emotional young\nteens especially those who are going through teenage drama. I was in\nyear 8 when a first watched this film which was recommended by my\nteenaged friend. When I got home from school i viewed it on this site\nand the rating was well so yes i decided to watch it. During the film\ntheir were a lot of connections between me and the characters in the\nfilm. It seemed like we were going through the same teenaged drama\nfaise. The ending also was great it reminded me of the ending of the\nclassic 1985 'The Breakfast Club' but even better, there were so many\nquotes such as 'we are infinite' which was the last words of the main\ncharacter in this film. Teenagers or not i recommend this film because\nit really connects with the viewer.\n"
"\nThis movie is amazing. From the beginning, to the end, the writing is\nwell above average, and the musical accompaniment is great.<br><br>However, the one thing that stands out above all else is the acting.\nPerhaps the finest three performances I have ever seen in the industry\npropelled this movie to the top of my list for this decade so far.\nLogan Lerman is absolutely fantastic as Charlie, although he looks a\nbit old for the part. Emma Watson is perfect as Sam, and Ezra Miller is\nthe perfect Patrick. The tension, and the coping, and the other\nunderlying themes are all as fantastically portrayed as the characters\nthemselves. You will feel everything that they do with the force of a\ntrain.<br><br>As with any film, there are differences between the book and the film,\nmost notably the change of the tunnel song. However, the movie is still\ngorgeous, and the characters are so full and rich, that you can't help\nbut feel with them.<br><br>I wanted to put in some comment about Slut and the Falcon, but I would\nprobably just ruin the delivery, so I'll leave you to watch it instead.\n"
"\nIts like i was meant to watch this movie, this movie is not just for\nme, its for all those bored teenagers out there. Perks of being a\nwallflower doesn't just tell a story, this movie stands out from all\nthose terrible lame boring high school movies who don't stick to their\nplots very well. I don't care if this movie isn't pleasantly rich\nenough to be listed on the top 250, it changes your life completely, go\nwatch it. I saw it 30 times and counting with my friends and family and\nthey said i had great taste in movies. Its because everyone can relate\nto this movie just like the breakfast club. This movie will be on my\nshelf for decades just like when my mom had the breakfast club on her\nshelf years ago and i will remember the great times watching it because\nit completed my life.<br><br>Download it on iTunes, Watch it on Netflix, Watch it online i don't\ncare, its a must see. My perfect rating score and i've been talking\nabout this with my family and we all voted. 8/10.\n"
"\nI just watched this movie because of Emma Watson who was a beloved\ncharacter in Harry Potter. After I seen this movie, I was moved and I\ndo think this is a great movie. In the real life, outgoing people are\nvery self-confident and at the same time they pay little attention to\n'wallflower' or someone who is very introversive. But Patrick and Sam\nwere not like this. They met Charlie and invited Charlie to get into\ntheir world. At the very end, I was very impressed by the idea\ndelivered in this movie - being an outsider is no good, only\nparticipation can really make you feel more and experience more, get\nlove from others as well as make others feel your love.\n"
"\nIn my project of watching IMDb's Top 250 list (of August 9 2013) I have\ncome to number 249, which is \"The Perks of Being a Wallflower\". The\nmovie is based on the novel of the same name by Stephen Chbosky.<br><br>In the movie you follow Charlie, who has just moved up in High School\nafter being bullied for the last years, and if it wasn't bad enough his\nonly friend has just committed suicide. In the beginning he feels\nlonely, but after becoming friends with Sam and Patrick his life\nbecomes so much better. He isn't just a Wallflower anymore, but a\nsocial human being. I think that Logan Lerman and Emma Watson do good\njobs portraying Charlie and Sam. However, I think Ezra Miller does the\nbest job in his eccentric portray of Patrick. You really come to feel\nconnected to these characters, which I think is important in the\ncreating of a good movie. <br><br>I will give the movie a 9 out of 10 stars cause it is a very good movie\nand I highly recommend it. Prehaps I will take a look at the novel one\nof the days.\n"
"\nI've been wanting to see this movie for a while and i just had the\nchance to see it today. Afterwards i felt compelled to write a review\nfor a first time ever, i think is a beautiful and powerful movie with\ngreat acting, great script, great story telling. For those of us who\nwere raised in the 90s will be like traveling back in time, it will\nbring you so many feelings back. Having said that i believe this movie\ncan be appreciate it by anyone. Once again great acting, i loved them\nall and i would be looking forward to see more work in the future from\nEmma Watson. If is of any help i would recommend this movie for\neveryone, even buy it if you have the chance i'm sure i will. Greatings\nfrom Spain.\n"
"\nWhen I saw that film first time I thought it's a cry-drama for girls\nbut I decided to watch it anyway, and I absolutely sure this is awesome\nfilm. Now it's one of my favourite, I really liked it and advise you to\nwatch.<br><br>There is all I need in this film: nice story, love drama (not for\ngirl), the acting, music, and emotions. Emotions are main theme of this\nfilm, that's why it is so good.<br><br>Two days later I still think about The Perks of Being a Wallflower, I\nalways think how awesome it is. <br><br>If you watch it, you will not regret. I promise :)\n"
"\nwow! i don't know what to say. there are not many films out there that\ncan move you but this is one of them. im gonna make it short, not just\nbecause i have trouble in describing things in English that im feeling\ninside, but just because sometimes things don't need to be cleared.\njust go and see this film and experience something inside. this film\ncaptures the whole spectra of emotions and the actors were all\nterrific! one of the best films I've ever seen, and i came over it just\nby accident so i can imagine that not many people have heard of it. and\nim giving an extra credit to logan lerman whom i thought gave a\nstunning performance of a teenager who is out of place in this world.\njust see it, and be amazed by the power of the performance!\n"
"\nThis movie is probably one of the best I have ever watched. Literally,\nI am not just saying that. It was so, so great every moment of it. The\nwhole film was absolutely f*cking brilliant. <br><br>The plot, oh gosh how are there any words for me to describe this. I\nwill not ruin it for you, in fact, go buy the DVD if you do not already\nown it. Trust me, it is worth every penny, and it deserves to be higher\nthan 8.1 stars, watch the movie and you will agree with me.<br><br>The Perks Of Being A Wallflower has so much ups and downs but somehow\nthey all manage to fit in with each other. It can make you feel like\nyou're on top of the world, one moment, and the next your eyes are\npouring. <br><br>Let me just say that this film shows what it is like to have true\nfriends, how it feels to be in love and simply, oh ever so simply, how\nit feels for you to be free in the world, and to not have a care about\nanything else in the world. Just about those you love.<br><br>So clear up your schedules, get home head for your sofa with a blanket\nand some ice cream and watch the movie.\n"
"\nThis movie changed my life.<br><br>I always thought that I had a rough life but after seeing this movie\nand seeing what Charlie (Logan Lerman) has been through changed my\nperspective.<br><br>Nobody should lose a friend like that even though it happens every day.\nIt never happened to me. Nobody should have to fight so hard to keep\nthinking I'm worth living this life even though people feel that way\nevery day. It never happened to me. Nobody should have been abused like\nthat even though it happens every day. It never happened to me.<br><br>Nobody can say that their life is hard after seeing this movie. I also\nhave great respect for Logan in this movie. It's so different from what\nhe usually does but I believed him. I believed him the whole movie. If\nsomebody told me that Logan has been trough that in real life I would\nhave believed it.<br><br>So in the end I think that everyone should see this movie. Not\neverything ends with a happy ending but you can make the best of it.\n"
"\nI quite liked this film, it was very interesting however I found it did\ngo on a bit too long. i really liked the twist at the end though and\nmade it worth watching the whole way through. after watching the\ntrailer I was expecting more of a light hearted film about a bunch of\nteenagers and there story's. however it actually contained Mental\nillness, sexual abuse, drugs and alcohol which was a surprise, it did\nmake the film a lot more interesting. If it didn't have these\ninteresting parts in the film I probably would have not watched it\nuntil the end. Even though I enjoyed this film, my parents fell asleep\nwhilst watching it, so maybe it is not as interesting to the older\nviewer and is better for younger people as they can relate to things\nthat go on in their life, to parts in the film.\n"
"\nI loved nearly everything about this movie, Emma played an American in\nthis movie (or Canadian idk) and she did e great job at loosing her\nusual accent. The casting was not only perfect, but the plot was great\nas well. Though I personally haven't read the book, my cousin, who has,\nsaid it followed the book as far as she can recall (she read it quite a\nwhile back) my only real issue with it, is that as it gets closer to\nthe end, he has flashbacks of some sort, which makes it hard to follow,\nand in the end there doesn't really seem to be a close, like there is\nless of a plot at the end. Outside that, I loved it and was trilled to\nhave finally watched it, great job to the director and actors and even\nmore so to the author of the book.\n"
"\nI just watched this movie for the first time. At first I thought it\nlooked like some cliché high school movie. Of course, twenty and\nnearly-30-yr-olds play teens, which is rather unrealistic. (I'm still\nin high school and NO ONE has that nice of a complexion!) I continued\nto watch as Charlie, played by Logan Lerman, struggles to find friends.\nI also thought that was silly because this guy is very handsome and he\ndefinitely WOULD have friends, even if they'd only use him for his\nlooks. So far, it seems like I hated it. Well, Emma Watson and some\nother dude befriend Charlie and from then on, the story bursts with\npassion, confusion, secrets, lust, and a wonderfully brilliant message\nabout \"misfit\" teens. I cried at least 3 times throughout this--\ngranted, I was very exhausted today--but it contained honest humor and\nemotional connections. I would have given this a 10/10, but \"White\nChicks\" takes first place. Either way, this movie is incredible and I\nrecommend to everyone.\n"
"\nJust seen this very good movie and I know its very late. Couldn't get\nit out of my head. IMO, a well scripted drama, inspired from novel. The\nmovie features three main teen characters, but it isn't an ordinary\nteen movie. 'Charlie' character reminds me of the young man from\n'ordinary people (1980)', which also features three main characters but\nnot teens. The songs (OSTs) from the movie are cool too. A Special\nmention to 'Come on Eileen' (\"OMG, they are playing good music...\nliving room routine\") and 'heroes' make the viewers to enjoy the movie\nbetter. Sad thing that this movie didn't fall upon the eyes of the\nacademy. STILL IT IS INFINITE!\n"
"\nThis is one of the best movies I have ever watched in my life. The\nacting in this movie is sublime. One of my favorite parts of a movie is\nthe music. This movie has, by far, one of the best soundtracks of any\nmovie ever made. I have always thought that Logan Lerman was an\nexquisite actor, but he has reached a whole new level of genius with\nthis movie. Emma Watson is one of those actresses that unfortunately\nhas been type cast by her portrayal of Hermione Granger, but her acting\nis so new and refreshing in this film, that you completely forget about\nher even being affiliated with the Harry Potter franchise. I have\nwatched this film several times looking for a flaw, and I'm happy to\nsay, one does not exist. Everything, from the writing, cinematography,\nproduction, and acting in this movie is one of a kind. I was hesitant\nto watch this film for the first time, but this will go down in history\nas one of my favorite films of all time. Kudos to the entire crew!\n"
"\nProbably one of the best movies I've seen.<br><br>The story is great ... I was reading the book when I came across the\nmovie ... but I think this is one of those rare cases where the movie\nturns out better than the book and that is because of the cast.<br><br>Logan Lerman is fantastic. You really feel all the uncertainty, the\ninner turmoil, the self-imposed guilt and the pain that weigh down\nCharlie. His performance is so good that it's easy to overlook those\nwho play \"Nothing\" and Sam, and all the others, but everyone was\nexceptionally good, although some of the better known actors like Paul\nRudd, Dylan McDermott were definitely outshone by the three central\nactors.<br><br>At no time did you feel any acting was going on or that the dialogue\ncame from a script. They really were Charlie, Patrick and Sam.\nFantastic.\n"
"\nIt looks like another lying and silly American teenager high-school\ndrama. All the typical characters are there. The cheerleaders, the\nfootball players, the weirdos and the nerds.<br><br>But as it goes deep inside Charlie's (Logan Lerman) life, it gets more\nand more dark. I'm Brazilian and I really don't know how it is the life\nof young north-Americans, but that was the most realistic movie about\nthe theme that I ever watched.<br><br>Along with the problematics Patrick and his friend Sam - Ezra Miller\nand Emma Watson - Charlie, who is introspective and has no friends,\nfinds a safe haven and is forced to confront the reality of his life\nand his mental issues. The slow soundtrack that includes The Smiths\nenhances the melancholy and makes everything more plausible, pushing\naway the cliché.<br><br>A great turnover on the script at the end of the movie connects all the\npoints and makes you think about your own reality. After all, is it so\ncool to be normal?\n"
"\nThis movie has an excellent plot. After watching this I read the book\nand could really feel the characters. For me it was like stepping back\ninto the early 90's. this movie really needs to get above a 5. I do not\nrecommend letting 8 year old kids watch this, it is to big for them.\nBut read the book and you'll Cherish this movie a lot more. watch it it\nwill bring you to tears and trust me you will have a lot of new\nfavorite songs. But I recommend watching the movie first so you can\ncompare the movie to the book while reading it. This is certainly a\nmust watch. But keep in mind do not do any of the stuff they do in the\nmovie if you're 20 and under.\n"
"\nI first wanted to see this movie, because Logan Lerman played the main\ncharacter, but then I realized that this is an amazing movie. All of\nthe actors did a great job playing in this movie. I think this is Logan\nLerman's best movie ever. Emma Watson did really good as well, this\ncharacter fitted her. This is an interesting movie for teenagers coping\nwith hard life. Love, sex, cheating, it has almost everything in it\nthat interests a teenage nowadays. The end was really moving, it made\nme cry. All in all, it's not the best movie I've ever seen, and it\nisn't the movie with the most cliffhangers and action in it, but it's\ndefinitely worth seeing.\n"
"\nFrom start to ending 'The Perks of Being a Wallflower' is truly\ncaptivating and endlessly realistic. This film instantly became one of\nmy favourites and will always remain so. As I have also read the book\nin which the film is based around I can honestly say that the entire\ncast play their parts fluently all the way through. A great thing about\nthis film is that it also manages to appeal to an impossibly wide\naudience as anyone can relate to at least one area of the film. I truly\nclass this film as a classic for its ability to have such a simplistic\nand realistic plot but yet create such a emotional and memorable\nresponse from the viewer.\n"
"\nThis is one of my ultimate favorite films, I love the main character's\ndevelopment and this movie as a whole. I never get enough of it.\nAlthough the movie doesn't completely cover the book but it was\narranged amazingly, the cast, direction and everything. I must admit\nthe first time I've watched this I was in tears throughout the entire\nfilm, not sure why but after re-watching it several times it turned\ninto my go to feel good movie. It doesn't have the cliché everyone gets\nwhat they want ending nor does it have the everyone is miserable in the\nend thing either, the ending is one of my favorite parts of the movie\nand I recommend this movie to anyone interested in the whole \"not okay\nteenagers\" cause it takes the matter somewhat realistically.\n"
"\nI stopped the movie 3-4 times because i could not control the feeling\nof happiness and emptiness after watching some of the scenes. I think\nthe story shows life of two depressed person one's Sam and the other's\nCharlie. Sam is more of an outbursting type while Charlie is\nin-bursting. I hope you got me here :)<br><br>The story focuses more on Charlie's life but you can determine the life\nof Sam by it. If anyone felt the same and want to see another Great\nmovie with same feeling then watch Submarine, you will love it too for\nsure.<br><br>Thanks for reading<br><br>P.S this is my first review so don't be hard me :)\n"
"\nI'm writing this review to so that the little tick box of things I've\ndone with my account that says \"Written a review\" will be ticked. This\nmovie is for the largely female teenage masses yearning for another\ncute and misanthropic and oh-so-relatable film to sink their fangs\ninto,dripping of tumblr giffyness. The writer knows their FRICKing\nmarket, though, and panders to it accordingly. For example, the\nprotagonist. Teenager? Check. Quiet? Check. Feels a disconnect from\nthose around him? Check. Reads a lot and wants to be a writer? Check.\nThere is literally a part where it's his birthday and they get him a\ntypewriter. A FRICKING TYPEWRITER. This movie oozes \"hipster flick\"\nfrom every crevice, and it's actually critically acclaimed. FRICK this\nmovie.<br><br>IMDb is lame and doesn't let you write \"prohibited words\" but I'm sure\nyou can imagine what I wanted to write instead of \"frick\".\n"
"\nI'm only fourteen, still in high school. But I really wanted to see\nthis movie. I finally got around to doing so and I have to say it is\none of my new favorites. I struggle with friendships and fall in and\nout of depression like Charlie. I just feel that this movie just\nrelates to me. I cried the rest of the night because it just hit me.\nThe story is about a freshman who has problems and doesn't have any\nfriends. He finally finds himself among upperclassmen. Him finally\nfitting in and feeling alive really brings Charlie to life. And I just\nfelt a connection to that. It might just be me, but I absolutely loved\nthis movie. This will be one to go down in the history books for all\nthe misfit toys, including myself. I strongly recommend this movie. I\njust... can't really put it in words I guess. Everything's perfection.\nIt is how life is for some. Real life; reality. I'm happy a movie\nfinally shows that.\n"
"\nI cannot overstate how great this movie is. I'm truly sick of many of\nthese users that think they are some high class film critic. 4 out of\n10? Really? It's rare that a film encompasses so much of what it is\nlike growing up with the social and moral dilemmas that nearly every\none of us face at some point in our lives. This is literally a \"feel\ngood\" movie, that will leave you with an emotional high. It has a\nwonderful cast and an even better soundtrack. Stephen Chbosky\n(Director) did a phenomenal job bringing this wonderful book to the big\nscreen &amp; I look forward to more of his movies in this future! Go out\nand rent this movie now, you won't be disappointed....\n"
"\nFinally! The Perks of Being a Wallflower was on my hit list of movies\nto watch but likely put on the back burner due to the predictability of\ncoming of age films that aren't always very enticing. How can Stephen\nChbosky remix the classic plot of the protagonist having to introduce\nhis external world with his internal complexities? He doesn't but he\nconfirms that it's not always necessary to reinvent the wheel. <br><br>The writing was impressive from the outset of the movie. Chbosky does a\nphenomenal job at juxtaposing Charlie's best self narration to his\nawkward social executions. It wasn't cringe worthy but it was difficult\nlistening to and understanding Charlie's intentions and then watch him\nstruggle with expression. Logan Lerman, Emma Watson, and Ezra Miller\ndeliver natural performances and never let us get too confident in\nCharlie and his abilities to adapt. The movie evolves true to the title\nin that there remains incomplete advantages to being a non-participant.\n"
"\nI am a male ,and usually watch movies like the dark knight or Pineapple\nExpress , but I watched this today and I almost cried at the end when\nCharlie was about to kill him self and I m not one of those guys that\nusually does that.Just this movie just spoke to me so much and I really\nwas hoping Charlie would die so I would know what happens with him till\nthe end of his life.I really want to know what happens after this movie\n,so much that I made a IMDb account just to rate this movie.I just want\npeople out there to know how touching this movie ends it deals with\nwatching someone you love love someone else and it shows what people go\nthrough when family isn't good as Charlie 's aunt molested him and his\nbest friend committed suicide.then for him to find someone so perfectly\nfit for him and everything is going great until she has to go away and\nit tore me apart a few years dropped from my eyes.Logan Lerman really\nshows you he s a great actor as everyone else. watch this movie\nespecially if you are in high school.\n"
"\nUsually, when I watch a movie, I always skip some parts because I find\nthem boring. In this one, the exact opposite happened. I found myself\ngoing back and back again to watch the same scenes. I would also come\nback to other random scenes while watching the movie. I was so absorbed\nby it, so emotionally involved that I needed to watch some scenes many\ntimes.<br><br>I think it took me around 3h30 hour to watch it. Excellent. Incredible.\nI almost didn't want to watch it as the preview and the summary of the\nmovie was ordinary, but now, I regret not having watched it earlier.\nThe soundtrack, the actors, the way the scenes were filmed. Everything\nwas perfect. I'm sill feeling the aftershock of the movie while\nwriting. I'm just sad because I don't think I'll ever find such a good\nmovie again.\n"
