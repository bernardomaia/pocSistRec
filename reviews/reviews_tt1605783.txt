"\nWoody Allen's love affair with France, which goes back decades, finds\nits finality with \"Midnight in Paris,\" the latest of Allen's Parisian\nbrochures, which recently opened at the Cannes Film Festival on\nWednesday. The good news is that Allen seems to be paying attention in\na way he hasn't always done in recent films, and has found a way to\nchannel his often-caustic misanthropy, half-comic fear of death and\nanti-American bitterness into agreeable comic whimsy. The nominal point\nof \"Midnight in Paris\" is that we've all got to make the best of life\nin our own time while longing for a past that probably never existed.\nIf anything, Allen seems to be rebuking himself, ever so mildly, for\nhis compulsive romanticism, his obsession with the past and his\ndisconnection from contemporary American life. Allen has baked us a\nsweet, airy Parisian dessert with just a sense of sentimental substance\nin the finish. One of his better films in his latter years.\n"
"\nThe love between the French and the Americans has always been mixed\nwith an element of dismissal even contempt but the love is real. Woody\nAllen walks that fine line in truly inspired fashion. \"Midnight in\nParis\" is a delight. This is he first time I actually loved Owen\nWilson. He is terrific as Woody's alter ego. Rachel McAdams superb. Her\nmean American girl is hilarious and frighteningly recognizably, so are\nKurt Fuller and Mimi Kennedy as her parents. What a chillingly awful,\nnormal pair. I loved the moment in which Owen Wilson, in a great close\nup, comes to accept what's happening around him. I accepted it too.\nHappily. Another stand out moment: the meeting with Salvador Dali,\nplayed brilliantly over the top by Adrien Brody. Highly recommended.\n"
"\nQuite a lot of great lines carrying life's wisdom; Profound reflection\nand insight of living the precious present expressed in a light-hearted\ntouch! If you have your own 'Golden Age' fantasy, you will likely enjoy\nit. This movie seems to be relatively more straightforward in\ncommunicating its message than some of Allen's other works, such as\n\"You Will Meet a Tall Dark Stranger.\" As a plus, lovely cinematography\nof the city of Paris - Mr. Allen has apparently fallen in love with the\n'good old (and charming)' European major cities; e.g., London, Paris,\nBarcelona and etc. Very likely, you will leave the movie theater with a\nbig and warm smile on your face...\n"
"\nWoody Allen takes Paris and bathes it within its own glory all the\nwhile making one of his most entertaining films in decades. Great\ncinematography, classic music, french food, french culture and Allen's\ntrademark humor are pure magic. You may see some of the familiar\ncharacter types from other films, but they only add to the mixture. Odd\nman out is Owen Wilson, but somehow he sheds his B-movie past and\nencompasses the Woody Allen humor without mimicking Allen. The\never-evolving plot twists will have you laughing as well as entranced.\nThis is the first Allen film (in a long time) where he doesn't\npontificate about life and death, but only celebrates the present while\nironically, living in two eras. This is beyond Oscar material.\n"
"\nI love Woody Allen, so already I'm biased. But even I will admit that\nhe's been spotty for the last...my God!...twenty years or so. \"Curse Of\nThe Jade Scorpion\" will forever be his lowest moment, and in his later\nphase \"Match Point\" and \"Vickie Christina Barcelona\" remain the\nhighlights. Well, we can add another to that list. By no means is this\nmovie an \"Annie Hall\" or a \"Manhattan\", let alone a \"Husbands and\nWives\". But if you've been bored by what you've been seeing at the\nMultiplexes lately, if you think \"The Hang-Over 2\" sucked and you've\ndespaired that the romantic comedy is dead...than I'm delighted to tell\nyou to go see this movie right now. See it on a big screen! It's\ngorgeous to look at, fun to watch, romantic, sweet, smart, and\npleasantly old-fashioned. This movie is not a masterpiece, and yet I'm\ngiving it 10/10 because it was perfect for what it was -- a modest\npleasure that left me in a great mood, and even a little inspired.\n"
"\nShallow and cliché'd this movie made me pine for a 'Kung Fu Panda 2'\nshowing next door for a more meaningful experience.<br><br>Mr. Allen, please find your own Gertrude Stein who'd read your scripts\nand tell you the truth. Meanwhile, take it from this disappointed\nmoviegoer that one simple idea is not enough to fill 90 minutes even if\nrepeated three times.<br><br>Contrary to the movie's claim, there was a better epoch where your\nfilms did have depth, humor, and acting. \"Midnight\", with all the\nrecognition it received, sets the bar so low that aspiring directors\nfeel like nouveau Buñuels with their 'Hangover 2'.<br><br>As Ernest Hemingway said (although not in this movie): \"The most\nessential gift for a good writer is a built-in shock-proof\n$#%*-detector.\"<br><br>Please get one.\n"
"\nI really fail to see how this film can attract so many decent reviews.\nI'm no film buff but I've seen a fair few in my time and this is\nprobably one of the worst. The scenes of Paris are more like a 1980s\nministry of tourism project - if you want to see sumptuous Paris then\nlook no further than Jean-Pierre Jeunet's Amelie. The plot is absurd -\nit's like a school film project - hey why don't we cram in as many\nfamous people from the past as we can and then have the main character\nmiraculously be able to go back in time whenever he wants! Even this\ncould be tolerated if it weren't for all the cringeworthy lines such as\nwhen the main character walks into a room to meet Gertrude Stein and\nshe leans over and says \"hey Pablo what yer paintin\" or something\nequally painful in order to shoehorn in another famous character.\nWooden acting, appalling script, truly terrible stuff.\n"
"\nAfter an interminable opening montage of establishing tourist shots of\nParis (if it had been London there would have been red phone boxes and\ndouble decker buses; not a North African mugger or traffic gridlock in\nsight), all to the accompaniment of Woody Allen's horn-blowing, we have\nWoody Allen directing a Woody Allen script in which Owen Wilson plays a\nwriter of scripts who talks, acts and dresses like Woody Allen; after\nhalf an hour or so of by-the-numbers comic clichés about culturally\ninsensitive Americans and pompous pseudo-intellectuals (oh the irony!)\nthe plot stumbles into Goodnight Sweetheart territory as Woody, sorry\nOwen, stumbles through a time porthole into a 1920s Paris where you\ncannot order a coffee without Salvador Dali asking \"Have you met my\nfriends Luis Bunuel and Man Ray?\" Just when you think it cannot get any\ncrasser Woody, er Owen, er Woody, trowels on a Hallmark moral about\nliving in the present before ditching his materialistic American\ngirlfriend to take up with a French chick who shares his love of\nwalking in the rain...\n"
"\nI am astounded that this film is amongst the Oscar nominees for 2012.\nIf there was a category for Best Travel Film it would win hands down as\nthe cinematography is first class in its depiction of Paris. But the\nplot is so shallow as to be transparent. The characters are likewise\nand define the term cliché. Owen Wilsons whiney portrayal of what is\nclearly supposed to be Woody Allen himself is irritating in the\nextreme, except when he puts Michael Sheens character in his place with\na critique of a Picasso painting, which I admit was the highlight of\nthe film. I am aware of Allens politics but surely he is more\nintelligent than hitting us over the head with his obscenely wealthy\nAmerican 'sledgehammer' of a Republican family. The film is worth the\nnomination for Art Direction but the other three nominations are\nundeserved and to think that this sorry apology of a film has been\nnominated for best film when Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy has been\noverlooked is nothing short of scandalous. If you want some good shots\nof Paris see the film otherwise pass it by.\n"
"\nHow this film rankings so high must be a testament to the old Hollywood\nmarketing engine <br><br>Loaded with cameos from well know and respected actors. It's obvious\nthey're having a good laugh at the audience as they rake in the money\nfor what is clearly a thin movie. Woody Allen has clearly exhausted his\ncreativity and snap. A sad moment to witness for what was a great\ncreative genius. <br><br>The photography is indeed beautiful with various Paris scenes but the\nstory plot is weak not only unbelievable but absurd. The primary actors\nare miscast and overplay their roles. The cameos are well done but\ncan't save the drowning pool of this movie.\n"
"\n\"Midnight in Paris\" was a massive disappointment.<br><br>The film is full of beautiful shots of Paris and perhaps this may\ndistract viewers from the fact that this movie is void of any real\nmeaning whatsoever.<br><br>The 'story' is about a writer Gil (Owen Wilson) who wants to stay in\nParis and write. His fiancé (Rachel McAdams) and her family are wealthy\nsuperficial socialites. Every night, Gil 'time travels' back to Paris\n1920s where he meets all his artistic and literary idols. This is\nlittle more than an exercising in name-dropping and talent-wasting. He\nmeets a non-superficial woman (Marion Cotillard).<br><br>I can't spoil the storyline because nothing happens. In what I suppose\ncould be called the 'climax', the character Gil himself experiences\nwhat he describes as a \"minor epiphany\". It barely even qualifies\nminor. It's meaningless.<br><br>The 'characters' are woefully under-developed, completely\ntwo-dimensional.<br><br>Woody himself as described his film-making style as \"lazy\" and I have\nto say this is Woody at his laziest.\n"
"\nI remember when IMDb was the bastion of knowledgeable reviews of\nmovies. I remember when I would choose which movie to watch by picking\none from the IMDb Top 100. Inception confused me, it wasn't a very good\nmovie, but it got a very good rating. But oh well. This on the other\nhand...<br><br>I do not understand how a movie so devoid of any subtlety can be rated\nso highly. Each plot point was drawn out so crassly, so boringly, so\nartificially it was unbearable. No character was likable, as no\ncharacter had even a semblance of depth. It was a parody of a parody,\nand not a good one at that. There was but one tiny laugh in the entire\nfilm.<br><br>This movie was equivalent to a school project. To give it 7.8 out of 10\nis to deceive the public of what is on offer. If you want a mindless\nrom com, then there are 101 other movies you can choose where the\ncharacters actually are human.<br><br>This is the death knoll of the IMDb. To deceive such as this is beyond\nthe pale. I will never trust these ratings again.<br><br>So long.\n"
"\nWoody Allen seems to be in his element after a long long while...a well\ndeserved pause and I must say what an intellectual pause eh! A fabulous\nscreenplay,the most original I have encountered till to date. Shooting\nParis la' Manhattan was anticipated but execution is unpretentious...a\ndifficult task in this age of high end computer graphics tantalizingly\nat your beck and call. Casting of '1920s Greats' was to the \"T\".\n'Rhinoceros' Dali is the manifestation of wicked wicked Allen and you\ncan imagine the understated 'throat clearing' pause from Woody whilst\nwriting and filming 'Rhinoceros' scenes..<br><br>Am a great fan of Woody and my bias may be glaring but I am proud of\nit. More power to him and his ilk. Am in nervous anticipation as to\nwhen he writes a script based on Indian sensibilities?!!!\n"
"\nFor any senior creative person trying to keep dry eyes during Midnight\nin Paris is almost an impossibility. It brings back faint memories and\nromantic desires wished for but often unfulfilled.<br><br>Woody Allen takes the viewer on his own eye view of a city he long has\nloved more as a fantasy than a reality. He does this through\natmospheric lighting and evocative music that creates tourists out of\ncinema goers.<br><br>Owen Wilson, in the of his best performances, takes on Allen's role and\nhe is given a gift of experiencing what he had missed by being a bit\ntoo young for the Lost Generation of the 1920s.<br><br>When Wilson and Marion Cotillard stroll through a misty Parisian street\nto some richly romantic French music, it was like the joy of all man's\ndesiring...a truly beautiful moment in cinema.\n"
"\nI really don't get the hype with Woody Allen. I really do feel that\nit's a case of \" The Emperors New Clothes\" with his films. Actors and\ncritics alike fall over backwards to praise his work yet i find it all\nvery bland.<br><br>Midnight in Paris is an odd film about a writer who , while on vacation\nin Paris with his wife to be, finds a way to go back in time to meet\nfamous artists , writers and musicians and he soon realises that this\nworld is far better than the one he currently lives in.<br><br>As is any Woody Allen movie , Midnight in Paris is very dialogue\norientated , and i have no problem with that but what i don't like is\nthe pretentiousness of it. Allen presumes the audience is aware of the\ncharacters on show and their history and that everyone is in love with\ntheir work. It's not the case with me. Owen Wilson is irritating ( as\nusual) as is the totally unbelievable Rachel McAdams. You never get the\nfeeling that these are a real couple. <br><br>This film is not terrible , just boring and that really is not a trait\ni want in a film\n"
"\nWoody Allen directs Owen Wilson, a typical example of a modern American\nactor, in a movie built on two elements : the magic of the City of\nLight and the unbelievable spiritual and artistic prosperity of the\n20's. As the protagonist travels back in time, the viewers have the joy\nof watching parade in front of their eyes the creme de la creme of the\nartistic world of the time : the Fitzgeralds, Hemingway, Eliot,\nPicasso- just to name a few. Some may find it a bit slow for their\ntaste, but it is, certainly, an interesting, positive and entertaining\nfilm. A movie that reminds you that there was a time when bars were\nfilled with stimulating conversation, when everybody dreamed of\nbecoming a poet, when great people lived and thrived !\n"
"\nWe begin with shots of Paris (yes, some of them in the rain) and I\nthink I'm looking at a travelogue; but I'm wrong. Once it gets going\nthis film is very witty and even whimsical at times, and I really\nenjoyed it. Woody Allen's writing is spot on here with some great\ndialogue and some marvellous characters. The plot has just the right\namount of mystery to keep me interested and even has some important\npoints about living your life in the past. All the performances were\nexcellent with Owen Wilson and Marion Cotillard getting top marks from\nme. Over all I found it very entertaining, amusing and even a little\nprofound in places Well worth a look!<br><br>SteelMonster's verdict: HIGHLY RECOMMENDED<br><br>My score: 8.5/10<br><br>You can find an expanded version of this review on my blog: Thoughts of\na SteelMonster.\n"
"\nThis film is a genuine feel good film with a unique plot and a genuine\ncharacter development. The beginning of the film sees the main\ncharacter Gil a bumbling, confused and lost man but as the film goes on\nbecomes more confident and sure of himself and what he wants. The\n'famous' characters he encounters such as Hemingway, Dali, Ella\nFitzgerald were very cleverly portrayed. The scenes in Paris are\nbeautiful and magical, the music a tad monotonous but I got used to it\nand it soon added to the charm. This film was simply charming, clever,\nwell acted and well directed. After watching it I felt a warm happy\nfeeling that not so many films have managed to do. Good job Woody!\n"
"\nI've almost always been harsh with Woody Allen... Never taken him\nseriously I must say. But, hes not one to be serious. As far as light-\nhearted comedies go, this is the vein of many of his other movies. <br><br>I had the pleasure of watching this movie on an atypical gloomy, rainy\nafternoon and it was a really good experience. Everything from the\nwide- eyed, open-mouthed, kid-in-a-toy-store Owen Wilson, to the\nhardcore Hemmingway, to the beautiful and confused Marion\nCoutillard/Adrianna, to the petulant Picasso, to the\n\"what-the-hell-is-he-smoking\" Adrian Brody/Dali and the absolute\ntimelessness of Paris at night, was an absolute treat to watch.<br><br>This movie left me with a smile on my face and an intense desire to\nwalk in the drizzle. Hope you enjoy it too.\n"
"\nmy girlfriend fell asleep while watching this movie, and i regret i\ndidn't. It took about 45 minutes before i give up. The movie is\ncategorized as romantic comedy, and it's definitely not funny in any\nway.<br><br>After every meeting with a famous writer or painter in the 'midnight'\nOwen Wilson embraces this character by saying it's name several times.\nThis namedropping of 'famous' writers (who i never knew until this\nmovie) becomes really irritating after a while. Also the\npseudo-intellectual conversations about art are painful to watch.<br><br>The concept of the movie is not bad, the acting is also not bad. In my\nopinion the dialogues are to boring and obvious to keep the movie\ninteresting. And i miss humor!\n"
"\nI finally got this DVD from my library and am so happy that I didn't\npay to see the movie. I started getting angry as soon as I saw the\ntoxic couple at the beginning of this movie, but, things devolve even\nmore, if possible.<br><br>Everyone in this abject failure is a caricature; Wilson, as the\nnebbish-on-steroid Allen persona, his fiancée as the\nscreech-y,throughly unlikeable Material Girl; her parents, as the Mitt\nRomney-esque 1%'s; the other couple is straight out of the movie line\nfrom \"Annie Hall,\" the one in which Marshall McLuhan steps out of a\ncardboard poster and tells them that \"you know nothing of me and my\nwork.\" And what's up with Wilson's ultimate soul mate... a Mia Farrow\nclone? Any Freudian meanings there? The good news is that I could\nfast-forward through a lot of the nonsense to what was the inevitable\nbreakup of this thoroughly unsympathetic couple. Allen is capable of\nsuch good writing...he must have done this for the money and a paid\ntrip to Paris.\n"
"\nI don't love Owen Wilson, but I think this role gets every good quality\nout of him possible, and his charm really drives the film forward.\nMidnight is the perfect Woody pic because it has lightness, comedy,\nhuman neurosis, philosophical drivel, and hatred for the same\nphilosophical drivel, all wrapped up together. I love the more Apatow\nsort of comedies that dominate today, but this was a more classic and\nthought-provoking sort of film that I think raises the standard and\nrefreshes the palette. I think it is great when a comedy can be\nnominated for best picture, and this one certainly deserves to be this\nyear. Go see it for date night, and if you are with the right sort of\nwoman when you do, you should marry her.\n"
"\nThis is the height of solipsism! In the \"extras\" in the bluray, Woody\nAllen mentions in the Cannes interview something about this movie that\ngives a clue about why it is so lifeless and pretentious: he just\nwanted to show the beauty of the Paris in a movie and shoot a movie for\nthat, story be damned! Why not just ask the Paris Tourist Bureau that\nhe would do it for them at a discounted rate, so he can indulge into\nsomething he wanted to do in a proper context? I went to see this movie\nhoping that it would be as decent as Vicky Christina Barcelona, with\nBarcelona replaced by Paris and the rest of the charm intact. I was so\nwrong! Oh well, I am not repeating the story etc. here, as plenty of\nthe reviewers did, but you are warned!\n"
"\nModern-day Hollywood screenwriter and novelist, on vacation in France\nwith his fiancée and her parents, travels back in time to Paris in the\n1920s via a magical taxi-cab, meeting legendary literary and artistic\nfigures who help the writer put his work and his love-life into focus.\nWriter-director Woody Allen, seemingly in love with Paris himself,\nappealingly uses fantasy to both confuse and clarify reality...but\nwithout interesting, disarming central characters, the confection seems\nto cool early on. Stepping in for Woody, lead Owen Wilson doesn't have\na dynamic screen presence (he fades into the foreground), and even the\ncomedic scenes that should work the smoothest--such as a bit involving\nRachel McAdams' missing earrings--have a bland denouement. Allen's\nnostalgia for the past is fun for awhile, but he doesn't use it to\nbuild momentum; fairly soon, we're stuck in a revolving door of\npersonalities and romantic couplings, sequences which have an\nattractive sheen but ultimately feel a little underwhelming. ** from\n****\n"
"\n\"And actually, Paris is the most beautiful in the rain.\"<br><br>Probably the most charming and fanciful Woody Allen movies that I've\nseen, and also one of the most enjoyable. Owen Wilson is great as a\nproxy Allen, transported back to the streets of 1920's Paris and\nlooking for his \"Golden Age\" amongst the famous writers and artists\nthat wafted through the city at that time. <br><br>I really don't have any criticisms about the movie. The script is\ntrademark Woody Allen, full of musings about life and happiness, but\nit's more subtle and natural than his dialogue can often be. The cast\nis great (Corey Stoll as Earnest Hemingway and Adrien Brody as\nSalavador Dali being two of the most memorable examples), and Paris\nlooks so beautiful that it often can distract from what's going on with\nthe characters. <br><br>Fully recommended for Woody fans, Wilson fans, romantics at heart, and\nthose who love Paris (both past and present). \n"
"\nMidnight in Paris is a wonderful work, full of passion and soul. As\nexpected, Woody Allen shows you Paris though the eyes of love, but\nmostly through they eyes of a nostalgic all time tourist, in Paris.<br><br>The direction is wonderful, as is the general acting. In my point of\nview, Owen Wilson could have done a better work. He often seems more\nidiotic than lost, and he keeps delivering the lines as he would in any\nother movie he played.<br><br>The plot if really entertaining. It creates the illusion it was\nintended for, and, although, the ending might seem predictable the\nconclusions and the message itself is not.<br><br>Not one of the best movies, not even one of the best of Woody Allen,\nbut it is what it promises to be, time and place, love and life,\nquestioned and answered wonderfully. If you are looking for a light but\ngood movie to watch, you found it.\n"
"\nI failed to make it beyond the first 20 minutes of Midnight In Paris.\nThat miserable time was filled with a ever-increasing pity for such\nhopelessly self-absorbed people. Sadly, every Woody Allen movie I have\nseen, which is by no means all, has been populated exclusively with\ncharacters devoid of the quality that I cherish in real people; a\nrecognition of some thing which is greater than themselves. Allen's\ncharacters always seem to follow the same, circular, shallow lives: It\nstarts with conflicting introspection, then false-awareness, always\nfollowed by the deep, wallowing creep of a search for a self-induced\nproblem that would not have existed had their self-absorption not been\ntheir best quality. Is Allen incapable of writing a character that has\nfaith? Surely he must have met a person in his life to draw upon,\nSOMEWHERE, that was not endlessly bumping into other people's psyches,\nconstantly wondering what is wrong with themselves! Well, maybe not...\n"
"\nI knew one minute into this film when they spoke of my favorite book,\n'A Moveable Feast' by Ernest Hemingway, that this movie was going to be\nsomething special...and I was NOT disappointed!!!<br><br>Owen Wilson plays Gil Pender, an aspirating novelist vacationing in\nParis with his shallow fiancée (Rachel McAdams). He has a romantic side\nthat yearns to walk through the Parisian boulevards in the rain ~ which\nshe totally dismisses as 'boring'. This leads him to wander the streets\nat night by himself...which is when all the magic happens!<br><br>Gil is transported by an 'old' Peugeot to 1920's Paris each evening ~\nwhere he encounters the likes of everyone from Scott and Zelda\nFitzgerald, to Gertrude Stein, to Hemingway himself! It was so much fun\nto see what historical figure would appear next ~ and sharing Gil's joy\nin meeting everyone from Pablo Picasso to T.S Eliot! <br><br>I was certain that Woody Allen's movie 'Zelig' was my all-time favorite\nfilm of his...but if so, 'Midnight in Paris' certainly runs a very\nCLOSE second!\n"
"\nIt's weird for me that most of the story's ingredients didn't really\ninterest me much. Despite with all those big names in the cast list I\ndidn't really feel that it makes the story as a whole the more\ninteresting. One thing that interested me the most is whether the whole\nthing is only Gil's imagination or what. And the movie did enough to\nshow that it's actually a magical time travel movie after all. The\nthing is, just like many other Woody Allen movies, this one explored so\nmany plot branches that becomes significant enough at the ending but\nthis movie didn't give any of them justice in terms of solving them.\nThis movie has many characters but they don't really develop much. The\nmovie only relies on initial impressions of the characters much like\nthey're monotonous in their life or experiences. The acting overall\nfelt really decent. With all those bigger names in the cast list, it's\nstrange that only Owen Wilson gets to do significant parts. That said,\nOwen's acting really is eclipsed by the potential that other cast\nmembers can have here but didn't do.\n"
"\nThis film will appeal to individuals with a certain orientation and\nbackground. If you feel the term \"romantic\" applies in your case, you\nwill likely enjoy this movie. And if you are steeped in the romance of\nthe Jazz Age and Belle Epoque you will likely love it. I saw it around\nthe time it came out and just now again. Watching it this time, I\nappreciated the fact that Mr. Allen cast another actor to be his\nprotagonist. The persona he affected on the screen was limiting as the\nnovelty wore off. Having someone else in the lead makes him much more\nan Everyman given the context. I found the other actors successful in\ntheir roles but, as the late Roger Ebert pointed out, Kathy Bates is\nespecially outstanding as Gertrude Stein completely fulfilling my idea\nof what Stein must have been like. If the times and place portrayed in\nthis movie resonate with you already, you are in for a treat. If not,\nit's \"Oh, no--not liver and onions again!\"\n"
"\nAn enchanting Parisian ode to the artisans of past. The ensemble cast\nis expertly used, making the audience simultaneously recognise the\non-screen talent and the talent on-screen. <br><br>Unfortunately Woody Allen's direction is utterly stagnant and\nunevocative - I would have much preferred an 'In the Mood for Love'\napproach to the film. But instead, a celebrous romp. Owen Wilson, I\nfind placid and stolid (again), maybe good for the role, but maybe the\nwrong role for the film.<br><br>Also, for a film about a man deeply entranced and influenced, Woody\nAllen's script is utterly uninspired and unevocative and only truly\nreminiscent. Dissolving into a half-assed abstract love triangle. <br><br>Great for any lover of art (references), Paris and the 1920s though.\n"
"\nThis has to be one of the best Woody Allen films,It was this film that\nmade me a Woody Allen fan. After watching Midnight in Paris it inspired\nme to read all of his books.Now I don't know if this is because Owen\nWilsons character is a writer or just because I was fascinated by the\nconcept of film. I believe its a really unique idea of a man that sits\ndown in Paris and can be back into the 1920s. <br><br>The film takes you on an exciting journey with Owen Wilson's character\nas he doesn't just explore his own fantasies of meeting legendary\nauthors he also discovers more about himself and what is happening in\nhis life.<br><br>I would definitely recommend this film to anyone as I believe its a\nfilm that can be viewed multiple films and it still be entertaining.\n"
"\nI don't know what to make of this film, I'm normally not Mr. Alan's\ntarget audience. In all honesty I generally avoid his films. That being\nsaid, i fell in love Mr. Alan's dream, his vision of Paris. I feel\ncompelled to tell everyone who has not seen this film to watch it, and\nthose who've indulged in it and genuinely enjoyed it as i have, to\nshare in my happiness! The crisp notes, the smell of freshly pressed\nnewspaper, the smell of unfiltered tobacco, I loved it all. The only\ntruly sad moment with films such as these is the profound loss at\nhaving them end together with the fact this kind of love only exists on\nscreen. True romance and conversation , music and beautiful leading\nladies who sweep you off your feet with that simple &amp; delicious\nelegance. Thank you Mr. Alan for the two hours of true love, now back\nto reality.\n"
"\nYou definitely need to be in the right mood for this-luckily I was and\nenjoyed it throughout and could have watched for longer. Of course the\ncharacterisations of the famous historical figures must be taken with a\npinch of salt. Yet it felt like a celebration of these figures and also\nintroduced me to the wonders of alternative filmmaker Luis Bunuel which\nis certainly not a bad thing. As with many of his films if Allen\ndoesn't play the lead role then whoever does seems to be doing an\nimpression of him. Wilson did do this but had enough charisma and\nability to shine through. McAdams also does a good job and of course so\ndoes the beautiful Paris.\n"
"\nThis movie is a fun and enjoyable experience. The movie provides great\natmosphere of Paris and really makes the viewer feel as if they are in\nthe roaring twenties.<br><br>Owen Wilson is the perfect actor for this role with his unassuming\ndemeanor and funny wit. Rahel McAdams plays the uptight wife perfectly.\nThe plot is very entertaining and the movie was never dull. The movie\nconveys a strong message about life in general and also provides\ncomedic relief. It was great seeing Picasso, Hemingway, and others out\nand about in Paris. <br><br>Everyone should check it out immediately.\n"
"\nMidnight in Paris is a very imaginative and entertaining film about\nthat you should appreciate what you have in the present. The film is\nvery nicely filmed and it shows much of the city's beautiful\nsurroundings. It's a really fun film filled with wonderful music and\nthe actors were really good. During the film there was a lot of funny\nsituations that Gil (Owen Wilson) ended up in and I could identify\nmyself with the character many times throughout the movie. Although I\nthought the movie was predictable I didn't think it was any less\nboring. I recommend the movie to anyone who just wants to watch a nice\nand fun movie.\n"
"\nI actually thought this movie was quite entertaining and had some\nrather funny parts. I was \"forced\" to watch WA films growing up and\ncould/never have understood his appeal. I don't think any of his films\nare very funny and I've seen about a half dozen (parents love him).\nThis film however appeals to a wide variety. Owen Wilson and Rachel\nMcAdems aren't the only appeal but they certainly do help with the\nappeal of the movie. They played their parts perfectly but the content\nof the movie also should appeal to different generations and people of\nvarying degrees of intellectual and humorous levels. I was not familiar\nwith all of the characters but its not important to the overall\nstoryline. Overall the movie was very entertaining and enjoyable.\n"
"\nI think it is a very \"delighful\" film that conveys a message that says\n\" follow your instinct \" and you won't see this image of the the movie\nuntil you reach the end, and that is the beauty of this movie when you\nrealize and see what it intends to convey at the end.I wish i could\ndescribe this movie in very few words but, unfortunately, the policy of\nwebsite does not allow to say no more.However, let me say that whether\nyou're into comedy,action,horror,science fiction, or anything, you\nshould not miss the opportunity to see such an inspiring movie that\nopens and awakens your mind to a lot of things happening in your life.\nI know you might say this is too much to say about a movie, but I\nbelieve that you will see what I saw and you will not regret seeing\nthis beautiful movie.\n"
"\nThis is a film which I will not tell you much about, storywise, because\nyou need to be surprised when you see it, as I was. On a cold winter\nday I grabbed a few dvds from the local bookmobile and this is one of\nthem. Figuring if Woody Allen' name is on something, I probably won't\nhate it. Au Contraire! I loved it! This film starts out with a\npicture-post card view of Paris and the film warms up from there. Mr.\nAllen shows why he is one of our finest filmmakers. In an interview, he\nsays that when starting out, he just had the title with no story to go\nwith it. What a neat story he concocted! I'd like to tell you more, but\nthat would only spoil the fun for you. See this feel-good movie and see\nif you don't, well, just feel good by the time it is over.\n"
"\nA frustrated American writer (Owen Wilson playing a role Allen would\nhave played himself 30 years ago)on his hols in Paris with his\nobnoxious, materialistic fiancé finds his midnight strolls turning into\ntime travel back to Paris' golden years of the 1920s and the 1880s and\nalong the way meets all manner of artistic and literary greats from\nParis' past such as Dali, Scott-Fitzgerald, Hemingway,Metisse etc and\nin the doing so realises that the past isn't as important as now. Both\nWilson and Marion Cotillard shine in their roles as does Michael Sheen\nas a pedantic and ultimately sleazy friend of Wilson's fiancé. With\ngreat acting and beautifully filmed its a wonderful postcard of Paris\nnow and in the past... 8/10\n"
"\nA time. And its crumbs. Nothing more. Game of testify and irony, pieces\nof lost memories and joy to describe, not very bad, Communism. The\ndetails are not important. The exaggeration is only for taste. It is\nnot a documentary. But an exercise to say truth in soft way. So, it is\nnice and amusing. A form to imagine a death world who lives in every\nslide of Romanian reality. A story about people in the skin of\ntotalitarian regime. A masterpiece if compare it with Autobiografia lui\nNicolae Ceaușescu. With small ambitions and great sense of ridiculous.\nWith desire to amusing and rediscover years when to survive was the\nfirst preoccupation. And title of one talented sugar daddy director.\nThat is all.!\n"
"\nUnfortunately, one do miss a quality Woody Allen movie these days.\nMidnight in Paris: beautiful shots of Paris but no serious plot. Yes,\nmany acclaimed stars, but no acting.<br><br>Nostalgia is fine but this is very fake. I watched the film with my\nmind sending the relevant past clips from other beautiful Woody Allen\nfilms like Manhattan, Purple Rose of Cairo, Radio Days, even Vicky\nCristina Barcelona. But bringing them together does not make a nice\nmovie.<br><br>I love rain in Paris but not like the last scene where the rain pours\nover only the cast not the bridge; is it cost-saving? <br><br>And after all, why do we need Owen to mimic Woody?\n"
"\nI worried a bit in the beginning that I might find it a bit \"banal\" as\nI live in Europe and Paris is not exactly \"exotic\" to me. But -Oh My\nGod- the plot was fantastic! Deep, meaningful and real. Owen Wilson at\nhis best; I always loved his voice, natural talent and general style\nand in this movie his voice and general style is a unique asset. The\ncasting was very spot-on! I would have hated to see any other main\nactor for this movie and the same goes for Carla Bruni's role, and most\nof the other smaller roles. The humor, the unexpected turn of events,\nthe mystery, the romantic turn to the literary past of an old city, the\nbeautiful people and gorgeous Paris scenes by day and by night were\njust \"rich\". I would see it again at the drop of a hat. Great job!\n"
"\nIt's striking midnight and we all know that means a walk back in time.\nIt's an old story in an old city, and it's pretty to watch. Mostly\ncharming, but often annoying due to the miscast of Owen Wilson. It is\nimpossible to buy him in a role of a literary, well read author. He\njust can't pull it off. He and the actress playing Zelda are problems,\nand it's too bad for all the other really excellent portrayals. The\nactors playing Hemingway and Salvadore Dali are wonderful, as is the\nbrooding Picasso. The fiancée, her family, and the know it all friend\nare great, too. A pleasant, pretty film with a great soundtrack and a\ncasting department needing their heads examined.\n"
"\nAfter reading reviews here, I have decided to watch this movie in\nBarcelona. Although I really did not like the way trailer has been put\ntogether, still wanted to give it a shot. Headed to a local cinema\nshowing it in original language. As the trailer was telling me like\n\"don't go don't waste your time and money\", it was beyond belief that\nsome people will rate this movie highly just because its an another\n\"master\" !? piece from Woody Allen.<br><br>First of all movie is not a romantic comedy, its not a science fiction,\nits not a drama, its not a romantic drama nor its a comedy. Its a very\ncreative idea of time traveling put in a very boring interrelated\npatterns.<br><br>Acting is horrible as well. It could have been a great Hollywood comedy\nif directed better with better comedy lines. There was a single line\nwhich I laughed about Valium. That was something which they could have\nused throughout the movie.<br><br>If you are not into literature and art, do not waste your time.\n"
"\nThis is an absolutely enjoyable film on every level. My favorite part\nof the entire film (**SPOILER**) is the slow realization that appears\nover Wilson's glowing face when he finally realizes he has gone back in\ntime. Wilson's sitting at a party, having a glorious time with F. Scott\n&amp; Zelda Fitzgerald, then is astounded to see Josephine Baker dancing. I\ncould watch this scene a thousand times.\n"
"\nAn amazingly original story where a struggling writer (Owen Wilson) on\nholiday finds himself traveling back in time to the 1920's each night\nat the stroke of midnight, where he encounters the greatest writers of\nthe early nineteen hundred and soon falls in love despite his fiancée\nback home. a great film to watch. directed by Woody Allen this really\nshows the fascination he has with France. 7/10<br><br>performance 9/10 originality 9/10 direction 9/10 story 7/10 ending 6/10\n"
"\nI am NOT a Woody Allen fan. I don't like his direction, writing, or\nacting. But I did enjoy Midnight in Paris.<br><br>I suppose the main reason I liked Midnight in Pairs is because I lived\nand worked in Paris from 1978 until 1981. Just seeing all of the views\nof the city nearly brought me to tears. There is no city in the world\nlike Paris. It is unique in it's beauty, culture, shops, museums, and\npeople. <br><br>I watched the movie, even after I saw that Woody Allen was involved,\njust because of the Paris component. But I also found the story\ninteresting, characters interesting, and casting on target.<br><br>When the movie started I was surprised and disappointed in the choice\nof how the movie was shot in terms of the color reproduction. It was\nflat and dull. That made it a little difficult to watch. But I got lost\nin the characters and story which held together well through to the\nend.\n"
"\nThis 'frat pack' jerk actually proves there's some depth to him as an\nactor. First movie he played in that I actually liked! 'Course the fact\nthat I didn't have to put up with Ben Stiller or Will Farrell in the\nsame picture probably helped. And, I guess, Woody Allen as director\n(though this one seemed rather 'mainstream' for him). One of the only\ngood movies that I've seen in quite some time. Strangely enough, this\nfilm also seems to have won some awards, and to have been nominated for\nseveral more ('strange' in that my cinematic choices usually differ\ngreatly from the 'critical reception'). Well, as they say, there's no\naccounting for taste. Plus I'm always drawn to plots involving time\ntravel. See this movie. It will, in its own quiet way, amaze you.\n"
"\nIt's a romantic setting, Paris (France), a romantic story and very\ninteresting. Every night at midnight, Gil (Owen Wilson), is waiting on\na small street corner for an old car to come by. The car takes him to\n1920's Paris. The first night he's meeting F. Scott Fitzgerald and\nErnest Hemingway, ... a lot of fun. Then Picasso, Dali and several\nother of Gil's artistic heroes show up on different nights. This movie\nis well worth seeing and I really enjoyed it, a relaxed flick perhaps\nfor a rainy Saturday or Sunday afternoon.\n"
"\nThis was very disappointing containing no real insight nor any comedy.\nThe characters never become more than stereotypes (not particularly\nlikable stereotypes) and the whole confection seems little more than a\npuff piece to flatter the egos of the makers. <br><br>No-one is more than we expect them to be and no attempt is made to use\nthe time-shifting to explore differences to art, morals or society.\nDespite the persistent talk on the theme of nostalgia there is no\nsuccessful attempt to actually discuss this. Perhaps any attempts were\nunable to come to the surface under the weight of layers of cliché\nholding them down.<br><br>The only saving grace is the visual depiction of Paris and the high\nquality acting but form without content id essentially unsatisfying.\n"
"\nOne of my favorite movies of all time. I don't know if it's the Paris,\nor the protagonist's romantic fantasies, or the 20's that got me so\ndeep in love with this movie. Opening scene with streets of Paris and\njazz music are something I could watch separately over and over again.\nThe eternal comparison of now and then, of our simple everyday life and\ntheir amazing life and work. The question we all ask ourselves, sooner\nor later, are we born in the wrong century? Could we be more successful\nand accepted in some other era? The fear that we might never be\nunderstood by people that surround us, and the comfort that we seek in\nwords of those who battled same fears. What happens when we meet those\nwho inspire us? Great story, great performance, beautiful picture.\n"
"\n30 years ago Woody would have played the protagonist himself and that\nwould have been bad. <br><br>Owen Wilson is closer to an average creative American circa 2011. It is\neasier to empathize with his character. Woody Allen is an outlier and\nhis presence turns the show into a satire. <br><br>I see how the film tells a story about a mythical Meta-Paris, a place\nand time where one feels happy, and empowered to control his\nenvironment and life.<br><br>The upper class Californians are spot on. I have met such a family when\nvisiting the famous Hitler's Eagle Nest. (I wish Wood Allen had time\nfor a plot like that: Midnight at Berchtesgaden).<br><br>I am giving only 8 stars because the American theme in the film is\noverblown and leaves no air for the European theme.\n"
"\nI am not a Woody Allen fan but have got to hand it to him for this - A\nfilm with Owen Wilson as the male lead that I found thought provoking?\nCome on that couldn't be right! But it is! I myself have often wished\nfor that 24 hours back in 1976, just for one day and wondered how I\nwould perceive it now as opposed to how I did back then, well, Midnight\nin Paris comes close to that reality for 'Gil' (Owen Wilson)and I found\nit captivating - I spent a lot of time in Paris in 1998/1999 and it was\nwonderful to see so many places I had spent time appearing in the film.\nIf you are a romantic you are going to love Gil and 'Gil in Paris' - I\nam and I did - Gil saw Paris with his heart not his eyes - I am a\nmusician and have found many places inspiring, I go to them often even\nif it's just to strum a few chords on the guitar, if you also pursue\nanything similar then you will love this movie - If you like to hear\nthe Rhythm of Paris then I guarantee the opening and closing title\nmusic will haunt you!\n"
"\n'Midnight in Paris' has a certain charm and elegance about it, no doubt\nthanks to the delightful Parisian setting and magical atmosphere, which\nthe film captured perfectly. I enjoyed the film primarily because of\nthis, but also because it is significantly lacking in other areas.<br><br>I can't say I was particularly impressed with Owen Wilson, playing\nHollywood writer Gil. He didn't do the character justice and it felt\nlike he was completely out of his comfort zone. For a romcom, it lacked\nmuch comedy. Amusing is probably the most appropriate word, but even\nthen the amusing moments are few and far between.<br><br>The short running time does the film a favour, otherwise this would\nhave been a drag. 'Midnight in Paris' is a elegant but rather dull\nfilm.\n"
"\nI love Woody Allen, and although I don't think this is his best work, I\nstill think it was a good watch. The thing that really caught my\nattention was the deeper meaning of this film, or the theme of being\nbored in your own present and being nostalgic about the past and other\ntimes, which is a feeling that the majority of people feel every ones\nin a while. I think that without this, the film would have felt empty\nand would have just been a waste of what could be achieved with this\nstory, just full of name dropping and so on. <br><br>In conclusion, I really liked this movie and would recommend it to\nanyone who is a big Woody Allen fan as almost all the themes he uses in\nhis other films (Jazz music, romance etc.) are all present.\n"
"\nWriter Gil loves Paris, his fiancée not so much. So when Gil finds a\ntime warp which drops him into Paris of the 1920s and, in particular,\nin among the artistic intelligentsia he so admires, he finds himself\ntorn, especially when he begins to fall in love with Picasso's\nmistress. But the present-day beckons: he has commitments, but he may\nalso find a way into the heart of the woman he is coming to love.<br><br>Woody Allen often annoys me, but the self-aware intellectualism which\noften spoils his films for me is here turned to entertaining use as the\n1920s artists and intellectuals become vibrant scene-dressing and, in\nsome cases, essential plot elements. The script is fun, and the lack of\nany explanation for the movement between eras matters not at all.<br><br>We know what's going to happen, of course - the mismatch between Gil\nand fiancée is gaping - but getting there is good fun. It is\ninteresting to see Owen Wilson playing Woody Allen instead of himself,\nand the rest of the cast do fine.<br><br>And Paris looks lovely, filmed in oversaturated colours.\n"
"\nLet me start with this: generally I don't like Woody Allen's movies for\nvarious reasons.But this one is definitely an exception. I enjoyed\nevery minute of it. Maybe because I am particularly interested in the\n1920s and have written about the Americans in Paris at that time. The\nhumour is very subtle, the romantic charm of Paris is present in nearly\nevery scene of the film. There is a very nostalgic mood, however it\ndoes not depress,but rather fascinates. Above all, it is a celebration\nof artistry, of creativity which Paris has always made to flourish for\npeople from all over the world. We meet the artistic celebrities of the\nage: Scott Fitzgerald, Ernest Hemingway, Gertrude Stein, Salvador Dali\netc. all of whom were charmed by Paris for certain periods of their\nlives. I also liked the juxtaposition reality vs. fantasy. The main\ncharacter chooses the fantastic world of the imagination rather than\nthe drab reality. It is remarkable that he chooses to remain in Paris\nat the end of the movie.\n"
"\nBefore I start this review, I'd like to just comment on the summary\nbeing noted of a quote I really liked in this movie as It doesn't have\na tag line which Is what I would normally quote. But never mind.\nMidnight in Paris ... is one of the greatest films I've ever seen. It's\npure cinematic originality, Woody Allen is a genius in the director's\nchair as per usual, It's definitely Owen Wilson's best film and I have\nto say I feel like I've honestly had dreams none too dissimilar to this\nmovie. The romance of Paris captivates you until the very end and after\nthe movie finishes, the characters are all amazingly done, you hate\nElizabeth Banks and Michael Sheen but you love Kathy Bates and Corey\nStoll. Also on a side note, Marion Cotillard is also perfect in this\nmovie. Also I felt I could really relate to Gil in this movie, just his\nmannerisms and his views resemble my own quite frequently. Not only is\nMidnight in Paris my favorite Woody Allen movie but It's also in my top\n10 Movies of all time. When I eventually sort that out.\n"
"\nAnyone who has visited Paris and finds themselves feeling that they\nmiss the city should definitely watch this movie. It manages to capture\nthat palpable atmosphere of the city from the get go and then\ntransports you right into the 1920s. The great artist of the era are\neffectively played by prominent actors with Dali and Hemingway standing\nout in particular. Marion cotillard is great playing the muse and\ncaptures the essence of a Parisian beauty with mystery and beauty. The\nThemes of longing for life in a different era is something that I\npersonally fond myself relating to and the way in which the story\nresolves itself is very satisfying as you see the protagonist grow.\nAlso as a North American I was able to relate to how Gil finds a\ncertain magic to Paris or Europe that other people do not appreciate.\nThe dialogue between the actors of the modern era isn't as snappy as\nyou come to expect of woody Allen films but it further shows why Gil\nlongs for a different time.\n"
"\nThis movie has something very unique about it. The ability to watch\nthis movie and not rethink your choices in life is quite hard. The\nmovie explores the idea of The Golden Age, where Owen Wilson character\nis wanting to live in the past. As the movie progresses, he takes\ninspiration from the people he comes into contact with in the past.<br><br>The acting is very well done by all the characters bar Rachel McAdams\nwho seems a little out of place in this movie, but still portrayed her\nrole very well. The score used adds so much to the movie and allows you\nto immerse yourself in the feel of the 1920's Paris and back to\nReality.\n"
"\nI'm not a huge fan of Allen's movies, but I must say this is a nice\none. I felt really happy and after watching it. Although it's not\nexactly a masterpiece, it lives up to what I expecting. It gives you a\ngood message. If you like a script that tries something new bu simple,\nfor sure you're going to like it. The Paris scenes at the beginning\nwere great, it couldn't start better. Some characters are not well fit\ninto to the story like Rachel McAdam's parents. Speaking about her,\nthough her character it is the definition of the expression \"pain in\nthe ass\", she really shows that she is improving and soon or later we\nare going to see her at the Academy's nominees. I never thought I would\nmake a compliment about him, but again, nice surprise. He carries the\nwhole film without making huge mistakes and most of his scenes are\nreally but really funny. When he mets Salvador Dalí is probably the\nmovie best part. At last, i recommend this. Not a huge production, but\nit gives you some piece of mind.\n"
"\nMidnight in Paris is refreshingly original romantic comedy (there is\ntime travel involved) yet a familiar Woody Allen film in that it is\nautobiographical in nature and shares similar themes with his other\nfilms. The story is about a writer (Owen Wilson) who is dissatisfied\nwith life and wishes he could have lived in Paris in the 1920s. Low and\nbehold he enters an old taxi which takes him to this very time and\nplace every midnight where he meets many famous Parisians of the time\nlike Hemingway and F. Scott Fitzgerald. These historical characters are\nall brilliantly acted, my favorite being Adrian Brody as Salvador Dali\nwho is hilarious. The film has a great ensemble cast which makes\nAllen's writing all the more impressive in that he is able to flesh out\nall of these characters in only an hour and a half.\n"
"\nWoody Allen's Midnight in Paris is a fantasy/comedy shot in a\nbeautifully and descriptive way. The movie tells the story of a\nnostalgic screenwriter named Gil (played by Owen Wilson) who goes to\nParis on a business vacation with his fiancée Inez (played by Rachel\nMcAdams)and her parents (played by Kurt Fuller, and Mimi Kennedy) and\nevery day at midnight Gil goes back to 1920's Paris where he meets his\nliterary idols such as F. Scott Fitzgerald (played by Tom Hiddleston),\nErnest Hemingway (played by Corey Stoll), Gertrude Stien (played by\nKathy Bates),Salvador Dali (played by Adrien Brody who is hilarious\nbecause he keeps on talking about rhinos), and his possible favorite\nartist Pablo Picasso (played by Marcial Di Fonzo Bo). With this movie I\nthink that Allen's direction for this film was much better than his\ndirection for Hannah and Her Sisters (1986) (I hope that all you other\nWoody Allen fans don't get offended because I still liked Hannah and\nHer Sisters.)-But in the end the end I think Allen's works are bizarre\nand interesting at the same time.\n"
"\nWhat a concept. While on a trip to Paris with his fiancée's family, a\nnostalgic screenwriter finds himself mysteriously going back to the\n1920s every day at midnight. Unfairly dismissed by some, this is a\nfunny sex comedy. . It's not the thing to see if you're in the mood for\nsomething uplifting, or something with tons of action. The film is more\nthan just a glimpse into the life of a man who does know how to live,\nbut I was wondering if he served more as a metaphor for everyone of us\nas a part of the human race who live better when we're on a leash. I\ngive it a final rating of 7 out of 10 because it's good but also kind\nof flawed.\n"
"\nExcellent movie. I felt the euphoria of character to find what he found\non the nights of Paris. Actually always found the past better than the\npresent. But nostalgia is always good! That curiosity to know how\nthings were before us ... The Woody Allen is one such wealth:\nart,culture, history, nostalgia and sensitivity. Unfortunately, this is\nnot for everyone! \"A trip of dreams\" I'm a writer, and this work of\nWoody Allen inspired me in many things, for me is the best scripts I've\nseen a masterpiece. Charming and delightful !! I felt led me to a city\nbeyond the tourist, but as if knowing every secret of the city and its\nmagic, as one resident who grew up in the city, which has much more\ninformation on it that, but you know every corner, every mouthful where\nall are, someone just for tourism never know. Owen Wilson played a very\nnice role and her well the character.\n"
"\nThe casting of this highly complex, imaginative film is spot on.\nHemingway, Zelda and Scott Fitzgerald, Cole Porter, Josephine Baker,\nDali charm me into their world of literary and artistic wonder. I\nbought the film and have watched it several times; I realize that it's\nactually about the philosophy of living your best life at the best\ntime, which seems perhaps narcissistic, but I personally wouldn't mind\ngoing back to the twenties in Paris. At least the traffic would be\nmanageable. :) When Owen Wilson quotes Faulkner, \"The past isn't past;\nit's still important and affecting us,\" (paraphrase), I began to see\nthe philosophy of this important film, which Owen Wilson self-effacing\ncharm adds volumes to. I see this as an important statement about\nliving life to the fullest with the right people at the right time,\nface-to-face. It's a challenge to the cellphone, computer absorption of\nour current 2014, which erodes the significance of human emotions,\nencounters and literature. I love this movie!\n"
"\nOwen Wilson as you never seen him it hard to know if he living in\nreality or there is something mentally wrong him it like the new Colin\nFarrell film fairy tail in New York he goes to Paris to as a film\nwriter with the gorgeous Adams as his wife she suffers every night\nwondering were he goes he goes of to immerse himself in Paris to feel\nthe artistic part of his life in the early 20 century he thinks he has\nmeet Ernest Hemingway to try and get his play filmed he goes to see\nother writers and dancers to learn the way of looking for inspiration\nbut is he gone mad we don't know great film from Woody Allen and acted\nby Owen Wilson the film is a cross between being john Malcovich and the\ntime traveling wife\n"
"\nI was hesitant to see the movie first. I must admit that I\nunderestimated the acting qualities of Owen Wilson. He should be given\nmore opportunities to act in good movies. It's was an attractive movie,\nin the real sense of attracting. I didn't stop watching it until the\nend. I even listened to the music at the very end when the film credits\nwhere running over the screen. Something I seldom do.<br><br>To paraphrase the movie: I saw a photo. I saw a film. I saw a\nrhinoceros. The past is not dead. It's not even past, you know.\nActually, Paris is the most beautiful when it rains. It was like a\ndream. I was dreaming. Even educated flees do it. You should dream too.\nGo see the movie! There is really nothing more to say.\n"
"\nWoody Allen, hmmm, what is there to say about this clown, this writer,\nthis I guess non-actor, or voice and heart of sleeze and wine. I think\nit's wonderful, that Woody started his career writing comedy, that\neventually lead to standup and then into the movies and with it, his\nversion of Hollywood.<br><br>He brings a Nerdtopia to his films. If a joke can make you feel more\nattracted to the balding man, the elder fool, the goofball and\nintellectual. Eclectism reigns king with Mr. Allen, a newyork\naristocrat.<br><br>As, much as I like Woody, I don't like his films! With the exception of\nthis romantic comedy. Midnight In Paris, is a excellent movie in\nEnglish. Some of these scenes look like paintings with camera framing\nand coloring. I, do think Woody has reached his best work here, and, I\nam sure more to come from the aging star.\n"
"\nThis is kind of a movie which leave you with wanting more...at the end\nof it you would think of different possible ending except for the one\nwhich actually happened...having said that this movie is a feel good\nmovie and for those having a keen interest on becoming a writer this\none is a must watch.This movie keeps you engrossed throughout and don't\nlet you leave the place without finishing it, throughout the movie you\nwould say to yourself that this strong build up should meet with an\nappropriate and if possible a logical end.As per the performance every\none gave a sounding work.Owen Wilson was simple, pure and believable,\none who feel more and think less...I must say he steals the\nshow..Rachel McAdams was good in her part and looked convincing..Cant\nsay much without revealing the story part which I did not intend..this\nmay not be a great movie but definitely a watchable one\n"
"\nThis is one of best movies i have ever watched. Owen Wilson has done\nsome terrific work in the movie. others to look forward to are Rachel\nMcAdams, Micheal sheen and our beloved Tom Hiddleson from the avengers.\nthe movie begins with beautiful images of Paris and i am hooked to the\nmovie from the very first image. i just freaking love this movie. no\noffense, but if you think this movie is not at all adorable then\nprobably you have a bad taste. the soundtrack of the movie is well\nwritten and is beautiful. the screenplay is excellent. there are some\ngoofs (especially in the scenes during the 20's) but the hooking story,\nacting and the magic of the movie covers it. if have not watched this\nmovie yet please watch it. it will be worth all the dollars you spend\non buying the DVD. this movie is really magical.\n"
"\nA nice movie to watch but hardly an original idea. <br><br>The entire thing is almost a carbon rip-off of the UK television comedy\n\"Goodnight Sweetheart\" http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0106014/. This\nspoiled the movie for me as I kept feeling I had seen it all before. <br><br>On the other hand the acting was solid, the sets fantastic and the\ndialogue interesting. Usually not a fan of Woody's work and this\ndisappoint in the same way. Overall it was fine to watch with my\npartner but if a second airing is needed she will be witnessing it\nalone. <br><br>All in all it was neither spectacular or dreadful. 5/10\n"
"\nThis dreamy film is especially moving due to its atmosphere, and I\nadmit I didn't know how to explain it. Of course the visuals are\nstunning, but it's not just that. Obviously the 'artsy' premise is\ndecisive for that magic feel. Even Owen Wilson, whom I usually don't\nlike, added a touch of innocence and credibility, despite the fact that\nhis character was a 21st century Allen (and well done, for that\nmatter). It's very rare that a film suggests so strongly an atmosphere.\nI don't know how much has this artistic and idealized Paris in common\nwith the one in the real world of today. But it's worth it. Previously\nI wasn't that fascinated by Paris as some of my friends... Previously!\n"
"\nI love this movie. For me it's a mix between the charming, old Paris,\nand the mind of an artist(writer). And Paris seems the perfect place to\nspark one's creativity. So many artists were inspired throughout\nhistory, by the magic of this place. <br><br>Another great part of movie is Gil's desire to live in past times, and\nagain Paris is the perfect city for this too. The old but perfectly\npreserved buildings, the paved streets, and the whole atmosphere makes\nyou feel like you're not in the present anymore. <br><br>I think his relationship with Inez is just a representation of his\nimagination and inspiration, which are trapped in the present and this\nis a drag for him, as a writer. <br><br>It's a lovely movie.\n"
"\n\"Midnight in Paris\" confirms what I've always thought: Woody Allen's\nbest movies are the ones in which he goes straight for comedy. With\nOwen Wilson as a neurotic writer on vacation in the French capital and\ntraveling back to the 1920s to meet the American writers who lived\nthere at the time, it's one of Allen's cleverest movies. I felt like I\nwas never going to forgive him after he made the über-atrocious\n\"Everyone Says I Love You\" (about which there was NOTHING to love), but\nhis movies got better after that (I especially liked \"The Curse of the\nJade Scorpion\" and \"Scoop\"). But this one is the cream of the crop.\nAllen definitely needs to make more of these. I'd also like to see him\nmake another sci-fi flick like \"Sleeper\". Maybe even his very own\nslasher flick (he would presumably play a neurotic guy who rambles\nabout intellectualism while butchering depraved teens).<br><br>Anyway, this is a really good movie. You gotta see it.\n"
"\nI think that this movie really tells a message that our present-day\nworld is in need of. It aims to make us understand that we should\nescape more often the rules that govern our daily life, our society,\nour entourage, everything that surrounds us and makes us act like some\nrobotized creatures, dominated by mercantilism and falsity. It tells\nthe story of the intellectual who confronts himself with so-called\nsocial problems because of his different way of seeing and experiencing\nlife. Paris is a portal for the protagonist through which he accesses\nthe past eras that he thinks he belongs to, but also the change of the\nliving ambient that reveals the differences between his and his wife's\nways of seeing things and living. Great script, the movie is catchy\nfrom start to end.\n"
"\nToday at noon I watched this great movie second time by one of the\nfinest director Woody Allen. The movie does it's best in all aspects,\nIt has pretty good screenplay, astounding cinematography and melodious\nmusic. When I watched it firstly it was nearly midnight. And I got to\nsay that the movie's real magic works at midnight. Though I liked it\nmore or less the second time. Editing was superbly creative. I\nremembered the title sequence at the starting just when Gil starts to\ntalk with his fiancée you can see \"Midnight in Paris\" which remarkably\nfits the space. The theme is creative and I always thought about\nnostalgia and I guess it haven't been yet shown in any other movie. We\nall have conceptualized the golden era by our notion. The movie\nportrays this very well. I must say that it is one of the best movies I\never watched. I think the movie inspires me both on cinematic\nachievement and characterization.<br><br>If you haven't watched it you are missing a whole lot fun.<br><br>Remember to watch it at midnight!\n"
"\nLet me just say, it is refreshing to see that people are once again\nputting heart, soul, and character back into movies. I am a huge fan of\nHemingway, Fitzgerald, Picasso, and many of the other figures that\nappeared in this movie, and I was happy to see them portrayed how I\nfelt to be effectively. Even as a Conservative, I was able to laugh at\nsome of the jokes at the Republican Party's expense, and the tasteless\nview of the world Gil's fiancé and in-laws were supposed to have as\nRight-Wingers. It didn't deter the magic of the movie for me at all,\nand goes to show that even though I might completely disagree with\nWoody Allen politically, there is no denying his true genius in cinema.\nVery funny, very charming, and somewhat inspiring. I could see myself\nin Gil more than once, and it felt good to have some of my closeted\ninner feelings about my own generation expressed on the silver screen.\nGreat movie, would recommend it to anyone for an easy and fun viewing.\n9/10.\n"
"\nI came across this movie on the Starz channel today and fell right into\nit! As someone who feels exactly like Gil (Owen Wilson), who feels like\nthe present is dull and that it would be better to live in a different\ntime, I connected with this movie beautifully. This movie is set in\nParis, obviously, and it's about Gill and his fiancé Inez (Rachel\nMcAdams) who are there because her parents (Kurt Fuller and Mimi\nKennedy) have a business venture there. One night, while a little\nintoxicated, Gil Pender gets into an antique vehicle and is taken back\ninto the 1920's Paris where he meets many historical figures including\nCole Porter, Scott and Zelda Fitzgerald, Ernest Hemingway, Pablo\nPicasso and more.<br><br>The only problem that I have is that I didn't recognize a few names\n(which is my fault for being unfamiliar with those names). I thought\nthe movie was beautiful and very easy to understand! I recommend this\nmovie to anyone!\n"
"\nI could not manage to say a word after watching this film. It perfectly\ncaptured history, and the personality of the figures in history, like\nF. Scott Fitzgerald, his wife Zelda, and Ernest Hemingway. Owen Wilson\ndoes a great job, as he always does, and plays the role with heart. He\ngives the character a personality, in a way that not a lot of actors\ncan. The writing was good, and no doubt that helped, but it takes a\ngreat actor to truly bring a character to life, as Owen Wilson did in\nthis film. The most remarkable thing about this film, however, is its\nbeauty. It looks incredible. Paris is a gorgeous place, as everyone\nknows, and it is captured perfectly. Everywhere they go has a unique\nbeauty to it, and, if nothing else, it is gorgeous to look at. But the\nstory, the characters, and the acting make it so much more than just a\ngorgeous film. It is excellent, and I pity you if you have not yet seen\nit.\n"
"\nThe colorful musical romantic movie is a special creation by Woody\nAllen. The movie was remarkably beautiful, the music and background\nscore and cinematography are absolutely fantastic.The Director cleverly\nbalanced the future and the past of Paris through his cinematic\nastuteness.The acting of Owen Wilson was nice and the characters are\nmade so true that it never sounds like acting in this movie.While\nwatching you will definitely feel the warm colors,soothing music and\ncharisma of dialog in the movie. After watching you felt like satisfied\nand seems like the movie has left a colorful romantic musical print on\nyour mind and heart. It would never be wrong if I say it is one of the\nbest romantic colorful movie made in the recent era. People who love to\nread classics and admirer of musics and cinema definitely will love\nthis movie.\n"
"\nA screenwriter who happens to be an uber fan of literature time travels\nto 1920's Paris to hobnob with his idols, while having doubts about his\nimpending marriage in the present. The fantasy element in the plot line\ncoupled with sharp Woody Allen dialogue makes this film quite\nenjoyable. Although Owen Wilson plays Owen Wilson, the famous acting\ncameos keep it interesting. The cinematography captures the whimsy of\nParis albeit true to reality or not and the soundtrack gives the film a\nsignature sound. Allen has a habit of recycling his plots and inner\nconflicts. MIDNIGHT IN Paris is no exception; it mirrors MANHATTAN in\nmany aspects. Allen's foray into the semi-fantasy genre after nearly\nten years pays off in the end.\n"
"\nWow! There is something special about this film, it is an intriguing\nangelic delight. I instantly fell in love with it from the first scene,\nand this love increased throughout the feature. <br><br>However I haven't rated this film 10/10, because there was a minor\nconcept missing. I'm not sure what it was, I just felt it wasn't\nfinished, there could have been more. If anything, I suppose the ending\nwas rushed and could have been explored more.<br><br>Nonetheless, this was a pure charming admirable film from all aspects:\ncasting, cinematography, mise-en-scène, music, dialogue, narrative,\nsetting and acting. Everything seemed to come together to produce a\nmasterful enchanting piece of film, which I strongly recommend to\nanybody, there is something in there for everyone.\n"
"\nI'm really baffled by the praise for the film, and Woody is one of my\nfavourites. He obviously loves Paris and he wants to stage the fantasy\nof 1920s Paris as his, perhaps it could be anyone's, his point is\nsimply the classic Romantic line that forces that move us to be\ninterested in another time and place are unappreciated by capitalist\nmaterialists. <br><br>The characters are generally flat, and Owen Wilson as the protagonist\nis another of the awkward stand-ins that Woody ventriloquises. There is\nlittle of the detailed structure of interpersonal engagement that\nusually give his films something to chew on. All the figures of\nEuro-American modernism that are celebrated in the film are also\nflattened into stereotypes.<br><br>The art direction is superb and the city looks its best version of its\ncliché. But where Manhattan paired the visual city with the interior\nworld of its inhabitants, this one is all about the surface.\n"
"\nI can't get enough of Midnight in Paris. I love everything about it. It\nmakes me want to go to Paris so bad. It makes me want to go to that\nplace where Owen Wilson went and heard the bells ringing and that\nmagical car came down the street and picked him up and took him back to\nthat magical time. The people that played the Fitzgeralds and\nHemingway, Dali, etc. were great!!! I also thought that Rachel McAdams\nwas very good in this movie, as was Kathy Bates and really, just\neveryone. It's just a charming movie that makes you not only want to go\nto Paris but to be back in the Roaring twenties, even just for one\nnight. Woody Allen is a genius. I love this movie!!\n"
"\nA family travel to the French capital for business. The party includes\na young engaged couple who are forced to confront their differing views\nof a perfect life.<br><br>First and foremost, Owen Wilson deserves some kind of applause for\nthis. He can play goofy, cheesy roles, but is not really a strong\ncharacter. Woody Allen found a way to make that work here, making the\ntimid Wilson a strong lead.<br><br>The film, of course, was nominated for best picture and won best\nscreenplay. I think this is perfectly fair. Allen's strength is his\nwriting. He is nothing more than an average director, but his scripts\neasily carry his films -- the intellectual dialogue is appealing\nwithout being pretentious. How he does that is beyond me.<br><br>And seeing Adrien Brody as Salvador Dali... nice.\n"
"\nMidnight in Paris was written and directed by Woody Allen. The bad news\nabout this movie is that the \"real\" plot is ridiculous. We are supposed\nto believe that Gil , would want to marry Inez despite the fact that\nInez is spoiled, selfish, immature, and comes as part of a package that\nincludes her unpleasant parents and obnoxious friends. Yes, Inez is\nattractive, but as a successful screenwriter, surely Gil could find\nother attractive women with whom he'd be more compatible.<br><br>Really,film's fiction is great,and the film's music is good.İn my\nopinion this film is very romantic and history.I love this movie and\ncharacters(Gil and Rachel McAdams)\n"
"\nI've never been a fan of Woody and this is not going to make me one.<br><br>One of the problems, I think, is that all the characters are cardboard.\nOwen Wilson plays Woody and shows such great Romantic Enthusiasm that\nit wore me down after a while! (At least he didn't try to obviously\nimitate Woody's mannerisms as Kenneth Branagh did in \"Celebrity\"!)\nRachel McAdams plays his \"Crass Fiancée\" and Michael Sheen plays \"The\nPedant\".<br><br>Yes, we know Woody loves Paris but this too becomes oppressive in my\nopinion while becoming a near commercial for the city. And Woody has\ndone the fantasy or time-travel shtick more than once before, most\nobviously in Zelig, Sleeper, and Purple Rose but these have all been\ndone better by others.<br><br>And finally, all the celebrities Owen meets are pretty much top of the\npops: Cole, Ernest, Gertrude, Alice, Pablo, Luis, Salvador, Scott and\nZelda, Man Ray, Josephine, T.S., Toulouse-Lautrec, Gaughuin, Matisse,\nDegas: they are all here! <br><br>In short, a very superficial and obvious, if somewhat entertaining,\nfilm.\n"
"\nTruly a fascinating movie, caries like dream up until the end. Most\nwould recognize themselves, trying to escape reality and go back to a\n\"golden era\".. apart from the notorious and less notorious characters\nportrayed in the '20s, this movie gives a lot to think about, and\ndelivers many emotions to the passionate watcher. Its a perfect\nromantic movie, not necessarily a chick flick, ideal Francophiles,\ntruly enjoyable indeed. Watch it over a glass of wine and possibly with\na fireplace warming you... Woody proves again to be a master and is\nhere doing a great job putting together so many nice fragments of time.\nIs this really such a bad epoca?\n"
"\nThe film transported the mind and heart to Paris, mesmerizing the movie\nviewer to feel its beauty, for all whom have been blessed to see the\ncity, it was a realistic portrayal of its eternal charm.<br><br>A memorable Woody Allen film which captivated its viewer to immerse\noneself in the moment of the artists world of era's gone by and\nilluminated us with a juxtaposition of the present reality.<br><br>The scenery, french time-period sets, color, artistic textures,\nlighting, costumes, music, script, editing and acting within 'Midnight\nin Paris' were richly luscious and encapsulating due to vivid attention\nto fine detail. <br><br>Wilson expressed an ability to draw the movie viewer into the\nenchantment of a love story, that was written to open the heart towards\nfullness.'Midnight in Paris' creates a strength for the inner voice\nthat calls us to our destiny in each moment, to seek a relationship\nbased on the truth of compatibilism.\n"
"\nWoody Allen, as always, tries to find the true meaning of life in an\nupbeat way in this 2011 romantic comedy.<br><br>Too bad that Allen wasn't younger, he could have easily played the part\nwhich was done quite well by Owen Wilson.<br><br>A young writer and his girlfriend come to parents along with her\nparents, just before they are married. By a quirk of fate, Wilson is\ntransported back to the 1920s and meets the likes of Ernest Hemingway,\nGertrude Stein, Salvadore Dali, F. Scott and Zelda Fitzgerald, and so\nmany others from that grand period.<br><br>Everyone is marvelous here in depicting their famous people they are\nplaying.<br><br>While the '20s was certainly a golden era, the film shows what can\nhappen when one of the people goes back to the 1890s.<br><br>Reality always wins out and at least by film's end, Wilson realizes\nwhere he belongs and with whom he does not.\n"
"\nmidnight in Paris is a fantastic movie about generations upon\ngenerations of nostaligic regret, and the contrast with the dismal\npresent, because life itself is unsatisfying! yes its unrealistic and\ncoincidencially romantic at times, but thats the point! its a movie\nabout the movies, and a fabricated era filled with wonder and insight\ninto the past... man... i mean i know the movie takes notions from\nolder movies, like Les Quatre Cents Coups and it's description of\nFrance's failing generation, but it does it well and im glad such a\ngood movie has been made in the 21st century with such great\ninspirations from the past.\n"
"\nI just saw a movie by a similar title (to my summary line) and I think\nit fits perfectly. Though I still have trouble describing the movie. I\nguess you know what it's about because you either have seen the trailer\nor read a summary of the plot, but I fortunately could avoid those\nthings and went in without knowing anything about the movie. And let me\ntell you, it was great fun.<br><br>Still not sure about the Oscar nods (while movies like DRIVE only got\none nomination), but the movie is entertaining while not really making\nany sense. Or trying to explain anything. You either accept what\nhappens or you will be left out (or you will feel that way). Very\nintriguing and maybe even thought provoking, this has a simple message\nafter all. Which is not a bad thing at all\n"
"\nI am not a fan of Woody Allen, but I do watch his movies from time to\ntime. This particular movie is quite a gem, as it does not feature\nWoody Allen's needy Jewish guy character. But... Owen Wilson is not the\nright person for the role. He made what would be a nice sophisticated\nromance movie into a run-in-the-mill romantic comedy. At least romantic\ncomedies are funny... This is not. <br><br>How can a movie with all the right elements: Great settings, great\nstory, great plot and plot devices, go so wrong? Because the central\ncharacter is wrong. I almost wished Woody Allen's usual character is\nthe protagonist. I would have believed in the movie more.\n"
"\nIt's a movie that romanticizes Parisextolling all it's magic and\nbeautywhile belying the theme we always over-romanticize the world\noutside our realm.<br><br>It's immensely entertaining and like other Woody Allen films it's not\nnecessarily laugh out loud funny as much as it's quietly smirking to\noneself funny. <br><br>Rachel McAdams sheds her perfect, big-eyed nice girl role to play a\nvain, arrogant socialite while still being completely believable. Owen\nWilson, who has been a screenwriter, gives a nice balance between\nyoung-boy-like-wonderment with a scared, always doubtful, realist. <br><br>The world it creates in 1920's Paris is amazing with beautiful sets,\ncostumes, lighting, cars, and many other nice touches to make us feel\nlike we're there.<br><br>See this movie because it's overly romantic while still picking fun at\nitself in the way only Woody Allen can.\n"
"\nI've never been a Woody Allen fan particularly but I found this film to\nbe one of the best I've seen in recent years. I am aware that people\nthink some of the references go over the heads of people but I don't\nthink it mattered at all. Likewise, I didn't think it \"too guided\"\n(with the introducing by names of the characters). It's a thoroughly\nengaging story with great understated performances. A light romantic\ncomedy that I couldn't take my eyes off. I watched it again very\nquickly after the first time. Okay, Owen Wilson might be playing Woody\nAllen but I'm fine with that. It might be what we need in the world.\nOh, and Michael Sheen is excellent.\n"
"\ni am not a fan of Woody Allen, even less of a fan after his marriage to\nhis adopted daughter, but it seems that Hollywood and the movie-going\npublic can almost forgive anything. And let's face it, he has not made\na good movie in years. i know many think Vickie Christina Barcelona was\ngreat, but i thought it was awful. Owen Wilson was an odd choice for\nthe lead and his nose distracts me, but i stuck it out and actually\nenjoyed the film. Owen seemed to be changeling Woody through the whole\nfilm. i think Woody wanted to play this role, but realises he isn't a\ngreat actor and he is too old now. Perhaps i enjoyed the scenes of\nParis more than the film. i love Paris. i had problems with the\ncharacters, especially Inez played by Rachel McAdams. i liked the idea\nof going back in time and living another life, but then it seemed more\nabout him cheating on his girlfriend, which i did not like. If you love\nAllen or Paris, then i would say watch it, once won't be a complete\nwaste.\n"
"\nThis one was a struggle for me to get through. Actually I'm kinda\nsurprised by all the rave reviews here. I think what put me off the\nmost was how annoying all the central characters are. Griping,\nobnoxious, arguing and just being horrible tourists. Owen Wilson was\nalright, bumbling along as usual, this time with a bit of a Woody Allen\nthing going on because that's who he's meant to be right?! <br><br>This was beautifully filmed though and the love story to Paris is\nreally the best part of the movie. I also enjoyed the storyline, I was\ninto the fantasy of travelling back in time to 1920; intriguing and\nmagical. It was also fun to see some familiar faces playing the likes\nof Salvador Dali and Earnest Hemingway and it seemed like the actors\nwere having a great time with their roles. 04.14.14\n"
"\nIt is a very shallow and silly story. A pathetic salad made of famous\nartists and writers combined with a unimpressive main character. The\nmain idea of the movie - magically getting back in time to meet most\nnoticeable people of the past - is older than the oldest motion\npicture. <br><br>It starts as a vacation in Paris of a young couple that is about to\nmarry. He is a writer, she is a shopaholic. These two really do not\nmatch each other. Miraculously he starts to get back in time every\nnight and meet most famous writers and artists of the past. Gradually\nhe learns that his relationship is rubbish - something that is clear to\neverybody from the beginning of the movie.<br><br>True waste of time!\n"
