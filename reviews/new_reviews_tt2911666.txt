based on the reviews i read in here i was expecting much more from this movie
yes the movie is action packed but very much over done
certainly not a quality movie by any means with a weak story line
it was like being in an action game where the lead had unlimited lives
he is invincible no matter how many times he is shot
there are assumptions that we will understand the rules of the committee but these are never explained and we are left with very few answers the end
in light of the over the top and often excessive violence and killings i must say keanu reeves performance is the only highlight of the film
overall however a very weak story with unnecessary and excessive violence and a plot that is more suited for a playstation game
i do not know what a lot of you others are drinking before you watched this attempt at a film but i will not be imbibing thats for sure
there are comments in some of the reviews here that this will be a new cult film that it is the best action film of the year etc etc etc
sorry but fail is the only word that comes to mind
the gratuitous and total violence is just pathetic and i might say a serious low point in american culture
keanu has returned
from what
he looks like a very sad has been actor forced to not act so that the film maker can get his rocks off on this masturbation or a movie
i hope that the directors and producers of this garbage are duly banned from ever making another attempt
seriously people if you liked this film then you need to seriously look in the mirror
i mean really
if the mirror dont crack then just be thankful
if i had to find just one redeeming factor i would be very hard pressed
ok  i liked the little dog
yuk
cannot think of anything to redeem this movie
fight scenes were boring with baddies unable to find their target at 3 feet
an expert as john wick was supposed to be was unable to fight off 2 thugs and an idiot in his own house
he could shoot every other baddie but when it came to iosef he kept missing
why didnt he kill ms perkins
what was the significance of the gold coins or was i too uninterested to catch what it was
also willem dafoe was just a pointless addition could have put anyone in that part who just wanted to collect a cheque for little contribution
again keanu fails to impress and this was 100 minutes of my life i will not get back
do yourself a big favour and give it a miss really
put your brain on hold and just sit back and relax for an hour and forty five minutes while keanu reaves finds a multitude of ways to kill many nasty people
the story is silly but the action is continuous as wick is pursued throughout by men and women with bad intentions
he is a karate expert and is also skilled with a variety of knives and firearms which are quite useful to our hero
his background is sketchy and never really explained but one must just suspend belief and just take the ride as if on a roller coaster
willem defoe shows up to fill out a decent cast with reaves carrying most of the load as he is in almost every scene
it looks good and the new york locations are a good choice
a final 7
510
this movie has some of the best quotes i have heard since a tarantino movie
a past assassin who tries out a new life of marriage and bliss
when he looses his wife and someone kills his only thing given to him from his wife before she died he has to dip his feet back in the pond of chaos and ends up taking out the whole russian gang of new jersey to kill the bastard son and everyone infected with the curse of being related or working for the kids father who is the russian mob boss of new jersey
great acting great actors and i noticed keanu is doing a lot of his own stunt work in this movie and had to do a lot of close combat training for this movie and future movies to come
i seen he stars in knock knock a recent sun dance movie just released but akira is the movie i am waiting to see him in
this movie is great and keeps on you on the edge of your seat
watch it to find out if he gets revenge for the person who took everything from him after he lost the only thing that mattered in his new good life
this is a worse film i had seen in last years and i just do not get how it comes here to average from 7
the story is guy kills hundreds of people because of one dog
wonderful
and on the top implementation detractlacks any logic
it is so sad to see such a great actor in that kind of crap movie  so sad

cannot believe how weak and pathetic this movie was
i was expecting at least a plausible story line and gripping action with keanu reeves in it
but reeves acting was so shallow and unbelievable as was everyone elses
the plot was barely existent and everything in it was just a repeat of so many other movies
the action was stiff and repetitive and absolutely lacking in reality
the story was unbelievable to the point of being ridiculous and the concept of reeves being able to do even a small portion of what he was pictured to do was just absurd
can hardly believe actors of reeves caliber could even consent to act in this bgrade rubbish
its like a kids movie  all impossibility and fantasy
nothing gripped me at all not for a moment
one of the worst movies ive ever seen
this movie is an offense on my iq  it was 100 predictable from the beginning  complete waste of time so disappointed with imdb for giving this movie 7
5  why
i am expected to write 10 lines of text about the movie that doesnt even deserve one
i could easily say it was one of the worst movies ive watched recently  give you my word
actually the reason i decided to open an account in imdb was to share my displeasure with the actors the plot and pretty much everything else
there was a countless number of moments when i literally couldnt believe the producers managed to get away with such unsophisticated b class stereotypical unengaging movie
so my word of advice is no
i watched whiplash only yesterday and it made me feel like changing from form mustang to fiat punto
shitty movie
honestly after the first 20 minutes i had to turn if off
really
killing a dog
was that necessary
also it hurt my ears to hear the terrible russian being spoken by the bad dudes and the guys who play the gang members arent even russian for god sakes
and as a russian i gotta say i am also incredibly sick of hollywood literally always using russians as the bad guys
change it up for once
keanu reeves has played the same character even if different movies for the last several years
blah blah revenge exhitman blah blah good guy versus bad guys blah blah blah
hollywood movies these days are all identical and lack originality
save your time and watch something older like an action movie from the 80s and 90s
lmao
this movie was so sick that i have renamed it
its john sick rather
i have never seen such a crappy flick for ages now
what was it all about
how could he survive all the bullets shot at him and how come whoever he shot at got killed
im disgusted that i ruin my weekend for this movie
keannus acting was awful too
he was ind of frozen in the whole movie
no expressions at all
i was still recovering from the action scenes from the equalizer and here we go another crappy flick
i still have 4 lines to qualify for the review submission
i just dont know what to write
please do watch it once everyone
i want you all to go through the same pain i went through
i bet it would be a great movie but unfortunately i pressed stop after a couple of minutes
the first scene was about john wick who loses his wife and he is sad and angry
second scene his dead wife sends him a present which was a puppy for him to take care and love how sweet and sad
third scene some creepy guys break into his home cause earlier they wanted to buy his car but john did not sale it to them
so because the movie wasnt so tragic and dramatic all ready you probably thought that something was missing
what about killing the puppy
of course you killed the puppy and you made the movie worth watching now or not
to sum up a wife dies he is depressed violent guys want to kill him for his car and because there is not enough drama already they kill the puppy
what a start
i wonder if after that john wick becomes hit man and tries to get revenge for his puppys death driving his car
thank you and sorry
had high hopes for this film after seeing good reviewsbut it was really bad
after the first ten minutes it turned into a video game with all the bad guys getting shot so easily
keanu reeves just grunts the whole way through with most of the other characters acting as if they are from another planet
maybe next time ill scroll down the page to read a few more reviews rather than the headline rating
the penny dropped when the credits started to roll and i saw that most of the direction and producers were from russia so it was made for the russian market
has there ever been a good russian film
please dont tell me there is a john wick 2
yep this is a good action film kind of simple but good
the action in this film is enough to keep action movie fans happy
it didnt have long boring scenes that would have you sitting around waiting for some action to start
it was perfectly done much like predator or the equalizer or better yet the matrix
in fact while watching this film i was reminded of the matrix a time or two
no mystery why
the acting was done well too
there were a few familiar faces from the small screenhbo as well
all of the characters were convincing and believable
john wickkeanu reeves is an exhitman who is forced to come back to work to find the people who took everything from him
like i said its simple but its good
now it is violent but it is fun to watch and it will keep you interested
a basic straight forward bare bones plot makes way for what may be the greatest action flick in over a decade
john wick serves as a breath of fresh air for the action genre
jam packed with slick and stylish gun play judo jiu jitsu highly quotable dialogue and of course the seemingly immortal keanu reeves himself now age 50
the cinematography is beautiful
the soundtrack is killer
the action scenes are allowed room to breathe and unfold in a way that is always satisfying and never cluttered or confusing
as previously stated the story is bland yet no one cares
the movie is just damn fun
why should it need to be anything other than what it is
recently with the oscar fever i have been watching mostly drama or real life scenario type of movies
i have been wanting to watch john wick for a long while
hence yesterday i decided ill give it a go
i was in for a super duper action treat
mind you the action is mindless
crazy shooting he pulls a trigger people die but people will capture him and only talk to him
so if you are ready for these kind of logical nonsense then this is the movie for you
keanu reeves seems to have got it right
he looks convincing as the superhuman superpowered supreme hitman
the background score of the movie is the highlight
classic stuff for action scenes
anybody a fan of the 90s action movie and leave your brain in the locker and watch this movie
youll enjoy it
the film is so contrived
you know whats going to happen from the off
character development and everything is so basic its laughable
you could have got a film student to write and direct the entire thing
im flabbergasted that people actually think this is a great film
whats so unique about it that no other film has got
the acting is wooden the scenes unbelievable and this just a payday for those involved
trust me youve seen it all before
if youre willing to put all common sense behind you and take everything at face value then perhaps this film is for you
oh my god its just finishing as i write and i cant believe the final scene
now i know this film was rated by kids for kids
how can this movie rate 7 in imdb
i registered today for another reason but i also wanted to rate john wick
sorry sorry sorry this movie is not good at all
very bad acting no good scenario no good light
stupid russian racism mafia in us is mostly jewish so i consider this movie as a gross propaganda like anti russian equalizer movie
usa is a fascist empire  controlled at 80 by zionists  statement by the prime minister of israel bibi in 2013
economy is down because ultra liberalism has allowed the most vicious and unethical jewish mafia to rule the world
now they want people to fight and forget who put the world into chaos so they bring war between west and east russia and muslims
its the fight of bad against good
your society will collapse because it is based on lies
so the whole idea of justice and epitome of firstworld problems goes to the fantastic plot of invincible kiwi reeves who starts going all crazy killing everyone in the world over a car which he gets replaced for free and a dog he didnt really like and had around for two days
despite the fact that the dog was a gift from his freshly dead wife he chucked some blankets on the floor and took it off the bed
the same man who had no feelings over the dog had no feelings expressed when his best buddy got killed
are viewers supposed to root for such a spoiled rich boy
are viewers supposed to believe that a hitman incapable of loving can all of a sudden switch to his cell phone video of his wife and think about her from time to time
kiwis character is full of contradictions like the movie for a 5 year old
this movie was incredible
the plot was pretty simple but they were able to make a simple plot an awesome movie
this movie has your attention from the beginning
this movie was a solid 9 for the simple fact that the action was awesome and the characters did a great job acting
the movie took a turning point for me when i realized marcus william defoe was still being a good friend
i didnt know how this movie would stand out until then
uncreative amateurish plot with terrible acting like most keanu reeves films
ridiculous shootemup action throughout with no redeeming moments
i gave up after reeves had slaughtered his 153rd victim with little more than a few scratches in return
one of willem dafoes poorest performances and typical of keanus highschool acting
even one of my favorite actresses bridget moynahan drowned in the murky waters of this garbage film
the musical score sounded like it was produced by a bad garagegroup of teenagers
the cinematography sucked and it took an uncommon stayingpower and determination to sit through it til the end
this flick is a total waste of time and anyone who gives it more than a 2 has been smoking bad weed
this movie clearly wants to be in the original taken category but alas it cannot be
its just a boring one note action flick that would be a b movie if not for its a list star and obvious polished locations
i like looking at keanu as much as anyone but him punching a lot of people does not a good movie make
its as good as the taken sequels that is not say not good at all
there is no time spent to create a world behind each character its just heres a guy punch him shoot him
it feels like a cartoon for very stupid boys
there isnt a good line in the entire thing
the most memorable scene is a girl entering a swimming pool in high heels
before i start i feel i have to state that john wick is more than just another popcorn movie
its stunning choreography seamless switchingup of fighting styles and without a doubt its cast are impeccable
reminiscent of other revenge thrillers such as taken and the man from nowhere john wick enthrals the audience with its visuals while keeping you connected with its personal performances
keanu reeves was born to play the part of john wick the nice quiet guy with a big dark secret
if youre looking for a movie you need to watch twice to fully grasp its countless layers and subplots go watch memento or donnie darko
if youre looking for a movie you want to watch twice because you have to show your buddy what a bada keanu reeves is then look no further
john wick is as manly as a steak dinner washed down with a 6pack of pbr
i thoroughly enjoyed this film and cannot wait for john wick 2
this movie was a waste of my time
with movies like the equalizer and the remake of oldboy the idea of the revenge concept is become more and more prominent
they have also become extremely exciting but what was the appeal of those films
the characters were interesting and made the action more fun and promising over just seeing some guy beat up a bunch of people
john wick was that
it as a beat em up revenge movie
it was a pointless movie that dragged on
i mean really
why do i care
i didnt feel a reason too
i didnt care about who john wick was or what he wanted and the whole mythes about him
this film gave me no reason too
people wanna talk about transformers age of extinction
pfft talk about john wicks lets just fight movie cause that is all that it was
john wick is great low cost action film which which strong fights sense thorough out the film
which keanu reeves best films since the matrix
i think the story it little bit lacking but this not driving by the the stories narrative
the start of the film which starts showing him at the his lowest point with the wife pasting always which his wife gave him a dog to keep her companies
when the group people which what his car they decided to steel it from john wick which previous life turn out to be exhitman comes out of retirement to track down the gangsters that took away everything form him
the action sense great change the action fight sense back to simple form which thew cut not like the other film such as film like taken and marvel films which too much cut between each simple fight sense
it best action pack in 2014
another awesome performance from keanu reeves
i really like the plot
all the action are very nice executed if some real fighting moves from martial arts
i like the shooting scenes and for these one keanu received some special training
the soundtrack is another interesting thing from the movie it fit well
i am looking forward to see the second movie of that one released earlier this year 2017
for action movies fans keanu reeves fans this is another movie to be seen
now ive seen mr
wick also doing something human like sleeping in a bed sharing some breakfast with a lovely little dogimpressive scene discovering the puppy and reading his dead wifes letter
as the first film of a manchad stahelski the director who has previously been a stuntman and a martial artist its a great achievement
accumulating considerable experience as a stuntman in films as point break 1991 the matrix 1999 the matrix reloaded 2003 the matrix revolutions 2003 constantine 2005  man of tai chi 2013 all with keanu reeves it was natural that stahelski and reeves will work together again achieving something even more spectacular
good action and great music
i liked this film because it follows the formula of revenge but its not terribly boring
it feels somewhat fresh
there are good believable performances and it manages to hold your interest at a medium level for the entire film
some of it feels original as well
i like that
the gun work is amazing
the fight scenes are good and the create a world that feels believable
i was able to suspend disbelief for a little while and enjoy this world
to many film today operate with the premise that the audience knows its all fake
a good film draws you in and makes you believe in the theme of the story the plight of the characters and their emotions
id say this film has some success in doing this
i liked it
it doesnt deserve 10 stars but was a good movie
a combination between james bond with daniel craig and jason stathams movies
i havent watched many movies with keanu reeves lately and im glad i saw this
now ill watch the chapter 2 to see how is it
i hope ill like it
i finally got around to seeing john wick folks say you should see the this one before seeing the 2nd
the movie is exciting enough the soundtrack is loud and seems to ebb and flow with the level mr
wicks killing carnage
mr
reeves is certainly looking good for age 52 and is impressive as he jumps around wrestling and killing folks
i will never get the concept of someone going off to war because someone kills his dog and steals his car but you certainly dont have to understand that to enjoy the movie
im not sure how many of these john wick movies they can keep making without giving the character a little more emotional resonance
the way it looks now john wick is some kind of natural step between humans making and directing movies and artificial intelligence taking over the movie making

john wicks simplicity is what brings this movie from a minor league to a major league
john wick in its glory gives us as viewers eye candy to watch over and over
im rating this action film high because this is one of the very few action movies i can watch over and over
it does have its shortcomings however
john wick fails to deliver new action thrills and sticks with the same old movie tropes that we have become accustomed to
just as the matrix set a tone for this almost masterpiece it suffers from ive seen that before oh but thats a great scene i recommend john wick for people who like action and a simple plot
thank you for reading
an exhitman comes out of retirement to track down the gangsters that took everything from him
over the last few years actor keanu reeves had both his ups and downs and he has made some pretty awful films but also some pretty enjoyable but nothing is enjoyable as much as john wick a character that even liam neeson would be afraid of i mean seriously how can i explain how freaking amazing this film looks and sounds like
great characters great acting cool soundtrack and amazing action sequences that will blow your mind and of course it ends with a hint on a sequel which is coming out next month john wick part 2 in my opinion this film deserves its place next to films such as die hard equalizer commando first blood and more because its not just enjoyable but its also pretty amazing in every scale that you could even imagine
i had several friends tell me this was a great movie so i went into it with above average expectations
sadly i was disappointed
i enjoy movies where the main characters are bigger than life but this was just one big disappointment for me
there was no brains to the movie
the main characters mode of operation didnt have the slightest hint of realism
the fight scenes were well choreographed but highly improbable and quite clicha
if you want action movies with a brain i highly recommend the professional leon bourne identity or the usual suspects
if you want an action movie with a better story and more entertainment watch the boondock saints
if youre just looking for a highly stylized action movie here is some basic entertainment for you
its just blood shedding
what a pathetic story line
i will say there is no story
i dont know how it got 7
2 rating
it was a waste of time after you have seen bourn series
he keeps on killing around like a super hero or something
and you look at other people as if they are nothing
people get killed like chickens
nothing happens to the kenu as he is a super hero or something
i had a lot of expectations after i saw rating 7
2  it was a waste of 2 hour and it spoiled my mood also
they want you to write 10 lines for a review
actually no one can write 10 lines for this movie
its all about blood shed
he is a man of steel or something
and he is not even quick in his moves
why bullets doesnt touch him that should be investigated
the filmmakers of john wick looked at action movies and figured out a way to make them better
what if you cut everything that the movie didnt need  the love interest the convoluted plot and the moralizing
whats left is a pure action movie without anything it doesnt need
they knew people liked choreographed action sequences and they filled the movie with plenty of them
in subtle ways it makes advances in the genre
for example notice how characters react when they hear the name  john wick
theyre instantly terrified
the one thing that i wanted that the film didnt give me was something truly original
unlike the matrix or inception which really changed action movies this movie doesnt
but man if it doesnt change the game it plays the game like a true master
too bad i had to give this movie a 1 rating
it really deserves a zero
i cant believe at one time it had an 8
at least now its on its way down
i enjoy action films but they should have some sense of reality and character development
john wick has neither
gratuitous violence on 100 i lost count bad guys who are seemingly just waiting to be dispatched by john
no attempt at creative engagement of the bad guys
just show up at a particular location and start shooting
shoot 20 or more bad guys at a nightclub on the dance floor while people keep dancing
give me a break
more like a video game than an engrossing entertaining movie
i kept waiting for my countdown counter to reach zero which seemed to take forever
an hour and 40 minutes totally wasted
if youre over 15 skip it
ultraedited and devoid of originality this turd is ultraviolence sensationalized for the sake of show with absolutely no thought
it is an overthehill keanu reeves star comeback movie without the comeback
it is a diarrhea amp vomit of direction
rather it has overcooked music and cheesepuff rock and is as poor a movie as ive seen in the last few years
well this imdb rating is here to help bring some honesty to how bad this steamer is
bad accents bad dialog russian accented english or russian interspersed with blah blah who cares semblences of conversation  john wick the boogieman killer
blah
think of better or even average actionthrillers like equalizer history of violence or the taken movies and this movie rips off from every single one
made by 9 year olds
slogged through this utter drivel knowing better
embarrassing for all filmmakers involved and the mayhem guy from the insurance commercials catching a payday
210
people might rave on how good action this movie shows
to me its just pointless
even if i swallow the fact that mr
wick is doing impossible things during the entire film the story about an ex hitman that goes back in business for revenge is so thin that it could have been told in 10 minutes instead of two hours
all the movie shows is a thousand ways how to kill someone nothing else basically
although nicely filmed its a big pointless yawn in the end
keanu reeves does his acting job much much better in the matrix and the action parts there are much more enjoyable
waste your time on something with brains behind it
this lacks it completely
when i first heard the movie title i was thinking this movie was going to be awful boy was i wrong
john wick is on of the best action films i seen in years
it starts off very touching and you feel a lot of sympathy for mr
wick then he turns up the volume until the speakers pop
keanu reeves is at his prime in this movie
it makes me wonder where hes been
so glad he came back in a movie like this one
dont let people trick you into the thinking this is the keanu from the matrix cause its not
this is the keanu reeves youve been craving to see
this is one man you dont want to mess with and someone u want on your side
hope to see more from him
but i really think its going to be hard to put up another performance like this one
great movie and it definitely belongs in your movie collection
two thumbs way up
john wick is easily keanus best film since the original and only good film in the franchise matrix
the action slowly builds along with the tension as wick seeks revenge for the murder of his dog and the theft of his beloved car great scene in the garage when the thieves turn up with wicks stolen car and leguizamo realises whos car it is and what is coming next
the bad guys get no sympathy as carnage ensues and reeves is great as the relentlessly cold killer
this film is the taken sequel that has never happened
nyqvist gets to play a heartless bad guy and mafioso style boss whos son is the primary goal of wicks revenge
i disagree with those who say there is no story to this film some of the same people liked speed which is and always has been simply awful
and i think the characters are reasonably well thought out and the acting good for a film of this genre
overall a very entertaining action thriller
havent seen a nice action movie of keanu reeves since the matrix
i enjoyed every minute of it
sure the plot seems a lot like a classic case of ex super ultra assassin being a one man army but it is well structured and never leaves you bored
the atmosphere is good and gives the feeling of a city that is governed by a crime syndicate
acting is quite good compared to other recent action movies i saw lately
i hope keanu reeves continues to star in more good movies because he was quite unseen during the last decade or so with very few exceptions
at first i was sceptical about the rating i saw but after watching the movie i think it deserves it
in todays day it is as hard to make a good action movie as it is to break box office records
thrillers may be based on tried and tested formulate but that is the reason why to bring something new and refreshing becomes harder and harder in this genre
john wick is a tale of revenge a man with a violent past who is brought back to the life he left behind when he is brutally attacked and his dog is killed
the plot works because it doesnt try anything new in fact it takes you back several decades to lee marvin in point blank
keanu reevess character of john wick is a throwback to lee marvin charles bronson and every other bad ass who doesnt bother to say much but shoots instead
this in itself is refreshing just a simple action thriller with no overcomplicated storyline and ingenious twist
this movie is quite different to the other great tale of revenge released at the same time the equalizer mainly because keanu reeves is a much different actor to denzel washington
john wick is for the lovers of hard action and no frills

its funny but i am not sure what is 7
4 about this film
is that keanu reeves
well this guy may know how to act but he doesnt show that in this movie
how about the plot
what is the plot
you killed my dog and stole my car and now you want to apologize
common man you cant apologize i got to kill you and few thousand people around you cause i cant make a movie otherwise
and a way he kills
man i think every single video game maker would envy this director
oh i must admit that this movie fulfills the hollywood mandatory condition where russians are the bad guys
has anyone noticed johns replies in this movie to most of the questions asked
he just repeats what he heard and sounds like michael armstrong in the hot fuzz
all in all i would recommend this movie if you are still with segamega drive but if you have ever played a game called counterstrike then you might consider this movie boring
for all other viewers just dont bother
oh my
where do i start
ridiculous script based on the clicha one versus entire russian mafia painful acting senseless shooting scenes one after the other
sorry to see 2 fine actors from the excellent tv series the wire in such poor roles
keanu reeves plays a guy so bad ass that killed 3 with nothing but a pencil but was owned in his house by the 3 stooges that beat him up killed his dog and stole his car one of them his former bosses son which was about the only living person that didnt know whom he was
makes sense right
i gave it 2 stars because it made me laugh and i laughed again when i saw its score here on imdb but i have to say that it is still a bit better than 3 days to kill
what a great movie this movie is a nonstop fun rollercoaster ride
i love keanu reeves
he is perfect in this film
this is the type of movie people will see over and over again
waited in a long line to see it but it was well worth it
amazing special effects great acting great everything
best movie i have seen all year
keanu reeves is back after a long break and he is better than ever
this is like a combination of speed and the matrix combined
directors leitch and stahelski have created a beautiful looking action picture one that is large enough to deserve the imax experience
john wick is the real deal
it is a amazing action picture filled with strong performances by a cast along with superb action setpieces and a genuinely interesting world to boot
reeves commands the screen and reminds us why he is still a genuine movie star
an exbad guy against bad guys who went very bad with him nothing more to add about the screenplay of john wick
the rage and the aim for revenge do not create a real empathy to the viewer
this is all about restless killing and were easily led to like the bloody show anyway which makes the movie okay
610
another typical adrenalinefuelled revenge flick lowlife angers unstoppable killing machine carnage follows secondary subplot develops further carnage lowlife dies secondary subplots resolved by additional carnage semiredemptive ending with unstated promise of a sequel a need i say more
the movie would have benefited from little more focus on the underworld motif and a few less exploding suvs and generic russianmafia corpsesinwaiting
if you like this kind of thing in general youll really like the movie hence the relatively high imdb score if you dont you likely wont make it past the first death
i fall somewhere in between i like these kind of movies when there is some substance underlying the style
unfortunately there is nothing to john wick beyond endless photogenic but interchangeable fight scenes
keanu reeves plays the liam neeson role in this slick sharp vicious little bout of revenge fantasy
with support work from a whole mess of i know that guys and a blowaway effects budget its a real riot to watch not to mention one hell of a tech demo for the masterminds behind the fight scenes
like those neeson killemalls though its as straight as an arrow and shallower than the kiddie pool
in some ways its refreshing to just dispense with all the stereotypical origin trappings and get right into the firefights but at the end of the show it just feels like one long easy excuse to watch a whole mess of cool stuff without any extra justification
lustworthy cars ferocious weaponry powerful westernstyled physicality stereothumping tunes magnificent cityscapes the list just goes on and on
escapists delight for john wick has come to deliver a dream
cinephiles wella just sit back and try to let the sheer celebratory brutality beat your conscience into submission
it wont be too difficult
aahhh it took me a while to watch this movie because it looks like just another bad action flick the poster is not helping either
i love films from foreign docsfestival to the hollywood blockbusters of all genres
i hunt for certain directors and i do love intellectual films or some might call them art flicks
but the genre that i do miss is the action trash  grind house films  in the glory days of vhs many films were released only for the vhs market
many of those are the simple dirty action films some are bad and some are so bad its great
well
john wick reminds me of that
no bs revenge films
if you are aware of the charles bronsons death wish john wick has a similar idea
recently i am very happy with what liam neeson does  taken 12 and a walk among tombstone john wick has similar feel
dont expect cannes films or look for holes this is like i said a b movie on a mainstream market
great ride shootem up midnight snack  only if those seedy cinemas still around
