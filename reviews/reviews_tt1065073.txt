"\nThis is the Emperor's New Clothes all over again. The movie runs two\nhours and 45 minutes to cover 12 years, and believe me, it seems like\n12 years. There is nothing of interest in the film. It is about\nnothing. Nothing happens, except children grow up, parents grow up,\nchildren make friends, parents marry again and again. No drama, no\nhumor, no sadness, no happiness.<br><br>Just boring people leading boring lives, and the gimmick of using real\nchildren and filming them at yearly intervals to show how they grow, is\njust that, a gimmick. The boy of the title is a slacker, seeking\nmeaning by doing nothing. Save your money, and more important, save\nyour three hours and see another movie, any other movie.\n"
"\nOne of the more overrated films lately.<br><br>The good: production, shooting, editing, sound -- were all good.<br><br>The great: the idea of following the same boy and others for 11 years.\nTransitions from age to age were beautiful.<br><br>The tiresome: the acting. It was OK, but nothing that grabs you. Ellar\nColtrane was at his acting best when he was young, but gradually got\nmore stilted. This could have been due to the director more than to\nhim.<br><br>The ugly: The script. Existential drivel, over and over. Every\ncharacter was written in a way that remained two-dimensional,\nespecially his sister and mother. Ethan Hawke as his father did the\nbest job of any of them in bringing some depth of life to his role.\n"
"\nWorst 3 hours of my life it got to the end and I was still waiting for\nsomething to happen. I would of had a more productive time watching\ngrass grow. Don't waste your time watching this film. I don't see the\npoint in the film or what it was trying to achieve. It went through a\nboys life that had no real significant moments in it. The most\noutrageous thing he did was smoke a cigarette at 15. It was basically a\nfilm of a kids life that would not effect or inspire anybody. He was a\npessimist with no real goals in life he didn't go through any dramatic\ntransformations or offer anything to the world he didn't achieve much-\nit was a pointless film. It was like the film was made to actually be\nas bad, boring and ordinary as possible- not one part of the film was\nembellished or interesting. To sum it up, an awful film.\n"
"\nI'll start:<br><br>1. 12 years of wasted time; 2. Literally nothing happens for 3 hours;\n3. Scumbag stepfathers everywhere; 4. The transition from cute kid to\nan emo kid; 5. I only write this, cuz IMDb requires 10 lines of text;\n6. 12 years of indie rock bands; 7. Not sure if gay; 8. Most epic twist\nin movie history lol jk; 9. Can't believe it's nominated for an Oscar;\n10. Best movie to sleep on; 11. How to throw away $4,000,000; 12. The\nboring life of a regular kid; 13. Unfortunately it didn't get more HD\neach 20 minutes; 14. Desperate housewife; 15. Much feels wow; 16. This\nis why you shouldn't trust IMDb ratings; 17. Shot in 12 years, lasts 12\nyears also.\n"
"\nThey spent 12 years filming but no actual thought on the plot or\nending. Afters 2 hours I finally realized this movie was never gonna\nget to a point or climax. And it ended with nothing. If you want to\nwatch just to see the actors age and their acting improve then yes\nwatch. But don't watch if you need a story, your not gonna get one\nhere. It was basically a movie about a family, no happy ending no\nlessens learned, just life how it goes, super boring and slow. I think\nthe producers could have given it an ending or a meaning of something\nor the kid learn a lesson or anything. But that didn't happen, it just\nended.\n"
"\nI don't have a huge amount to say about this film as I feel absolutely\nnothing happens within the space of 3 very long hours.<br><br>For those of you who have taken the time to read my review and have\nwatched the film I have a question. Would you praise this film to the\nextent that is has been if you hadn't watched the actors grow up over\nthe course of 12yrs? Would this film have been as critically acclaimed\nif they had used different actors as they grew like the majority of\nfilms? My personal answer is no. And my reason being that the dialogue\nis tedious thrown in with a lot of unlikable characters.<br><br>I'm not denying the concept is brilliant and original. However, overall\nthis film did nothing for me except remind me the annoyance of puberty.\n"
"\nSPOILER ALERT! a boy grows a mustache.<br><br>SPOILER ALERT! nothing happens.<br><br>SPOILER ALERT! a boy grows a mustache.<br><br>SPOILER ALERT! this review now has more lines than the film.<br><br>SPOILER ALERT! the film is an elaborate joke at the audience's expense.\n"
"\nThis is easily the most over-rated movie I have ever seen in my life. I\nwent to it with very high expectations given all the amazing reviews. I\nfound the movie to be extremely trite, cliché, over-wrought, boring,\npretentious and too long. <br><br>The movie basically rests on the gimmick of filming the same actors for\n12 years. Take that away, and the movie is nothing but one cliché scene\nafter another. So if you're in to seeing people kinda slowly age/grow\nup, then this movie will blow you away, because that's basically all\nthat it offers. If you are looking for a good engaging story, I'm\nafraid this does not have it.\n"
"\nHated it. Most boring film of the year. Could've followed someone a bit\ninteresting for ten years, rather than this boring tripe. Sit around\nthe kitchen table, go to school, kitchen table, school, father in law\ngets drunk, school, table etc etc. You get the idea. That's it in a\nnutshell. Sorry for all the spoilers, but Turkey of the year for me, do\nnot understand how so many people like it. Probably many boring people\nrelate to it. Hope it doesn't win any Oscars, there are many other\nfilms more worthy, just because this is a unique film doesn't make it a\ngood one. <br><br>Acting is terrible, and there is no plot, obviously. It's just a 3 hour\ndocumentary following a family who get divorced. But are still friends.\nBut I'm struggling to see the story here, surely if you are going to do\nsomething as clever as is, at least make it worthwhile. Most kids\ngrowing up have a trip to hospital it an accident, this kid doesn't.\nNowt. Didn't even have a personality.......\n"
"\nI have just wasted nearly 3 hours of valuable movie time just to see\nwhat all the fuzz is about<br><br>Whoever finds this movie \"special\" because it took a bit of time to\nfilm it: get a life and don't try to be arty.<br><br>Just for the record: if I could have given this movie less than one\nstar I definitely would have<br><br>I was seriously bothered by the attitude and the uselessness of these\nkids and the way they try to be all knowing and \"different\". <br><br>Grow up, get a job and make a difference.<br><br>No entertainment value. Definitely not a classic in the making. Have\nsome pain killers ready. If you need to watch the whole thing, have\nsome red bull nearby. <br><br>Please rate this thing for what it is worth: 1 star\n"
"\nI'm going to start off by saying that this is the first movie or show\nthat I have ever reviewed, and I have watched a lot of them. \"Boyhood\"\nseemed like a great concept to me and the trailer looked interesting\nenough to give it a shot, but what really made me go to see it were all\nof these reviews calling it a \"masterpiece\". <br><br>This may have been one of the WORST movies I have ever seen.<br><br>If sitting in a chair and watching absolutely nothing happen for 2\nhours and 45 minutes is something that sounds appealing to you then I\nhighly recommend this film. I honestly have no idea how someone could\neven call this a good movie, let alone a \"masterpiece\" or a \"once and a\nlifetime experience\". I'm legitimately angry that I watched this movie.\n"
"\nI went to this movie expecting an incredible \"masterpiece\" as\nadvertised. On a Saturday afternoon, there were about 25 people there.\nI was so very disappointed. This movie went on and on and on. So much\nso that I continued to look at my watch wondering when this movie would\nend. Would it ever end?? And then it kept going. While the idea of\nfilming over a 12 year time frame is unique and very clever, the film\njust needs major editing. It's the story of a boy growing up. There was\nabuse which was painful to watch, but basically the film was just too\nslow paced and boring. It goes on for almost 3 hours so take a meal\nwith you if you decide to go despite these alerts. It is just slow,\nlong and boring. I seriously considered just getting up and leaving and\nasking for my money back. I wasn't sure if everyone was in the same\npain I was, but I also considered standing up and yelling \"when will\nthis film ever end?\".\n"
"\nThis was the worst movie I've ever seen, truly. Expecting an\ninteresting insightful chronicle, instead you get a warped concept and\na painfully dysfunctional family. The pace was slow, uninteresting, and\nunreal. It was like listening to a college student perpetually asking,\n\"What is the meaning of life,\" instead of moving ahead in life. Since\nit was also difficult to identify with any of the characters, the\nviewer is left on the outside listening to someone boringly\nphilosophize their view of life. My wife and I went to see it because\nof the extremely high rating, but instead were imprisoned in a far too\nlong film. Perhaps critics ignored the trite story and awarded the\nsuccessful unique achievement of filming the same person over twelve\nyears. Ethan Hawke was outstanding as usual, and it was nice to see\nPatricia Arquette of Medium fame again. Otherwise save your money and\nespecially your time.\n"
"\nI usually don't comment on movies I didn't like, but after seeing the\nrating of this movie, I couldn't stop myself. The only interesting\nthing about this movie is, that it was shot over 12 years. Considering\nthat the whole movie was shot on 45 days, they filmed about 4 days each\nyear. That alone tells you a lot about this movie. The director didn't\ndo anything special. And the story is boring. Nothing happens. Movies\nare supposed to give the audience some kind of emotions. To feel sad,\nexcited, to be scared or to laugh. None of that happens. This movie is\na total waste of time. Take a look out of your window and watch birds\nfly or people walk by is more exciting believe me. I wouldn't even give\nthis movie 1 star, but there is nothing less available.\n"
"\nBecause of all the positive hype, I hoped for at least a good film. I'm\nleft wondering what it is I just don't get. So many good reviews? Even\nMark Kermode says the young actor in the film has 'screen presence' and\nI think WTF! He's playing a boring so and so - he's not supposed to\nhave presence.<br><br>I'm not sure if there's enough good stuff here even for 10 minutes -\nseriously. Certain things like Ethan Hawk showing an empty wallet\ncaught my empathy for a moment but not enough to merit sitting through\nnearly 3 hours of this. I just don't understand how it won the golden\nglobe for best film. Thankfully, there's a few negative reviews from\nlike-minded people for me to know I've not gone completely mad!\n"
"\nI do not understand any of the good reviews of this movie. I think that\nits' hook is the gimmick of the kids growing up in it. But there is\nnothing redeeming or even entertaining about this movie. It was\nterrible. The story bordered on depressing. The trailer leads one to\nbelieve that this is a documentary of a child's life, but it is not.\nThere are actors in it. It was awful, just awful and I do hope it will\nnot end up winning an Oscar. Surely someone could do a coming of age\nmovie better, or a documentary set over 12 years better. I wish I could\nunderstand what the reasoning behind the good reviews, I watched the\nmovie and I just cannot see it.\n"
"\nReal life, well yes for this boring persons and heroes of this movie.\nLife is here that is for sure but life that really should not be meant\nfor anybody as you can see that heroes of the movie are bored with\ntheir every day life and if that was intention than they really nailed\nit, but then again why watch it, what is the purpose in making movie\nabout completely regular life of one functional but boring family. At\nthe end of the movie I started to value my time only because I lost\nthree hours spending time with this people while I could have spent it\non my people and again if this was purpose of the movie then again\ngreat job, as I am going with my family now and we will have some joy\nand happiness so totally opposite then this and who nows maybe we will\nrecord things on video from now on and we will maybe make more enjoying\nlife movie with heroes getting older and with no budget at all. I\nwonder...\n"
"\nI only have one word to describe this movie: pointless. The traditional\ncue to a film crew, prior to shooting, is \"Lights Camera Action!\"\nWell, here, someone forgot to call for action. The film is 165 minutes\nof banality, without any artistic value. The camera work is simplistic.\nThe dialogues are superficial babble. Merely showing the everyday life\nof a typical US family is not cinema: it's a home movie.<br><br>True, I forget. This was filmed over a 12-year period. This is the only\nslightly distinctive feature of this horrible movie. This extensive\nperiod of filming reminded me of Nikita Mikhalkov's outstanding Anna:\n6-18, that I had seen in 1994 when it came out. While Mikhalkov painted\na stunning and compelling picture of the evolution of his daughter in\nthe faltering Soviet Union, Boyhood is a long and boring vacuum.\n"
"\nHere's the bottom line. I think there should be an exception for these\nIMDb reviews; considering there's really nothing of absolute revelation\nor a spectacular \"climax\". Everything you thought of going on in an\nordinary person's life that COULD happen, happens. That's it. Again,\nthis isn't a spoiler. You already knew what happens in this movie\nbefore even seeing the trailers; trust me. You're not missing anything.\nStay home and watch videos of your own family through the years. You'll\nbe happy you did.<br><br>I will add that if Ethan Hawke wins the Oscar for Supporting Actor, I\nwouldn't have a problem with it. He did do a good job at the role.\n"
"\nI am so disappointed in this movie.<br><br>The ratings gave me high expectations for this movie. But I feel really\nlet down.<br><br>This movie was meant to capture the true essence and experience of\ngrowing up and going through life.<br><br>It is directed and acted out so neutrally to try to make the movie as\n\"real\" as possible. But this is not reality. Reality has more emotion,\nmore struggle, more comedy, and more life.<br><br>Life is not an objective biography or recollection of events. It is a\nsubjective frenzy.<br><br>I can make a movie of me watching this movie and make it more alive.<br><br>TL;DR: This movie about life is more boring than life itself.\n"
"\nThis movie is based on clichés all over. I tried, really tried to get\ninto it for about 1.5-2 hours, but it was impossible. Seriously, top 5\nworst movies I have ever watched. <br><br>At the beginning, you still have hope that the movie could be\nreasonable (good performance of some actors, you start getting into the\nboy's life...). But this hope just fades away as the movie develops as\nextremely unexciting.<br><br>Imagine a boring life of a boy living in the USA. Translate that into a\n3 hour movie (but taking away any potential exciting moments, the ones\nwith adrenaline, interesting intellectual reflections, sex, etc, etc):\nthat's what this movie is. I am usually not that bold in criticizing\nmovies, but this one deserves it. Sorry, but it does.<br><br>Even the 10 minutes I watched of \"sharknado\" were better. At least it\nwas a bit funny.\n"
"\nRating Based on Criteria:<br><br>Sound: 1/2 The soundtrack reminds us which alternative rock songs were\npopular over the last decade.<br><br>Acting/Characterization: 0.5/2 The children grow up to be bad actors,\nwhile the adults give decent impressions of Ethan Hawke and Patricia\nArquette.<br><br>Script/Writing: 0/2 The script captures what life would be like if you\nwere surrounded by dull people and reality was a few borrowed\nmilestones from your favorite after school specials. <br><br>Visuals: 1/2 Occasionally, the characters commune with nature and the\nscenery is pretty.<br><br>Concept/Plot/Theme(s): 1/2 A filmmaker receives overwhelming praise for\ndevoting 12 years of his life to a thoroughly disengaged and\nuninteresting character. He earns a point from me for completely\nbamboozling his audience. <br><br>Total: 3.5/10<br><br>Rating Based on Gut Feeling: 4/10 This is a coming-of-age story in\nwhich no one on screen really matures and the audience ages\nconsiderably watching them.<br><br>Final Average Score: 3.75/10\n"
"\nBoyhood is truly an amazing film. Terrible, awkward cringe-inducing\ndialogue. Boring, uninspired cinematografy. Awful, poorly written\ncharacters. No story to keep you interested. Also, don't forget that\nthe movie's really long too. It almost feels twice the 12 YEARS.<br><br>Let's be serious here. They are saying the movie's revolutionary. It\ntook twelve years to make! But if you think about it, Harry Potter\nfranchise is same kind of thing as this film except with actual\ncharacters and plot.<br><br>But really... some people dare to call this movie a masterpiece? Hmm, I\nthink I will release my childhood movies. They were recorded in span of\n12 years. I'm pretty sure I'll get an Oscar.<br><br>In the conclusion. Spare yourself your sanity and don't watch this\nfilm. I'm pretty sure that once you get outside of the cinema you will\nfeel 12 years older. I got gray because of that movie.\n"
"\nI usually don't write these reviews, but I am so anti-inspired, and\nthis way would like to warn people if you don't like first 10 mins,\neverything later will be even worse. I thought that Skyline is worst\nmovie ever, but after watching this one I am really not sure. The plot\ndoesn't lead anywhere. Almost all characters have horrible\npersonalities, they are absolutely stupid and not capable to to lead\ntheir lives. Scenes are lasting too long, and for many I find no reason\nof including them to the movie. The movie lasts too long, and it is so\nfrustrating and irritating that after watching it, you realised it was\ntotal waste of time. Just don't make the same mistake.\n"
"\nLooking the reviews, I thought it was worth a watch. The 1st hour was\nnot too bad - highlights of the usual family problems in American\nculture etc - but the other 2 hrs was really disappointing. While the\ntimeline of actors and culture serves to make this movie somewhat\nunique, there wasn't much of a plot other than \"this is what it's like\nin real life\" (in which case, it would be a documentary but it was\nnot.) There was a good introduction (in the 1st hour...I was still\nwaiting to anticipate how the plot would go), but not much build-up, no\nclimax and no resolution. Pretty disappointing to what I thought might\nbe a good story.\n"
"\nI went into this movie cheerful, energized &amp; with high hopes after\nseeing that it was rated so highly on IMDb. After 2 hours (of the 2.75)\nI was absolutely ready to leave.<br><br>On the face of it, it seemed we might possibly receive something along\nthe lines of \"Into the wild\" a brilliant and gripping true story, with\nmany touching moments, but here, instead we get a mostly mundane,\nrepetitive, and dragging collection of snippets, that left me flat.\nThere was little storyline, or remarkable photography. An ordinary\nperformance by Arquette &amp; her unlikeable partners, detracted from the\nnatural understated awkwardness of the \"boy\". Ethan Hawke, as the\nestranged father was probably the most interesting character.<br><br>Could the fictional storyline have been any more uneventful? Nothing\nhappens! And I mean nothing...\n"
"\nI checked the spoiler box just in case, but nothing happens, nothing to\nspoil, huge waste of time. Everyone is allowed to formulate their own\nopinion about movies, but I would highly recommend to STAY AWAY from\nBoyhood, this movie is terrible. It is filmed over a twelve year\nperiod, yes twelve, same actors and actresses. The movie is 2 hours 46\nminutes long and we had to turn it off at 2 hours(2 hours of my life I\nwill NEVER get back). I love all kinds of movies, action, adventure,\ndrama, comedy, even a chick flick now and then, but this movie went\nnowhere, did nothing, and ended up like every other person in life. See\nit for yourself, but you have been warned. Cant figure out how its up\nfor 6 award nominations, other than the artsy fartsy crowd loves this\nkind of crap.\n"
"\nThe only thing interesting about this movie is the fact that there was\na serious commitment in peoples time to film it over 12 years. I did\nenjoy watching the main characters develop/grow over 12 years but the\nmovie as whole was boring and uneventful. The story didn't impart any\nprofound life lessons or anything else that could be gained from my\ninvestment of three hours in front of a television. I kept waiting for\nsome big climax in the story to take place to redeem the whole thing\nbut it never happened. I'm not real sure why this movie has such high\nratings. Makes me wonder about the views who think this was actually a\ngood piece of work. Seriously, save your time and watch something else.\nThis movie was boring at best...\n"
"\nAfter reading the reviews here I had really high expectations of this\nmovie. But to be honest I was a bit disappointed.<br><br>First of all it is a great concept, filming 12 years so you can see\neveryone change. But that was the only thing I liked about the movie. I\nmean the acting is good, but I just found the movie very boring. There\nis no real story, just ''life'' in a movie. I hoped for a story that\nwould move me, but that never happened in the 2 and a half hours I was\nwatching. I wouldn't say don't watch this movie, but I won't tell my\nfriends about how good it was. Just another movie in my eyes, nothing\nspecial. Except for the part you get to see everyone in the movie age,\nthat was special.\n"
"\nThis was the most boring movie I have watched for some time. I even\nregistered with IMDb just to say \"I want my 3 hrs back\". I can\nappreciate the time it took to make, and the places it was shot but\nthat's it, nothing happens. Honestly after the first 15 Min's I was\nsaying, something will happen soon. After 2.5 hrs I was just watching\nout of spite to see if something would happen at the end. NO, nothing..\nI think that the main actor lacks substance too, it was as if he almost\nwanted to be there but not quite. I was waiting for him to loose his\ntemper and do something, anything. But again nothing, he just kept\nplodding along and mumbling away. I personally think that during the 12\nyears someone lost the script.\n"
"\nWhile I watched the movie I kept thinking that something was going to\nhappen.<br><br>That there was more to this movie than to watch a screwed up woman live\na screwed up life and drag her children through it.<br><br>Then finally near the end of the movie Patricia Arquette, the mother,\nsummed up the whole movie experience for me in a nutshell. In one line:<br><br>\"I just thought there would be more ...\"<br><br>I did not hate the movie. It wasn't as if I wanted the director to give\nme back 165 minutes (yes, that long of a movie) of my life. But ... It\njust wasn't THAT interesting of a movie.<br><br>The concept of the movie was novel, that of making a movie over 12\nyears time, but that was the entire creative aspect of the movie.\nNothing else was all that interesting.\n"
"\nThis movie was very boring, pointless and an unfortunate waste of my\ntime. I hate to say this, but the drunk stepfather was probably the\nmost exciting part of this whole movie disaster. It made no sense and\nthere were WAY too many loose ends! If I could give this movie a 0 then\nI would because I feel that 1 is way too generous. I feel like that 8.3\nrating should be on a scale of 100. The premise of a 12 year project\nunfolding before your eyes just sounds absolutely mind blowing. I'm\nvery disappointed that there wasn't more done with this movie. It had\nso much more potential to be more than it was, but it just never took\noff. I would not recommend this movie to my worst enemy.\n"
"\nThis movie is not even close of what I was expecting it to be. Nothing\nreally happens in the whole movie. I mean come on is this even real\nlife ? Everything was so quiet and simple. No interesting plot no\ninteresting characters. 9 years for a complete failure on my opinion.\nThe idea was great and it could have been a hell of a story but it was\njust a waste of time. It isn't even a drama, nothing dramatic happens\nat all. I don't know what people saw in it and rated it with almost 9\nstars. It surely does not worth to watch it at the cinema. If you want\nto watch something the time before bed its perfect cause all it can\nmake you is to become sleepy.\n"
"\nThe most stupid film I've ever seen. Surely the day i'll be sick i know\ni'll regret the precious hours i've spent watching this movie, so now i\nfeel i've the duty to advise other IMDb people not to lose their life\nthis way - Michelangelo created the Sistine chapel in 4 years, and then\n12 years to assemble this thing!? could have written a better\nscreenplay and chosen better settings in 12 years of work! The\ncharacters are hateful(aside from the Hispanic plumber), especially the\nyoung protagonist, one of those guys that feel special, an\nunappreciated snowflake, even if it's just a moronic adolescent.There\nis not a single dialog, not a single scene that make your neurons bump,\nit's just a tedious and endless movie in which nothing happens.\n"
"\nI was looking forward to seeing this film, but the points I would give\nit is nothing out of 10. Everything about it is remarkable in its\nawfulness. Writing, acting, absolutely unconvincing, and you knew what\nthey were going to say before they said it. I hope that is NOT the\nAmerican way of life, because it's unreal. The word they use throughout\nthe film is 'awesome' and whenever even the tiniest thing like batting\na baseball ended up with the high five. I would have been better off\nweeding the gardens and growing swede, it would have given me a great\ndeal more pleasure. It is a film I wouldn't say is a turkey, but a\nmassive pork pie, with plenty of jelly, even that sounds quite nice. I\nam always thoughtful about films, I love films, and the film that\nleaves the memory lingering is Jet Boy, a remarkable Canadian film, I\nwould give that 8.5/10. If anybody wants to waste their time in\ntotality, get this film for £10, remember, you have been warned. I put\nthe film straight in the fire.\n"
"\nJust rented this from iTunes today and watched it awhile ago. When\nEthan Hawke asks \"what's the point?\" near the end of the movie I yelled\n\"EXACTLY !\" I think it was a neat idea of a movie but so darn boring I\njust wanted it to end. There was some good acting, but I could not\nrelate to any of these people. I think the photography of the movie was\ngood. I felt like I wasted 3 hours of my life I'll never get back. I\nknow the critics have loved this movie but I think it's just because\nthe director had such a novel idea to film the same actors over a 12\nyear period. I'm trying to come up with something more positive to add\nbut just can't. My advice is go see an interesting movie because this\none is not.\n"
"\nBefore watching this movie, I wasn't sure if the plot would interest me\nsince the movie seemed to be just about an ordinary kid's life and the\nonly interesting thing about the movie seemed to be the fact that it\nwas made over 12 years and followed the actual aging process of the\nactors. After seeing the movie, I realized that I was completely wrong.\nBoyhood is more an experience than just some other conventional movie.\nSeeing the protagonist and his family growing up and changing\nconstantly during the movie makes the viewer think about family life in\nall its aspects and when, at the end, Mason leaves his home, dem feels\nkick in... The fact that the movie itself was written over 12 years\nalso brings something special to the movie.\n"
"\nI get that The fact it was filmed over a 12 year period. That Is very\nunique. The realism was great. The acting was very very good. But\nnothing interesting happens. <br><br>It's a home movie about a dysfunctional family. The reason no one takes\nhome movies about their domestic abuse and divorces is because no one\nwants to see that, unless there is an interesting story about it. Other\nthan that, nothing else happens in this movie. <br><br>The characters aren't even particularly likable or unlikable. You never\nreally get to know them because you see them at different times in\ntheir life for a very short period of time. It was like looking through\na family photo album of someone you don't know for three hours. No\ndepth into the story or the characters. I love subtlety in a movie, but\nthis was just boring. <br><br>I thought I would love this movie but, it's much ado about ABSOLUTELY\nNOTHING.\n"
"\nSeriously, the only thing epic about this film was its length. It\nliterally dragged on and on. There was nothing groundbreaking about the\ntechnology or story, Patrica Arquette and Ethan Hawke gave very good\nperformances but then again they're very good actors. There is nothing\nnew here, I was shocked as I invested hour after hour of my life\nwatching something that never really went anywhere, just telling a\nstory of the life of pretty much every other person living in America\nin the 21st century. Do not get me wrong, I am not one of the\nanti-boyhood critics and I certainly didn't think the film was boring,\nI just I expected more after reading rave review after rave review.\n"
"\nWhat can be said? The reviewers who love this movie are entitled to\ntheir opinion, of course. But don't trust them. This movie is god\nawful. Only because of the critical reviews and my girlfriend wanting\nto see it, plus the rent one get one free coupon from Hastings, did it\never come into my DVD player. And if ever a premonition of a terrible\nmovie came true it was with this tripe. Where to start.<br><br>There is no plot. But this is just life you say. Yeah. And if I don't\nwant to be entertained for the evening I will not rent a movie. I will\njust stare at myself in the mirror and otherwise watch another day go\nby.<br><br>But they followed this kid around for thirteen years or some such B.S.\nas that. Did they? Who casted his parents? Who scripted his lines. What\na hoax.<br><br>This movie is so bad that when I returned it to the video store this\nevening and demanded my money back the staff, in unison, asked, did you\nwatch \"Boyhood\"? We are so sorry.<br><br>This movie is so bad that it inspired my first ever review on this\nsite. Wow, I could go on.\n"
"\nMost people who love movies know by now that Richard Linklater is a\nunique and special filmmaker. He has crafted at least a couple of\nmasterpieces already. This film is one of Linklater's best yet, and\nthat's saying something. Hollywood usually doesn't dare to make films\nthis genuine, this introspective, this meaningful. The film is\nbeautiful, it's not just Hollywood slop entertainment, this film is art\namongst the rubbish. Boyhood truly is a landmark film, one that will\nnot soon be forgotten. Forget the 2014 Guardians of the Galaxy hype,\nleave that to the kids and the lazy minded, this is the film to see! <br><br>8.5/10\n"
"\nI understand the critics who value this film; it's 12 year scope is\ninnovative, and I appreciate the intense reality of an average boy's\njourney through a fairly unremarkable life. Yet, that, for me, is the\nproblem. My enjoyment of movies derives from their creative and\nimaginative storytelling. I'm engaged by a good tale, using form to\nencapsulate the plot-driven action. In addition, the characters need to\nbe either extraordinary in an ordinary world, or ordinary in\nextraordinary circumstances--or both. In \"Boyhood,\" everything and\neveryone is just excruciatingly ordinary, and there is no particular\nstory, except insofar as we follow a normal young man through his\nnormal life. I know some people are captivated by such filmmaking, but\nI'm not; I felt bored and distracted. \"Boyhood\" didn't generate enough\ninterest in the characters or their lives for me to care. Quite\nfrankly, my life has been much more interesting, so sitting through\nsomeone else's plodding memories left me unimpressed.\n"
"\nThis has to be one of the most tedious films I have ever watched, which\nI think may have been the point. The idea is good, following the same\ncharacters/actors over 12 years. Also the acting, of Patricia Arquette\nand Ethan Hawke, is extraordinary in their portrayal of ordinary\npeople, and the reason I rate this with 2 stars (one each).But that's\nall I can see that's good in this film. The son, Mason, is\noversensitive and lazy. The daughter, Amanda, is sulky and selfish,\nalthough her character is underdeveloped. The biggest issue I have with\nthis film is, NOTHING HAPPENS. AT ALL. Alright so a lot of the life is\nabout the mundane and the boring but I cannot imagine anything more\ndull than watching someone else's everyday life. Like Big Brother\nfollowing the same people for 12 years. Boyhood needed something of\ninterest to happen to reward the audience who invested over 2 and a\nhalf hours, and some money, in watching it. The best films are ones\nthat have an effect on the viewer afterwards. The only effect this had\nin me was to bore me. It was am opportunity missed.\n"
"\nWhilst I admire the technical achievement of editing what must have\nbeen a mound of material from over more than a decade into a reasonably\ncoherent story, this film is the cinematic equivalent of a television\nsoap opera. In a series of episodic scenes we see Mason Junior and his\nsister growing up fairly gently through the usual challenges of\nchildhood, his mother go through a series of bad choices for partners\nand Mason's father change from being a flighty ne'er-do-well into a\nresponsible family man, albeit not with Mason's mother.<br><br>It's all very pleasantly done, even the supposedly tense and\nconfrontational moments, and it's beautifully shot, but I was fidgeting\nin my seat from an early point and the film never really held my\nattention.<br><br>The unusual background to this film is remarkable. However, the film\nitself is not.\n"
"\nI have seen birdemic, birdemic 2, the room, sharknado, and etcetera,\nbut none of them come remotely close to this terrible film. The\naforementioned are at least comical in their terribleness. Boyhood is\nneither funny, nor inspiring (or anything positive for that matter).\nHalfway through the film I felt myself wishing that Ellar Coltrane had\ndied in a tragic car accident or something of the sort just to prevent\nthis film from ever being produced. The concept for the film is\nsplendid and one of a kind. Unfortunately, nothing else was remotely\ninteresting. Please save yourself 3 hours and do something else. Eat\nsome dirt, lick a bee, smack your arm with a sledgehammer repeatedly\nfor 2 and a half hours to give yourself half an hour to spare.\nanything, and i mean ANYTHING is better than this film.\n"
"\nI went to see this because of the high reviews here (and everywhere\nelse). I was disappointed because while the acting was very good, there\nwas no suspense. <br><br>There was not a plot in the conventional sense. There was no crisis for\nthe protagonist to overcome. You just watched as some people that were\nvery real (you saw the good and bad in them) as they went about their\nlives. <br><br>It was just so slow and long. Obviously, many people like this movie.\nJust beware that while the unconventionality of having the same actors\nplaying their characters over several years is groundbreaking, the plot\nis very slow and does not have the normal conflict and resolution that\nyou see in a movie. While the characters do grow or age physically,\nthey do not seem to grow emotionally and come out at the end of the\nmovie with some great insight from having been through the events in\nthe movie.\n"
"\nMy friend said this was filmed from 2002-2013. I was so intrigued and\nso excited to watch this.<br><br>After watching the film I was left super disappointed. Like super\ndisappointed. Like seriously super disappointed. It was kind of boring.\nI mean it was boring. So boring I find myself repeating the words and\nwanting to fill this whole review with the words boring and\ndisappointed. <br><br>When the movie ended I felt lost. I did not understand my purpose in\nlife (like seriously) &amp; why I sat for 2 hours and 45 minutes watching\nthis film.<br><br>I don't know... this could have been a great film. It is really\noverrated.\n"
"\nNow, this film isn't really about anything. The film doesn't have a\nstory, it is rather just a \"Documentary style\" type of Mockumentary.<br><br>I don't like the film, because it is labeled as something super special\nand extraordinary, but why? The acting was bad,some were not even\nactors, and could hardly play them self. The story is some what\nunrealistic in terms of the way they tried to portray it, The all Drunk\nmales and children going against their own batted single mother. The\nChildren growing up in the condition that the film depicts, stay closer\nand show more respect for their single parent. The rest of the film\nfeels like just random moments from a person memory bank. And the\nreason why this \"Documentary\" works so well as a film is because our\nsociety has this new fashion of wanting to know how other people live\ntheir life's.\n"
"\nAs many have said, it is the un-eventual life of a person, much like\nThe Truman Show which made fun on the reality TV, this basically wants\nto be The Truman Show. Obviously this doesn't really work because you\nsee his 12 years in the 3 hours, if they made a TV show about the main\ncharacter it would have most likely never lasted 12 years, but then\nagain people watch all kind of reality TV.<br><br>For me it did nothing and I stopped watching after the first 20 or so\nminutes and just skipped through until the end.<br><br>People called it LIFE, great but I rather watch The Goldbergs for that\nat least it is funny and funny enough being a child of the 80's I can\nrelate to it.\n"
"\nI got little out of this movie. All characters, at least the adults,\nwere narcissistic and selfish, which I realize is all too typical of\nAmericans these days, but still, who wants to watch a movie about them?\nMovies are for escape, not for watching what you can see around you\nevery day. I didn't like anyone in the movie and I felt sorry for the\npoor kids who had to grow up in a badly broken family (broken multiple\ntimes). I'm sure this happens all the time, but why would I want to\nwatch a movie about it? Depressing. I kinda wanted to slit my wrists\nafter it was over. I surely wanted the three hours of my life back that\nI spent watching it.\n"
"\nWhat was \"Seinfeld\" about? NOTHING but it was so cleverly written and\ncasted, it was classic. What was \"BOYHOOD\" about? Nothing and it was so\nstupidly written, so boring, so annoying...it was close to three hours\nof complete visual and acoustical torture. It's actually up for Oscars?\nThe fix is in, folks. All it's about is a time sequence study of the\nsame people for more than a decade. As they age, the movie gets lousier\nuntil one's bladder tells you the large container of soda is having a\ngreater effect on you than is the picture hence the rest room becomes a\npart of an escape from the garbage being shown to a lot of suckers like\nme. No kidding, all this picture is worth is an extended visit to the\nthrone room.\n"
"\nThe fact that this awful travesty of cinematography is so highly rated\njust lowered my opinion of humanity. It's downright boring and about as\noriginal as a Rocky Sequel or a Disney princess cartoon. Watching the\ncharacters in this film grow through adolescence was painful and I\nterminated the movie with extreme prejudice after a little over an\nhour. Thanks Richard Linklater for showing us what 95% of American boys\nexperienced either directly or indirectly while growing up in the 90's.\nYou managed to create a movie that made my formative years seem boring,\ntedious, and frighteningly more deserving of an Oprah episode than the\nESPN 2 stuntman series I was hoping for. I fell asleep no less than\nfive time during this flick and that's a very conservative number.\n"
"\nI guess I just cannot relate to this kid. There were only a few\nmoments, that touched me. All the rest was boring. After watching this\nmovie I don't have any feelings - no desire to be better, to get the\nbest of life, no gloomy thoughts on life. So for me the movie seemed\npointless. Although I can see how for many people it would be their\nreal life. I guess just not my case. So if you want to see a quick\nrecap of a boring and tough life of a kid growing up, then you should\nsee that movie. But there's not even ups and downs of his life - it\njust kinda flows it's ways and that's it. And the ending... well I\nguess it leaves you a way to decide for yourself what the ending will\nbe\n"
"\nI would say that I appreciated the effort in filming a movie over the\ncourse of 12 years, but it actually didn't seem like much effort was\ntaken to create a seamless movie. Sometimes the kids hardly change in\nappearance and the movie just jumps to another storyline without ever\nresolving the conflict from the last scene and you're left wondering\nwhat the heck just happened. Other times the kids have obviously had a\ngrowth spurt and you're stunned because they just shot up 6 inches from\none scene to the next - again, with no real resolution from the last\nstoryline. Often times people talk about story arcs, well this movie\nhas 12 beginnings to arcs with no real climax or resolution - with the\npossible exception of minor storyline involving a worker at a\nrestaurant. In summary, this movie is comprised of 12 loosely coupled\nscenes being passed around as a movie. You have more continuity\nwatching 12 episodes of Seinfeld than you do with this movie. I really\nwanted to like the movie because I want more films that try to be\ndifferent - but this just wasn't my cup of tea.\n"
"\n3/4 Boyhood: A realistic story of the simple and subtle tragedies and\njoys of childhood and young adulthood without any perspectives on such\nthings. Cinematographically frank and unfortunately disparate, the\ntale's sporadic thematic grasp did not quite live up to the scope of\nits production and ended up being more of a nostalgic tribute to the\nlast fifteen years than an actually cohesive, gripping story or\ncommentary on them. This film had the balancing act of being relatable\nand deep emotional storytelling and frequently shot at spots that\nmissed both marks. But above all, the innovative style of literally\nwatching the characters grow up gives this film not only visual but\nhistorical significance. The juvenile point of this film is summed up\npoorly in the awkward, choppy delivery of two teenagers the audience\ncares little about.\n"
"\nI bought into it. Heard all the noise surrounding the film and how\nremarkable it was to have filmed it over 12 years. To be honest, I\nfound even that, not too remarkable. If you want to watch a story of\nsome folks that absolutely have nothing to offer and no meaningful\ncontribution to make, then go ahead and watch this film. It was\nridiculously long and tedious. I should have quit watching after the\nfirst 30 minutes but I suppose I was holding on for dear life to see if\nanything at all might happen to make this movie worth while. It turned\nout to be an absolute snore and there isn't a thing at all memorable\nabout it other than it being a huge waste of my time.<br><br>I will NEVER be able to comprehend how this movie has such a high\nrating nor the fact that it was up for so many awards. You guys need to\nget over the artsy-fartsy concept and take a look at the story - it is\nabsolute crap.\n"
"\nThe most boring movie I've ever seen. The concept of using the same\nactors over 12 years is a clever one. But the fictional story that goes\nalong with it is utterly boring. On a relative basis it makes my own\nactual life seem like a dramatic epic adventure.<br><br>I almost feel like I have to give a spoiler alert before saying nothing\nat all interesting happens in this movie. This is a fictional story and\nyet shows the life of a boy and family that is more or less the same as\nthe actual boring life of millions of families. Thanks to fast\nforwarding I made it to the end, but I wish I didn't. My time could\nhave been better used watching paint dry.<br><br>How this movie has an 8.2 rating (at the time of this review) is beyond\nme. If you watch it anyway, consider yourself warned. And keep the fast\nforward button on the remote ready for use.\n"
"\nNo spoiler needs to be flagged here. It was spoiled from the start.<br><br>165 minutes of nothing. <br><br>A waste of film and 13 years. <br><br>I haven't watched a movie boring in years. At best, Patricia Arquette\nwas almost ray light. However the movie was so bad I even got tired of\nseeing her.<br><br>If I had rented this movie at Redbox for $1, it wouldn't have been\nworth it.<br><br>Cartoons have more depth.<br><br>I'm not sure how this movie is up for any award unless maybe a Golden\nRaspberry. Since it took 13 years you could give the Golden Raspberry\nfor lifetime achievement.\n"
"\nI usually love slow burning character driven movies where the plot\nmoves at a pace that dictates character development and depth.<br><br>Then I realised that there was still over 1 HOUR to go.AND NOTHING HAD\nHAPPENED.......and NOTHING looks like it will happen.<br><br>And I don't care what happens. JUST MAKE IT STOP.<br><br>So I did......I stopped watching. Now I am relieved.<br><br>Because MOMENTS AGO.......I turned into Peter Finch and began raving.<br><br>I'm mad as Hell and I'm not going to take this anymore.<br><br>I'm mad as Hell and I'm not going to take this anymore.<br><br>I'm mad as Hell and I'm not going to take this anymore.<br><br>What is the point of this dribble mascaraing as a movie.<br><br>I DON'T care what happens to the BOY, the MOM, the SISTER or that DAD.<br><br>I am not wasting one more precious second on this meaningless reality\nfantasy pretending to be interesting or clever or arty.<br><br>I HATED THIS !!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n"
"\nBoring boring boring boring... I wish I could fill up this review with\njust that one word, but IMDb won't let me.<br><br>How can anyone sit through 2 3/4 hours of watching someone's boring\nlife roll by? What a waste of film - or is it all video tape now? I\ndon't care how long a film took to make, how the actors aged over the\ncourse of the film or anything else.<br><br>I want a film to tell a story and this is more like watching someone's\nboring life as they grow up. So what? Who wants to watch that? What is\nit with all these people who think that is marvelous. They really must\nhave incredibly boring lives to think that this film is even the\nremotest bit interesting.<br><br>This film is almost as bad as Birdman which I watched completely\nthinking that at some point something interesting must happen. But it\ndidn't. Just some arty-farty long camera shots. Whoop-dee-doo.<br><br>And this one was filmed over 12 years? Whoop-dee-doo.\n"
"\nSorry I wasn't impressed. The only thing that was interesting about\nthis film was his aging knowing it was real. The story line was slow,\nlabored and boring. At times to attempted to be political.. making\nreferences to various liked and disliked politicians (mostly in a\nderogatory form). I judge movies on how they make you think or feel.\nThe good ones linger and leave you reliving the story or imagining it\ndifferently. This movie only made me think about how much time I just\nwasted! I found nothing redeeming or valuable in the jumping around.\nWhen it was at the end all I could think is great now I can get on with\nthe rest of my day.\n"
"\nCertainly as a 12-year project it's an interesting concept. The plot\nis, however, intrinsically dull with no compelling characters or\nworthwhile story threads.<br><br>Such a high IMDb rating for this film makes me realize that the type of\npeople who post on here are trite, self-important dullards who can be\neasily duped by anything they are told is \"artistic\". There is bad art\njust like there is bad pop. This is very bad art.<br><br>The comments I heard from other movie goers leaving the theater echoed\nmy sentiment.<br><br>Bring water so you don't get dehydrated. You'll feel like you've given\nbirth by the time you get out.\n"
"\nThe 12 years life-journey shooting is a good concept just dropped into\na very disappointing movie. I pretty much agree with everything thats\nbeing said here: no plot, and therefore no dramatic tensions nor\ndynamics. I understand it's suppose to be real life, but honestly most\nof our lives have much more twists or fun at the age of 18. The\nperformance of this Coltrane kid is so apathetic and inexpressive that\nmakes it impossible to relate with the main character. He even\nphysically resembles to Hayden Christiansen and his acting skills are\nequally non existent. Editing is bad as well, with characters and\nsituations coming out of nowhere and disapearing all of a sudden\nnonsensly just like that (did I mention no plot? oh, yes). Just four\nstars, mainly for the idea (terribly executed) and for Arquette's\neffort, which is rather good, but not Oscar winning material anyway.\n"
"\nCan't warm up to this movie. Yes, the idea is compelling, but watching\nkids grow up real time also happens in the Harry Potter series, so\nwhat's the big deal. My problem with this movie is, what's the story\napart from watching a boy grow up in a lower-middle class US family,\nwhich in it self is not a very appealing topic, at least when you're\nnot American. Being European my childhood was so decidedly different\nthat the appeal of watching this boy grow up is very low, because there\nis no dwelling in own memories while watching. Though I can see the\nappeal for US viewers.<br><br>Apart from that the acting is not really top notch, especially the\nteens seem insecure and self-aware in front of the camera. Ethan Hawk\nis great though as a dad who first has to grow up himself. <br><br>So sorry for every fan of this movie, but I think at 8.1 it is highly\noverrated.\n"
"\nDisappointing. What's all the fuss about? The film is boring,\ninconsequential and way overlong. It's supposed to be a drama right?\nIt's not a documentary so why does it feel like one? <br><br>For goodness sake Linklater, at least write some drama or comedy or\ntragedy or something. The film just feels like real life. And how\nexciting is that! <br><br>There are no 'moments' in this film at all. Mason is just not very\ninteresting. What he does is not very interesting. Nothing happens to\nhim. So it was filmed over 12 years. Whoop De Doo! Where's the\ncatharsis?<br><br>I liked the soundtrack though.\n"
"\nHaving heard about a ground breaking film that took 12 years to film\nusing the same cast I expected this to be the best film in years. What\na disappointment!<br><br>This film is 12 years of real life squeezed into 3 long hours. There is\nno major hook, we just follow Mason as he grows from a young boy to a\nmonotone, uninteresting teen. <br><br>Although people can relate to this normal boy growing up, it's not\nenough to justify the poor storyline. Yes, we are watching people grow\nup on screen but it lacks any sense of adventure, drama or emotion. We\nhave watched Kim Kardashian grow up on screen for the last 10 years\nwith much more excitement and drama.\n"
"\nThe effort should be applauded but the plodding, too realistic, slice\nof a life over time, is boring and filled with unnecessary political\ncommentary.<br><br>I liked the way the scene with the girl on the bicycle unfolded as the\ndialogue and the kids came down the street. It was similar to the\nconversation Mason and his father had walking through the forest. Kind\nof meaningless to the plot but much like a real conversation can be.<br><br>The movie was long with too few revelations and a great deal of pure\nlife experiences that though refreshing were extremely mundane.<br><br>The part where the ex-military guy said that his unit survived without\na death while others perished was because of the \"mutual respect\" they\nhad, as if it were the fault of the soldiers that were doing something\ndisrespectful which caused them to die, not that they were caught up in\na war and in a situation beyond their ability to control.<br><br>Unique undertaking...boring, politically slanted result.\n"
"\nI'm writing this at the two thirds mark of a very long film, mainly out\nof sheer boredom. <br><br>The film starts well enough but the acting of the lead boy deteriorates\nas he ages and the character becomes more and more dull. Watching hours\nof some mumbling kid does not make for good entertainment. <br><br>Patricia Arquette is good in the earlier scenes when she has some drama\nto get her teeth into but basically does nothing much for most of the\nremainder of the film. Ethan Hawke puts in a good turn as the caring\nbut mainly absent father. <br><br>Overall a bit of a disappointment after all of the acclaim.\n"
"\nOK, this is one unique movie - making it trough 12 real years with same\nteam - and that is why people will say how great it is. But, really, it\nis not! It has nothing but that \"12 years making\" fact. Almost three\nhours about a super-boring \"retardish\" boy growing ...sooo boring. I\ncan watch almost everything and I did... but this is too much. Imagine\neveryone of us, making a movie in episodes trough 12 years. Just\ncutting clips and putting them in one 3-hours movie. Separate parents,\na bit of drinking problems, first school loves,... and all so\nshallow... just showing more-less normal kidos life! Any award(s) this\nmovie will get is only because 12-years-making of it. But it is so\nboring that it doesn't deserve any!!! Big disappointment! Really,\nwatching a tide for three hours is more exciting than this movie. I\ngave 2 stars - one for original idea of making it and one for my\nfavorites, Ethan Hawke and Patricia Arquette.\n"
"\nSuch a boring movie, like watching paint dry... If i remove the gimmick\nthat was used all that remains is a boring snooze fest, the story was\nnothing extraordinary to offer, just follows a life, and a not very\ninteresting one i add. The actors are very good, but that does not a\ngood movie make. I feel like i've been conned. I knew i should like it,\neverybody else does, but i couldn't. I know my review does not have\nmuch content, but neither does the movie, so there's not much i can do\nthere. Stay clear, and let's hope movies stop creating gimmicks when\nthere is no creative power behind the projects. If they used 5 or 6\ndifferent kids, this movie had a 5 IMDb rating and would never be\nconsidered for awards. I guess people like to be conned. Not me. Stay\nway.\n"
"\nI watched boy hood the other day and all I can say is that to me its\nthe most overrated film I have seen yet. a 3 hour film with barely a\nstory line, no thank you! All I can say is that the only reason critics\ngave this a whopping 100 review is that the critics were too in love\nwith the fact that the production filmed this film for 12 years using\nthe same people. yes the idea of seeing a person grow up from a child\nto a young adult in 3 hours is a good idea but I would like to see some\nwhat of a story line. In my opinion the life of the child's mother was\nfar more enjoyable and exciting than the boy that the actual film was\nbased on. sorry but I'm giving it a 4/10, and thats being generous.\n"
"\nI was excited too see a movie that was filmed over a span of 12 years,\nas that was a pretty interesting concept. Watching the actors age\nbefore your eyes was a nice novelty. But is what this movie mainly is,\na novelty. Hopefully this will be the end of the genre.<br><br>This movie could be edited down to 2 hours without losing anything\nsince there is so little to the movie anyway. The kid goes through\nissues just like you and me. Would you want to see 30 minutes of your\nlife in 4th grade? Me neither. So we get 5 more of these vignettes, at\nvarious times during the kids life. His acting was nothing to write\nhome about either. At least the 2 biological parents did a good job of\nacting, but the rest of the cast seemed to be going through the paces.<br><br>If you have 3 hours to blow by, like a long plane ride, go for it.\nOtherwise your time could be spent much more productively watching\nsomething else, like maybe reruns of \"Breaking Bad\".\n"
"\nWow, how stupid are human beings that think by filming for 12 years\nequates to a masterpiece. Poor script, diabolical acting by the Brother\nand Sister, I don't have a problem with a film not having a plot if\nit's well written and well acted, this had neither. If filming for a\nprolonged period of time deserves award recognition then surely Michael\nWinterbottoms Everyday should have won more awards than Platoon and the\nGodfather put together, maybe people should watch that rather than this\ntripe. I will be extremely surprised if the Brother and Sister were\neven seen as extras in Hollyoaks in the future. I enjoy watching the\nOscars, last years films were rightfully nominated, Dallas Buyers Club\nand the Wolf of Wall Street deserved the acclaim they received. Boyhood\ndeserves nothing apart from compensation being paid to everybody that\nlost the three hours of their lives sitting through the dour boring\nnonsense. Please diet Patricia, you used to be hot.<br><br>\"two jobs back it was a four man job\"\n"
"\nI can't think what the hype's all about. Sure it's neat that the\n5-yr-old is the same actor as the 18-yr-old. But that's been done by\nMichael Apted and his was a documentary and completely enthralling.\nThere was something of the \"documentary\" to this over-long movie. The\nacting by the principals looked at times like it was ad-libbed - is\nthat supposed to be good? Ellar Coltrane managed to hold his own\nthroughout the film, demonstrating the typical feelings one would\nexpect from a boy at a given age. But even still his performance was\nfrequently stilted. '<br><br>Ethan Hawke was one of the few believable characters. Patricia Arquette\nwas Patricia Arquette as directed by Woody Allen, to my mind! And I'm\nnot a fan of Allen....<br><br>Perhaps if you're a growing boy, or a man who's gone through the\nprocess from boyhood to manhood, this would be an intriguing film.\nPersonally I thought it was tedious and I was appalled when I saw I\nstill had an hour and half to go at the half-way mark! \"Ho hum\" comes\nto mind when I think of this film. It really felt like a waste of three\nhours.\n"
"\nThis picture should be excluded from any Oscar consideration simply due\nto the almost unwatchable opening 10 minutes. We considered leaving in\nshock. Kids and parents shrieking at each other from some bad 1980s\nDisney comedy, and utterly predictable reliance throughout on hip music\nto make up for how little emotional impact is being relayed on screen.<br><br>A scene of boys camping out in an unfinished house is unintentionally\nlaughable in dialog and acting, throwing believability out the window.\nSome of Arquette's lines as well fall astoundingly flat - were there\nany editors here?<br><br>The lead is fantastic, and to see him change over the 12 years is a\ntreat, a reason to note this experiment in film. But stories worth\nretelling require more continuity, forethought, PACING, and some sort\nof arc that it seems Linklater didn't bother with (or couldn't due to\nthe limitations of the experiment?). The longest feeling movie I have\nsat through in years...\n"
"\nI love Linklater's movies, but this one was one long boring drivel\nabout a brooding boy who sleepwalks through life and mumbles some\nphilosophical musings while you almost nod off to sleep. There isn't a\nplot or a storyline or even a script. Nothing really happens in the\nentire 3 hours. Save for the \"wow\" factor that this movie was indeed\nshot over a period of 12 years and you can see the main character\nactually age on screen, there is nothing in this movie that deserves an\nOscar nomination. It is just a pretentious self- indulgent film with\nsome nice soundtrack thrown in. I love Patricia Arquette though. She's\ngood in it and you can see that she didn't get paid much to do her\nrole. You can see the pain in her eyes for having gotten suckered into\nthis project for 12 long years for no money. I hope she wins an Oscar.\n"
"\nIt was OK but there really wasn't a storyline. I mean I understand that\nit is about him growing up but it just seemed like it kept going and it\nreally never ended. The ending was pretty bad also. What happens after\nthat? What happens with his sister or mother or anyone?? Maybe they\nturn out fine maybe not no one will ever know. Not only that but it\nseems like it wasn't really the most intriguing movie ever. I was kinda\ninto it at the beginning but as it went on it kinda just dragged and\nslowed down. Then to top it all off it seems like the scenes never\nreally finish without going into them 20 years later. Of course that is\nan exaggeration but I never know whether it is the same problem as\nbefore or a new one until the scene is almost over. Maybe this is just\nnot my type of movie but I have seen plenty and go into them open\nminded. I never just pick one genre. Maybe they could have elaborated\non some problems more. Like what happened to the step kids? They\nprobably should have added a little more to some parts and left out\nothers.\n"
"\nThis movie is fairly entertaining and well acted all the way through,\nbut its novelty wears thin pretty quickly. I have a feeling that the\ncritics who lavish praise on it now will have forgotten it in ten\nyears, sort of like Crash. Remember that one, the critics' darling a\ndecade ago, the 2004 Best Picture Oscar winner? Me neither.<br><br>Boyhood has gotten a lot of attention for the novel way it was filmed,\nbut that alone isn't enough to make it an eternal classic. It's really\nnothing but a fictional documentary about one kid's growing up.<br><br>It's too long (almost three hours) and very repetitive, sort of like\nwatching the kid experience the same experiences over and over at\nvarious different ages - Mom marries a jerk, kid plays the latest video\ngame, Dad comes and goes, Mom marries another jerk, kid plays the\nLATEST video game, Dad comes and goes, etc, etc. Etc.<br><br>It's worth watching once, maybe, just so you can say you saw it.\nOtherwise it's a home movie for the actors to show their grandchildren\nthat we have to pay to watch.\n"
"\nThe novelty of watching the characters age over the years, especially\nthe children, was the only redeeming quality of this movie. And there\nare enough Youtube videos of children aging to make even this that\ninteresting. <br><br>The story itself was boring. Quite boring. I was constantly waiting for\nsomething \"big\" to happen and then watch how it affected the characters\nover the years, but nothing really ever happened. Some may argue that\nthe film and plot are more subtle and what happened in the boys life\n(mom moves and remarries 2-3 times) made him the somewhat cynical,\nintrovert that he became, but 165 minutes isn't worth dedicating to see\nthis.\n"
"\nBefore seeing \"Boyhood\", I'd seen a number of Richard Linklater's\nmovies, each of which I've liked. I already had high expectations for\nLinklater's newest effort, and it didn't disappoint. Filmed over 12\nyears, it shows the trials and tribulations of a boy as he ages. But no\nmatter what happens to him - including his mom's marriage to an abusive\ndrunk - he finds a way to keep going. \"Boyhood\" could be a look at any\nperson's childhood, since we've all had unpleasant experiences in our\nlives.<br><br>I would say that the most impressive cast members are Patricia Arquette\nas the mom trying to settle down, and Linklater regular Ethan Hawke as\nthe dad who likes having children as long as he doesn't have to be\nresponsible for them. I would say that they both deserve Oscars for\ntheir performances. But the overall point is that \"Boyhood\" is one of\nthe year's best. I recommend it to everyone. As for Ellar Coltrane, I\nhope to see him in more movies, and I have very high expectations for\nRichard Linklater's next movie.\n"
"\nI know this film is gaining wide acclaim this year and it is the front\nrunner for best picture, but I don't understand all the love. The\ncharacters were annoying and rarely did anything interesting. The film\nseemed to have no driving conflict at all and I felt like I was\nwatching a whole lot of nothing. The movie was not only boring but it\nwas way too long!<br><br>I understand that it is AMAZING that the film was made over 12 years.\nYes I get that but the amazing concept, I feel, was unfortunately\nexecuted on an incredibly unworthy story.<br><br>Patricia Arquette and Ethan Hawke are gaining attention this award\nseason but I really don't know why! I thought Ethan was fine but not\ngreat and Patricia's performance is laughable bad!<br><br>This is just my opinion and yes, it is a very unpopular one. I just\ndon't understand the love. I really wanted to like it, too. 3/10\n"
"\nI watched the movie with my 13y old boy who usually is into action\nmovies. During the movie I could see from his body language how much\nthe film appealed to him. His feedback was 'This is a very good film.\nIf it would have been any shorter something would have been missing.'. <br><br>I agree with him - the movie was great. It shows real people in real\nlife - it shows humanity. It reminded me in a way of the movie\n'Heimat', a well made trilogy about German history between 1919 and\n2000. Again, very personal and full of humanity. I can understand that\nthis might not be entertaining to all people but it certainly was to\nus. Enjoyed it and I hope it can get an Oscar.\n"
"\nI'm giving this movie 3 stars out of 10, and each of those stars is\nstrictly because the movie spans 12 real years. Besides that cool fact,\n\"Boyhood\" is incredibly lame. Actually, it's pretty much boring. And\nit's so long... it drags on and on. My husband says it was like\nwatching a non-humorous \"Seinfeld\" episode- --the movie was really\nabout nothing. So maybe if you like that kind of thing then you'll\nenjoy it, but I like some \"umph\" in my movies, you know? So kudos for\nthe awesome 12 year journey, but I wish they would have done something\ninteresting with the story. So much potential, but it didn't deliver. I\nhonestly don't see how it could be so huge and well- liked beyond the\n12-year production fact. <br><br>So much potential wasted.\n"
"\nObviously as others have stated too, this is as close to someone\ngrowing up as has been depicted on film. The director took risk, by\nmaking this a work in progress over 12 years for many reasons. You have\nto make schedule that is fitting for the actors to come back from time\nto time and while everyone was obviously committed (and fortunately\ntalented, which is sometimes tough to foresee in young actors), there\nis also something no one can control: Death! There are digital\nsolutions nowadays of course, but that wouldn't really fit the budget.<br><br>But it never came to that, though the film can be as depressing at\ntimes (or overall depending on your view). It's not always sunshine and\nyou don't get easy solutions for every problem that occurs. Having the\nmovie span 12 years is a task that is being accomplished well enough,\nbut you can't show everything. Even with almost 3 hours running time\nthere is always something that has to be left out. If this is your cup\nof tea or not, is something only you know best ...\n"
"\nI'm giving this movie a 3 out of 10 simply because the idea of filming\nthe protagonist over a 12 year-period is quite interesting. But,\nunfortunately, the great and innovative idea had an incredibly poor\nexecution.<br><br>First of all, you will not feel connected to any of the characters\n(perhaps with the biological dad, he did a good job, but that's it), in\nfact, you'll want a huge boulder to fall in each one of them. The\nprotagonist, at his teen years, is simply dull and boring. The mom\nkeeps repeating the same mistakes over and over again, which gets\nreally repetitive at a point.<br><br>I watched this movie due to the hype and over-the-sky reviews it got. I\nwas really disappointed when it ended. This movie had the potential to\nbe a classic. <br><br>Please do yourself a favor and DO NOT watch this movie, you will not\nmiss out on anything, trust me.\n"
"\nGreat idea. Poorly executed. Screenplay dominated by factual biography.\nMinimal external, contextual references. Few glimpses on internal\nstruggles, doubts, nuances of choice. No cinematography. This could\nhave been a good reality show. Belongs there. No reason for 2.4 hours.\nThere is no substance outside the historical sequence of events. Ver\nsimilar transitions to Slacker and Waking Life: main character posses a\npervasive equidistant, phlegmatic stance. Hard to digest some of the\nclichés when describing political preferences, social classes. Some\nmoments of embarrassment also when characters seem replicas of\ntabloids.\n"
"\nthe most disappointing film ever. terrible. not original, whatsoever.\nIt's just sad. so sad., so overrated...... \"doesn't contain a coherent\nplot so much as a chronological sequence of loosely connected\nvignettes. There's no thread tying it all together, no central conflict\nanimating the characters.\"\n"
"\nListen, I'm a film buff, and I've seen some movies that I think are\nutterly flawless while others would think them dull. Films like There\nWill Be Blood, 2001, Drive, and No Country For Old Men are some of my\nfavorite films of ALL time. I love movies that are bleak and/or slow\nburn when they go somewhere or use silence to build tension. So when I\nsay a film is boring, I like to think you can trust me. Nothing\nhappened in this movie. It will not change anyone's life, it will teach\nyou nothing. If you're set on seeing it then all I can say is be\nprepared for 3 hours of plot-less nothingness, cheesy life lessons, and\npretentious inane dialogue that will make you want to inflict physical\nviolence on someone. <br><br>I do have to give Linklater some credit for the film's experimental\nstyle, but that praise only goes so far. Honestly I'd give this one a 6\nor very generous 7 out of ten as it is not a terrible movie, but I'm\ngiving it a one here because this movie is almost as overrated as The\nDark Knight.\n"
"\nPeople talking that took 12 years to make People walking that took 12\nyears to make People running that took 12 years to make People laughing\nthat took 12 years to make People crying that took 12 years to make\nThere's no interesting stuff to be said about this film at all. It\nliterally has NO other reason to exist. It just follows the regular,\nboring life of a regular jack-off kid as he grows up into a regular\nnerd teen. Nothing special or dramatic happens it's just a regular\nboring kid's childhood. The movie is given so much love and praise\nbecause it took 12 years to make. How impressive that they were able to\nkeep calling back the same actors over 12 years!﻿ OH! In-case you don't\nknow, Boyhood is a movie that took 12 years to make. It's also a boring\npiece of turd.\n"
"\nI did rent this on BR and watched it over several days so I realize\nthat is not the ideal viewing experience. Still, I was looking forward\nto this and was disappointed. I have seen previously two of the\n\"Before...\" series by the director and found them to be charming. But\nwhat works in a constrained time frame did not work for me in this\ncoming of age story. The story is routine and meandering like much of\nlife, but I prefer a more artful rendering. The 12 years of filming\nsounds so audacious but is actually just a stunt. So I was not engaged\nwith the characters or the plot. I normally check out the \"features\" on\na BR but skipped them for this film.\n"
"\nI don't want to disrespect the amount of time and work that went into\nthis movie, but there is really nothing there.It touches every point so\nsuperficially that you have a 165 minutes of cliché about boyhood,\naccompanied by bad (adult) acting. <br><br>There is no conflict, no story. Dialogues were corny, especially for\nanyone born in the 90's, who're in the same age group with these kids.\nEverything in this movie has been said/done in other films till it's\nworn out. It's not a documentary, not a fiction, hard to understand the\npoint of it all. <br><br>The only interesting thing about this movie was seeing the actors\nage/grow up.\n"
"\nOne of the worst movies I have ever seen. Bad acting, terrible script,\nno plot, too long. Cheesy after-school special scenes with cliché, one-\ndimensional characters. The lovable loser dad. The single mom who has\nto pull herself up by the bootstraps. The a-hole abusive 2nd husband.\nWhat a joke. And don't get me started about the kid. I don't give a\nrat's ass about the boring brat. Negative stars .................\n................ ................... ..............\n..................... ........................ ...............\n........... ......... ..... ............. .......... ...............\n.......\n"
"\nOne of the most boring movies I have ever watched. I mean, what's the\npoint of this.It made me angry that I wasted nearly 3 hours on this\ncrap. According to me, Its rating on IMDb should be between 5 to 6. It\nseems to be a trend that well-formed characters are lauded as excellent\nmovies, when in reality it takes more than characters to make a story\nthat works.Boyhood spans 12 years and has vivid characters, yet it's\nhard to nail down what the movie is about. What is the conflict? What\nis the issue that must be resolved? Lack of conflict is no minor thing.\nIt gives framework to a film and the viewer something for which to\ncheer. I never felt I had an outcome for which to cheer.I was not\ndeeply moved. My heart was not touched. My Suggestion DON'T WATCH THIS\nMOVIE. Thanks\n"
"\nI have no clue what I have just watched, this has to be the most\npointless and forgettable movies of the year . Yes I get what the\nselling point of the movie is, it was a coming of age movie that\nfollowed a boy into adolescence over the span of 8 years. Yes this is\nnovel and a producers deserve praise on this front. But there was\nliterally no storyline.Don't be worried about spoilers either because\nthere are bloody none. If this is the storyline's we make movies of\nthese days, then i might as well just film myself over the span of a\nday going to work, star bucks and then returning home. But who the hell\nwould want to watch such an uncompelling boring movie?. Well apparently\nthe hipsters who gave this an undeserving 8/10.\n"
"\nBy far this has to be the worst movie I have ever seen. Maybe because I\nhad seen some of this boy's boring life in myself, I don't know. I got\nthe movie because of all the academy buzz and am thoroughly\ndisappointed. The movie meandered all through out this boys life, which\nwould normally be a good thing, but never pulled me in. There is a\npoint near the end where I looked at the cover of the movie and it said\n\"Drama\" on it and I hoped the kid would drive off in the ditch or\nsomething. But really an uninteresting kid, with typical kid attitudes,\ndoing kid things. <br><br>I thought the acting was good by the parents and even the older sister.\n"
"\nThe movie is beautifully shot and to see this boy grow old in front of\nus is incredible yet what is an amazing starting point for a movie\nproject falls short as there's simply no plot to the movie other than\nthis. The story of this boy is extremely conventional, despite the will\nof the director to bring some drama to it via the complicated\nrelationship between the parents. So in the end it feels like a attempt\nto appeal on everyones nostalgia, showing memories most of us, white,\nmiddle-class people, share and objects from the past we all cared for\nlike a gameboy, etc... I actually couldn't go through the whole movie\nas I was bored to death and quickly understood that the prowess of\nseeing this boy grow old on camera was the only interesting fact of the\nmovie.\n"
"\nI started wondering when this movie would finally end. I lived in Texas\nand Houston for awhile and did not know the family lifestyle they\nfocused on. Mostly dysfunctional liberals who cannot seem to keep\nrelationships, or their lives together. The stereotypical leftist view\nof the aged Christian , Republican family of Jesus, guns and pie.<br><br>It was Arquettes worst performance as an actress.A women ,mother,wife\nwho leaned on men to enable her and totally detached from any\nrelationship with her children.She finds men who are caught up in\npseudo macho lifestyles. They are abusive, arrogant and self absorbed.<br><br>Director Richard Linklater gave the impression this movie took years to\nfinish.He took us from movie that did not mention modern electronic\nsand film developing to Facebook and smart phones. The lead actor who\nplays mason, Mason is a whiny kid who I would like to send to Alaska to\na van to experience his call of the wild.I should have titled this \"\nArt not! link \"Later for this\"<br><br>Meanwhile the boring script keeps going and going !\n"
"\n2:45mins I'll never get back. Don't bother starts off a bit slow then\nslows to a crawl for the rest of it. Then at the end having waited for\nsomething to happen it didn't. IMDb say you have to write 10 lines for\na review sorry but this not possible as the film is just not exciting\nenough. Don't really know What else to say Except if you value Your own\ntime Then give This one A miss It ma seem a little harsh but that's my\nview . The concept of the film being done over the actors and actresses\nlives is very good but sorry the concept is sadly better than the film.\nSorry to witter on but I have to fill the review box with more dribble\nas I have not yet got to the correct amount of lines. Looks like I have\nnow.\n"
"\nI tried to watch all the films nominated for the 2015 Oscar awards best\npicture. If I'm not mistaken this film was the 1st exit of all , not\ncaught my attention and did not look up to know the nomination. This\nwas the last of the 8 I looked and I really do not like it one little\nbit. It do not generate me anything, is a film that spends waiting to\nhappen something central and resounding and yet nothing happens. Jumps\nin time although they are not marked are almost always immediately\nrecognizable. Moreover the center love swings experienced by the mother\nthat the child passage teenager. I'm always a little influenced by the\nscores see on IMDb and I think that's the reason why not abandoned by\nhalf. However, they are not all bad news. Is to recognize the fact that\nit was filmed over several years (12 if I am not mistaken ) and\nincreasing age of the characters is clearly noted. Sorry if i had some\nEnglish mistakes.\n"
"\ni have seen Richard Linklater's movies before and i have to say i love\nhis work.specially the movies like waking life and before trilogy are\namazing. now when it comes to this movie, i see this movie as an\nattempt to put some kid's ordinary life on the big screen. and i am\nbeing honest, THIS BOY's life is ORDINARY. and why this movie got so\nmany good ratings?its because people found it different as it took them\n12 years because of the same crappy cast(okay the cast is good but\nstoryline is sh!t) and then there are some lowlife cliché philosophical\ntalks and drunk people. i mean if you want philosophical crap then\nwatch waking life,it is far better. i don't understand the intent of\nthis movie. people don't wanna see something they see everyday,this kid\nas he grows up like all other American kids,who wants to see that? well\ndirected? yeah kind of..but still stupid. i am being kind by giving\nthis 5. hope Richard Linklater does better in his next movie.\n"
