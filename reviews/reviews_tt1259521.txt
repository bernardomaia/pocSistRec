"\nI went to the premiere of The Cabin In The Woods last Friday. Not\nhaving read any of the reviews going around prior to watching it I must\nsay it is one of the worst films I have seen in a long time. The thing\nis, am I missing something? I get the fact that it is a parody or an\nanti-horror film or perhaps even a nod (whether positive or negative)\nto horror films generally, but I still don't like it.<br><br>It was predictable from the start (why did that eagle have to hit the\ninvisible boundary to the cabin? It made the later scene with the motor\nbike jump completely redundant). The acting was poor and even though\nthe film may be satirical it is still painful to watch.<br><br>The only thing I do like is perhaps the idea of an ode to all horror\nfilms and horror characters, but if it is a parody than that wouldn't\nmake sense.<br><br>I am just so surprised that this film currently has 7.9 / 10. Am I\nmissing something here???\n"
"\nIs this some kind of a joke? Are there cameras that filming people's\nreactions and laughing at them or what?<br><br>It was AFWUL! It was neither scary nor funny. I hated myself that I\ndidn't leave the theater after the first 15 minutes. <br><br>The only scary and the best scene of the movie was the guy appeared\nsuddenly at the old gas station. The movie is that bad...<br><br>Too bad I can't rate it less than 1.<br><br>Unless you are from the new generation who loves nonsense bloody scenes\nand find them funny and somehow scary; STAY AWAY FROM THIS MOVIE!<br><br>My rating : -10/10\n"
"\nI don't know why people are saying that this film was an abomination\nand advising others not to see it, because it has all if the element\nrequired in a fantastic horror.<br><br>For me it re-ignited the flame in what was a dying genre, being\npoisoned by numerous of extremely bad films. Not only did it make it's\nway into my favorite horrors of all time, but it makes me have faith\nthat people can once again create a true horror. Now there are only\nremakes of horrors, ( Friday the 13th, A Nightmare on Elm Street ....)\nor prequels, ( Prometheus ).<br><br>This movie is full of twists and turns you don't know what way it's\ngoing to go. It's smart, funny, gory and sexy with fantastic acting by\nall the cast. I was on the edge of my seat hungry for more.<br><br>Overall, I rated this movie a 10 because it deserved it. This was one\nof the best films I've seen in a very long time and is one that I'll be\nwatching over and over again.\n"
"\nThe Cabin In The Woods starts off as, what seemed to be a horror comedy\n- the cliché college students (a jock, a blonde girl, a stoner, a nerd\nand a virgin) meet up to spend the weekend in a cabin together. 'Fair\nenough', I thought. But that thought didn't last long. Here is a list\nof things that bugged me about this film:<br><br>1) The acting ranged from bad right down to laughable.<br><br>2) The characters were annoying and 2 dimensional. I could not wait for\nthem to be killed and was actually rooting for the zombie family, which\nhad more of a background story than any of the main characters.<br><br>3) The big red button that releases every monster. WHY WOULD YOU INVENT\nTHIS BUTTON?! In what possible scenario would you need this button?!\nThe mere existence of this button was the best plot twist in the movie.<br><br>4) During the entire time of me watching this movie, I was not sure\nwhether the movie was parodying the horror genre or actually wanted to\nbe taken seriously. Either way it failed.<br><br>A brainless movie with no good storyline whatsoever. I want my money\nback.\n"
"\nGive me a break. This movie was awful. Full of clichés and the most\nridiculous twist that, quite frankly, ruins anything good that happened\nin this train-wreck of a movie in the first place. Is this really what\npasses for good horror today?<br><br>SPOILER TO FOLLOW Are you ready? This is all a high-tech way to\nsacrifice humans for Gods that live underground on an earth that is\nobviously not ours. Once you know the big \"secret\" you really don't\ngive a damn. Of course the victims that live in this alternate earth\ndon't even have a clue that they may be part of the high-tech\nsacrifices that have been going on forever. Put that together with a\nbunch of overused horror and slasher clichés (and some awful comedy\nthat was done far better in truly original movies like \"Scream\") and\nyou have this garbage.\n"
"\nLiterally a waste of time, if the movie has any redeeming qualities it\nwould be the slight humour in the film. It's advertised as having a\ncrazy twist and 'you think you know the story' etc... Basically if\nyou've seen the advert you'll know what's going on.<br><br>They are in a cabin in the woods, their actions are influenced by some\ngovernment people. But everyone got that from the advert when the two\nguys in shirts said \"Target acquired\" right?<br><br>(spoilers) The 'twist' which has nothing to do with the entire movie\nuntil the very end and is shamelessly explained by a new character in\nthe last 5 minutes is that they're doing the whole thing to stop Gods\nfrom destroying the whole world. <br><br>Would never suggest this film to anyone (however it does have slight\nelements of humour). Was embarrassed walking out of the cinema after\nsuggesting it.\n"
"\nOne of the most disgusting movies i've ever seen in my life <br><br>these are the things which are \"not\" present in this movie -horror (no\nit's way off it's even insulting to include this in a horror category)\n-thriller -story -action<br><br>it's a total waste of time , a complete senseless crap <br><br>only little kids can like this movie who have never seen any good\nhorror movie in their entire life and they'll feel happy on blood\nshedding and watching zombies coming out of the ground <br><br>this movie is also a consecutive proof that IMDb rating mechanism is\nvery poor and you can't depend on it, IMDb rated it 7.5 ,it don't even\ndeserve 1/10<br><br>to conclude don't watch it!\n"
"\nThis is the absolute worst movie that I have ever seen in my life. The\nacting and the plot were absolutely awful. The people who gave it an\n8.1 rating out of 10 are completely insane. Don't waste your time and\nmoney on this outrageously stupid and awful movie. The movie is\nbasically about a bunch of stupid teenagers who decide to go on a\ncamping trip to a friends cousins camp when randomly a bunch of zombies\nbegin to attack everyone. The only thing that is truly keeping my\nattention while watching this movie was the fact that Chris Hemsworth\nwas in it. This movie is the most pointless thing I have ever seen in\nmy entire life. Snakes On A Plane was a much better movie than\nthis.SERIOUSLY DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME OR YOUR MONEY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n"
"\nHow did this film get an 8???<br><br>What a stupid film! Absolutely pointless.<br><br>How do I know this film was so bad?? Because a lot of the reviews are\nfrom people who admit 'I don't normally watch horror films' or 'I don't\nlike horror films but this was quite good' HA you think this could be\nlabelled as a horror? <br><br>I just didn't like this film WHATSOEVER! <br><br>Stupid synopsis, stupid idea, stupid, stupid and not to mention STUPID!<br><br>I am angry at myself for watching this :-( <br><br>Only good point - Sigourney MASSIVE bad point = death to Sigourney! <br><br>Do not waste your time people!\n"
"\nThe official trailer for this movie should actually be considered a\nteaser trailer, since it only contains 1/4th of what the movie is\nreally about. The story was really bad, although it was original( i\nmust say.) This movie shouldn't be considered a horror movie but\nactually a comedy.If you are looking for a good laugh this movie is the\none to watch, But if you got the impression this movie in fact was\ngoing to be a horror movie (as many of us thought)expect a huge\ndisappointment; therefore , do not go and pay for this film, it is not\nworth your money. Perhaps if this movie was displayed as the typical\nScary movie series, then this movie would with no doubt receive ten\nstars. Save your self ten bucks, or watch another movie!\n"
"\nOverall this film is not anything to jump about at. The story line\nseems unique and almost engaging when you hear about it, but when you\nwatch it, it becomes a different matter. Joss Whedon has tried to mix\nComedy and Horror in a way that just does not work, although there are\nsome comedic moments, the film is still not quite a 10 out of 10.\nHowever the start was intriguing as you thought of the predictable\nstory, there was a twist. Although this twist was something different,\nputting it at the start of the Film spoilt the sense of anticipation of\nwhat was going to happen, because it was all fairly predictable. As the\nfilm went on the outcome became more and more predictable, until the\nend when there was a twist which was so unrealistic that it made the\nfilm look stupid. In summary,the film was not anything special and in\nfact I wanted it to end as quick as possible, the acting it self wasn't\nthat bad but the story line prevented it from being anything special.\n"
"\nI am writing this review to help those who fall into the trap of seeing\na rating of 7.9 and thinking this film must have some redeeming\nqualities. Believe me it doesn't. It is ridiculous and abysmal. The\nscary thing is the sort of individual that enjoys this film is the same\nindividual that states scream is original. Some may find this deeply\ndisturbing but I would be quite happy to live in a world without films\nsuch as scream, there i said it. There was only one scene that I found\nfunny and it was when Mr athlete decided to ride his bike into a force\nfield of some sort. I began thinking something worth while was going to\nhappen but this moment never came.\n"
"\nI went because wife wanted to see it. Wish i didn't. I'll start with I\ndon't' like horror/slasher movies. Never have. This is your typical\nhorror/slasher movie, right down to who gets killed first. The movie\ndidn't really make any sense other than to watch people die. The\ncharacters were put together fairly sloppily. No reason as to why there\nwere going where they were going, why they took an RV to a cabin. Just\nwhole parts of the movie didn't make sense. The writers refused to\nchange and do something different. It was pretty typical, you know\nwho's gonna get it and no real scary parts some shocking, surprise ya\nscenes. <br><br>There were some funny parts, but the script never got into it, just a\nsimple,who's gonna get it and how. The ending made no sense and didn't\nclose up loose ends. Did the world come to an end? Was this all a\ndream? etc.<br><br>If you want a brainless slasher movie, go see it but if you want to be\nentertained go see Three Stooges.\n"
"\nSince this movie was shot in 2009 but not released until 2012, I can\nonly imagine that the only it was released at all was to capitalize on\nthe success of Thor, starring Chris Hemsworth, and the impending\nrelease of The Avengers. It can't be a coincidence that both movies\nwere directed by Mr. Whedon. Cabin In The Woods is a hodgepodge of\nclichéd imperiled teens stuck in a remote location getting knocked off\none by one and seemingly science fiction elements. The movie tries, and\nfails, to duplicate the successful combination of snark and fright that\nScream pulled off so well, but the script is so poor that near the end\nwhen a slumming Sigourney Weaver makes an appearance, she utters a line\nso ridiculous that it's amazing she could say it with a straight face.\nAs bad as most of the movie is, the ending is worse than anything came\nbefore. Amazingly, this movie has been receiving fairly decent reviews.\n"
"\nIt's a shame I had to even give this film a one.<br><br>There is nothing about this film which is good in any sense. I am angry\nthat I actually paid to watch this.<br><br>The plot doesn't make any sense. I can't go into any detail without\nrevealing spoilers. But basically, if you're looking for a good horror\nto watch...just don't watch this.<br><br>I came into it wanting to just watch a story about people in a cabin in\nthe woods. Which is what you assume that the movie is. But it isn't. It\ntwists and turns, and goes to all sorts of non-sensical places.<br><br>The only reason I kept it on until the end is because it was like\nwatching a car crash...I couldn't look away. I had to see the ending\njust to see how POOR it would be.<br><br>Sorry for the negativity, but honestly, this film deserves it. How it\ngot rated above a 3 is MIND BOGGLING to me.\n"
"\nI've never seen a movie like this before. It is awful not worth a\nminute to watch if there is a point like zero or -10000000 I can give\nthat as a vote. just blood,stupid story no acting no directing at all I\ngave 7usd for this movie but I don't go if it is for free at all I\ndon't understand how it makes this point , IMDb is not worth to relay\non any more I went with two friends of mine and we told each other not\nto tell anyone that we've come to see this movie. It is a secret. I\nhave never go out from cinema before movies end but for this movie I\nneed to get some air. watching the second part was like a torture for\nall of us. there were 7 people in the saloon and all of us had same\nopinion\n"
"\nApart from many other deficiencies in this movie, the overuse of\nunimaginative stereotypes to create fear or intrigue was insulting\nreferences to stupid college kids, red-neck guy quoting scripture,\nreferences to Christianity, punishment and iconography. All it does is\ncreate confusion and it shows no original thought which is not grounded\nin history or today's reality. 90% of the demographics that would watch\nthis movie have no context of history, nor do they care. All they care\nabout is entertainment, which accounts for the high ratings.\nUnfortunately, when the audience sees the same stereotype played out\nover and over again in the same type of movies, it becomes reality. The\nfilmmaker has a larger responsibility to its audience. I hope the\npeople that worked on this movie weren't duped into thinking that they\nwere producing a quality film.<br><br>Don't attempt to be intelligent or ground-breaking when you're clearly\nnot. This is GARBAGE.\n"
"\nA horror comedy rated so high, I had to go check it out. That too I\nchose the precious Friday evening. My wife was pretty excited to see a\ndecent horror flick in the theatre. And then, as every minute passed\nby, I expected for the movie to deliver on what the reviews said. I\nmean I was waiting till the last goddamn minute!! The movie suffers\nfrom a hyperdouchebagomania. It's full of crap. Period.<br><br>I think all the reviewers together pulled a prank on us. Some reality\njackass going out there to send people to watch this p.o.s. <br><br>I guess if you have nothing better to do and you plan to watch this\nmovie, still stay put! It's an insult to movies.\n"
"\nI never usually do stuff like this, but after watching this movie I\nfelt I had to make an account and inform you on it's awfulness. I\ndecided to go and watch this after all of the high-rated reviews on the\nmovie from other users, some saying it would change horror movies for\never etc... I went to this movie expecting to be scared and jumping,\nbut it was probably one of the worst things ever. It was not scary in\none bit, it was more like a child's film. It's so unrealistic and not\nscary at all, not to add to the awful story line and bad acting. I\nfound it had rushed to the plot and when it was near the end I thought\n'when are we getting to the scary stuff', but nothing came. It was a\nsoggy and bad ending I recommend nobody to go and see this.<br><br>GOD KNOWS HOW IT GOT RATED SO HIGHLY\n"
"\nThis movie is the worst movie EVER. Seriously. I never wrote a review\nfor ANY movie in my life, and if I take so much effort to register in\nIMDb and post this review, you can clearly understand how frustrated I\nam after watching this stupid movie. I believe these movie makers have\nfound a way to tweak the system by posting bunch of positive reviews\nand make a really pathetic movie look like an amazing one. If you have\nlot of money to waste, try to throw it in dust bin. I believe there is\nmuch greater good accomplished with your money that way than paying to\nwatch this movie or watch it in any other way. More importantly, you\ndon't support an idiotic movie company to make even more pathetic\nmovies like this.\n"
"\n*Might contain spoilers*<br><br>This movie was awful. I expected a horror film and I got some sort of\ncomedy. I love horror films, but this one was down the drain. This was\nno horror film in any shape or form. At the end of this film, I was\nliterally saying, \"what the actual f*ckery??\" and not in a good way\nwhere your mind is blown like after watching Inception. The only reason\nwhy I gave this movie a higher rating than a 1 is because I give it\ncredit for the sarcastic uses (satire), creativity and it's mockery for\nday to day horror films even though I expected horror. If you're\nexpecting a real hard core scary movie, do not waste your time on this\nfilm. Unless you're fond of surprises, watch it.<br><br>Personally, I thought the unicorn scene was extremely ridiculous. Was I\nsupposed to be afraid? Oh of course, it's a sarcastic \"horror\" film.\n"
"\noh my god..its getting worse and worse.. i thought i might see\nsomething interesting and unexpected here like years ago while i\nwatched \"cube\".. but this is just another cheap teenie trash wannabe\nhorror movie. and the worst of all \"people rate this movie 7.2\" ?!! you\nserious??? whats wrong with you guys? this movie is so stupid you might\nfind it interesting when you're like 15years old, smoked pot for the\nfirst time in your life and sitting at home while your parents are\nout..<br><br>after 30% of the movie its just going dooooooooooown..and after every\nscene i felt like \"you serious??\"..<br><br>really people, better watch the ducktales instead of giving 90mins of\nyour life to this movie..<br><br>\"horrible\"\n"
"\nI've never been so disappointed by a horror movie. Usually you know\nfirst hand what you're getting- cheesy, gory, traumatizing. I thought\nthat because of the reviews of the movie, and of course friends telling\nme to see it, that it would be decent. It's beyond cliché. Everything\nin it has been done. There are thoughtless \"plot twists\". And the\nending is pretty much resolved by deus ex machina. Literally. The\ngraphics are neat but not up to the standards of a true horror film.\nThe suspense is contrived. I suppose if you're 12 and you've never seen\na horror movie before you might enjoy it. But I'm 27 and I have no time\nfor such useless movies.\n"
"\nI've seen some bad horror films in my day, but this piece of $hit takes\nthe cake. It is totally nonsensical, utterly ridiculous, grossly\nexaggerated, completely absurd and a blood fest, no, a blood orgy is\nmore like it. And those are its good points. <br><br>The premise is so tired and worn. As I watched the girl descend into\nthe dark basement alone I knew then it was schlock. What woman in her\nright mind would do that in such a creepy old, dark house in the middle\nof the woods? But alas our brave heroine whom earlier was so grossed\nout by a piece of art that she had to put a blanket over it, now has\ngrown a pair of balls. <br><br>There is no way any review can spoil this movie as it has spoiled\nitself.<br><br>I feel like suing the producers to get the 95 minutes of my life back\nthat I wasted watching this crap.<br><br>And that Signourey Weaver and Bradford Whitley would even lend their\nnames to this made me lose all respect for them as actors. Times must\nreally be hard for them to sink this low.\n"
"\nPlea to film-makers with what looks like oodles of money, contacts and\nresources: <br><br>Please stop making movies like this. Please take a long hard look at\nyourself and the opportunities you have created for yourself and think\nabout telling a story that has come from somewhere inside you, or\nsomeone around you, a story born from a moment of real inspiration and\nnot born from within cinema itself. You know you can do it. I know you\ncan do it. We all want you to do it. We'll support you. We'll come and\nsee it. I promise. And we'll applaud you. You know we will. <br><br>Why?<br><br>Because we love you. <br><br>You know that.<br><br>Don't you?\n"
"\nBeware!!! Don't get fooled by the ratings!!!<br><br>Too bad I cannot rate this movie in negative. I can now say that don't\ntrust all the movies by its rating. I never thought the ratings on IMDb\nwould be so off and this would turn out to be one of the worst movies\nI've seen in my life time. Not scary at all. It's a big waste of time.\nThis movie was so pathetic that I was forced to write a review so that\nanyone who thinks of watching this movie should spare themselves of the\npain and agony and spend their time either sleeping or doing nothing\nwhich is still worth than watching this pathetic movie.<br><br>Beware!!! Don't get fooled by the ratings!!!\n"
"\nOK, here it goes..I was bored one night and my friend suggested my this\nmovie. He highly recommended watching it. He told me it was something\ndifferent than a regular horror/thriller/suspense movie. It was a night\ni will never forget. It began OK, but towards the end it became so\npathetic that i was watching it just for the sake of telling people\nthat i have watched this movie and how awful it is. It sure was\ndifferent but it was not good different. If you haven't watched this\nmovie, then do not i repeat DO NOT watch it. Why? because it sucks.\nUnless you are one of those who enjoy watching things wayyy far from\nwhat makes sense do not watch it. The end was just stupid. I signed up\nfor IMDb just to say that this movie SUCKED!\n"
"\nThis girl named Kymberly recommended this movie to me. I will never\ntake a recommendation from her again. This movie was a heaping pile of\ncat doodoo. The plot twist was atrocious and the women casted had no\nbodies. seriously like a pair of skeletons on screen. The creepy girls\nlooked better. I will say the blonde had nice tits though. I was gonna\ntype blond but kymberly recommended i spell it \"blonde\". To summarize\ndon't watch this hack of a horror movie also don't listen to anyone who\nspells their name with a \"y\" instead of an \"i\". THE END. OK maybe the\nreview isn't over since i need a minimum of 10 lines. So ill also tell\nyou how to make Papa johns garlic sauce. Butter and garlic powder and\nput it in the microwave BAM you got papa sauce.\n"
"\nthis film contains pretty much everyone's fear and portrays them in a\nvery dark comedic way. The plot is about 5 teens who go camping in a\nforest in a cabin. one by one this company used these elevators to\n'deliver' these monsters and beasts to this cabin to kill all of them.\nThe film was very creative in how the monsters were portrayed and how\nreal they looked; and the scene with all the elevators was very\noriginal. However it was pretty much a typical horror film as it was\npredictable in the fact of when the people would die but it was\noriginal with the creativity of how the people died. Overall I did not\nenjoy this film as I found it boring and I would not recommend this\nfilm to anyone.\n"
"\nWorst movie iv seen in a while. It don't know what it wants to be, a\nhorror, or thriller or mystery. So it fails as all of those. It's just\na mashed up movie of mostly stinking manure... It starts out OK and\nthen gradually just gets worse and worse until you wish you are the one\nbeing in the movie being killed... How it has a 7 in grade here in IMDb\nhas to be because of young people that don't know a good movie from\ntheir bowel movement yesterday... Nothing is really explained, it has\nlots of lose ends that never gets tied up and it is very bad. Please\navoid this movie for your own good. Never thought Joss Whedon would\nwrite something so bad...\n"
"\nThis is my first review and the only reason I feel compelled to write\nit is because everybody speaks so high about Cabin in the Woods.<br><br>I was really expecting a horror film and instead I got a comedy, with\ntoo many clichés (that I think were intentional, but too many movies do\nthat nowadays to really accept that as an excuse).<br><br>It start off very promising, by the middle of the film you see good\npotential because the plot is actually a very good idea, but by movies\nend you are thinking why did this turn into Resident Evil, by this I\nmean you are seeing horror scenes that are actually not scary. <br><br>I was really expecting a lot more, guess you have to go see this movie\nnot really expecting anything to actually feel good about it when you\ncome out of the cinema.<br><br>I guess it is entertaining but not for horror fans.\n"
"\nYoung people on a weekend trip at a cottage get sacrificed the titans\nunder the surface of the earth and Sigourney Weaver is lucky that some\npeople are huge Alien fans.<br><br>Seriously, this movie missed the mark so badly, it's annoying. There\nwas zero gore (except for the guy in the elevator scene), the movie\nkept making references to other movies but never kept up with the\npromises in terms of violence or blood. I found it extremely annoying,\nit's like pointing a finger at \"Evil Dead\" and then ...simply not\ndelivering (the hellraiser clone looked like an idiot).<br><br>It was an extremely polished \"satire\" that tried to stay on a serious\nenough level to attract horror movie fans, but really I cannot imagine\nany horror movie fan finding it interesting, it just does not have\nanything to offer. The Evil Dead 2 was cheap but pulled the cynical\nspin off so much better.\n"
"\nThis one is starting with a spoiler, so you're warned twice now.<br><br>OK, so it was obvious from the start, that nobody is getting out (the\nmoment the bird crashed on that force shield). That kind of killed the\nmovie for me, but because i am not feeling well and couldn't sleep, i\ncontinued watching. And i'm sorry, that i didn't turn this off. It was\nvery boring and predictable until the very end. Especially boring the\nfirst 50 minutes.<br><br>The 2 points are for a little bit of fun i had, when they let all the\ncreatures out. Apart from that and several other minor scenes, i didn't\nlike this movie. And i saw someone writing about twists and giving this\nscore of 10, are you serious? Every single \"twist\" you can see before\nit happens. No suspense AT ALL. Too bad Sigourney Weaver took part in\nthis movie.<br><br>To summarize - i couldn't believe this has above 7 score, i hope my\nvote will help to fix it.\n"
"\nIf I could give it 0 stars, I would. Far too silly and exaggerated to\nbe even vaguely scary. It became ridiculous by about 30 minutes in at\nthe latest and lost my interest completely. If you're looking for a\ngood, plausible and truly frightening film, look elsewhere. This is\nmeant to be satirical horror - unfortunately, all that it manages to be\nis a big joke, and a bad one at that. I kept waiting for an explanation\nof what was meant to be scary and what the point of it all was, but\nthis never came. At the end, one is left with more questions than\nanswers, and the most burning question is how to get one's 94 minutes\nback to watch something of better quality.\n"
"\nAll horror film story lines are the same these days; a few teenagers go\nout to a remote holiday cabin with no communication with the outside\nworld and decide that they have to fight whatever it is that's trying\nto kill them all until they die one by one. What made this film worse\nthan all the others is the fact that it concentrated so hard on having\na terrible, cliché story line.<br><br>This film is a disgrace, and it is an insult to all good horror movies\nthat \"The Cabin In The Woods\" was even advertised as a scary film. It\nwasn't even remotely scary, in fact the only time it made me jump was\nwhen the credits started rolling and I jumped out of my seat to be the\nfirst to leave the cinema. <br><br>To summarise, the story line made literally no sense, the acting was\nweak and I'm still laughing at the fact that this film was categorised\nas a \"horror\". Thoroughly disappointed.\n"
"\nI'm a huge fan of horror movies, any movies really, i watch whatever,\nbut this was just terrible. I gave it a 2 only because the beginning\nwas alright, but once the \"zombies\" were coming out of their graves\nfrom underground,I kind of started to worry. But even that would've\nbeen better than what this movie turned out to be. At first i didn't\nreally understand what was going on, but once i knew, i wish i hadn't\nfound out- evil gods? really?! What a letdown!!!!!! No idea how this\ngot so many good reviews. I honestly think \"The Devil Inside\" was\nbetter than this and I was even bored to death through that! I'd rather\nwatch that like 10 more times than watch this again\n"
"\nI am very sorry I really looked forward to see this movie today,\nhowever whatever the director there had in mind is just shocking and\ndoesn't even have to do the slightest with a \"good\" horror movie. The\nsetting basically is like in many horror movies, the one dies behind\nthe other in the survival chain of the characters. There was no special\nideas behind their deaths, just pure slaughter in the darkness. Any old\nschool Nightmare on Elm Streets movie was more inspiring. Even the\nacting wasn't good at all. (until now this movie would get a 4 from me)\nWhat makes it even worse is the end. To have a total chaos with a\nvariety of creatures below the house next to the end of the world\nscenario is just plain uninspiring. To have a ritual to stop the gods\ncoming while having a whole army already killed during this doesn't\nmake sense either. I am very sorry but it was the worst movie I have\nseen 2013. Maybe even the actors cannot do much for this, however\nreally don't want to see more. How can it be rated with 7,1??\n"
"\nI did not see the trailer or did not hear anything about this movie. I\ngave it a chance and was expecting it to be something like The\nStrangers or something like that.<br><br>I was disappointed and surprised as to what the plot was. If you like\nhorror movies, this is NOT what you're looking for. It started off\npretty decent and then only got worse. It turned out to be completely\nweird and out of my style of movies I like. If you like zombies, you\nmay like this one. <br><br>This is honestly lucky enough for me to even give it 2 stars. I\nabsolutely cannot see or believe why this was rated so high.\n"
"\nNot sure if Cabin in the Woods was supposed to be an horror movie or an\ncomedy/satire movie. Yet, it fails both ways. As an movie expert, i\nmust say that, in this film, the only derivation from horror it's the\nword to describe it: horrible. Unless you're a 13 year boy with a lot\nof SWAG and YOLO, this picture won't mean anything to you. In spite of\nhaving an original, different plot from the other horror movies, it\njust \"goes bananas\". And i'm just assuming that this was not supposed\nto be a comedy, because if it was, the word horrible isn't enough. The\nzombies, the unicorns, clowns, wolves... it's more cheesy than the\ncheesecake factory. The good thing about this movie is the runtime. If\nyou don't want to see a movie that will take you 2 hours in front of\nthe screen and make you think or discuss ideas after it, this is the\nmovie for you. Pure lame, cheesy Hollywood entertainment right in your\nface.\n"
"\nHow many reviews have we seen where the reviewer says. \"Are we talking\nabout the same movie?\" Well that's what I'm thinking. First thing my\ndaughter said after the movie was, \"How could anyone pay for this movie\nto be made?\". That's a good question. It's amusing that I couldn't add\na spoiler if I wanted because there's nothing to spoil. Shame that\npeople go by the numerical rating. What an upside down world this is\nwhen a piece of junk like this actually gets a rating similar to movies\nlike Titanic, The Departed, or Lord of the Rings. The only reason I\ngave this above a \"1\" is the scene in which they realize where they\nreally are...and did we really need that thing she did with the wolf?\nWell, I'm going to a good movie tomorrow night to get this bad taste\nout of my mouth.\n"
"\nAfter reading several reviews and very high ratings, I rented this on\ndemand for $4. This was nothing short of a ridiculous teen horror\nflick. I'm still perplexed why some reviewers called it intelligent.\nWere they referring to the almost non-stop absurd attempts at horror,\nor were they referring to the \"intelligent\" dialog from the horrid\nattempts at humor? Whatever the case, they were wrong in all cases.<br><br>My advice is to skip this one unless you enjoy loud silly creatures\nthat are supposed to be scary, or watching less bright people smoke MJ\nexcessively and act like this is actually funny. It's embarrassing just\nto watch. You can't even fast forward through the bad parts because it\nseemed like the bad parts occurred more frequently than every 5\nminutes.\n"
"\nThis review is going to be short. This was one of the worst movies I\nhave watched. The transitions from thriller to cheap comedy were so\nannoying. You start with bloody killings and suddenly you are watching\njokes that are not funny and you are lead to scenes that you don't even\nwatch in home made movies. And then the ending was what gave the final\nstrike though. I understand that this was not going for the same old\nthriller in the woods but where on earth did that come from... Just\nno... Save your time and money for another one. I just don't understand\nwhy there is this high score in IMDb, lots of people are saying that\nits the best movies they have seen. Well sorry but what I watched was a\nreally bad movie that made me think more than 5 times that I wasted my\ntime.\n"
"\nJust returned from a screening of the movie in my town - I wanted to\nsee this movie because I'm a fan of horror movies and in addition i\nusually trust the very good ratings from users of the IMD (especially\nfor a horror movie, and when there<br><br>is a very reliable number of voters) - but in this film ... I can not\nunderstand the rating of 8.0 IMD users - in my opinion this is a movie\nto score maximum 5.0! A big mess with ... OK it had a few scary scenes,\nbut also had a controversial point at the end - the acting was okay and\nthe music was good - another annoying thing (for me) is to confuse\ncomedy with horror in a very long part of a movie - Difficult to tell\neveryone \"go and see this movie 100%,\" unless you don't have something\nbetter to do ...\n"
"\nThis review has so many spoilers I'll get blacklisted no matter how\nmany times I state that. With that being said, this film was awful. It\nwas one of 2 movies I've walked out on and got my money back from.\nSPOILER ALERT!! This film is not a horror film. Its a comedy masked as\na horror film. SPOILER ALERT AGAIN!! The whole plot revolves around Men\nIn Black characters watching and manipulating teens from some computer\nbase far far away from it all. LAST SPOILER ALERT!!! NONE of the goofy\nMIB scenes are in ANY trailer I've seen for this film, making that\nalmost false advertising. Stay away...it is a parody on horror films\nthat is so bad you'll wonder if you walked into the wrong theater.\n"
"\nThis movie had about as much substance as baby geniuses 2. It lacked\noriginality and was a very scripted horror that turned more comedy as\nit was so bad. Spoiler alert: someone gets impaled by a unicorn!! It\nhappens.<br><br>I am thoroughly convinced that the advertising dollars were spent on a\nteam of paid reviewers and rating bumpers. We all suspected it may be\nhappening and this movie proves it. If not I see now how the movie\n\"Idiocracy\" was more a cautionary tale than a comedy. <br><br>Moral of the story: You can definitely tell the quality of a movie by\nit' reviews. Reviews suck? Rush and get your refund before it's too\nlate!!<br><br>I may stop watching most cinema, they aren't even trying anymore!!!\n"
"\nI mean...seriously?Is this supposed to be a movie?It is definitely the\nworst thing i have seen so far!A completely waste of time and\nmoney..During it, i fell asleep twice and i almost thought i was\ndying.The so called ''jokes'' really killed me , they were as terrible\nas the acting and i just didn't get the whole point of this crap.While\ni was desperately searching for the exit of the theater it finally came\nto an end and that was the moment i realized how stupid i had became\nafter watching this ridiculous film. To sum up, i would like to warn\nyou:do NOT see this thing..EVER! p.s:could someone, please, explain to\nme why does it have such a high rating?...because i really don't\nunderstand! 1/10 (as negative rating doesn't appear to the options)\n"
"\nRead a review in the Daily Telegraph saying that this film is up there\nin the same category as the Sixth Sense, Usual Suspects and Memento,\nwhich are all favorites of mine. That made me go see it at the cinema\nand what a disappointment. It's a good film, but totally different\ngenre, and is more like Scream meets Friday the 13th. Must admit that\nit started with promise, but as soon as the zombies appeared, I\nrealized it was going to go downhill from there, and it sure did. There\nis some clever ideas, and it is not something that should be written\nhere as it gives away the premise of the film, but the whole thing was\nunbelievable and, in places, unbelievably bad. The acting is\nacceptable, but not great, and the story ends up being quite\nridiculous. All in all, something worth watching on cable but not\nworthy of the cinema ticket price.\n"
"\nI have no clue as to why people are saying this was a good horror\nmovie. It was crap. It was all round stupid and the story line was bad.\nI love scary movies but this was just out right horrible. Who ever\nwrote this shouldn't write another horror movie ever again, what were\nthey thinking. Incredibly ridiculous and made me bored.<br><br>When people told me it was bad I didn't imaging it like this. I mean\nit's beyond the valley of stupidness. I don't suggest anyone should\nwatch this it's completely a waste of time. I feel like it stole time\nfrom my life that I will never get back and I regret it. I should've\nlistened to my sisters. <br><br>Any ways please listen to my advice and don't watch it. Even if you're\njust curious. Just remember 'curiosity killed the cat'.\n"
"\nCan I give a negative rate? Please? I honestly don't know what the HELL\nis going on with these people giving 9 and 10 rates to this movie\nbecause it is absolutely awful! The storyline is ridiculous and the\ncharacters are so cliché... Fortunately I didn't pay to see this movie,\notherwise I'd be even more chocked! And I honestly don't understand how\nthis \"thing\" is rated almost with 8! How is that possible? If the\nviewers continue rating this as a good movie, we will see it in the TOP\n250 of IMDb. Do you think it is that good? The film could've been\nbetter if the writer/director explored more the concept of the human\nsacrifice and the sources of that religion... but they didn't! I really\nhave no idea why people like this kind of bad cinema. IMDb is losing\nits credibility, clearly.\n"
"\nI've looked at several reviews here and a common theme is that this is\nan original film, it's not. It is essentially a remake of Waxworks, a\nfilm from the 80's with that guy from gremlins in it. <br><br>It's not a terrible film, but nothing worth watching a second time. And\nthe final reason for why everything is happening is just dumb, lazy\nwriting, it would have been a better movie if the core reason for\neverything that was happening was slightly clever.<br><br>You can go see this film, but prepare to be disappointed if you are\nhalfway intelligent. And yes, that is my way of insulting you people\nwho will sing praises for this film just because of the firefly guy.\n"
"\nCabin in the woods was probably the worst movie I have ever seen. I\nfound it very difficult to stay awake. After waking up for the third\ntime I realized the movie wasn't going to get any better. Each time I\nwoke up I was watching a completely different movie. I wasn't impressed\nwith the typical zombie horror film to begin with. I've seen movies\nlike this millions of times with the same outcome. Everyone dies. I\nstarted to wonder how this movies was jammed together when I saw the\ncollege kids drive through a bridge that somehow put them in another\nrealm with a forcefield? That combined with a lot of random\nmonsters,weed as an inluential part of the movie,a swat team,and some\nform of earth god who destroys the world because some girl doesn't die\nmakes the perfect, senseless movie. After watching I felt that someone\nhad put \"Aliens\" \"The Even Stephens Movie\" and \"SAW\" in a blender.\nWorst movie ever.\n"
"\nTwo stars because I did finish it (regrettably). I understood \"the\npoint\" loud and clear, but to regard this film as some kind of\nintricate, genre-straddling masterpiece of cinematic renaissance is\ninsulting on so many levels. The Cabin In The Woods is pure convoluted\njunk. It's as if they couldn't come up with one good solid plot with\nwhich to drive the movie. So they utilize a caterwaul of plots which\nare half-baked and mostly stolen. Worse yet, the subplots that they\nactually came up with on their own reach a level of cheesiness that\nsurpasses all but the guiltiest of cheesy 80's horror. Aside from the\nstory, the script is fundamentally generic and blatantly melodramatic.\nThe special effects look great, but everything else about this film is\na God-awful mess.\n"
"\nWhen I first saw the previews for this I thought that good horror\nmovies were finally being made again! But I stand corrected. This movie\nwas horrible. I went to see this for my birthday and was not impressed.\nThe story plot sounds good while reading it, but when you see it, the\nmovie plain out sucks. It was a waste of money and time. Everything was\nvery cheesy, from the cabin just mysteriously having a underground\nlaboratory to the cheesy zombies. This movie would have been a lot\nbetter if it weren't for the laboratory doctors making it seem so\nridiculous as a \"sacrafice\" for the demons. There was only one good\npart of the whole movie, and that was when they were in the elevator\nlooking at the 4 different monsters. All the rest of the \"nightmare\"\ncreatures were baloney. From a man-mermaid to a unicorn. And when you\nthink it can't get any worse it does. There was way more blood in the\nscene while they were waiting in the lab while the creatures attacked\nthan there was in the whole movie. In other words Don't Waste Your\nTime!\n"
"\nToo much is not enough for this twisted tale of disgusting horror and\ndespair. Are our minds so warped that we find this nonsense\nentertaining? They should pay you to watch this one. Let's see, Ah yes\nthey had to save the director's role for, surprise, Sigourney Weaver.\nAnd it's too bad Bradley Whitford can't find decent roles for his\nacting talent. What really gets my goat is that movie critics, who are\nsupposed to be discriminating, gave this movie high marks. You suckered\nme in. I hope I don't have nightmares over this, but, of course I'm too\nsophisticated for that, aren't I??? Or perhaps we're all too damned\nnaive.\n"
"\nHorror is my favorite genre. I LOVE good horror, even if it's a bad\nB-movie. Let me say that first.<br><br>Rarely do I write one of these, but I felt compelled to give my two\ncents on this turd. The kills are so-so. The suspense is frequently\ninterrupted by the cut-scenes to the wraparound story, but the humor\nwas pretty funny. I had no intention of seeing this movie today\n(Friday, the 13th) as I had already been sucked in to seeing a 3D\nre-release of a classic with my wife. I wish I would have done so. At\nthe last minute, the hype bug bit me and I had to go see this movie. .\n. Mistake.<br><br>The most enjoyment I received from this film was the chaos near the\nend. That was cool seeing everything at once (you'll get what I mean if\nyou see it). Overall, what a turd. Save your $30 and get this out of\none of those red boxes in a few months.<br><br>I gave this 3 stars for it's humor, the use of the token stoner and the\nsomewhat entertaining twist. Other than that, fugedabowdit!\n"
"\nI'll make it short, sweet and to the point.. I gave it a 2 instead of a\n1 because of the boobs. Did everyone who gave this a good review see\nthe same movie as me? This was horrible.<br><br>Why I liked this movie...<br><br>1. Although small, the movie showed boobs for about 1 minute.<br><br>2. Sigourney Weaver was in it all of 5 minutes.<br><br>Why I did not like this movie...<br><br>1. The acting was horrible<br><br>2. I HATE CGI, it was horribly done. One word..SNAKE.<br><br>3. You saw where the movie was going 15 minutes in<br><br>4. Boring as hell with a \"unique\" story line<br><br>5. NOT SCARY AT ALL. \"Make you jump\" scenes don't count, its cheating<br><br>6. Sigourney Weaver was in it all of 5 minutes<br><br>7. The ending was HORRIBLE<br><br>8. The unicorn scene was...yeah the unicorn scene.<br><br>9. No good gun porn. Sub par guns for how many were in it<br><br>10. The button....really? Just one button to do all that?<br><br>It was like a cross between Cabin Fever, 13 ghosts, Hellraiser (but not\nas good), Saw and Truman Show.\n"
"\nIt was terrible. Gory, bloody, and gross. It was very cliché and you\ncould expect when the scary parts were going to happen. It was very\npredictable. There was nothing good about the movie. I hated it. It\nwasn't even scary, it was just downright disgusting. I thought it was\nterrible and I couldn't wait for it to be over. It was cheesy and\nlooked fake. It's an hour and a half of my life I will never get back.\nIt all looked extremely fake and awful that a lot of the time we were\njust laughing. If you like rooms literally filled with fake blood then\nthis is the movie for you. I personally thought it was gross, cheesy,\nand bad. Don't waste your money.\n"
"\n.. I actually had to make an account to review this movie, and I'm\ndanish, so don't mind any spelling mistakes. This movie was so terrible\nit blows my mind, and I was actually told from several others (imdb, my\nwork and my friends) that this movie was awesome and definitely worth\nthe watch. I mean, the front page review is saying that this is the\nbest horror movie in 7 years - what.. the.. f*cking.. hell!?<br><br>Trust me - don't do the same mistake as I did and spend money on this\nthing. It's not funny nor scary, the plot is so awful and that \"twist\"\nthat everyone talks about is overrated as hell. <br><br>I hope that this review will help anyone who's doubting whether or not\nthey should spend their precious time on this. DON'T!\n"
"\nIts was entertaining, but after I watched I was really surprised to\nfind such a high rating on IMDb. Where the hell did Sigourney Weaver\ncome from. You can't just drop in characters like that. I learned that\nin 6th grade English. It bad story telling. And what was with the\nclown, white mask people, and unicorn. That was kind of lame. There\nreally isn't much more to say. It was different, entertaining, but not\nmind blowing or revolutionary. It just makes me wonder where all these\nhigh rating come from. They could be fake. It could just be one of\nthose films that you either love or hate. Personally I think that\nmovies like the Evil Dead series were much better.\n"
"\nSeeing the trailer, you would think this would be an awesome horror\nflick. But think again. I went into the theater excited for the movie.\nEven in the first 5 minutes it's stupid and not exactly about the teens\ngoing to the cabin. It's not exactly what you expect it to be, it's\ntotally different. I admit the movie does have funny parts but it is\nnot scary nor gory. I was sitting in my seat praying for the movie to\nend. I almost walked out but I figured after paying for it, I might as\nwell of stayed there to see the ending.I thought it couldn't get worse\nbut then it did. I was very disappointed in this film. Seriously,One of\nthe worst movies I have seen, please do not waste your money!\n"
"\nI believe all these glowing reviews must be fan boys of joss whedons,\nwho were in a movie theater where they pumped in some drugs to convince\nthem all that it was a great movie. Game changer? Horror at its finest?\nSurprise guest appearance at the end!(bfd)? So randomly stupid, no\nwonder it was made four years ago and never released! I love a good\nintelligent scary movie but this was none of the three, perhaps two\njumps in the entire showing, the rest was tongue in cheek humor that\nmade absolutely no sense if the end game was to appease the elder gods\nwho need sacrifice. Senseless, and vapid. I wish I would have stayed\nhome and watched the NHL playoffs......and I HATE hockey!\n"
"\nI can only think that Drew Goddard (the director) paid desperate teams\nof unemployed people to work long hours through the night - weeks on\nend, without any rest - creating fake profiles on IMDb to rate this\nmovie. Friends of friends of family of anyone involved, cast or crew,\nmust have been promised untold riches and stardom in turn for their 10-\nstar review.<br><br>It's that bad.<br><br>IMDb usually has a rating system you can trust - anything above 7 and\nit's usually worth throwing your money at - but not this one! If it was\nfree I would have walked out. To be honest, I'm still not sure how this\nmovie got backing, because it feels like it was made up during filming.<br><br>I'm not going to go into details because it's not worth that; but\nreally, don't waste your time. The very basic storyline, where a cabin\nin the woods was setup for horror, showed some promise; but then sh*t\njust got weird. The End.\n"
"\nİ watched this film yesterday. First i saw this film in IMDb. Point is\n7. I thought film is good but now i don't understand why people loved\nthis film. Absolutely AWFUL. Film is so unnecessary, scenario is\ndisgrace. In the begening of this film i said '' ouww this film looks\ngood '' but in the end of this film i sweared 100 times. Totally\nwasting time. İf you want to watch horror film, absolutely you don't\nthink this film. Editing is so simple. Every kind of monsters are shown\nfor frighten but this thing is not scary just ridiculous. I am still\nnot understand why people high rated for this film. It is so funny. İn\nmy opinion 3 point enough for this film hmmmm maybe 3 is much.\n"
"\nSo I'm a huge horror buff. From the classics to the deep dirty world of\nforeign snuff I always enjoy a great, fear inducing film as much as the\nnext obscenely curious horror fiend. However, this movie sucked. My\nless horror enthused associates weren't even upset at the fact that I\ncould narrate this movie, without ever having seen it, before anything\ncould occur. It wasn't funny or satirical. It literally shows as a\nhorror attempt gone horribly wrong! The ending is simply ridiculous,\nand not in a funny way, just in a wtf were they thinking kinda way. If\nthe writers/directors wanted to be snarky, they should have done a\nbetter job. They definitely did not get that point across. The movie\ndoesn't really portray itself as a dark/bleak comedy. If they were\nserious with this attempt, then they still failed. Overall, this is a\nshitty movie. Especially for it's time. Go watch Sinister instead.\n"
"\nI do not get the idea why people would make a movie so worthless. Its\nstory is senseless and extremely lame to say the least. Its primary\npurpose is to show gore, gore that is done by non-humans; \"monsters\" if\nyou will. Like your usual mediocre gory horror movies, the cast is all\nenticing with youthful good-looking actors and actresses. In this movie\nthough, the acting was fair enough. The movie writers wanted to make a\nmovie that combines technology with old-fashioned backwoods zombies.\nThey thought it was a brilliant idea. All it did was an utter waste of\nresources. Maybe that's what they wanted after all, since the movie was\nall about that; futility.\n"
"\nWhere to start? OK, I'm a pretty big fan of Horror movies. Anything\nfrom old classics like Psycho, Poltergheist, Amytiville to more recent\nmovies like Saw, Let The Right One In, The Conjuring, etc. What I like\nin horror is the storyline, the acting, the suspense, the scary\nmoments, etc.<br><br>I found this movie a complete joke and I wondered if I was watching\nsome kind of parody of the genre. The storyline is very cheesy and full\nof \"cliches\". The worst is mixing all this with some kind of reality\nshow. Really?<br><br>If you like \"real\" horror flicks, here's my little piece of advise:\nDon't watch it!\n"
"\nWhat a load of crap. No tension at all. No scares. OK maybe that wolf\nthing that came in the elevator. Nothing apart from that. Because, you\nknow, I sat back and expected an old fashioned Evil dead sort of a\nmovie (not the 2nd part). Instead I get some video game like thing.\nReality TV. I guess we are the butt of the joke in this movie. <br><br>I don't have to be concerned about anything. Are the monsters going to\ndo anything? Who are the monsters? Who cares? I was just waiting for\nthis whole crap to end. And then there is a change. But then it becomes\nmore ridiculous. I suspect some CGI stuff. <br><br>Generally I agree with Roger ebert on most movies but I have to\ndisagree with him on this. <br><br>I didn't fall asleep. That's it. <br><br>4/10\n"
"\nFirst off, I have no clue why this movie is so highly regarded. I mean\nI'm still wondering how that got so out of hand so quickly. I'll admit,\nthis movie started off pretty good, had my attention, had an unique\nstory/plot going on, then out of no where I completely lost interest.\nIt had nothing to do with the actors, as I thought they all played\ntheir roles to the best of their abilities, other than one very\nannoying voice. Another thing this movie had going OK was the special\neffects/graphics. The problem is how the movie ended. That seems to be\nvery common now days, especially in the horror genre. Directors/writers\nget going and going and totally wind up off the deep end. I give this\nmovie 4 out of 10-RENT IT\n"
"\nWell after such an extended and unnecessary build up I finally saw this\nfilm. It has come and gone without a whimper and I've watched many far\nsuperior films since. So where to start?? Remember the twist in 'The\nCrying Game?' And thinking hang on where's the twist??, I knew that\ngirls a guy!! Or hearing how you should not read or watch anything to\ndo with this film??? There's good reason for that... This film started\nin a predictable manner, struck something partly interesting along the\nway (by accident??) and finished as a film that has lost plot normally\ndoes. Remember Lost?? So similar. So no huge story, usual antics and\nonly 1 creative scene. The rest is filler, loose ideas and dead ends.\nReally quite a terrible mess of a film, given 5/10 only for people who\nhave lived in a cave and found a video, TV and a chair. See it only to\nsay I've seen it.\n"
"\nJust awful. Neither funny nor scary. Terrible effects, poor acting and\noverall just a terrible and boring film. I use IMDb a lot for films but\nfor horror films it's really been letting me down recently. I\ndon'tunderstand what people see in this film. If you watch it you WILL\nbe wasting 90 mins of your life. I've had more fun sitting on a plane\nnext to an obese person on a 10hr flight than this. This movie is less\ninteresting than watching paint dry and a lot less original. I've seen\nsome terrible and dull and unoriginal films in my time but this just\ncaps the lot. How it got good scores on the movie review sites is\nbeyond me. Makes the Scary Movie franchise amazing! AVOID\n"
"\nI bought this DVD, not to be scared, but for gore. I was very\ndisappointed. The DVD case had 3 different reviews, each giving 5\nstars, so I got my hopes up. Although there was a lot of blood, it\ndidn't feel like there was a lot of gore. Unfortunately it was\nbasically a cross between The Hunger Games, Final destiantion and\nFriday 13th. Don't get me wrong, they're all great films but the\ncombination isn't. It all seemed a bit too cheesy for my liking and\nwhilst the storyline had the potential to be great, it wasn't told in\nthe best way. In my opinion, the best thing about it was Chris\nHemsworth.\n"
"\nTo be upfront the only thing I did not like about this movie is the\nlast 5 minutes. It's got good suspense, action, thrills etc. If the\nmovie would have just been the people taking bets about who survives\nthat'ed been cool. But instead they had to throw in the ancient god\nstuff and that just ruined it for me. I do like how what \"monster\" they\nface is decided by what they pick up first in the basement. Some pros\nare: good storyline (until the end), quite suspenseful, the high guy\nreally is funny, pretty girls. The cons: the only one to me is the\nending. I have not bought this movie since its release nor do I plan\nto. I would watch it again but only if it came on TV (basically if it\ndidn't cost me anything). The movie had a lot of potential but they\njust didn't deliver the ending I was hoping for. I guess in the end its\nall up to personal preference.\n"
"\nReally this is a very boring film. The only reason why I watched it\nthrough to the end was because I was thinking maybe there was going to\nbe some clever twist but in fact there are no surprises. Once the\nsituation of the film is set up within the first 30 mins all the rest\nis fairly predictable.<br><br>The basic idea is actually very uninteresting. So, it satirises a few\ngenres of horror films and does so within a greater plan, but the\nsatire is not very clever. I didn't laugh once in this film and I do\nhave a sense of humour, honest.<br><br>If you have sat through 30 mins of this and you are bored don't make\nthe mistake I did and keep watching in case something interesting\nhappens, it won't.\n"
"\nI've only heard good things about this movie before I watched it. I\nread reviews and assumed only good things but while it came to watching\nthe movie it self it was just horribly directed through out the movie I\nwas very confused as to what the actual movie is about accept a group\nof people going to a cabin in the woods where they would all most\nlikely die.<br><br>As I continued to watch the movie I deeply this disappointed to what it\nbecame I was expecting a movie like non other but instead it was\nterrible I will only give it a point for a different story line\nalthough it was just confusing to me. <br><br>I do not recommend this movie it was a total let down after all the\nglossy trailers.\n"
"\nWhat a waste of time! I suggest people who're planning to watch this\nmovie, Please don't go by the rating it has got. This is such a TRASH\nMOVIE you will always repent for. I found this movie very boring and\namateurish. Maybe small kids will get frightened seeing this but I bet\na grown up will find this movie very laughable. Wonder how come people\nlike Joss Whedon ended up producing this trash. You will get to see a\nlot of zombies and creatures and high amount of gore. But the question\nis what for? There is no strong story. Completely illogic plot.\nUnnecessary special effects. Overall a complete let down. Watch it at\nyour own risk. The movie is really gonna test your patience..Big Time!\n"
"\nNo offense meant, but this is probably the worst movie I 've ever seen\nin my life..may be because I had expectations about this movie after\ngoing through the IMDb reviews....but OMG, this movie turned out to be\nthe most overrated movie on IMDb..sorry guys..it has a craziest\nstoryline you can think off, from the way the movie starts and moves,\nyou would get an impression this will turn out to be just another\nFriday 13th kinda movie, but then the absurdity starts, and you will be\nlike- \"can somebody even ,think like that??\".. there's lot of blood n\nkillings, less thrilling..no comedy no fun.. huh..well, all in all I\ndint like this movie, not even a bit..\n"
"\nThis movie is somewhere between horror and comedy, failing at\nsatisfying either of the two genres(Though there are a few funny\nscenes). The characters die every easily and very quickly. <br><br>*Spoiler Alert* <br><br>As per the plot everything is fixed (the deaths of the characters) so\nit doesn't leave a suspense whether or not if anyone will survive,<br><br># But Yes the Twist is a Good One but soon fails as some of the stuff\nseems Illogical. On terms of Acting everyone does a good job, the movie\nlacks in screenplay and I doubt any part of the movie will scare you. <br><br>P.S I don't know why it has been given a 7.9 Rating. This one is truly\nthe most Overrated movie of the year or maybe the Decade.\n"
"\nQuite frankly, after the lengthy slow beginning and awkward mid\nsection, it got to the point where after the elevator scene,my\ngirlfriend and I had a small discussion and agreed. We walked out. We\ncouldn't take it any longer. I posted that reference on my BBM and I\nhad 2 friends write back and say, \"Didn't you read my status update on\nSaturday?\". An absolute nightmare of a movie. Yes that's right, that\nnight I had nightmares of me throwing away 20$ bills! How it went from\n7.9 to 8.2 in one night is beyond me. I gave it a 3 only because it had\ncomedy tossed in. YUK. Maybe I'm missing the point but honestly, I\nnever walk into a movie with ANY expectations. (That way I'm never\ndisappointed) but this one did my head in. It's excruciating to watch.\nAnd, I'm not talking like a cheap B movie excruciating, I'm talking\nabout we tried so hard but failed to hit the nail on the head\nexcruciating. With all due respect to those who enjoyed the film, I\ngive you all the credit in the world for sitting through that painful\nflick. Should have had a splif before we went in.\n"
"\n7.6 Rating in IMDb prompted me to view this movie on the very first day\nof the screening. The trailer was impressive. So did the beginning of\nthe movie. Once we realize that the characters are being watched by set\nof scientist and customers, you will expect something really\ninteresting. But what you get to see some zombies and blood ever where.\nThe way the climax was shot made be feel that even 10th grade students\nwould film a better movie.<br><br>I personally feel, this movie does not deserve anything more than\n0.5/10.<br><br>If you want to spend 90 minutes of your life without doing anything\nuseful, then watch this movie.\n"
"\nThis is the truth and only but the truth: IMDb and Hollywood last 5\nyears are pure garbage trust me this is the only truth, absolute\nGARBAGE !!! they even paying personnel to write fake reviews for\nabsolute garbage movies ,i don't understand why this is happening but\nits time to start watch my friends Bollywood movies are way better ,\nthis movie is garbage as a thousand movies i have watched last 5 years\nso don't try to find why and where just big names just fake scenarios\nwithout ideas and this industry gets your money out of your pocket and\nselling you trash, Ancient Gods? OH! MY GOD! I feel like retard monkey\nin the cage that world government gives bananas to forget that we are\nslaves working for 300 euros per month , Hollywood you make mind\nexperiments now? after cocla cola ,microscoft and gogle and fbook now\nHollywood? WTF? oh yes i know it started from 40's not just now this\nare real mind trash experiments , better if you don't have strong will\ndon't watch them it produces permanent damage to your Brain!!!!!!!\n"
"\nThere are no words to express how amazing this movie was. What one\nwould assume would be a typical horror cliché is actually treated to\none of the most creative movies I've ever seen. Although most people\ncould expect what the movie contained from the previews, as I did, they\nwill still be blow away by this movie. Not from the acting or directing\nor anything like that, but from the pure originality of the movie. The\nlast horror movie I remember seeing that was this original, inventive,\nand down right badass was Scream, and with a equally satisfying\ndeliverance of it's gritty, gory, grisly, and tongue in cheek attitude.\nAnyone who goes to see this movie will surely get their money's worth\nand then some.\n"
"\nWhen five college friends (Kristen Connolly, Chris Hemsworth, Anna\nHutchison, Fran Kranz, Jesse Williams) arrive at a remote forest cabin\nfor a little vacation, little do they expect the horrors that await\nthem. One by one, the youths fall victim to backwoods zombies, but\nthere is another factor at play. Two scientists (Richard Jenkins,\nBradley Whitford) are manipulating the ghoulish goings-on, but even as\nthe body count rises, there is yet more at work than meets the eye.<br><br>Um......just wow. The acting is kind of cheesy, but those elevators\ndoe. This movie completely did a 180 and shocked me. Even if you think\nyou know what's gonna happen.....you still aren't even close. This\nmovie is so unconventional and I absolutely love it for this.\n"
"\nholy shirt man, i thought i was going to yachts a very good movie\nbecause my friend recommend it to me but then i watched it and......<br><br>....<br><br>shirt.....<br><br>i just Short my bl00dy punts m9. This was sorely the worst mover Evy\nrattan. i shoulder just watched the Titanic instead... much more scary,\nso sink... what a w8ste of my ti'm man.<br><br>Nebr fr-gt<br><br>baby pols, so can u not b man i really find it not like why do you this\nman\n"
"\nThe Cabin in the Woods revolves around two stories, there are the main\ncharacters who go to the cabin and wound up getting attacked by\nmonsters and a group of mysterious business men who seem to be\ncontrolling the whole thing. Overall the movie seemed like it was just\ngoing to be a fun, campy horror movie and in the first act it was. The\nsetup was perfect and it got me really excited for what was going to\ncome but when the monsters show up it was vastly underwhelming but\nthat's not the worst part. The worst part is the third act which is SO\ndifferent from the rest of the movie it gave me a headache. In the last\ntwenty minutes I ended up tapping my foot waiting it to be done so I\ncould continue on with my life. If you're a horror fan then I recommend\nyou stay away from this one.\n"
"\nI came in expecting to see a horror movie, but it turned out pretty\nquickly that that's not what this movie is at all.<br><br>The whole premise of the kids being watched and killed off for\nentertainment was interesting and mildly funny, but somewhere along the\nway, it just turned to a big dump. Imo, it doesn't work as a satire,\nit's not subtle or smart, even though it tries hard to be. As a comedy,\nit doesn't really work either, because it's simply not funny.<br><br>What irks me the most about this movie is the way everything is\nspoon-fed to you. All attempts at satire are practically shoved in your\nface. \"Look at this! So ironic!\" The worst part was the ending, had\nthings gone differently after they broke into the control room, it\nmight've been salvageable.<br><br>Everything was just really half-done and kind of shitty, despite some\ngood ideas. Disappointed.\n"
"\nI am actually angry I wasted my time, my night, my intelligence\nwatching this piece of crap! I knew 15 minutes in it was bad, but I was\nhoping it would get better...nope. I am so upset actually that I made\nan IMDb account just to write this review. <br><br>Acting is terrible, characters are shallow and unlikeable, plot \"twist\"\nis given away early, special effects are a joke! There is literally\nnothing good about this trashy, tacky film. I should also add there is\ngore for sake of gore and nudity for sake of nudity.<br><br>This movie is not funny enough to be satire nor scary enough to be\nhorror. So stupid.<br><br>Please reconsider your existence if you are still interested in\nwatching this.\n"
"\nThis movie is badly written. Good actors wasted there talent being in\nthis awful movie. It is an awful ending. They took stuff from just\nabout every horror story in the world. This movie is not scary. It is\njust stupid. I can believe people like this movie. It is so stupid and\npoint less. You have to be under 10 to get scared of it. If it supposed\nto be funny it is not. If it is supposed to be scary it is not. Do not\nwast your time. Do not wast your money. Do not see this awful movie.\nThis one of the worst horror movies ever made. Do not see it. It is\ncrap. I am running out of lines and I don't know what less to say. This\nmovie is pooh pooh.\n"
"\nThe Cabin in the woods seemed to be over-hyped in the media at the time\nit was in the cinemas and that's usually a bad sign. My instinct was\nright this time. It's impossible to like a film that has such a bad\nscript with hollow unlikeable characters. The plot starts to stink from\nthe very beginning when everything is told straight away. There's\nhardly any surprises for the viewer as all is given away too early.\nEverything goes as expected and it gets quite boring.<br><br>The movie's also very unstylish that i have to question the vision of\nthe creators. What might have crossed their minds or were they just\nmaking a fusion of Evil dead and The truman show and calling that\noriginal. Little bit of this and little bit of that movie here and\nthere just seems to make a film these days.<br><br>This movie put me off watching new movies for awhile. I wonder when i\nsaw a movie just as bad as this. Even the old trashy movies were more\ncompelling.\n"
"\nIf you know what deus ex machina means in storytelling, you'll probably\nknow that it's a bad thing used by lazy writers to get themselves out\nof ridiculous plot holes. <br><br>So, now you know what it means, you'll begin to understand why I've\ntitled this review the way I have. It's play on the horror genre that\nprobably seemed like a really good idea before someone put proverbial\npen to paper.<br><br>From a curious start with, for me a least, a WTF the moment in Act I\nthat I never really recovered from, the movie winds its way badly\nbetween horror, suspense and waves absurdities at us that even Monty\nPython's team would have felt too silly.<br><br>But this is no comedy; no black comedy either. <br><br>It's a film that really doesn't seem to know what it is or why.<br><br>And that deus ex? Well, watch it for yourself and if you can't spot\nthem (there are several) you might actually enjoy this.<br><br>As for me... I'll stick to something more plausible, like, say,\nAirplane.\n"
"\n\"The Cabin in the Woods\" is not clever enough to be satire and not\nscary enough to be a horror film. I think that, to make this a properly\nsatirical movie, it should have been presented as a normal horror movie\nuntil stoner boy discovers the camera. The opening scene with Richard\nJenkins can say there, but all the inter-cutting between the cabin and\nHQ removes what little tension the movie has. The way it's currently\npresented, you know how it's going to end, or at least I did. Now don't\nget me wrong, it's pretty original, but that doesn't mean it's a\nmasterpiece. It's a joke. Richard Jenkins and co. were the only\nworthwhile part of the movie. (Seeing people, whose job is to kill\nothers, make the most of their duties was very reminiscent of \"The\nHunger Games\".) But I will say that at least they tried to have some\nfunny parts. My favorite was the death of Chris Hemsworth, obviously.\nBut yeah, hugely overrated movie.\n"
"\nThis movie was probably the dumbest movie I've ever seen. The\njumpscares were so obvious and does not really classify as a horror\nmovie to me. Everything in this movie was predictable and had\nabsolutely no originality. I was pretty much bored throughout the whole\nentire movie. Nothing actually made sense. Where some characters should\nhave died they didn't and when some of them should be OK they instantly\ndied. It just seemed like they were trying to make fun of another\nmovie. Also the they should have named the movie something else. This\nmovie was a waste of my time and I'm so glad I didn't spend money to\nwatch this in the cinema.\n"
"\ni watched this movie just because of its high rating ...but i got to\nsay, this movie is one of the lamest I've ever seen...does not scare\nyou and if at some point if it does somehow manages to give you chills\nthan its gone by some stupid science fiction crap.. ..too much gore and\nviolence makes it boring to watch....the story fails to provide any\nreal sense of attachment at all..characters tries to hold their ground\nbut there is just not anything in the story . ..it just fails to\nprovide any justice to the genre..if you are a core horror fan then\nthere is nothing for you in this movie..you might wanna skip this\none..its like hunger games on a bad day..!!.too stupid to watch!!!\n"
"\nI don't understand how does it movie have 7/10 rating. And the other\nreviews which i read..how can people like this and give it a 10??<br><br>Story Well i decided to watch this movie by seeing its rating and genre\nHorror, Mystery ,thriller and expected it to be something like\nDisturbia. Instead is nothing good in it no logic involved\nwhatsoever.The story is a mixture of Drag me to hell , I spit on you\ngrave , See no evil , Final Destination and Zombieland and Saw.<br><br>If you have already scene any of these movie you can get an easy idea.\nDifferent aspects for each movies have been combined to make The Cabin\nin the Wood there is no originality and has a lame star cast.<br><br>You can only watch this movie when you keep you brains aside,and just\nwatch it for the sake of entertainment.<br><br>My recommendation Save you time skip this movie too many movies of the\nsame type have been made before and I'm sure you must have seen plenty\nof them, its just that the rating is somehow good which might compel\nyou to see it.\n"
"\nThe special effects and blood were good in this movie. The makeup was\nimpressive and the scenery was great... at the cabin. As for the rest\nof the film...<br><br>Boring and lame delivery of Pop language. If you like people speaking\npop while not showing emotion, you'll like this movie. The better\nactors are wasted as we have to watch them watch a bunch of lame\nmillennials speak whedon. The camera work was decisive, but it didn't\nmatter. The end's cluster 'F' was lame. The message was, humanity\nsucks, let's die.<br><br>To be honest, you can get a better laugh from movies like Dead Alive,\nArmy of Darkness, Shaun of the Dead, The Hills Run Red (that one wasn't\ngood BTW), Bad Taste, and Scream. This movie didn't have the actors to\nmake the film worth watching.\n"
"\nI'll start with the obvious--as anyone can tell from the commercials,\nthere is a cabin in the woods, some teens go there, stuff happens, but\nit seems that there are people controlling what sort of stuff happens.\nAnd that part is good--it is an original twist. But from there, the\nmuch awaited premier was a poorly acted, poorly lit festival of boredom\nand clichés. I hoped that towards the end, something might change, and\nit did--there was an interesting twist for close to 15 seconds before\nit, too, became boring and predictable. Don't waste your time with this\none. And I say this as a big fan of Joss Whedon's other work. But if I\nhad been in the theater with him while watching this, I would have\ntaken my DVD of Firefly and beat him to death with it.\n"
"\nOh, man...this was bad. I'm not even sure why I gave it a 2 - that was\ngenerous! I know horror movies can tend to be lame. But some can be\ngood (the \"Paranormal Activity\" series, The Exorcist, The Rite). But\nthis one was just awful. I saw it only as a slam to the \"corporate\nworld\" - such a typical view from Hollywood. But come on, a bunch of\nguys in white shirts and black ties killing people for - what? - That\nis never really made clear other than a bunch of other \"corporations\"\nworldwide \"compete\" for some unknown prize. While celebrating deaths\netc with \"office pools\", etc. I don't know. Didn't make it to the end\nof this one. All I saw in this movie was the political message and it\nticked me off. I don't want politics either left or right when I watch\na movie. I just want to be entertained. And the only scary part in this\nmovie - I agree with another reviewer - was the creepy guy at the gas\nstation. Pass on this one folks, even if you are an anarchist. It's\nstill bad LOL!\n"
"\nThis movie was a huge disappointment. How could this possibly be rated\na 7.4. Don't get me wrong it's watchable if you don't have nothing\nbetter to do. Me personally, I would prefer washing two days worth of\ndishes than wasting 90mins of my time on this. Why did i even rate it a\n6 I asked myself...... EFFORT......Although an unsuccessful effort.\nThis is the type of movie you naively carry your girlfriend to watch\nand afterwards feel totally embarrassed by your poor choice in movies.\nIn fact, when i first watched this i fell asleep...leaving my\ngirlfriend to bear the horror. I bet she would like to suck my toes\nrather than watch this again. So i awoke to my girlfriend's terrible\nreviews. I Watched it again so that i could give it a fair chance and\ncame to one conclusion. \"Only a complete nincompoop or someone who is\nbeing paid will rate this a 7 or above.\" I felt guilty even rating this\na 6.\n"
"\nThis is the only review I have ever written for IMDb. I will keep it\nshort and simple. I haven't seen the full movie yet but I have seen\nenough and I can state - knowing full well what will happen and having\nseen the ending - that this is perhaps the worst movie I have ever ever\nseen!!!!! <br><br>Do not see this movie - Even for free! It is a waste of time - time you\nwill never get back! <br><br>No likable characters - No redeemable qualities - No good direction,\nscript, cinematography - No Nothing! I am in the dark - Literally - it\nis so dark I can't see anything!<br><br>Take my advice - don't even see this to see what the fuss is about! Or\neven just for giggles! Stay away!\n"
"\nI made the awful mistake that so many before me had done. I rented this\nmovie based on IMDb reviews. This is a different kind of horror film,\nthey said. This movie will make you think, they said. No. Absolutely\nnone of the above. In all, there are several hilarious scenes in this\nmovie simply because of the awful makeup, CGI, or unbelievable nature\nof the plot. There are a few times where you'll loudly remark \"Oh, come\non! There isn't even that much blood in the human body!\" You'll know\nwhat I mean IF you watch this film, and I don't recommend that at all.\nSTAY AWAY! 5/10 simply because the acting was decent, and because of\nSigourney Weaver.\n"
"\nAt first glance this would be the perfect horror movie-5 kids alone in\na cabin in the woods when sinister things start to occur and people\nstart dying. Perfect right? And the movie seems that way, that is until\nright when its about to actually get scary, the movie is interrupted\nwith a cheesy subplot that destroys everything scary about it. If the\nending is ignored this could be an actually great scary movie to watch\nwith your friends, but all of that is thrown away with a downward slide\nof corny, cheesy stupidly planned garbage that fails to horrify anyone.\nThe end of this movie is so frustratingly corny the whole movie is\nthrown away and you find yourself sitting on the couch thinking: Well\nthat was a wast of my time. If you enjoy corny movies featuring the\nmonsters of your childhood nightmares, then this is the movie for you.\n"
"\nThis film is rubbish.<br><br>Horror??? nothing scary in this film at all, even the 15 rating tells\nyou there is nothing to be afraid of<br><br>Original??? nothing original just a big brother style holiday camp with\nmonsters<br><br>what a lot of nonsense the acting and directing was just average<br><br>a group of teenagers go for a holiday camping weekend however it is a\nbig brother style holiday camp where they are being watched and\nsurveyed by a bunch of geek scientists waging bets on who survives.<br><br>the scientists choose the monsters that will get them eg zombies<br><br>in the end the teenagers know what is going on and the scientists get\neaten by the monsters as the teenagers try to escape through the\nscientists lab<br><br>nothing amazing, nothing incredible it is just a normal average movie.<br><br>Why does this movie get amazing reviews??? 10/10 i mean some people\nmust be crazy<br><br>the film was so predictable especially with the dipsy blonde girl you\nknow was going to get killed<br><br>a very cliché horror film and very boring.\n"
"\nI waited over a year to watch this movie, as I had heard about its\nrelease a while back.<br><br>I finally got to see it and was completely disappointed by the whole\nthing! The only Semi Decent part about the whole movie was maybe the\nlast 20 minutes from when they arrive in the lift. The graphics were\nOK, but the whole story was complete shite.<br><br>Its like a deranged version of The Truman Show, but worse. And not a\ngood worse, a really REALLY bad worse.<br><br>Totally gutted about this movie because it had the potential to work,\nand failed.\n"
"\nI haven't left any comment here for a while but I was so irritated by a\nvery high IMDb rate for this movie that I had to leave my own mark.\nFirst of all, the the movie genre is like searching itself through the\nwhole movie. The director wasn't sure is he going to make a horror,\nthriller, SF or comedy so it looks like he is experimenting with the\ngenre through the movie phases never achieving one whole. Then, the\nidea of a horror in a controlled environment is kind of eliminating the\nhorror atmosphere and it is very poorly executed. Also, I found the\nacting of the five pretty pale. Worst thing from my point of view in\nthis movie is that all this is connected into the very boring melting\npot where no real plot and no movie dynamics leads you until the end of\nthe movie which I couldn't wait to come.\n"
