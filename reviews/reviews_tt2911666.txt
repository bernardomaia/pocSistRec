"\nBased on the reviews I read in here, I was expecting much more from\nthis movie. Yes the movie is action packed, but very much over done.\nCertainly not a quality movie by any means, with a weak story line. It\nwas like being in an action game where the lead had unlimited\nlives....he is invincible no matter how many times he is shot! There\nare assumptions that we will understand the rules of the \"committee\",\nbut these are never explained and we are left with very few answers the\nend. In light of the over the top and often excessive violence and\nkillings, I must say Keanu Reeves' performance is the only highlight of\nthe film. Overall however, a very weak story with unnecessary and\nexcessive violence, and a plot that is more suited for a PlayStation\ngame.\n"
"\nI do not know what a lot of you others are drinking before you watched\nthis attempt at a film but I will not be imbibing, that's for sure.\nThere are comments in some of the reviews here that this will be a new\ncult film, that it is the best action film of the year etc etc etc.\nSorry but 'fail' is the only word that comes to mind. The gratuitous\nand total violence is just pathetic and I might say a serious low point\nin American culture. Keanu has returned! From what? He looks like a\nvery sad has been actor forced to not act so that the film maker can\nget his rocks off on this masturbation or a movie. I hope that the\ndirectors and producers of this garbage are duly banned from ever\nmaking another attempt. Seriously people, if you liked this film then\nyou need to seriously look in the mirror. I mean really! If the mirror\ndon't crack then just be thankful. If I had to find just one redeeming\nfactor I would be very hard pressed. OK - I liked the little dog. YUK!\n"
"\nI thought this was one of the worst films of all-time. I only went to\nsee it because it had an 8.3 rating on IMDb. Wow! It is still rated\nover 8.0 as we speak. Holy crapamole Batman! This film was boring,\nlacked ANY character depth, and wasn't amusing or visually interesting.\nI have literally never been so shocked at the poor quality of a movie\nscript or character development.<br><br>Wow. This is the worst film I've seen in many, many years. And I'll\ntell you, it boggles my mind that MOST of you found it enjoyable. Just\nboggles my fracking mind.<br><br>And here is my tenth and final line so that I can post this review,\nwhich most people will dislike but a few random souls will agree with\npassionately.\n"
"\nOne-dimensional story: check. One-dimensional characters: check.\nTerrible dialogue: check. Bad acting: check. Uninspired action scenes:\ncheck.<br><br>I checked IMDb before watching this. People talking about how this is\ngoing to be a new cult classic or the revival of Keanu. WTF are you\npeople on crack or something. It was terrible from start to finish! <br><br>This movie is all about the action and even that feels completely\ngeneric and uninspired. The dialogue is just plain painful to watch. I\nactually felt shame for the people 'acting' on screen. <br><br>The story...... what story? It's virtually non-existent. Every random\nperson you find on the street can write something better than this.<br><br>The only thing going for this movie is Keanu looks cool. Even when his\nacting sucks.\n"
"\nGone are the days when you could trust the internet ratings on\nrotten-tomatoes, IMDb.. hell even Wikipedia entry is so wrong about its\n\"reception and critical acclaim\"..<br><br>This is one of the worst movies ever. It's a shame.. IMDb ratings.\nMovies like these will keep coming out and rigged ratings will keep\nearning them money. Hollywood is losing it.. <br><br>Do yourself a favor, and do not watch this garbage. The positive\nreviews on this website are so clearly made up by the possible\nstakeholders.. Maybe the producers nowadays are hiring marketing teams\nwhose jobs are to make multiple IDs and post as much positive reviews\nand ratings on sites like these to fool the public.. and guess what it\nsells.. some of the positive reviews are so clearly typed by the same\nfingers.. it is a shame.\n"
"\nIf I could give this piece of crap 0 stars I would. This is easily one\nof the worst movies I've ever seen. Even cheesy 80s action movies like\nCobra had better writing. <br><br>So many other reviewers already pointed out so many of the completely\nterrible plot holes, nonsense, and idiocy that I'll just leave most of\nthat out of this review. <br><br>That being said, there's terrible video games with better stories than\nthis movie. You'd be better off staring at a wall while punching\nyourself in the side of the head for 2 hours than watching this piece\nof crap. <br><br>Skip it.\n"
"\nCannot think of anything to redeem this movie. Fight scenes were boring\nwith baddies unable to find their target at 3 feet. An expert as John\nWick was supposed to be was unable to fight off 2 thugs and an idiot in\nhis own house. He could shoot every other baddie but when it came to\nIosef he kept missing. Why didn't he kill Ms Perkins? What was the\nsignificance of the gold coins, or was I too uninterested to catch what\nit was. Also Willem Dafoe was just a pointless addition, could have put\nanyone in that part who just wanted to collect a cheque for little\ncontribution. Again Keanu fails to impress, and this was 100 minutes of\nmy life I will not get back. Do yourself a big favour and give it a\nmiss, really.\n"
"\nthe scale does not have a 0. despite a whole lot of famous actors and\n2nd role ones, lots of killing, lots of killing, and again.<br><br>k Reeves needs money...<br><br>the whole plot is about a guy that got his car stolen and his dog\nkilled. <br><br>he wants revenge for this... <br><br>and he is gonna kill a couple of hundreds of mob people for that. <br><br>charming. waste of time.<br><br>barely watchable nice costume though<br><br>he wants is fxxx dog back...\n"
"\nNo major spoilers. If you like the action genre done well. Watch John\nWick. Vehicles flying around at high speeds, great gun play and kungfoo\nstuff. This is an action movie! Yes a very violent one and done well.<br><br>Its been a few years since we have had a well made action movie for a\nmature audience that could warrant being a new trilogy. Unlike The\nExpendables. This one is it. But if it dose not happen. Its sure to be\na singular cult classic. Especially with its refusal to be a shoot em\nup style of show, but a shoot em in the face style of show. As well\nthat one of the main plot features, put simply, is that Wick is seeking\nout vengeance because of the murder of his puppy. Any way no more info.\nWatch and enjoy.\n"
"\nIt is B level action movie. You can easily remind of other movies like\nthis. Equillibrium, District 13, The transpoter and many other action\nmovies with handsome, heroic guy. <br><br>Keanu fights usually with guns in this movie. But it brings more body\naction into the shooting scenes, so it becomes more stylish. Great to\nwatch it at home, not boring at all, if you don't expect something like\n007 series with Daniel Craig or Born series. Keanu kept his face and\nbody almost perfect, so he is still handsome and fit, good enough for\nthe film like this. But the enemies have less impression. They are fine\nbut not new, bit similar to villains from 90's action movies. I\nrecommend this movie if you are looking for something easy and fun, and\nyou've already watched every other great action movies like Born\nUltimatium or 007 Casino Royal.\n"
"\nThis movie was excellent. There are a lot of new faces in this movie\nwhich would make me feel it's low budget, but the actors have all put\ntheir best in to this film and you can see it.on screen. I have seen so\nmany films that just don't capture the viewers eye, this movie keeps\nthe viewer glued to the screen in till the end. It also ends of a\ncliffhanger which I always find is best. <br><br>Keanu was a great choice for this role, he plays a hit-man with ease,\nbut there is always a little spark which he puts into his acting which\nmakes him stand out from the crowd.<br><br>All in all 9 out of 10. By far better than any other action movie of\nthe past 2 years.\n"
"\nThis is basically a movie about vengeance. Although if someone kills\nyour dog, it does not really justify a body-count of 100s. After the\nfirst 20 minutes, this movie merely offers up set pieces of violence\nand killing set to grungy rock music. The violence reminds me of a FPS\nvideo game, where killing is cool and fun. Indeed, I must confess to\nfast-forwarding briefly during the final fight scene (yawn). A\npredictable and mindless offering. If not for the delightful Ms\nPerkins, then I would have given this movie a zero.<br><br>Don't get me wrong. The production and violence and well executed, on a\ngood budget. If that's what you like, then go for it. But as a Keanu\nReeves fan, I remember great movies like Constantine, The Gift, Matrix.\nAlas, this movie is not great. Just violent mindless drivel set to a\nnoisy soundtrack.\n"
"\nThis is one of those movies that makes you get out of the theater and\nyou want to kick someone. It's full of action, no excessive drama, no\nbackground history asides from the fact that everyone has to be scared\nof John Wick just by pronouncing his name just like \"The Boogieman\". <br><br>Keanu Reeves is perfect for this role, no expressions, no feelings,\njust a couple of lines and shooting a lot of bullets, very precisely by\nthe way, the real acting is on the hands of Willem Dafoe (sort of).\nAlfie Allen is kind of on the same role as the one in Game Of Throne,\nsorry but I have to say it, I watched him and can't stand thinking\nabout how he's useless here too.<br><br>For an action movie I really like this one... and I'm thinking who's\nbetter John Wick or maybe Bryan Mills?\n"
"\nInteresting action movie. What i really liked about it is that lack or\nnormal exaggerations in the movie continuity. John does NOT shoot 100\nbullets from a handgun without reloading, he does NOT fight for 20\nminutes with the bad guy at the end and he does NOT have superhuman\npowers (like flying through windows, dodge bullets or fall from 50\nmeters without repercussions). Yes, it's a bit brutal (90% of the guys\nget shot in the head), but it's exactly what i would expect in real\nlife if a person like Wick would really exist and would go rogue.\nBesides that, some clichés, some cars miraculously exploding (i think\nthe only thing which was really amateurish made in the script) and the\nnormal lack of story in a bang-bang-shoot-don't-look movie. But, at\nleast Wick goes after the bad guys for killing his dog, not the woman\nhe loved (like in most of the others). <br><br>Overall, 9/10 to watch, 4/10 to watch again.\n"
"\nPut your brain on hold and just sit back and relax for an hour and\nforty five minutes while Keanu Reaves finds a multitude of ways to kill\nmany nasty people. The story is silly, but the action is continuous as\nWick is pursued throughout by men and women with bad intentions. He is\na karate expert and is also skilled with a variety of knives and\nfirearms which are quite useful to our hero. His background is sketchy\nand never really explained but one must just suspend belief and just\ntake the ride as if on a roller coaster. Willem Defoe shows up to fill\nout a decent cast with Reaves carrying most of the load, as he is in\nalmost every scene. It looks good and the New York locations are a good\nchoice. A final 7.5/10.\n"
"\nThis movie has some of the best quotes I have heard since a Tarantino\nMovie. A past assassin who tries out a new life, of marriage, and\nbliss. When he looses his wife, and someone kills his only thing given\nto him from his wife before she died, he has to dip his feet back in\nthe pond of chaos, and ends up taking out the whole Russian Gang of New\nJersey to kill the bastard son and everyone infected with the curse of\nbeing related or working for the kids father, who is the Russian Mob\nBoss of New Jersey. Great Acting, Great Actors, and I noticed Keanu is\ndoing a lot of his own stunt work in this movie, and had to do a lot of\nClose Combat Training for this movie, and future movies to come. I seen\nhe stars in Knock Knock a recent Sun Dance movie just released, but\nAkira is the movie I am waiting to see him in. This movie is great, and\nkeeps on you on the edge of your seat. Watch it to find out if he gets\nrevenge for the person who took everything from him after he lost the\nonly thing that mattered in his new good life.\n"
"\nOne of the best action film. It keep you eyes focused on screen the\nwhole time. I was amazed by the sequence and story line Perfect movie\nto watch on holidays and with family.<br><br>The Hotel Rules were amazing <br><br>And the code word use for body disposable service was great<br><br>This movie is really good action in it<br><br>There is a underworld mafia<br><br>Contract killers <br><br>People work for Gold coin instead for case <br><br>Recommended to Friends: YES Action: 8/10 Storyline: 8/10 Acting: 8/10\n"
"\nThis is a worse film I had seen in last years and I just do not get HOW\nit comes here to average from 7+ ??? The story is: Guy kills hundreds\nof people because of one dog. Wonderful.

"\nCannot believe how weak and pathetic this movie was. I was expecting at\nleast a plausible story line and gripping action with Keanu Reeves in\nit. But Reeves acting was SO shallow and unbelievable, as was everyone\nelse's. The plot was barely existent and everything in it was just a\nrepeat of so many other movies. The action was stiff and repetitive,\nand absolutely lacking in reality. The story was unbelievable to the\npoint of being ridiculous, and the concept of Reeves being able to do\neven a small portion of what he was pictured to do, was just absurd.\nCan hardly believe actors of Reeve's caliber could even consent to act\nin this B-grade rubbish. It's like a kid's movie - all impossibility\nand fantasy. Nothing gripped me at all, not for a moment. One of the\nworst movies I've ever seen.\n"
"\nthis movie is an offense on my IQ - it was 100% predictable from the\nbeginning - complete waste of time so disappointed with IMDb for giving\nthis movie 7.5 - WHY? I am expected to write 10 lines of text about the\nmovie that doesn't even deserve one. I could easily say it was one of\nthe worst movies I've watched recently - give you my word! Actually,\nthe reason I decided to open an account in IMDb was to share my\ndispleasure with the actors, the plot and pretty much everything else.\nThere was a countless number of moments when I literally couldn't\nbelieve the producers managed to get away with such unsophisticated B\nclass stereotypical unengaging movie. So my word of advice is: NO! I\nwatched Whiplash only yesterday and it made me feel like changing from\nForm Mustang to Fiat Punto...\n"
"\nAn ex-assassin loses his wife to cancer, her last gift to him is\nprobably the worlds cutest dog. This lasts for maybe a day or two as a\ncouple young punks break into his home, kill his dog and steal his car.\nTurns out the guys who did this too him is the son of his former boss.\nNow you learn throughout the movie that John Wick is known by just\nabout everyone in town. So why this kid didn't know who he was is dumb\nbut its what makes the story take off.<br><br>John Wick is an action film that you need to just sit back, watch and\nenjoy. Don't nitpick at the little things. Such as the dialogue being a\nlittle bit corny, or the many cliché's that occur. This movie has\nfantastic gun fight choreography. In my opinion, its in the top 10 for\ngun fights. I also liked the world they created. The world of contract\nkillers was different from what I had seen in the past.<br><br>The good guy is a likable character and you feel for him. You also\ndespise the bad guys especially the son. Bottom line, its a good time\nand if you like action films, I highly recommend it.\n"
"\nNormally I'm not a fan from the one-man-army against a 300 men.<br><br>And i must say i didn't had much hope this to be good. After the first\n10 minutes i was thinking to turn it off,<br><br>But then it actually took off, and didn't stop with good solid action,\nand some unrealistic but very fun to see shootouts.<br><br>Good action movie. definitely worth your 90 minutes of time.<br><br>I'll give it a 7.8 out of 10 Lets hope America makes more of this kind\nof movies in the future (i need to write 10 lines) I'll give it a 7.8 I\nhave nothing more to add, only to make sure i have 10 lines of text so\nIMDb machine is happy\n"
"\nFirst time making a review here and this movie made me to do so. This\nMovie has nothing at all. A guy is shooting dozens of people one by\none. Thats it !<br><br>What I will suggest that start movie, watch for no more than 10 minutes\nby expecting somethings then close your eyes and go deep sleep. Don't\nforget to switch sound at lowest, lots of shooting will bother your\nsleep.<br><br>I have nothing to add for this empty movie, it doesn't deserve to get\nmore to say.<br><br>But IMDb wants me to add more lines.\n"
"\nShitty movie. Honestly, after the first 20 minutes, I had to turn if\noff. Really? Killing a dog? Was that necessary? Also, it hurt my ears\nto hear the TERRIBLE Russian being spoken by the \"bad dudes\", and the\nguys who play the gang members aren't even Russian for god sakes. And\nas a Russian, I gotta say I am also incredibly sick of Hollywood\nliterally ALWAYS using Russians as the \"bad guys\". Change it up for\nonce. Keanu Reeves has played the same character- even if different\nmovies- for the last several years. Blah blah, revenge, ex-hit-man,\nblah blah, good guy versus bad guys, blah blah blah. Hollywood movies\nthese days are all identical and lack originality. Save your time and\nwatch something older, like an action movie from the 80s and 90s.\n"
"\nlmao.....This movie was so sick that i have renamed it...Its John Sick\nrather..... I have never seen such a crappy flick for ages now...what\nwas it all about? How could he survive all the bullets shot at him, and\nhow come whoever he shot at, got killed? Im disgusted that i ruin my\nweekend for this movie..... Keannu's acting was awful too..he was ind\nof frozen in the whole movie...no expressions at all...i was still\nrecovering from the action scenes from THE EQUALIZER and here we go,\nanother crappy flick.... I still have 4 lines to qualify for the review\nsubmission....I just don't know what to write.... Please do watch it\nonce everyone..... I want you all to go through the same pain i went\nthrough..........................\n"
"\nI bet it would be a great movie but unfortunately I pressed stop after\na couple of minutes. The first scene was about John Wick who loses his\nwife and he is sad and angry. Second scene his dead wife sends him a\npresent which was a puppy for him to take care and love (how sweet and\nsad). Third scene some creepy guys break into his home cause earlier\nthey wanted to buy his car but John did not sale it to them. So because\nthe movie wasn't so tragic and dramatic all ready you probably thought\nthat something was missing. What about killing the puppy? Of course you\nkilled the puppy and you made the movie worth watching now (or not). To\nsum up, a wife dies, he is depressed, violent guys want to kill him for\nhis car and because there is not enough drama already they kill the\npuppy. What a start! I wonder if after that John Wick becomes Hit Man\nand tries to get revenge for his puppy's death driving his car!! Thank\nyou and sorry\n"
"\nVery poorly written and executed.<br><br>More importantly, the protagonist is worse than the \"bad guys\".<br><br>A huge body count over a car and a dog.<br><br>I have no sympathy for John Wick. A crazy, evil man, just like the\npeople he goes after.<br><br>The only decent character is the dead wife.<br><br>I could forgive that -- if the film had some other redeeming attribute.\nIt does not. (loved the series Dexter, and movies where the protagonist\nis an awful bad guy but there were excellent scenes of violence etc and\ninteresting characters).<br><br>I am glad I paid nothing to see this movie, but upset I wasted my free\nRedbox movie on it.\n"
"\nThis jerk who wrote this film is unbelievable. I can't believe anyone\nthinks it's okay to kill an innocent puppy in a film.<br><br>YOU SHOULD BE VERY ASHAMED OF YOURSELF, DEREK KOLSTAD.<br><br>It was completely unnecessary for you to kill the puppy in this film.<br><br>Maybe that's the best you could do.<br><br>If I was your mother, I would be completely embarrassed by you.<br><br>I will never see anything that you are associated with again.<br><br>It was a waste of my time and money.<br><br>I've always liked Keanu Reeves, but I'm surprised he would associate\nhimself with someone that would write such crap.<br><br>Shame on you too.<br><br>Very sad.\n"
"\nThis movie is lazy, formulaic and completely lacking in originality or\nflair.<br><br>There is no character development.<br><br>It is instantly forgettable <br><br>Keanu Reeves displays the acting range of a coat stand.<br><br>Michael Nyqvist plays the standard issue Russian psychopath. Where have\nwe seen that before?<br><br>SPOILER<br><br>There's the usual car chase with lots of bumping and shunting.<br><br>The baddies get killed.<br><br>Keanu walks the dog.<br><br>Er... that's it!\n"
"\nhad high hopes for this film after seeing good reviews,but it was\nreally bad. After the first ten minutes it turned into a video game\nwith all the bad guys getting shot so easily .Keanu Reeves just grunts\nthe whole way through with most of the other characters acting as if\nthey are from another planet. Maybe next time ill scroll down the page\nto read a few more reviews rather than the headline rating.The penny\ndropped when the credits started to roll and i saw that most of the\ndirection and producers were from Russia so it was made for the Russian\nmarket . Has there ever been a good Russian film. Please don't tell me\nthere is a John Wick 2.\n"
"\nYep, this is a good action film, kind of simple, but good. The action\nin this film is enough to keep action movie fans happy. It didn't have\nlong boring scenes that would have you sitting around waiting for some\naction to start. It was perfectly done, much like \"Predator\" or \"The\nEqualizer\" or, better yet, \"The Matrix\". In fact, while watching this\nfilm I was reminded of the \"Matrix\" a time or two. No mystery why. The\nacting was done well too. There were a few familiar faces from the\nsmall screen(HBO) as well. All of the characters were convincing and\nbelievable. John Wick(Keanu Reeves) is an ex-hit-man who is forced to\ncome back to work to find the people who took everything from him. Like\nI said, it's simple but it's good. Now it is violent but it is fun to\nwatch and it will keep you interested.\n"
"\nJohn Wick disappointed on several levels. I probably had too high\nexpectations, but the \"one-man-army/revenge\" concept has been done so\nmany times before and done much better than this. The movie is rather\nboring - no real story here, and the characters aren't very\ninteresting. The action scenes are mediocre and too much \"over the\ntop\". The whole thing just gets really tedious after a while.<br><br>The revenge concept needs to generate sympathy from the viewer, and we\nneed to be interested in seeing the revenge getting carried out. This\nmovie didn't manage to do any of that for me. I was surprised to read\nquite a bit of positive reviews of John Wick, and a metascore of 68 was\nalso surprising. I'm normally in line with at least the IMDb score, but\nthis time I can't find much in this movie that warrants more than a 4.0\nrating.\n"
"\nThis is a stylized action movie that the director describes as \"gunfu\"\nin the DVD extras.<br><br>The plot and story for this movie is very light and superficial, and\nfeels like it has been lifted from a comic book. There are clichéd\nRussian gansters and John Wick is the assassin with seemingly unearthly\nkilling skills. <br><br>I found the movie enjoyable, but I can see why some reviewers hate it.\nIf you are after an interesting story, this is not the movie for you.\nIf you like comic book movies and \"gunfu\" action sequences, you will\nprobably enjoy it.\n"
"\nA basic, straight forward, bare bones plot makes way for what may be\nthe greatest action flick in over a decade. John Wick serves as a\nbreath of fresh air for the action genre. Jam packed with slick and\nstylish gun play, judo, jiu jitsu, highly quotable dialogue, and of\ncourse the seemingly immortal Keanu Reeves himself, now age 50! The\ncinematography is beautiful. The soundtrack is killer. the action\nscenes are allowed room to breathe and unfold in a way that is always\nsatisfying and never cluttered or confusing. As previously stated, the\nstory is bland yet no one cares! The movie is just damn fun! Why should\nit need to be anything other than what it is?\n"
"\nRecently with the Oscar fever I have been watching mostly drama or real\nlife scenario type of movies. I have been wanting to watch John wick\nfor a long while. Hence yesterday I decided I'll give it a go. I was in\nfor a super duper action treat. Mind you the action is mindless. Crazy\nshooting, he pulls a trigger people die, but people will capture him\nand only talk to him. So if you are ready for these kind of logical\nnon-sense, then this is the movie for you. Keanu Reeves seems to have\ngot it right. He looks convincing as the Superhuman, Superpowered,\nSupreme hit-man. The background score of the movie is the highlight.\nClassic stuff for action scenes. Anybody a fan of the 90's action movie\nand leave your brain in the locker and watch this movie. You'll enjoy\nit!!!\n"
"\nWow! This is one of the worst action movies of all times and I can't\nbelieve it has 7.2 rating as I write. Where do I even begin? <br><br>- No character development. - Awful script, you won't even remember one\nline after the movie. - Sloppy acting, no one in the movie is good. -\nNo story. - Poor ending. - Environment, screenplay and visuals are also\nnot that good. - Action sequences are barely tolerable.<br><br>At the end, I would like to ask those who like this movie: what is\nwrong with you people? Have you not watched any half-decent movie\nrecently? And to those aspiring to watch this movie, I won't say don't\nwatch it. I'd say watch it and come back to IMDb and rate this movie -\nas a service to mankind.\n"
"\nThe film is so contrived. You know what's going to happen from the off.\nCharacter development and everything is so basic it's laughable. You\ncould have got a film student to write and direct the entire thing. I'm\nflabbergasted that people actually think this is a great film. What's\nso unique about it that no other film has got. The acting is wooden,\nthe scenes unbelievable and this just a payday for those involved.\nTrust me, you've seen it all before. If you're willing to put all\ncommon sense behind you and take everything at face value then perhaps\nthis film is for you. Oh my god, it's just finishing as I write, and I\ncan't believe the final scene! Now I know this film was rated by kids\nfor kids.\n"
"\nHow can this movie rate 7+ in IMDb ? I registered today for another\nreason but I also wanted to rate John Wick. Sorry Sorry Sorry this\nmovie is not good at all. Very bad acting, no good scenario, no good\nlight. Stupid Russian racism (mafia in US is mostly Jewish); So I\nconsider this movie as a gross propaganda like anti Russian Equalizer\nmovie. USA is a fascist empire \" controlled at 80% by Zionists \"\n(statement by the prime minister of Israel Bibi in 2013). Economy is\ndown because ultra liberalism has allowed the most vicious and\nunethical Jewish mafia to rule the world. Now they want people to fight\nand forget who put the world into chaos so they bring war between west\nand east, Russia and Muslims. Its the fight of bad against good. Your\nsociety will collapse because it is based on lies.\n"
"\nSo the whole idea of justice and epitome of first-world problems goes\nto the fantastic plot of invincible Kiwi Reeves who starts going all\ncrazy killing everyone in the world over a car which he gets replaced\nfor free and a dog he didn't really like and had around for two days.\nDespite the fact that the dog was a gift from his freshly dead wife, he\nchucked some blankets on the floor and took it off the bed. The same\nman who had no feelings over the dog had no feelings expressed when his\nbest buddy got killed. Are viewers supposed to root for such a spoiled\nrich boy. Are viewers supposed to believe that a hit-man incapable of\nloving can all of a sudden switch to his cell phone video of his wife\nand think about her from time to time? Kiwi's character is full of\ncontradictions like the movie for a 5 year old.\n"
"\nA lot of video games have been influenced by films - the plots, the\ncharacters, the framing, the cinematography. And increasingly a lot of\nfilms are now influenced back by video games - the plots, the\ncharacters, the framing, the cinematography. And so it is the case with\nJohn Wick.<br><br>It's set in a world where everyone seems to be a gangster or an\nassassin, or a formal part of that world. It's all rather cold and\ndetached. There is the flimsiest of back stories but it mostly consists\nof a very wooden Keanu Reeves shooting people in the face, sometimes\nstabbing them, and of course the obligatory 'throwing people through\nsheets of glass'.<br><br>The whole point of a video game is that you control the character. Even\nif the game consists merely of killing people, the fact that you are\ncontrolling them makes it an immersive experience.<br><br>Just passively watching a wooden game character shooting people in the\nface, sometimes stabbing them, and of course the obligatory 'throwing\npeople through sheets of glass', makes for a rather pointless and\ntedious 101 minutes.\n"
"\nThis movie was incredible. The plot was pretty simple but they were\nable to make a simple plot an awesome movie. This movie has your\nattention from the beginning. This movie was a solid 9 for the simple\nfact that the action was awesome and the characters did a great job\nacting. The movie took a turning point for me when I realized Marcus\n(William Defoe) was still being a good friend. I didn't know how this\nmovie would stand out until then.\n"
"\nThe movie is 104 minutes long. It features 119 people getting killed.\nMost of them in graphic detail complete with enhanced sound effects.<br><br>For those of you who do NOT live in their Mother's basement...there is\nless than minimal plot...almost no character development... just tons\nand tons of gore. <br><br>Keanu Reeves poses his way through every scene as if he is heavily\nmedicated.There is no range of emotions, no nuance, no sympathetic\ncharacters. It is a sad comment about American Society that this tripe\npasses for \"Entertainment\". Even with all this insane amount of\nviolence, it end s up being one of the most boring movies I can ever\nremember seeing.\n"
"\nJohn Wick, ex hit-man, comes out of retirement and sets out for revenge\non those who have taken all that he had left - a rather basic plot.\nThis doesn't stop John Wick from being a stylish, action packed movie.<br><br>The action scenes are top notch and are fitted together with an\nexcellent soundtrack. The character John Wick is an intimidating expert\nkiller who throughout the film evokes emotion without compromising the\nseriousness and sharpness of his personality.<br><br>If you are looking for an hour or so of pure entertainment, then this\nis a film worth investing in, it will make you want to re-watch it\npurely because it is a good time. If, however, you are searching for a\ndeep, psychological masterpiece, I suggest look elsewhere. 8/10.\n"
"\nUncreative, amateurish plot with terrible acting (like most Keanu\nReeve's films). Ridiculous \"shoot-em-up\" action throughout with no\nredeeming moments. I gave up after Reeves had slaughtered his 153rd\nvictim with little more than a few scratches in return. One of Willem\nDafoe's poorest performances and typical of Keanu's high-school acting.\nEven one of my favorite actresses, Bridget Moynahan drowned in the\nmurky waters of this garbage film. The musical score sounded like it\nwas produced by a bad garage-group of teenagers. The cinematography\nsucked and it took an uncommon staying-power and determination to sit\nthrough it 'til the end. This flick is a total waste of time and anyone\nwho gives it more than a 2 has been smoking bad weed.\n"
"\nThis movie clearly wants to be in the original Taken category but alas,\nit cannot be. It's just a boring, one note action flick that would be a\nB movie if not for it's A- list star and obvious polished locations. I\nlike looking at Keanu as much as anyone but him punching a lot of\npeople does not a good movie make. It's as good as the Taken sequels,\nthat is not say not good at all. There is no time spent to create a\nworld behind each character, it's just, here's a guy, punch him, shoot\nhim. It feels like a cartoon for very stupid boys. There isn't a good\nline in the entire thing. The most memorable scene is a girl entering a\nswimming pool in high heels.\n"
"\nIf you like fast cars, squealing tires, gratuitous violence, shoot-em\nup bang-bangs and a weak plot, then this is the film for you. Don't\nwatch it with a full-stomach; the very essence of the film will make\nyou sick.<br><br>Some top notch actors, but they are miscast. What are Ian McShane and\nWilliam Devane doing in this garbage? I guess times must be tough.<br><br>A dog is killed very early in the film. The plot is very unlikely and\nis tailored for the violence.<br><br>If you are anywhere near civilized, stay away.<br><br>This is not a movie for children. It's not one for adults, either, so\nsave whatever money and time you can by not viewing it.\n"
"\n\"world's greatest\" Hit-man gets the rollerskating bejesus kicked out of\nhim by: <br><br>1. some punks; 2. an extra; 3. a girl; 4. the (same) extra again; and\n5. an old man<br><br>In between he shoots off about 26 million rounds, about 4 of which hit\nand kills about 4 people (but not the extra or the girl who are taken\nout by others) and spends time in a hotel with inviolable rules that\nare immediately violated.<br><br>this with Gringot's gold coins.<br><br>oh and it's all over a fricking puppy.<br><br>Potential to have an obscenely talented ex-hit-man come out of\nretirement to avenge in a movie of true spectacularatude=incredibly\nhigh<br><br>actual ability to deliver even a slightly worthwhile movie= absolute\nzero.<br><br>worse than: every Transporter movie ever made.<br><br>about as good as - Crossroads with Britney Spears.<br><br>Still better than: Twilight.\n"
"\nBefore I start, I feel I have to state that John Wick is more than just\nanother Popcorn Movie. Its stunning choreography, seamless switching-up\nof fighting styles and without a doubt; its cast, are impeccable.\nReminiscent of other revenge thrillers such as 'Taken,' and 'The Man\nfrom nowhere;' John Wick enthrals the audience with it's visuals while\nkeeping you connected with it's personal performances. Keanu Reeves was\nborn to play the part of John Wick; the nice, quiet guy with a big dark\nsecret. If you're looking for a movie you need to watch twice to fully\ngrasp it's countless layers and subplots; go watch Memento, or Donnie\nDarko. If you're looking for a movie you want to watch twice because\nyou have to show your buddy what a bada** Keanu Reeves' is; then look\nno further. John Wick is as manly as a steak dinner washed down with a\n6-pack of PBR. I thoroughly enjoyed this film and cannot wait for John\nWick 2.\n"
"\nOn one level, a kind of cartoony action film for fans of KR.<br><br>On a deeper level, the films asks profound questions about valuable\nskills lost to society when competent people retire.<br><br>On an historical level this film may be an unintended tribute to\ndirector Michael Winner, who died the year it was in production.<br><br>This was exactly and precisely the sort of film that Winner specialized\nin, back in the glory days. Would have starred Charles Bronson (again,\nsadly, no longer with us).<br><br>Haters begone. If JCVD and Segal can keep churning out muck at a age\nwhen they should be in rocking chairs, let's give good old KR a little\nrope .. and then wait to see who he hangs with it.\n"
"\nThis movie was a waste of my time. With movies like \"The Equalizer\" and\nthe remake of \"Oldboy\" the idea of the revenge concept is become more\nand more prominent. They have also become extremely exciting, but what\nwas the appeal of those films? The characters were interesting and made\nthe action more fun and promising over just seeing some guy beat up a\nbunch of people. John Wick was that. It as a beat em up revenge movie.\nIt was a pointless movie that dragged on. I mean really. Why do I care?\nI didn't feel a reason too. I didn't care about who John Wick was or\nwhat he wanted and the whole mythes about him. This film gave me no\nreason too. People wanna talk about Transformers: Age of Extinction.\nPfft talk about John Wick's lets just fight movie cause that is all\nthat it was.\n"
"\nJohn Wick is great low cost action film which which strong fights sense\nthorough out the film. Which Keanu Reeves best films since The Matrix.\nI think the story it little bit lacking but this not driving by the the\nstories narrative. The start of the film which starts showing him at\nthe his lowest point with the wife pasting always which his wife gave\nhim a dog to keep her companies. when the group people which what his\ncar they decided to steel it from John Wick Which previous life turn\nout to be ex-hit-man comes out of retirement to track down the\ngangsters that took away everything form him. The Action sense great\nchange the action fight sense back to simple form which thew cut not\nlike the other film such as film like Taken and Marvel films which too\nmuch cut between each simple fight sense. It best action pack in 2014.\n"
"\nKeanu Reeves is an immense performer as John Wick. He is an elite hit\nman on a revenge mission. His name is enough for his enemies to\nquestion their decisions, its foreshadowed in the whole movie.<br><br>It is an awesome action movie a deep story and a strong character arch\nand produced with the slick action techniques of today. Which you will\nsee in very few films. <br><br>Unlike most action movies of this era, this film does not rely on quick\nand nauseating camera movement to show off its cool action moves,\ninstead it uses steady and uncut scenes for you to appreciate how much\nof a bad ass Keanu Reeves is.<br><br>It one of those hidden gems that are between these piles of garbage. If\nyou hit it you are rich. It one of those which deserve popularity but\nis dragged down by the lack of promotion. I am so glad I watched this. <br><br>Looking forward to John Wick: Chapter 2.\n"
"\nI really liked this film and was really not expecting to. Whenever\nKeanu Reeves dons a beard, he turns into this believable bad ass that\nis fun to watch. While I don't think the character of John Wick had\nreally any amazing hand-to-hand fighting skills, his real skill was the\npoint blank range shot. No hesitation, just one after another killed by\nhis skill for doing this. It was quite brutal, I'll be honest, but\nnonetheless very effective. Theon Greyjoy was unrecognizable (at first)\nas the snotty son who thought he could get away with killing Wick's\ndog. I loved the whole hotel/safehouse aspect of the story, that was\npretty cool. I haven't seen the sequel yet but I've been told it's\nbetter than the first one so I'm looking forward to seeing it soon.<br><br>Overall, I would recommend this movie to action lovers for sure and\nmaybe those who are looking for a good action movie because there\nhasn't been a good one in quite a while it seems.\n"
"\nThis is a good watch if you are into some mindless action. It really\njustifies Keanu's acting potential in style with the Matrix movies. The\nmovie has a decent plot, although easy to figure out. Some lovable\ncharacters, especially Willem's! <br><br>However, as a Swede, I simply cannot get over the fact that even though\nMichael does a decent job with the acting, his accent destroys the\ncredibility of his role. The dialect and accent is so obviously from a\nScandinavian country and not near how Russians speak having learned the\nEnglish language later in life. I cannot comment on the actual Russian\ndialect itself, but the English is way off. It's too bad really, he\nshould've gotten help with a language coach to hit off that accent.\nIt's easy for us Swedes to learn English, however, when done this\npoorly, it just becomes a bother.<br><br>All in all, 7/10 fruit loops.\n"
"\nAnother awesome performance from Keanu Reeves. I really like the plot.\nAll the action are very nice executed, if some real fighting moves from\nmartial arts. I like the shooting scenes and for these one, Keanu\nreceived some special training. The soundtrack is another interesting\nthing from the movie, it fit well. I am looking forward to see the\nsecond movie of that one, released earlier this year, 2017. For action\nmovies fans, Keanu Reeves fans, this is another movie to be seen.\n"
"\nJohn Wick is one of my all-time favourite movies, full of highly\nstylized action, frequent droll wit, and a relentless pace. <br><br>It's loaded with action and violence. But, unlike a lot of action\nmovies, Wick's action sequences don't stop to dwell in gore -- they\njust keep blazing along. Suits me perfectly.<br><br>I can't imagine better casting. The many supporting players are superb,\nand Reeves is outstanding. He does so much with extremely subtle\nmovements and expressions -- along, of course, with all the martial\narts gymnastics.<br><br>I wish this could be rerun in theatres!\n"
"\nNow, I've seen Mr. Wick also doing something human, like sleeping in a\nbed, sharing some breakfast with a lovely little dog(impressive scene\ndiscovering the puppy and reading his dead wife's letter). As the first\nfilm of a man(Chad Stahelski, the director) who has previously been a\nstuntman and a martial artist, it's a great achievement. Accumulating\nconsiderable experience as a stuntman in films as \"Point Break\" (1991),\n\"The Matrix\" (1999), \"The Matrix Reloaded\" (2003), \"The Matrix\nRevolutions\" (2003), \"Constantine\" (2005), \" Man of Tai Chi \"(2013),\nall with Keanu Reeves, it was natural that Stahelski and Reeves will\nwork together again, achieving something even more spectacular. Good\naction and great music!\n"
"\nI liked this film because it follows the formula of revenge but it's\nnot terribly boring. It feels somewhat fresh. There are good believable\nperformances and it manages to hold your interest at a medium level for\nthe entire film. Some of it feels original as well. I like that. The\ngun work is amazing! The fight scenes are good and the create a world\nthat feels believable. I was able to suspend disbelief for a little\nwhile and enjoy this world. To many film today operate with the premise\nthat the audience knows it's all fake. A good film draws you in and\nmakes you believe in the theme of the story, the plight of the\ncharacters and their emotions. I'd say this film has some success in\ndoing this.\n"
"\nI liked it. It doesn't deserve 10 stars, but was a good movie. A\ncombination between James Bond with Daniel Craig and Jason Statham's\nmovies. I haven't watched many movies with Keanu Reeves lately and I'm\nglad i saw this. Now i'll watch the Chapter 2 to see how is it. I hope\ni'll like it.\n"
"\nI finally got around to seeing \"John Wick\", folks say you should see\nthe this one before seeing the 2nd. The movie is exciting enough, the\nsoundtrack is loud and seems to ebb and flow with the level Mr. Wick's\nkilling carnage. Mr. Reeves is certainly looking good for age 52, and\nis impressive as he jumps around wrestling and killing folks. I will\nnever \"get\" the concept of someone going off to war because someone\nkills his dog and steals his car, but you certainly don't have to\nunderstand that to enjoy the movie. I'm not sure how many of these John\nWick movies they can keep making without giving the character a little\nmore emotional resonance. The way it looks now, \"John Wick\" is some\nkind of natural step between humans making and directing movies and\nartificial intelligence taking over the movie making.\n"
"\nWatched John Wick with Kenau Reeves(47 Ronin)as John Wick ,Michael\nNyqvist(Mission :Impossible- Ghost Protocol) as Viggo Tarasov, Alfie\nAllen(Game Of Thrones) as Iosef Tarasov,Adrianne Palicki(G.I.

"\nJohn Wicks simplicity is what brings this movie from a minor league to\na major league. John Wick in its glory gives us as viewers eye candy to\nwatch over and over. I'm rating this action film high because this is\none of the very few action movies I can watch over and over. It does\nhave its shortcomings however. John Wick fails to deliver new action\nthrills and sticks with the same old movie tropes that we have become\naccustomed to. Just as The Matrix set a tone for this \"almost\nmasterpiece\" it suffers from \"I've seen that before, oh, but that's a\ngreat scene\" I recommend John Wick for people who like action and a\nsimple plot. Thank you for reading!\n"
"\nPeople keep asking if he is back...<br><br>And yea, I'm thinking he's back.<br><br>John Wick tells the story of a man seeking revenge. The plot is very\nsimple and straightforward so my review will be comparable. John Wick\nexperiences a series of unfortunate tragedies and consequently, he\nspends the rest of the movie delivering head shots to the men who were\nresponsible. The simplicity of the plot is effective because it gives\nus plenty of time to focus on the action. And the action is where this\nmovie shines. The martial arts and gun fighting provide eye candy like\nyou've never seen. And the amazing stunt work is accompanied by\nflawless editing and directing. The guys who made this seriously knew\nwhat they were doing.<br><br>John Wick takes place in a dark and stylish Universe full of assassins\nand bounties. The music is dope, the characters are interesting, the\naction is slick and Keanu provides his best performance since The\nMatrix as he performs 95% of his own stunts.<br><br>One of the best pure action flicks I've seen in recent years 9/10\n"
"\nAn ex-hit-man comes out of retirement to track down the gangsters that\ntook everything from him. Over the last few years actor Keanu Reeves\nhad both his ups and downs and he has made some pretty awful films but\nalso some pretty enjoyable but nothing is enjoyable as much as John\nWick a character that even Liam Neeson would be afraid of, i mean\nseriously how can i explain how freaking amazing this film looks and\nsounds like? Great characters, great acting, cool soundtrack and\namazing action sequences that will blow your mind and of course it ends\nwith a hint on a sequel which is coming out next month 'John Wick Part\n2' in my opinion this film deserves it's place next to films such as\nDie Hard, Equalizer, Commando, First Blood and more because it's not\njust enjoyable but it's also pretty amazing in every scale that you\ncould even imagine.\n"
"\nI had several friends tell me this was a great movie so I went into it\nwith above average expectations. Sadly I was disappointed. I enjoy\nmovies where the main characters are bigger than life, but this was\njust one big disappointment for me. There was no brains to the movie.\nThe main character's mode of operation didn't have the slightest hint\nof realism. The fight scenes were well choreographed, but highly\nimprobable and quite cliché. If you want action movies with a brain I\nhighly recommend The Professional (Leon), Bourne Identity, or The Usual\nSuspects. If you want an action movie with a better story and more\nentertainment watch The Boondock Saints. If you're just looking for a\nhighly stylized action movie, here is some basic entertainment for you.\n"
"\nI'm all in favour of a revenge movie (especially when the bad guys kill\nan innocent animal). But two necessary features are that (1) the bad\nguys don't realize what they are up against and (2) said bad guys pose\na credible threat. This film fails to meet either criterion.<br><br>First, the vengeance-taker John Wick (Keanu Reeves) used to be a hit\nman for the mob, so they should be prepared for the worst.<br><br>Second, they are not. The way that the goons conveniently break cover\nand shoot to miss would be risible if it did not go on and on and on.\nWho knew there were so many incompetent bad guys? <br><br>And what is a good actor like Reeves doing in this film? <br><br>A big disappointment.\n"
"\nits just blood shedding. what a pathetic story line. i will say there\nis no story. i don't know how it got 7.2 rating. it was a waste of time\nafter you have seen Bourn series. he keeps on killing around like a\nsuper hero or something. And you look at other people as if they are\nnothing. people get killed like chickens. nothing happens to the kenu\nas he is a super hero or something. i had a lot of expectations after i\nsaw rating 7.2 , it was a waste of 2 hour and it spoiled my mood also.\nthey want you to write 10 lines for a review . actually no one can\nwrite 10 lines for this movie. its all about blood shed. he is a man of\nsteel or something. and he is not even quick in his moves. why bullets\ndoesn't touch him that should be investigated.\n"
"\nI didn't like the movie, it gave me cognitive dissonance. It is a\nprofessional work, it has perfect styling, the camera work is great,\nthe individual scenes are believable and well shot but... it has no\ncontent.<br><br>The characters are shallow and don't grow. The action is predictable.\nThe stereotypes are pure propaganda. It just feeels like somebody\nwasted not only the viewers money, but also hired the stars for\nnothing.<br><br>There is just no message. I felt like I'm Voight-Kampff tested for\nbeing an Android and got a positive result.\n"
"\nDoes this really reflect US? Maybe that explains the tragically high\ngun crime/tragedy of the whole nation. The people who say its \"Action\"\nare in a different world?<br><br>Thousands of bullets, scores of dead baddies. Why bother? And the DVD\nextras don't help, except to show the preparation for the \"fight\"\nsequences. (who-cares?)<br><br>Wick (Reeves) is coping with the death of his wife (unexplained?) and\nthen receives a delivery of a puppy, apparently from the wife?. Then,\nanother tragedy, he gets tangled up with a Mafia-type crowd from\nRussia. One of them steals his 69-Mustang AND kills the puppy.<br><br>Clearly revenge is coming. For 90 minutes. Oh dear.\n"
"\nThe filmmakers of John Wick looked at action movies and figured out a\nway to make them better. What if you cut everything that the movie\ndidn't need - the love interest, the convoluted plot, and the\nmoralizing? What's left is a pure action movie without anything it\ndoesn't need. They knew people liked choreographed action sequences and\nthey filled the movie with plenty of them. In subtle ways, it makes\nadvances in the genre. For example, notice how characters react when\nthey hear the name - \"John Wick.\" They're instantly terrified. The one\nthing that I wanted that the film didn't give me was something truly\noriginal. Unlike The Matrix or Inception which really changed action\nmovies, this movie doesn't. But man, if it doesn't change the game, it\nplays the game like a true master.\n"
"\nOne of the best revenge movies out. One thing I really like is the\nshootouts. Keanu trained with real tactical trainers using real guns.\nIm a gun guy so seeing movies with guns really turn me off because what\nthey are doing is not practical. There is a Youtube video of Keanu\nshredding at three gun. Thats where you are going through a course\nusing a rifle, handgun, and shotgun. People are comparing it to Taken\nwith Liam Nesson. I think it is a better movie then Taken. There is\ngood acting not only from Keanu but also Alfie Allen (Theon from Game\nof Thrones), Michael Nyqvist, and Willem Dafoe. Below is a link of\nKeanu shooting three gun competition. <br><br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpr8oqyjKIc\n"
"\nWriting a review for the first time and several months after watching\nthis movie, I just wanted to share my feelings about this movie.<br><br>I have to say I never expected Keanu Reeves at this level on an action\nmovie since the first Matrix. Certainly he has had some films out since\nthen but those are not even close to this one. <br><br>I really enjoyed all the action scenes, and the world of darkness in\nwhich all these hit men live. I want to know more of it, more from the\ncharacters, more about the history of 'The Continental' and I'm pretty\nsure everyone wants to see more of 'the Boogeyman'.<br><br>John Wick is a solid movie, with a great argument, great action\nsequences, an understandable motivation and - last but not least-a\ngreat Keanu. I can't wait for the already announced sequel!\n"
"\nYou could have written this on the back of a napkin... 'Guy's dog is\nmurdered; guy goes mental, efficiently killing those responsible. The\nEnd'. There's no colour to the story, whatsoever; there are only garish\ncolours in the nightclub scenes. If all you need to think something is\ncool is to see people getting beaten up or shot, then join the Army... <br><br>Indiscriminately colouring random subtitles to look like comic book\nspeech panels got old fast, too.<br><br>This is going to make me sound all 'get off my lawn' (if I hadn't\nalready!) but action movies used to be done so much better... These\ndays, apparently all you need to make a popular action film is some\nfast editing and fight choreography, with the barest hint of a premise\nthat absolutely no thought has gone into fleshing out - the end result\nbeing that the finished product has less depth than a puddle. I must be\ndemanding, but for what I want out of even the most streamlined revenge\nflick, that just ain't good enough!\n"
"\nKeanu Reeves isn't the guy that seems suited for your usual revenge\nflick, but he works fairy well for \"John Wick\". There's an inherent\ndetachment to Reeves for a good portion of the film, but he's also got\nthat quiet brooding that roils beneath the surface.<br><br>Probably the best thing about this movie are the action scenes, which\naren't cut to shreds. They're well-staged and have a nice fluid\nbrutality to them. Simple but effective.<br><br>What was also really nice was the clearly defined (under)world with its\ncoded language, currency ad protocols. It harked back to \"Payback\" and\nthe mob-as-corporate-culture. Also, Wick had modern dress and domestic\nappointments (probably due to his departed wife), but he's using an old\ntouchtone phone and getting around in circa '79s cars. Little touches\nthat add character.<br><br>It's great news that they're planning a sequel. They've already built\nthe world, and I'm in for more.\n"
"\nKeanu Reaves is back and this movie its a movie exactly for Keanu\nReaves. Don't expect to see an amazing story or a great photography...\nthis is an action movie quite interested and one or two points above\nthe usual action movies. Its sad, then its funny, then its thrill, and\nlots of action from the beginning to the end. The fights are very well\nconceived, we all know Keanu Reaves skills on martial arts and the\nacting is quite good on almost all the participants. John Wick is a\nretired contract killer passing for a moment of griving, the problem is\nthat a group of Russian's didn't let him griving on his own, and give\nhim a path back to his formal live.<br><br>Finally we know who killed the boogie man. And this create a lot of\nreactions during the movie which is very funny.<br><br>You wont be disappointed with this movie.\n"
"\nThis is a sly, swift and stylish action movie that is actually a decent\npopcorn flick. Sure the plot isn't anything grand, but that isn't the\ncore of this movie. A movie such as this needs a spark and how to go\nabout it from there on. It isn't as adrenaline filled entertainment\nlike \"The Raid\" or has a super well blended and enticing story mixed\nwith action like \"The Raid 2\" but it'st still a pretty cool movie. And\nseeing Keanu Reeves kicking ass and taking names is just the bonus.\nLike I said the plot doesn't have anything that really stands out, but\nthe stylish cinematography, choreography with enough cool action\nelements make this one worth at least one watch. Especially if you like\naction movies. However I could see why some audiences would not like\nthis movie and why some people just wouldn't. You could really tell the\ndirectors got their ideas from past action movies, anime and video\ngames. \"Max Payne 3\" really came to mind while watching this.<br><br>7.5/10\n"
"\nToo bad I had to give this movie a \"1\" rating. It really deserves a\nzero. I can't believe at one time it had an 8+. At least now it's on\nits way down. I enjoy action films, but they should have some sense of\nreality and character development. John Wick has neither. Gratuitous\nviolence on 100+ (I lost count) bad guys who are seemingly just waiting\nto be dispatched by John. No attempt at creative engagement of the bad\nguys. Just show up at a particular location and start shooting. Shoot\n20 or more bad guys at a nightclub, on the dance floor, while people\nkeep dancing?? Give me a break. More like a video game than an\nengrossing, entertaining movie. I kept waiting for my countdown counter\nto reach zero, which seemed to take forever. An hour and 40 minutes\ntotally wasted. If you're over 15, skip it.\n"
"\nEven for an action movie, this film is as simplistic as it gets. Even\nfor a mindless diversion it's boring. I found myself interested for a\nfull 4 minutes during this hour and a half drone. In a world cram\npacked with action movies this offers absolutely nothing new,\ninteresting, or beneficial.<br><br>There was some action, which was no different from every other action\nfilm. There was mindless machismo-ism based around tired, meaningless\nrevenge, completely void of inspiration. There was no plot--\nwhatsoever. It's no more than a long series of repetitive, uncreative\ntrigger-pulling scenes with no redeeming factors.<br><br>Save yourself the agony and watch something that will bring you\nreflection over base, retrogressive diversions.\n"
"\nUltra-edited and devoid of originality, this turd is ultraviolence\nsensationalized for the sake of show with absolutely no thought. It is\nan over-the-hill Keanu Reeves Star Comeback movie without the comeback.\nIt is a diarrhea &amp; vomit of direction. Rather it has overcooked music\nand cheesepuff rock, and is as poor a movie as I've seen in the last\nfew years. Well this IMDb rating is here to help bring some honesty to\nhow bad this steamer is. Bad accents, bad dialog, Russian accented\nEnglish or Russian interspersed with blah, blah who cares semblences of\nconversation - John Wick the boogie-man killer...BLAH! Think of better\nor even average action-thrillers like Equalizer, History of Violence,\nor the Taken movies, and this movie rips off from every single one.\nMade by 9 year olds. Slogged through this utter drivel knowing better.\nEmbarrassing for all \"filmmakers\" involved and the Mayhem guy from the\ninsurance commercials catching a payday... 2/10 -\n"
"\nPeople might rave on how good action this movie shows. To me it's just\npointless. Even if i swallow the fact that Mr. Wick is doing impossible\nthings during the entire film, the story about an ex hit-man that goes\nback in business for revenge is so thin, that it could have been told\nin 10 minutes instead of two hours. All the movie shows is a thousand\nways how to kill someone, nothing else basically. Although nicely\nfilmed, it's a big pointless yawn in the end. Keanu Reeves does his\nacting job much much better in the Matrix, and The action parts there\nare much more enjoyable. Waste your time on something with brains\nbehind it. This lacks it completely.\n"
"\nI wish I had the cash and the opportunity to see this one when it was\nin the theater over the summer because this movie was just entertaining\nas hell! <br><br>I have no complaints about \"John Wick\" because it is one of those\nperfect summer blockbuster flashy action flicks! Keanu Reeves is\nawesome as Wick and leads a cast of very talented people to play\ninteresting and fun characters in a story that is simple but extremely\neffective. Add in the exciting action and fight scenes and this movie\nwas awesome from beginning to end and just oozes adrenaline. It's a\ncrime if we don't see more John Wick and this film doesn't spawn\nsequels.\n"
"\nI hate movies which include dogs, because somewhere along the line that\ndog is going to get killed.<br><br>I guess I'm a sensitive man, but at the beginning of this movie when\nour hero receives a present of a little spaniel dog from his wife who\nhad died of cancer, this film took on heart, but it was all short\nlived, because the dog got killed by thugs who beat up our hero John\nWick and then you hear the dog yelp and then you see the dog from it's\nback, lying dead by John Wick when he wakes up from his beating.<br><br>John Wick the character has heart, he cries at his wife's grave side, I\nlost my own wife to cancer in September last year 2014, so I could\nempathize with the character.<br><br>All in all this was a very good movie with excellently rehearsed fight\nscenes, very cleverly directed. But getting passed the doggy being\nkilled, kind of spoiled it for me.\n"
"\nWhen I first heard the movie title I was thinking this movie was going\nto be awful, boy was I wrong! John wick is on of the best action films\nI seen in years. It starts off very touching and you feel a lot of\nsympathy for Mr.Wick, then he turns up the volume until the speakers\npop!!! Keanu Reeves is at his prime in this movie. It makes me wonder\nwhere he's been. So glad he came back in a movie like this one. Don't\nlet people trick you into the thinking this is the Keanu from the\nmatrix, cause it's not! This is the keanu reeves you've been craving to\nsee. This is one man you don't want to mess with, and someone u want on\nyour side. Hope to see more from him. But I really think it's going to\nbe hard to put up another performance like this one. Great movie and it\ndefinitely belongs in your movie collection!! Two thumbs way up!!!\n"
"\nKeanu Reeves is absolutely solid, as is everyone else. The action\nscenes are among the best I've ever seen. Stylised, but realistic. John\nWick, the character, is insanely good and insanely tough, but not in an\neffortless way. That makes it seem more real.<br><br>The grittiness of the action scenes also adds to them.<br><br>Choreography is brilliant, cinematography is beautiful. These action\nscenes have a clear \"flow\", i.e. don't degenerate into a collection of\nfast moving extreme close-ups. The storytelling may be simple, but\nextremely well done in a visual way. All exposition scenes are visual\nand most contain little or no dialogue. <br><br>So I liked this one!\n"
"\nJohn Wick is easily Keanu''s best film since the original (and only\ngood film in the franchise) matrix. The action slowly builds along with\nthe tension as Wick seeks revenge for the murder of his dog and the\ntheft of his beloved car (great scene in the garage when the thieves\nturn up with Wicks' stolen car and Leguizamo realises who's car it is\nand what is coming next). The bad guys get no sympathy as carnage\nensues and Reeves is great as the relentlessly cold killer. This film\nis the taken sequel that has never happened! Nyqvist gets to play a\nheartless bad guy and mafioso style boss who's son is the primary goal\nof Wick's revenge. I disagree with those who say there is no story to\nthis film (some of the same people liked speed which is, and always has\nbeen, simply awful!) and I think the characters are reasonably well\nthought out and the acting good for a film of this genre. Overall, a\nvery entertaining action thriller.\n"
"\nHaven't seen a nice action movie of Keanu Reeves since the Matrix. I\nenjoyed every minute of it!Sure the plot seems a lot like a classic\ncase of \"ex super ultra assassin being a one man army\" but it is well\nstructured and never leaves you bored. The atmosphere is good and gives\nthe feeling of a city that is governed by a crime syndicate. Acting is\nquite good compared to other recent action movies I saw lately. I hope\nKeanu Reeves continues to star in more good movies because he was quite\nunseen during the last decade or so with very few exceptions. At first\nI was sceptical about the rating I saw but after watching the movie I\nthink it deserves it!\n"
"\nAction hero has anew name and his name is John Wick! This is a definite\nsurprise movie for me- I didn't expect it to be as good as it was.<br><br>Keanu has been out of the limelight for a while, but what an epic come\nback in my eyes. I can't help but think back to Bill and Ted days!\n(This is a far cry from those days!!!!) The long and short of it is\nthat John Wick seeks revenge for the killing of his loved ones. Not\noriginal in idea, but still a good movie.<br><br>Great action scenes, lot's of fighting, gun battles, twists and other\nstuff to make it what it is.<br><br>If you like action movies, get it and watch it!\n"
"\nIn today's day it is as hard to make a good action movie as it is to\nbreak box office records. Thrillers may be based on tried and tested\nformulate, but that is the reason why to bring something new and\nrefreshing becomes harder and harder in this genre. 'John Wick' is a\ntale of revenge, a man with a violent past who is brought back to the\nlife he left behind when he is brutally attacked and his dog is killed.\nThe plot works because it doesn't try anything new, in fact it takes\nyou back several decades to Lee Marvin in 'Point Blank'. Keanu Reeves's\ncharacter of 'John Wick' is a throwback to Lee Marvin, Charles Bronson\nand every other bad ass who doesn't bother to say much but shoots\ninstead. This in itself is refreshing, just a simple action thriller\nwith no over-complicated storyline and ingenious twist. This movie is\nquite different to the other great tale of revenge released at the same\ntime; 'The Equalizer', mainly because Keanu Reeves is a much different\nactor to Denzel Washington. John Wick is for the lovers of hard action\nand no frills!\n"
"\nYou can describe this movie in a very short scheme:<br><br>*John gets his dog killed.<br><br>*John avenges his dog and kills a hundred men. (That is totally normal) <br><br>*John gets a new dog. The end.<br><br>This movie is one of the worst movies ever. 95% of the movies have some\ngood lessons for you. This movie has no lesson. Everything is negative.\nThis movie is so morally wrong. John Wick is a psychopath and killer.\nThe worst thing in this movie is that John SLAUGHTERS 'innocent' people\nand Hollywood makes it look as a GOOD thing.<br><br>I'm really disappointed that Keanu Reeves decided to accept such a\nshitty role. Usually I like action thrillers. But this? This is too\nmuch.\n"
"\nKeanu Reeves has had problems being believable in most of the roles he\nhas had throughout his career. I don't think he is a bad actor, but his\nacting coach must surely have been the most incompetent in Hollywood\nhistory. He plays exactly the same character in a tender love story, as\nhe plays in an 'action' thriller.<br><br>Now he does this. An 'action' thriller designed purely for 14 year old\nboys with pictures of cars on their bedroom walls. It plays out with\nthe stock grunty voices (because tough men have no tonsils)... and the\nvillains are Russian... with Russian accents only found in Los Angeles.<br><br>Then they kill the cute puppy. Keanu gets so miffed that he opens up\nhis secret basement full of big guns and even bigger bullets. At this\npoint... I gave up. I don't mind mindless fun, but I do object if I\nhave to be the mindless participant.<br><br>Keanu... do The Lake House Part 2... That was a half decent film.\nThis... is juvenile garbage that juveniles don't deserve.<br><br>Staggeringly formulaic, dismally predictable... and hilariously bad.\n"

"\nIt's funny but I am not sure what is 7.4 about this film? Is that Keanu\nReeves? Well, this guy may know how to act but he doesn't show that in\nthis movie. How about the plot? What is the plot? You killed my dog and\nstole my car and now you want to apologize? Common man, you can't\napologize I got to kill you and few thousand people around you cause I\ncan't make a movie otherwise. And a way he kills? Man, I think every\nsingle video game maker would envy this director. Oh, I must admit that\nthis movie fulfills the Hollywood mandatory condition where Russians\nare the bad guys. Has anyone noticed John's replies in this movie to\nmost of the questions asked? He just repeats what he heard and sounds\nlike Michael Armstrong in the 'Hot Fuzz'. All in all, I would recommend\nthis movie if you are still with sega-mega drive but if you have ever\nplayed a game called counter-strike, then you might consider this movie\nboring. For all other viewers, just don't bother.\n"
"\nOh my... Where do i start? Ridiculous script based on the cliché one\nversus entire Russian mafia, painful acting, senseless shooting scenes\none after the other... Sorry to see 2 fine actors from the excellent TV\nseries \"The Wire\" in such poor roles... Keanu Reeves plays a guy so bad\nass, that killed 3 with nothing but a pencil, but was owned in his\nhouse by the 3 stooges that beat him up, killed his dog and stole his\ncar, one of them his former bosses son which was about the only living\nperson that didn't know whom he was... Makes sense right? I gave it 2\nstars because it made me laugh, and i laughed again when i saw its\nscore here on IMDb, but i have to say that it is still a bit better\nthan \"3 days to kill\"...\n"
"\nIf you are going in with a expectation of being surprised by complex\nplot lines and twist you will find yourself being disappointed. <br><br>Go to see a well composed action movie with nice effects and creative\nideas on how to kill a man then you are in for a treat. <br><br>The pictures are filtered to set the scene of a sinister city of sin,\nwhich helps move the film along. <br><br>Cutting down the actions scene would help the plot reach the full\npotential, alas the director seems set on cramming in a maximum of\nkilling scenes that may not all compliment the story.<br><br>All in all you will be entertained 80% of the movie, which I would say\nis quite good for the genre.\n"
"\nWhat a great movie, This movie is a non-stop fun roller-coaster ride. I\nlove Keanu Reeves. He is perfect in this film. This is the type of\nmovie people will see over and over again. Waited in a long line to see\nit but it was well worth it. Amazing special effects, great acting,\ngreat everything. Best movie I have seen all year. Keanu Reeves is back\nafter a long break and he is better than ever. This is like a\ncombination of Speed and the Matrix combined. Directors Leitch and\nStahelski have created a beautiful looking action picture, one that is\nlarge enough to deserve the IMAX experience.John Wick is the real deal.\nIt is a amazing action picture, filled with strong performances by a\ncast, along with superb action set-pieces and a genuinely interesting\nworld to boot. Reeves commands the screen and reminds us why he is\nstill a genuine movie star.\n"
"\nI really loved this movie. Once I suspended the usual disbelief of the\n\"big group of bad guys attacks good guy one person at time\" scenes, I\nallowed myself to really enjoy this movie. I couldn't help but notice a\ncertain choreography to the killing scenes. They weren't over the top\nbloody and were actually very artfully done. The killing scenes were\nmore like complicated dance sequences with a little killing thrown in.\nThis really appealed to the artist in me (or should I say the\nprofessional art student in me). Normally I find gratuitous murder\nappalling, but since they were all bad guys.I'm cutting them some\nslack.<br><br>Keanu Reeves as the Clint Eastwood type, soft spoken bad guy turned\ngood, was well played except for a few awkward moments where you could\nstill catch a glimpse of his \"Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure\" days.\nAdmired his gritty determination and overall portrayal of a man who has\nlost everything that has ever meant anything to him. Thoroughly enjoyed\nthis escape from the mundane which seemed to end way too soon.\n"
"\nAn ex-bad guy against bad guys who went very bad with him: nothing more\nto add about the screenplay of John Wick. The rage and the aim for\nrevenge do not create a real empathy to the viewer. This is all about\nrestless killing, and we're easily led to like the bloody show anyway,\nwhich makes the movie okay. 6/10.\n"
"\nJohn Wick leaves you breathless from the amount of action and killing.\nIf you enjoy simple stories with a lot of guns, killings, and simple\ndialog, this movie is for you.<br><br>These stupid spoiled rich Russian kids unknowingly attack John Wick,\nand start the fuse that leads to massive unbridled mayhem in the city.\nWick is an assassin who cannot be defeated, apparently, since they've\nmade a John Wick 2. But it's not for wont of trying because boy do the\nbad guys through everything at him including the kitchen sink.<br><br>Keanu Reeves does a good job of being stoic, every so often throwing\nout cliché lines as he's killing people non stop. I loved his\ninteraction with his associate Wilem Defoe, which was a highlight of\nthe movie. <br><br>The story is simple. The plot is not complicated. the action is heart\nstopping. If you like these kinds of movies, you won't be disappointed.\nGood luck - be prepared for the ride.\n"
"\nAnother typical adrenaline-fuelled 'revenge flick': lowlife angers\nunstoppable killing machine, carnage follows, secondary subplot\ndevelops, further carnage, lowlife dies, secondary subplots resolved by\nadditional carnage, semi-redemptive ending with unstated promise of a\nsequel  need I say more. The movie would have benefited from little\nmore focus on the 'underworld' motif and a few less exploding SUVs and\ngeneric Russian-mafia corpses-in-waiting. If you like this kind of\nthing in general, you'll really like the movie (hence the relatively\nhigh IMDb score); if you don't, you likely won't make it past the first\ndeath. I fall somewhere in between: I like these kind of movies when\nthere is some substance underlying the style. Unfortunately, there is\nnothing to 'John Wick' beyond endless photogenic but interchangeable\nfight scenes.\n"
"\nThis is a great action movie. The premise is as simple as it is\neffective: John Wick loses everything, and goes on a revenge spree. The\nreason why it works so well, is that the characters and the setting are\nboth very interesting, and the action scenes are very good.<br><br>The movie is set in an almost comic book like world, where there's a\ncommunity of hit men and people in the underworld, with their own set\nof morals and code. They all use certain businesses (or services),\nwhich ties them all together. It's this universe that makes me curious\nfor sequels to John Wick. The characters in this universe are mostly\nquite fun, and a lot of that owes to great casting. The way they\ngradually reveal John Wick's past is interesting, and it leaves you\nwanting to know more about who he once was.<br><br>But, despite all the good things about the movie, it never elevates\nabove its genre.\n"
"\nJohn Wick is the kind of action movies which will remind the action\nfilms fans of the movies in late 80s and early 90s. The action scenes\nwere paced well and entertaining. Also this movie must have definitely\ngiven relief to Keanu Reeves as he delivered a hit after long time\nespecially after the disastrous 47 Ronin. I felt that Michael Nyqvist\nas the main antagonist was cool and at the same time menacing along\nwith other secondary villains. Another best part of the movie was that\nthis film was not dragged like other action films in recent times. <br><br>I am definitely waiting for the sequel which is releasing in 2017 and\nwould hope it would develop into a better franchise. <br><br>John Wick is one such movie that should be seen without any logic and\nwould prove to be entertaining on any weekend.\n"
"\nKeanu Reeves is the John Wick of the title, a grieving one man army who\ngets tipped over the edge when gangsters kill his dog. Carnage ensues.<br><br>The paying public do like a good revenge flick, there have been plenty\nthis last couple of decades, and they do go down well. Once the set-up\nhas been staged - Wick grieves at the loss of his loved one - gets some\nsmall joy via a pet - only to have that snatched away from him, then\nthe film becomes a joyously unstoppable actioner.<br><br>Wick, in good hands with a moody and beefy Reeves (face fuzz strange,\nthough) strong in presence, cuts a swathe through the gangland eastern\nblockers. And that's pretty much it! Characterisations are thin on the\nground, it's a bit nutty and of course preposterous, but boy is it fun.\nThere you go, a box office winning actioner without pretensions. Enjoy.\n7/10\n"
"\nKeanu Reeves plays the Liam Neeson role in this slick, sharp, vicious\nlittle bout of revenge fantasy. With support work from a whole mess of\n\"I know that guys\" and a blow-away effects budget, it's a real riot to\nwatch, not to mention one hell of a tech demo for the masterminds\nbehind the fight scenes. Like those Neeson kill-em-alls, though, it's\nas straight as an arrow and shallower than the kiddie pool. In some\nways, it's refreshing to just dispense with all the stereotypical\norigin trappings and get right into the firefights, but at the end of\nthe show it just feels like one long, easy excuse to watch a whole mess\nof cool stuff without any extra justification. Lust-worthy cars,\nferocious weaponry, powerful western-styled physicality,\nstereo-thumping tunes, magnificent cityscapes, the list just goes on\nand on. Escapists delight, for John Wick has come to deliver a dream.\nCinephiles, well just sit back and try to let the sheer, celebratory\nbrutality beat your conscience into submission. It won't be too\ndifficult.\n"
"\nAahhh, it took me a while to watch this movie, because it looks like\njust another bad action flick, the poster is not helping either. I love\nfilms, from foreign, docs,festival to the Hollywood blockbusters of all\ngenres. I hunt for certain directors, and I do love intellectual films\nor some might call them art flicks. But the genre that I do miss is the\naction trash ( grind house films ) In the glory days of VHS, many films\nwere released only for the VHS market. Many of those are the simple,\ndirty action films, some are bad and some are so bad it's great.\nWell..John Wick reminds me of that. No BS, revenge films.If you are\naware of the Charles Bronson's Death wish, John wick has a similar\nidea. Recently I am very happy with what Liam Neeson does ( Taken 1,2\nand A walk among tombstone )John wick has similar feel . Don't expect\nCannes films or look for holes, this is, like I said a B movie on a\nmainstream market. Great ride, shoot'em up midnight snack ( only if\nthose seedy cinemas still around )\n"
