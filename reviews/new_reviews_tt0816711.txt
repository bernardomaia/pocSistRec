what a waste of money
and i do not only mean for the tickets
the whole production must have been quite expensive
and i guess the taxpayer pays for all scenes where the us navy or airforce shows up
for what
the movie failed on all accounts and didnt even manage to create tension or scare people
the audience even started laughing in certain scenes
uff i really dont know where to start satellite phones that work inside steel vessels emp kills electronics including satellite phones but only hours late they seem to be working again amputations that dont cause the victim to bleed to death kids that are totally cool after losing their families high five
and i could go on and on
by the way the sponsors of the movie must have been duct tape and pepsi
the only creepy feeling i get is that movies like this or the purge play a certain role to prepare society for future apocalyptic events
god bless america
didnt know what to expect when we got this film had read a brief synopsis and it sounded good  plus we like brad pitt
what a rollercoaster of a film
well made full of action pretty scary in parts prepare to scream a couple of times at least good cast and good acting
the story line is interesting and it does make you think how this would affect you in real life what would you do
how would you cope
what about your family
its also set on a global scale with several countries being featured in the film
all of a sudden the world is a very unsafe and unpredictable place
good luck
if you fancy a film that is a little bit different will play on your emotions and make you think twice about stuff then give this a go
this movie was walk out worthy
anyone giving this garbage more than 3 of 10 stars either dont care about ridiculously intelligence insulting plot holes
for example you are in a plane that crashes because a fight broke out with zombies
you happen to be flying over a country you have never been to
you promptly pull yourself together from the plane crash and walk directly to a secret research facility miles away to find the cure
this was supposed to be somewhat smart movie
but ended up being just dumb as jurassic world which never set out to have an intriguing plot or mystery of any kind
i wish i could give this movie a 0
5 of 10
with budget and the source material they had to work with they did worse than i could have imagined
this movie is the walk out worthy category
i was about 30 minutes into world war z when it became glaringly apparent that the filmmakers were going through great lengths to avoid including blood and violence
honestly historically speaking gore has probably been more important to the zombie genre than story which is incredibly weak in this movie anyway
pitt is terribly unconvincing as a stayathome dad that is secretly a badass and apparently way smarter than the worldwide scientific community
if you genuinely like zombie movies you will not like world war z
if you like the book youll be disappointed by this movie
apparently brad pitt is going around saying he wanted this movie to be pg13 so his kids could see it
thats absolutely untrue
this movie is pg13 so they could make a profit
it had an incredibly high budget and they needed it to be more accessible as to recoup that money
make no mistake this is a brad pitt vanity project
i am that kind of guy who either love a movie or hate a movie
so my ratings usually are 1  10 or 9  10 or the rare occasion 10  10 the perfect movie this movie i didnt like
the main problem is that it has no character buildup
after 5 minutes after we meet the characters the action starts
by now i dont even know the name of any of them and i couldnt care if any of them died
sadly we are in the beginning introduced to a very interesting character but sadly he is killed off as the moment we start to like him
many scenes drag on for way too long and i found the movie more comical than scary
me and many others in the cinema laughed of how silly and stupid the zombies acted
also many of the scenes drag on way too long and you start to wonder what the director was thinking
the ending is one of the worst ending of any movie i have ever seen
it felt like the whole thing was pointless and it left zero impact
a good movie is a movie you can see endless times
this movie i will only see once
another zombie movie and this one is clearly the worst
i could not believe what i was watching
im surprised that brad pitt would actually appear in the movie
the zombies did a bit with their teeth very similar to what curly of the three stooges did and many in the audience started to laugh including myself
when the zombies started their contortions with their body at least six patrons or more started to howl with laughter
this group of movies companies that put together 125 million dollars to make this rubbish will not be laughing all the way to the bank but most of us watching this garbage will be laughing all the way to the coffee shops and bars
in short his movie is a total disaster
it doesnt have a beginning it doesnt have an ending it doesnt have any good acting except daniella it doesnt have anything good
the plot is idiotic actors are awful brad is disappointing
i dont know whats wrong with brad but this is not ok
he has proved in 90s se7en sleepers snatch fight club
that his is one of the best actors ever but in last 10 or so years he has wasted his talent on stupid and boring films
if there were no brad pitt in this movie it wouldnt get over 23 but because of brad pitt it has 7
4 and that shows how people think
tragic
a very disappointing film that i wanted to be good
it reminded me of the film outbreak which starred dustin hoffman
in that film people were infected with an ebola type virus in this one they were turned into zombies in about 12 seconds of being bitten  go figure
the film was dark and basically a glorified walking dead b movie  yawn
has brad pitt hit rock bottom
i thought that with a big hollywood star and probably a huge budget the film would have originality and a great storyline
how wrong can you be
worst of all the one place where they had managed to avoid the world wide plague was jerusalem until of course brad arrives and then it all went pear shaped
the zombified people were more funny than frightening and i began to wonder if it was meant to be a comedy
this is what the powers that be the council of 13 the people that actually rule this world and who own everything including the entertainment industry want
they live their wishes their desires and their fantasies out in the movies
they would love to cull 80 to 90 of the human population and then chip the rest so they can live on a prison planet
its said in the move mother nature is a serial killer thats rich
the elite are the serial killers spreading viruses worldwide and putting disease into vaccinesand they want to blame it on mother nature
friggin satanists

seeing some people here giving this movie bad reviews and low rate i must say i totally disagree
i thought this movie was good and very well done
the action starts right away and never stops and i was very curious all the time where all that happens in the movie would eventually lead and how the people in it would solve the huge problem they are up against
all in all i thought this was a well made well written well acted and intelligent film in many ways given that it is of course a zombie movie and of course that requires the viewer to have tolerance towards the adventure
but it caught my attention from the very beginning and i would recommend it to anyone who likes fast movies and tension
i would have expected more from a movie with brad pitt in it
if you have a thirst for zombie movies you might love this but it was just so tedious
it starts off with a bang with everyone trying to escape and wondering what is suddenly going wrong but its all downhill from there with zombies constantly appearing and reappearing
brad is wonderful as a loving husband and father but thats as wonderful as he gets
if youve seen the trailer youve seen the entire movie
so predictable and absolutely ridiculous finale with the handsome hunk saving the day and thereby saving the whole world
if i never see another zombie movie it will be too soon
when will hollywood realize that they do not need to fiddle meddle or otherwise mutilate a story to make a movie
the book is a masterpiece of sociopolitical commentary showing how politics and big business allowed the plague to become a worldwide catastrophe
instead we are treated to how politics and big business mutilated this story and mutated it into yet another generic action movie
instead of following a reporter around the globe ten years after the war as he gathers stories from those who fought and survived we end up following one man on his quest to be reunited with his family
for those who have not read the book do so
the pity is that brad pitt had a working script written by j
michael straczinski that he used in order to get the project greenlit
instead he tossed that script and used his own
awful film and a big disappointment
you need a special talent to waste so many resources and dollars and create such a boring film
its even more upseting when you know that many films have been made on this zombie theme before and if you want to be creative or original one would expect a new angle on this subject
but no
same screaming actors playing flat zombie characters
also the main character development is flat and cliche the plot line is predictable and the ending is poor
special effects are ok nothing more
i cant see any reason why a good actor like brad pitt a waste of two hours agreed to star in this movie money is not a good enough reason in this case
also the reproduction of the locations jerusalem for instance is full of errors and unreliable
with such a big budget the producers should have made a bigger effort if they respect the viewers
go have a drink with friends instead
okay this movie didnt get amazing reviews but it is an amazing movie the movie had an interesting story was a little scary and never had a dull moment the action had already started within ten minutes of the film one of the things i love about this movie is that they make you think that you know whats going to happen next but you will always be surprised
this movie is extremely under rated if you are a fan of the genre you are guaranteed to like it and if you arent like me you can still enjoy iti am glad i saw this movie i was not let down in anyway it was a good use of 2 hours i hope a sequel is made and based on the ending there probably will be
no other way around three quarters really good a quarter of crap
short said at the latest when mr
bleibtreu appears its time to to leave the cinema
it seems that the film crew was suddenly out of money the end of the movie is not playing in the whole world with colossal monumental recordings full of cgizombietsunamies but only with a handful of fairly creepy made folks within an office building the excessive and unintentionally funny often repeated chatter with the teeth as it would be a really strange adhesive cream commercial with the scenes of a finally adjusted to the appropriate audience extreme geronto crime scene on sunday night
i think this addition to the zombie film genre is great has a better feel to it than some previous ones
very loosely based on the book the storyline provided is well enough and i found myself sincerely caring for them all and routing for pitts character and bravery to protect his own
from the trailers i have expected a sloppy looking graphically created zombies flooding about in the masses
it gave a vulnerable feel to the main characters and that you cant necessarily guarantee a getaway when their faster than a marathon runner
the ending and resolve left one with hope as it was intended in the story as a whole
i will definitely purchase it when it comes out
and sometimes its okay to have a zombie flick and have it not be all about the gore which i am pleased to see that this movie did not spend a whole lot of time doing
recommended
i like brad pitt hes done some amazing movies
i was surprised he agreed to bring his name to such a poor production
i am always looking forward to all kind sf apocalyptic pictures and i was dragged by the trailers to see this one
the movies has some amazing shots specially the epic scenes of zombies invasions but that would be it
i would recommend it for a rental for those hardcore fans who find pleasure in tinny details
as a whole the script is poor and in many occasions the lack of logic simple stupidity or naivety irritates
pitt is on a highest importance mission in corea while his life and of his teammates is put in jeopardy by a phonecall of his bored and longing wife
lol
pitt injects himself a random virus which happens to be the one that works as a  camouflage cure
israel happened to foresee the coming apocalypse and built a wall because their intelligence intercepted chatter about  zombie while the rest of the world just awaited their doom
etc there is a ton of it
a real waste of time
i knew nothing about the storyline lest the trailers
i thought the best part of the film was the soundtrack
really weak script and again who thinks that handheld shaky camera is engaging and exciting
blur blur blur
lead couple was terribly miscast
definitely like my zombies slow and scary
there was such a major difference in the look and reaction time from group zombie cgi to small cluster zombie real actors
real waste of money and talent
based on some of the reviews it should have been more like the book
the soaring shots of the planes and helicopters was nice to watch
even epic
as the reviews touted
but the film was anything but
world war z is fast paced well acted with an interesting story
if a out break happened we would have trouble
i love how we study for the weakness and strengths of a virus
the 9 out of 10 people theory where we go with 10th person outlandish idea is a great theme
the movie is a mix of war of the worlds meets cognition
the problem with world war z is the ending
there is no explanation of why
there is no explanation of how to solve the problem
the ending left the viewer empty
the movie could be gearing up for part 2
brad pitt does another outstanding role
he seems to have left his outrageous weird roles like fight club and true romance
his new genre seems to be action family and playing the hero
i give world war z a seven out 10
i wont give this film a ten mainly because i saw it in 3d which costs more this film did not need to be in 3d didnt mind the 3d it just wouldve been just as good without it
brad pitts character is believable and appealing
the film is fastpaced and fun from beginning to end theres tension and excitement throughout
i personally love zombie flicks even the direct to video lot
movies where the viewer cant even begin to imagine the horror lend an excitement thats only available in modern zombie horror in my humble opinion
world war z also has its share of predictable moments but without giving anything away you will still enjoy the film
i am not really saying much with this review only to say that if you like zombie you will truly dig world war z
choosing fast and crazy zombies over slow and predictable ones give a bunch of raw pleasure to world war z
besides the ambient savagery the movie stands as a classic some escapes some panic some infiltration and some investigation
nothing new though the burlesque of the solution has its merits
710
another huge fan of the book wondering what the hell i just watched
why does hollywood even bother buying the rights to other media if there just going to utterly destroy it
why not just make an original film
is really so bankrupt of all ideas
the film has a un employee brad pitt travel around the world to various action set pieces for pretty much no reason only to survive a series of increasing unlikely close shaves
until near the end he and his one handed companion walk out of a devastating plane crash with a minor wound
no else survived of course
for once the mean streets of cardiff prove less dangerous than zombies as they make their way to the wizard castle to find a magical cure or something
its a science fiction horror film is a story of brainless and dead people who are taking control over world
the movie is full of amazing and horrifying scene
pitt conducts himself manfully throughout the proceedings  he is never less than believable while facing off against this pandemic  but if i never see another zombie in the movies i will not feel deprived
as compelling as pitt is at reflecting the worlds pain through lanes eyes the movie treats him too often as if he truly is the only one with loved ones to lose or a world to save
i have now started finding better movies through www
flickstree
com
it not only suggests great movies to watchit also tells where you can watch the movie online
highly recommended
1
shaky cam 2
people saying first names over and over and over
3
father exists only to make pancakes for his kids daughters grill him about it
4
family only exists to try to sell this as a family movie women are totally and realistically worthless in an emergency
5
brad pitt has a problem with a cop a random black man comes by to ask him how hes doing
6
cops clearly dont care about humanity and dont help in emergencies
7
lots of phony high pitched screams to go with shaky cam
8
5 seconds into the zombie apocalypse white criminal stereotypes are raping people in public
9
brad pitt looks like a burnt out hippy and often has his mouth hanging open
10
quite possibly the least scary zombies ive ever seen
11
hispanics who look and sound illegal save the white brad pitt family and instantly are asked if they want food to eat
12 anchor baby of illegals saves brad pitt again out of nowhere cause little boys all know how to use hand guns
13 rotten wife tells him to go talk somewhere else but its ok cause she is smiling
firstly i love a good zombie film and im also an admirer of brad pitts work so when i heard that a big budget a lister zombie movie was being made based on a cracking book i was a tad excited to say the least
world war z is a good film
the action zips along decent plot excellent acting by all concerned some very tense moments and a couple of jump scares along the way
if im nitpicking which i am i got to say truthfully i dont like the cgi created zombies at all and there needs to be more gore
a sequel is in the works apparently which i look forward too and i hope they can correct these minor problems with the first one and create a truly big budget classic zombie movie indeed
like any other zombiemovie but a lot less excitementbuildup
i could stand about half of the movie until i turned it off again
so im aware my rating might in some peoples opinions not be justified since i didnt see it all through
but wow this was truly bland and felt pointless to the point i gave up which i should add happens in very rare cases
rly looked forward to this considering the hype around it and the amount of money put into advertising it but
nah this was like any other zombiemovie with no unique twist and very predictable
so all in all not recommended even giving a shot unless you want to see the same movie as the other 611 000 zombiemovies out there
i thought that the team will be able to feel and recognize the essence of this great work and offer us a different but yet equally exciting and frightening story
in this segment the story of the movie is very predictable
we know already exactly in advance that wherever pitt lands there will be in a few seconds a thousand billion zombies and explosions
what i found unbelievable in the film is that forster decided to take out a few key moments
i recommend world war z to all those who have not read the novel and to the book lovers i suggest that they should skip the movie
even though this is an exciting and dynamic movie and actually has several moments that raise a lot of adrenaline in the blood
rarely have we seen zombie films work in the process of the film
and rarely do pg13 zombie films work
the audience are rarely given a chance to focus on what has just happened or to absorb key plot points
instead we jump from one scene to another
coherence is lost
impact is lost
someone must have left scenes on the cutting room floor
in one scene a character with key information is quickly dismissed from the film in a manner that was underwhelming and farcical
at this point i did a double take looked around the cinema to see if anyone else was as bemused and carried on watching
the confused frown never fully left my face
of the few strengths in the film one must highlight marco beltramis score that bounds behind the opening credits
not a terrible movie fairly average
some of the computergenerated effects were somewhat impressive like the armies of zombies climbing over one another like ants
brad pitt has his certain charisma and star power but they seemed to be minimizing that throughout
they gave almost nothing for mireille enos to do
shes from my home town
daniella kertesz seemed to play the most interesting character the israeli soldier who travels with pitts character
all of the bigbudget stuff is here the cinematography the effects the rewritten ending after being shown to test audiences
i am fairly glad that i didnt waste theatertype money to see it
but its okay
brad pitt has become more than just a pretty boy
he can involve you so you care what happens to him
thats what saved this movie from being just another zombie walking flick
the writing was pretty mediocre from so many standpoints
the opening scenes are good except it certainly takes brad and family long to run
if everyone is running away from something is that not a good time to start running also as opposed to dawdling around waiting to interview someone
but it was scary
the scene in jerusalem was very well done even if obviously cgied
who knew zombies could swarm and plan like bees
the plane scene is good also
the bicycles to the military plane seem stupid
and the chase down the who hallways seems ludicrous
they sent murielle to nova scotia
oh no
not nova scotia
that seemed lame
its worth the watch but no classic
but the film has its moments
i gave it an eightten only because of djuricko
rather than that the movie is too much similar to i am legend
it it really interesting but zombies are exactly the same in the already mentioned movie
i would recommend people to watch it but only if they dont have anything else to do in their boring lives
world war z is a great name i can say that someone did make his imagination go
brad pitt acting wasnt bad im not saying that but it is not too hard to act in a movie like this it is too amateurish
there was no plot at all everything starts too early and the end is already seen by the viewers even before the 30th minute of the movie
all in all nothing special if you want to watch a movie where a person needs to think to get the puzzles together skip this one this is too obvious
overall it was a good film but what happened in the last thirdquarter
looked empty and rushed
reverted back to type in this section
slow mindless zombies well i say zombies but what was with the click clicking chattering teeth doctor
looked a bit daft to say the least
ive read the book but apart from the title in common
i did learn something from this film as well as the vastly poorer zombies movies being released en masse it seems
zombies in films have had their day
too much competition from vampires werewolves ghosts and scarier stuff now
mind you fast at least human fast zombies that can think plan communicate with each other and use weaponry might take it up a level with the usual hunger for human flesh and needing a head injury to rekill them might work
think terminator but zombies not cyborgs hard to destroy and can shoot back
just a thought
try to teach you how to survive in this horrible situation on world when i heard announcement of this movie
i expected more like aliens and giant robots in this world war z title
but what is that
too much zombie movies now my 5 years old brother going to believe zombies is real
im pretty sure that brat pitt looks like a uncle thor
dead soldier scene was horrible we if you including hollywood star like brat pitt on your movie you should screen play something real
not a waste of time for me just cut that scene and make it 90min movie easy exiting simple not boring to watch
when i see this movie in theater first 30 minute was exiting next 30 min goes funny last 30 min i just talk with my friends how fake and funny that uncle thor looks on this film
expecting more but too boring
brad pitt mireille enos daniella kertesz matthew fox and david morse star in this 2013 scifi thriller based on the novel
this begins in philadelphia with former united nations investigator gerry lane pitt driving with his wife karin enos and their 2 daughters
soon they get into an accident and discover that a lethal virus is infecting people into hungry zombies
among the panic gerry gets his family to a secure location and is asked to help find the source of the epidemic spreading across the world
kertesz plays israeli soldier segan fox party of friends plays a parajumper and morse contact plays an excia agent
this isnt bad but couldve been better and pitt is good in it
so i had heard some seriously mixed reviews about this which meant i didnt go see it at the movies
the other day i finally watched it and to be honest i was fairly impressed
my boyfriend disliked it and i can understand why if that makes sense
it had a good plot and in my eyes could be pretty realistic as far as zombie movies go and movie landbrad wasnt over ally skilled which made me think a bit more real life there
it just lacked in execution
possibly would of worked more on that story and would of recast some of the people
i felt some of the scenes were empty and didnt need to be there but all in all i thought it was decent
i think people should see it for themselves because as far as i can tell people either liked or hated this movie
there is not a single thing i like about this zombie flick at all cause its not entirely based on the book and the book had more then just one story unlike this film
this is a film that i would not recommend to anyone
i mean the ending to this film is terrible
all it did was show brad pitts character and his family in a boat somewhere on the west coast or the east coast and it had no meaning at all
also the zombies in this movie reminded me of all those zombies in the video game left 4 dead for the xbox 360
i mean if youre gonna make a film based on a novel at least make it mostly based on the plot of the novel
this is definitely one of the worst films ive ever seen in my life
this film shouldve been scratched
this movie left me asking myself why
right from the beginning when brad pitt was stuck in traffic why did he floor it and drive like a maniac until he wrecked his car
when he and his family were headed to the rooftop why did he suddenly shut the door behind them and trap himself with the zombies
when he was in jerusalem why did the girl standing in line have a microphone that was hooked up to all of the loudspeakers
when he was running to the car why did his driver look directly at him and then speed away
why did his plane crash within walking distance of the exact place he was headed
why did the doctors at the who tie him down and interrogate him like he was a criminal
why did he very carefully leave his only weapon outside of the lab where the zombies were roaming
and finally why did an a list star like brad pitt agree to do such a terribly written movie
45 a big budget globe trotting zombie horroraction movie that feels very much like cut scenes from a video game glued together
the biggest issue here though is the characterisation as the movie unfolds we learn next to nothing about every single person in the entire movie
mr brad pitt is a married man with kids and a job with the un and that is pretty much all we ever learn about his character apart from him being more than able to smash open zombies heads with a heavy metal bar and he is in almost 100 of the movie
overall though it is a decent fast zombie movie if thats all you want but its nothing more besides
if im honest was not expecting much from this film but how wrong i was
im a great fan of zombie films and was not disappointed with this one the action scenes were intense and plenty the zombies themselves were also different to any i have seen before they were fast strong aggressive and slightly intelligent
it makes a change to see a zombie flick thats does not entirely center on one area or a group of survivors in this film u saw the world dealing with it and how one man risked his life to find answers
my advice watch this film because in my opinion it could be the start of a new zombie film wave hopefully dont compare this movie to others like dawn and land or even diaries of the dead
it is a whole new outlook on living dead films and i hope to see more like it
i saw the trailer hoping for an adrenaline filled pumped zombie movie however world war z wasnt quite as pumped and adrenaline filled as i had hoped
instead world war z had disappointed me because it was marketed as a pumped zombie thriller but id saw overall there was more action in the trailer than in the whole movie
it just seemed like any other zombie thriller out there and in no way compares to 28 days laterin my opinion best zombie classic which if your looking for a good zombie movie i strongly recommend over world war z
to me it was just another zombie flick and didnt really have anything special to remember
some of the acting is okay and some is excellenthowever i think it lacked originality
i would overall recommend you watch 28 days later before and then watch this movie
its not anywhere comparable to the zombie movie classics such as night of the living deadzombielandzombi 2 and dead alive
this is a great thriller filled with impressive visual effects and intense suspense
the set design of this film felt grandeur and spectacular which i felt was great but it inhibited some much needed emotional human moments
something this film had plenty of were jump scares which can only be seen as effective in a zombie movie
i did like the realistic tone that was present throughout making me believe that a zombie outbreak could really happen
unlike i am legend i thought the way world war z solved this global catastrophe was believable and eye opening
of course the star of world war z is brad pitt and he does a great job in my opinion portraying the character
my real problem is with the actual character itself
it seems as if this guy is invincible and can overcome any obstacle that comes in his way
i didnt read the book so im not sure if thats how the character is written but it did draw me out of the movie at times
the ending felt very rushed which did affect my grade of the movie however this is a solid film with more style than substance
im not really into zombie movies and tv shows but i actually enjoyed this one
brad pitt was his usual gutsy self being the tough guy making the tough decisions
the movie wasnt real cheesy considering the zombie theme
it had good action suspense and kept you on the edge of your seat
it actually half seems like it could happen in real life but not quite on the large scale it did in this movie or as fast
what ever happened to the parents of the mexican boy
they never really addressed that
is it just me or were the zombies exceptionally fast and strong
they were running like twice as fast as everyone else
that makes it even more terrifying
im not understanding some of the lackluster reviews here but i respect that everyones entitled to their opinions
i havent read the book yet so ill preface my review with that
ive seen both the rated and unrated cuts of this film both are very good
this movie is riveting from start to finish
no filler just action
much like movies such as cloverfield and 28 weeks later28 days later youll feel like youre in the movie experiencing it as one of the characters
it moves so well it feels like it flies by but in a good way
i recommend it
the acting is good too
cinematography is epic and special effects are above average
well worth a watch by all genre fans or not
decent zombie flick
i would have to say it would be third on my list of zombie films to see with the walking dead on top and 28 days later in second
im a little bit of a science nerd and didnt feel that the ending was very plausible but hey its science fiction and there are no zombies yet so i guess anything is possible in a movie of this type
the reason i compare it to contagion is because of the world wide factor
not many zombie films try to focus on the world wide epidemic and instead only focus on a select group or team and there endeavors to further the plot
i like the fact that this film wraps everything up in the end
it doesnt leave much to the imagination but i like not having to over think things sometimes
overall it was worth seeing at least once
i dont feel that i would get much pleasure in watching it again but it was a nice change up in the common zombie movie plot
this is a movie where you say i spent 2 hours but i dont say want them back
it was really enjoyable and the zombies where amazing i mean in the acting
they were realistic and the sounds were really good not incredible but still great
i strongly recommend that movie for the family
i know it has horror and stuff but its great with company
also the action scenes where amazing because there where great physics
by telling physics i meant the zombies how they falldie and stuff
also really fast start of the action
the action starts within minutes from the start of the movie and that makes the movie more exciting and more viewable
i mean there so little times that you will say the word bored
this film is billed as a zombie apocalypse film and it succeeds in being exactly that which is the reason i like it so much
brad pitt is hit with this zombie apocalypse that has taken over the whole world and he has to attempt to find a vaccine to stop this apocalypse
his performance is great and he is the main guy that you have to care about because the film doesnt really focus on anybody else
his family and partners in the film are okay but you dont really care what happens to them throughout the film
the best part of this film is of course the zombies these flesh eating creatures move faster then traditional zombies
some of the crazy shots with the zombies are breathtaking and the film never really gets better after these encounters
this films climax is tense without really any violence and that is the key for this film and is so tense to watch
this isnt going to win any oscars but it is a fun zombie film that i enjoyed a lot
