"\nWhat an innovative film!<br><br>Contrary to one of the reviews which canned everything about the movie\nfrom the plot to the actors' singing voices to camera angles (by\nsomeone who, to me, is obviously not familiar with the live theater\nproductions of this musical nor it appears the he has ever been to\nany), I find this movie version is a a state-of-the-art capture of one\nthe world's great musicals for the cinema screens!<br><br>The live singing is superb, showing the fragility (and flaws) of every\nperformer ... and that's what a live-performance is all about! This\nmovie captured a live theater production on screen for all cinema goers\nwho never had the chance to enjoy a live theater production!<br><br>Kudos to everyone involved! A must-see for all! And a must-buy for\nthose who wish to have a copy of this masterpiece for a keepsake!\n"
"\nAs a fan of the musical, I had not to be disappointed with this\nadaptation and I wasn't! I had the opportunity of watching it at the\npremiere in Leicester Square in London, with all the huge actors, the\ndirector, musical creator's, etc. <br><br>It was really exciting, the actors sing better than I expected, and all\nthe photography added to the musical perfectly complete it for an\nunforgettable experience. <br><br>I can't tell anything bad. Anne Hathaway is very good, as well as Sacha\nBaron Cohen or Hugh Jackman. The musical is fantastic. The movie:\nterrific!\n"
"\nTo be fair to this steaming pile of crap of a movie, i have not seen\nthe musical.<br><br>Even if this movie is based on a musical it should have enough\ninteresting aspects about it to stand on its own. Saying 'you just\ndidn't watch the musical that's why you don't like it' shouldn't be\nused as an excuse. <br><br>The camera work was just awful. I don't want to see anymore close ups\nof Russell Crowe's face. The story was waaaay too slow moving and for\nsome reason everyone had a British accent?<br><br>This is the first time in my life I walked out of the theatre on a\nmovie. I couldn't take the awful singing anymore.<br><br>Save your money and torrent this one!\n"
"\nI must be getting old &amp; cynical or both. I saw the actors listed and\nthought this has to be a great movie. It wasn't. I couldn't endure more\nthan 30 minutes, so perhaps it got better after I left. (I doubt it). I\nlove a good musical. I also like it to have some dialogue mixed in as\nwell. When I realised the whole movie was going to be sung I started to\ncringe, no amount of delicious hot popcorn and gallons of coke was\ngoing to keep me stuck in the seat. It's the WORST movie I have seen in\na long long time and I have seen some shockers lately (WRONG as an\nexample). As I said in the header, Les Miserable is exactly how I felt\nwhen I walked out of the cinema after spending good money on utter\nrubbish. After I walked out I noticed many others quietly exiting the\ncinema.\n"
"\nAmazing.... Les Misérables is a powerful story of redemption, grace and\nlove. I recommend the book (abridged... Hugo does go on) as well as the\n1998 version (Liam Neeson is a great Valjean). I could not say enough\ngood things about this production. The performers were excellent, the\nsets and effects were great and the direction kept things moving. If\nthis were on the stage Anne Hathaway's 'I Dreamed a Dream' would have\nstopped the show... I wanted to stand a cheer. Hugh Jackman deftly\nguided us through Valjeans anger, anguish, despair, love and honor. Tom\nHoopers decision to have the actors sing on set instead of miming a\nrecording made the experience more emotional.\n"
"\nWow! - Les Misérables is seriously Outstanding! Seriously Amazing! If\nthis doesn't win a \"Best Picture Oscar\" - Nothing should!! Hugh Jackman\n- Oscar!!! (he made me cry!) Anne Hathaway - Oscar!! (shemade me cry!)\nSamantha Barks - Oscar!! (she made me cry!) Eddie Redmayne - Oscar!!\n(he made me cry!) ...and then we move onto Russell Crowe - if only they\nhad enough time to re-shoot / edit out / destroy all existence of him\never being near this movie! (he Didn't make me...think he could act or\nsing!) The entire movie is non-stop and with them singing live while\nfilming you can really feel the authenticity of their singing! When\nthey move into some of the big \"torch\" song - you just want to give a\nstanding ovation!\n"
"\nOK, so I just recently watched this movie and I must say I'm in love!\nIt really irritates me that people are complaining that every word was\nsung.....its called opera. This wasn't a musical; this was meant to be\nsung 100% of the time.<br><br>Also I liked that not everyone was a class A singer. These are supposed\nto be real people with real issues (somewhat extreme but nevertheless).\nWhile it was difficult at times to understand Russell Crowe I commend\nhim for taking on a role that he has not been trained for. Hugh Jackman\nwas outstanding which makes sense given that he has performed on\nBroadway in the past. Anne Hathaway destroyed me in the final scene!\nShe was brilliant, heart-retching and devastating all at once! While I\ndon't know if someone who is too dense to understand what opera is will\nenjoy this movie; I think it's wonderfully done in all aspects. This\nmovie may not be for everyone but for those who can look into the soul\nof this story will not be disappointed.\n"
"\nI actually loved Phantom of the Opera, watched it 3 times. Thought I'd\ngive this one a chance. After 45 minutes I shut it off. Ann Hathaway\nwas just awful and Hugh Jackman wasn't any better. I never gave Crow a\nchance to see if he was any better. BORING- BORING. Glad I didn't waste\nmy time and money to see it in the theater. There was way to MUCH\nsinging, would have been better if at least half of it were just\ntalking. Phantom was also singing when the time was right, but there\nwas half of it just speaking too. If you want to watch the story, and\nit really is a good story, watch the one with Liam Neison and Jeffery\nRush, excellent movie!\n"
"\n\"Les Miserables\" is a great musical.<br><br>Don't waste anymore time. Give every Best Supporting Actress Award this\nyear to Anne Hathaway. <br><br>It's not light and fluffy like Mary Poppins; it deals with an extremely\ndark and difficult time in human history. It's a bit long and uneven at\ntimes.<br><br>If all singing is not your thing you may have trouble with this. Hugh\nJackman can act and sing. Russel Crowe gives it a good shot. So what if\nCrowe sings in front of a bird statue, it's not a crow. Songs are\nspread out to the supporting cast and they all deliver.<br><br>It's an extremely powerful movie that evokes emotion. If you don't want\nto cry don't go. If you go and don't cry you have no heart. If you want\nto be amazed by the power of a movie spend two and a half hours with\nthis outstanding cinematic achievement.\n"
"\nIf you have a modicum of intelligence, avoid Les Mis. It truly is\nmiserable. This movie is the worst movie I have seen in a very long\ntime. Russell Crowe is dreadful and can not sing a note. Not since\nPierce Brosnan pierced our ears in Mama Mia has an actor been so badly\ncast. From the opening scene when the dote appears you know this is\ngoing to be a dog of a film. And that's where is remains for the entire\nepic.There is a reason his band is a total failure; and Hugh Jackman\nand Anne Hathaway are not much better. This miserable piece of garbage\ndrones on for over 2.5 hours and I resented every moment. DO NOT SEE\nIT. EVER. If it gets any awards at the Oscars I may never watch them\nagain.\n"
"\nTruly awful, poorly paced, film adaptation of a musical. Bad direction,\ncinematography, sets, costumes. The miniatures of Paris looked\nhorrible. The sets looked cheap. No wonder the entire thing was shot in\na series of nauseating close-ups. I like Hugh Jackman but If this is\nthe performance of a lifetime he may need a couple more lifetimes to\nmake up for it. He suffered from frame one to the dismal end and so did\nthe audience. Worse was Russell Crowe who managed to look constipated\nfor the entire film. And newsflash: He can't sing! Anne Hathaway can\nsing but she can't act. Why did they bother hiring Helena Bonham Carter\nand Sacha Baron Cohen? They did nothing but mug in ugly costumes and\nwigs. Maybe the director thought it was a remake of Sweeney Todd? Three\nperfumers stood out: Eddie Redmayne as Marius, Samantha Barks as\nEponine and Amanda Seyfried as Cosette. Poor Amanda Seyfried. She is\nthe best part of two of the worst musicals of all time - this one and\nMama Mia!\n"
"\nI watched this movie three nights ago and I'm generally never a big fan\nof musicals however considering reading many positive reviews about\nthis movie, I decided to give it a try and was hoping that it could\nchange my perspective. It unfortunately was very disappointing and\nafter almost three hours of singing, I had enough. These songs were\ndone by actors who clearly did not have any experience and training in\nsinging. Even simple dialogues were in songs which were very irritating\nconsidering the fact that the writer had obviously aimed for a 100%\nmusical without any normal dialogue. It seems like a cheaply made movie\nconsisting mostly of only a few stages which is repeated throughout the\nwhole movie. The first scene was very eye-catching which seemed to have\nbeen designed to prevent further disappointment. Even though the\ntheatre had assigned the largest screen to this movie but it never\nreally helped to drive my enthusiasm. The settings were always too dark\nand depressing. I do not recommend this movie to anyone.\n"
"\nTo be honest i only started watching this movie because it had the\nGladiator and Wolverine. I usually don't like musical movies much. But\nright now after watching the movie the goosebumps are slowly fading\naway. What a great movie and such AMAZING acting.<br><br>Actors that i didn't really know much about such as Anne Hathaway,\nEddie Redmayne, Samantha Barks and Isabelle Allen really moved me.<br><br>I was pleasantly surprised by Sacha Baron Cohen. He can do so much more\nthan his silly movies (which i do enjoy).<br><br>But the hero of this movie is Hugh Jackman. To me after this movie he\nbecame one of the greatest actors. His eyes, face and voice so full of\nemotion. I love him in his action movies but in Les Mis he really\nentered my heart.\n"
"\nThis film is stunning! As one who cried through most of the stage show,\nI wondered if this would have the same effect. It did! Anne Hathaway's\n'I Dreamed a Dream' is heartbreaking, she did it beautifully, and Hugh\nJackman's voice is fabulous. Amanda Seyfried has the sweetest, purest\nvoice and Eddie Redmayne played a dashing Marius. People had mentioned\nin reviews that the camera work was a little odd but I thought it\nconveyed the feeling of being on the stage, where we tend to look\ndirectly at the person singing, so I had no problem with it at all. The\nweakest link, for me, was Mr Crowe whose voice was poor next to the\nothers. Had he not been alongside so many fantastically strong singers\nit may not have been so noticeable but, sadly, he fell a little flat in\ncomparison. This is my first review as I felt so strongly about it I\njust HAD to write one! GO AND SEE IT! IT'S AMAZING!\n"
"\nI have never read or seen Les Mis before, but now understand it's\nendurance on Broadway and as a classic piece of literature. This movie\nis more of an experience than a \"movie\" and my teen daughter and I left\nwith much to discuss. Anne Hathaway's performance and singing were\nbreathtaking and I still get teary just thinking about it. The entire\ncast deserve Academy Awards in my book-every character was believable,\nand created a simply breathtaking performance. It is simply not\npossible to gush enough. Bring your Kleenex and prepare to be blown\naway. The only problem both my daughter and I noticed (which was very\nminor) were the English accents displayed-french revolution should\nequal french accents, non? M'ais oui!\n"
"\nAs someone who have seen the original musical's China premier years ago\nand US tour in Chicago this year, Les Misérables movie is a complete\ndisappointment. It's such a disgrace to the original musical. The\nsinging is completely amateur and shitty, sometimes even laughable.\nThey are not even likely to enter the audition in normal situation. I\ngave the movie 1 star. And for those who liked it, it is no more than a\nhigh school mock-up play of King Lear. The true masterpiece is yet to\nbe seen. I saw people applauding at the end of the movie for a couple\nof seconds. At the end of the musical, everyone stood up and applauded\nfor minutes. It is my favorite musical and sorry for being sarcastic\nbut this movie really didn't live up to it.\n"
"\nAfter reviewing a number of the other reviews here, it is clear that I\njust didn't get it. The 'sung- through' style of 'singing' any dialog\nbetween the characters was, uh, agonizing to sit through. Of the main\ncharacters only Hathaway and Seyfried could hold a note; Jackman and\nCrowe should really, and I mean really, never appear in a musical\nagain. Another disconcerting thing was the character Gavroche, the\nlittle urchin kid, who spoke and sang with an extreme English Cockney\naccent. Really? If they needed a kid with an accent are you telling me\nthat the producers couldn't find a kid, any kid, with an accent similar\nto the other actors/actresses in the film, or, hell, maybe a French\naccent?? Just sayin'.<br><br>I knew I was out of synch with my feelings about the film when entering\nthe bathroom before leaving the theater I heard the gentleman in the\nnext stall whistling the man theme song. It was apparently a profound\nmovie experience for him.\n"
"\nDon't get me wrong: I do like musicals. But I only like musicals that\nhave real music in them with songs that have something to do them.\nMusicals I do like for example are The Sound of Music, Oklahoma and\nWest Side Story. They all have something this movie didn't - good\nsongs. In this movie, the music was so terrible it ruined the movie. It\nwould have been a half way decent movie if they eliminated the songs\naltogether and the actors just delivered their dialog without the\nsinging the dialog to what I can only describe as droning the words.\nThe lesson is this: If you don't have good songs and people like Rogers\nand Hammerstein with the wonderful ability to write good songs, don't\neven try to make a musical. I turned it off after a half hour. Victor\nHugo's Les Miserables is a wonderful story. Too bad they chose to ruin\nit.\n"
"\n8 Oscar nominations n' 3 Golden Globe grabbed this year.<br><br>Yes it is Musical Drama! Yet phonemically keeps hooked to seat! This\nglory written by Claude-Michel Schonberg,Alain Boublil.. more........\nand directed by Tom Hooper and very epically casted by none other than\nour well known hunk Mr. Wolverine i.e. Huge Jackman. and He is\ncharacteristically challenged by none other than Academy award winner\nn' a really beautiful mind Mr. Russel Crowe in drama.<br><br>Huge takes you to the zenith of versatility in his character and Russel\nkeeps you bounded while he appears on screen.

Director Tom adeptly concluded his business.<br><br>Go for it if you really ardent for Art n' more necessarily please be\npatience for digestion of this great food surely it will compensate you\nhunger.<br><br>---- Shrikant\n"
"\nOf films most recently seen leading up to the Oscars, this one leaves\nme breathless, wound up, crying, laughing and in short totally wrapped\nup the incredible long length of its run.<br><br>I believe this film will go into the history of cinema as a phenomenal\ntalent &amp; range of each actor's artistry in singing, acting, comedic\ntiming to compel laughter, tears, anger -- basically the whole spectrum\nof human emotion -- and infused into the story by each.<br><br>Even for those \"not into musicals\", be assured, you'll walk away from\nthis one mesmerized and touched in every emotional string..over and\nover again throughout each scene.\n"
"\none of the best musicals i've seen...Anne Heatherway is truly amazing\nactress &amp; singing I dreamed a dream made me shed some tears...her\nsinging is beautiful &amp; she acted the part vert well..was very impressed\nwith the other characters as well...very surprised at Russell Crows\nsinging...who would of thought this man could sing?! Helena Bowen\ncarter was amazing/funny as well as Sacha Baron Cohan...laughed/cried\ndurning this musical...I would watch this again!!!!!! also made me feel\nfor the charters &amp; at times had a ump in my throat as well the hairs at\nthe back of my neck stood up! Hugh Jackman was very good as well,\nIncredible songs that you could sing along to!!!!!!!!! shame these\nactors are not on the stage! Would recommend this to anyone x\n"
"\nIf you persevere through the opening act, you will be amply rewarded\nfor your patience. True, Crowe's singing does not match those around\nhim but the other performances are good enough that his miscasting does\nnot stay with you for too long.<br><br>Tom Hooper's use of close-ups gives you an intimacy that would never\nhave been possible on stage. Anne Hathaway is a revelation. She has\nperformed the definitive \"I dream a dream\" and has set the standard to\nwhich all others will now be judged. No matter how many times I listen\nto her rendition, I always feel a lump in my throat. Despite the short\ntime that she is on, she steals the scenes that she's in and truly\ndeserves an Oscar for best supporting actress role.<br><br>Hugh Jackman is superb and fits the role of Jean Valjean perfectly. In\ntruth, excellent performances abound - Eddie Redmayne, Samantha Barks -\nto name but a few.<br><br>If there is only one film that you would see this year and even if you\ndon't enjoy musicals, I would say that this is the one that you should\nsee - no question.\n"
"\nThis is one of the most powerful breathtaking films I have ever seen.\nIf you haven't seen this yet you need to... now!! I literally cried all\nof the way through and all the way home in the car! Anne Hathaway, Hugh\nJackman and Russell Crowe were just brilliant and Sacha Baron Cohen\nwith Helena Bonham carter bring a brief (but needed) bit of humour to\nan otherwise heartbreaking plot. Annes rendition of I dreamed a dream\nhad me literally sobbing it was that powerful. I cant praise this film\nenough and cant believe the people who are giving bad reviews! Please\ngive this a chance even if you don't like musicals this is a film\neveryone must see.\n"
"\nWell, I watched the movie a few hours ago and I have only one thing to\nsay: remarkable.It touched me deeply and the performances were\nastonishing.<br><br>People in the movie theater started to applaud right after the movie\nwas over as if we were in an opera house and cheering ''Bravo''...I\nthink everyone shared an overwhelming experience watching this\nfilm.Even though I already knew the story(obviously),and had watched an\nearlier version of it,I have never imagined that it could turn out to\nbe one of the most amazing films ever watched in my life.If you are\nplanning to go see it you won't regret it and personally i believe it's\none of the best musical made for the wide screen.I didn't even notice\nhow quickly time passed and most important I didn't want it to\nend..That is all..Hope you'll enjoy it too.\n"
"\nBeautiful and bold; the setting envelopes you and pulls you in\nimmediately, vividly recreating Paris in the 1800s in a time of trouble\nand poverty, but with scenes of hope and determination. <br><br>Hugh Jackman is moody and loving in the most appropriate way;\ndefinitely a super performance from him. Anne Hathaway singing I\ndreamed a dream is spectacular and yes, believe the hype. Her acting is\nspot on and the emotion pours from her in a good way, even if she is\nnot in the film for that long. Personally I think Russell Crowe is\nexcellent, and I'm not a huge fan, and a great performance from Helen\nBonham Carter and Sacha Baron Cohen; very funny and huge characters.\nThe scenes in the barricades surge with passion, emotion and\nauthenticity.<br><br>Yes I'm a fan of musicals which helps I guess, but this is one to be\nseen on the big screen and definitely next on stage! Overall an emotive\nand powerful film, and thoroughly enjoyable despite it being pretty\nsombre in parts. Loved it.\n"
"\nThis film is so far out of my comfort zone it is scary. This is not the\nkind of film I would normally watch. Thank God I went to see it, I have\nnever been so moved by a film in my life, I sat crying my eyes out by\nthe end, washed away with emotion, from the despair to the joy and\neverything in-between. The direction of the film, the effects, the\nsinging, the acting, the lighting, you name it everything came together\nin a perfect storm and created a truly wonderful film. I've been to see\nit twice and both times it moved me so much it's ridiculous.<br><br>If you go to see the film take some tissues for the tears, if you go\nand you're not moved then I pray for your soul, because this film would\nmove immovable objects to tears or cause unstoppable objects to deflect\nfrom their path.<br><br>I can't recommend this film enough, it's a true masterpiece of\ncinematic art.\n"
"\nThe very start of the movie intrigued me, the care taken into the\ndetail from costume to language was picture perfect, and being a huge\nfan of Hugh Jackman and Russell Crowe, this was a treat for me. <br><br>A musical is not what i usually prefer but i would have kicked myself\nfor the rest of my life if i had missed this on the big screen. this\nmovie brought out the rawest emotions of men, and why we end up doing\nthings we aren't proud of. the voice score was shocking,Anne Hathaway\nshook me up. The words were simple yet used to deliver the perfect\nemotion.<br><br>On the whole, i'm still in trance after watching the movie, and not\nmany movies bring a tear to my eyes. this one had me fighting them\nback. loved it.\n"
"\nI watched this film with my boyfriend, who was very reluctant to say\nthe least about watching it. However he actually ended up enjoying it!!\nshocker! I loved the opening scene of the film and carried on loving it\nthroughout the entire film. I cried, I laughed and I cried some more.<br><br>I can't recommend this film enough and I can't wait until I get the\nchance to go and watch it again.<br><br>Anne Hathaway was incredibly moving as her portrayal of Fantine.<br><br>Basically I highly recommend it to everyone. Even if you aren't a fan\nof musicals the storyline alone is amazing and it was a really, really\ngood watch :) Happy watching guys and girls.\n"
"\nThis is a beautiful and extravagant film of many colors and amazement.\nOne of the bottom lines about this movie though is that if one really\ndoes appreciate musicals, theater and opera's, then you are in for a\nreal treat as you will probably love this movie. If you're not a big\nfan of the theater or opera's however, this one might be tough for you\nto sit through as Les Miserables is about 2 hours and 37 minutes long,\nand accept for the credits and a little bit of dialogue, about 2 hours\nand 27 minutes of the film is all singing. It pretty much plays out\nlike the stage version of Les Miserables. <br><br>Hugh Jackman and Anne Hathaway own and embody their characters through\nthe passion of their voices and expression of their faces into their\nsoul. Eddie Redmayne and Russell Crowe are nothing to sneeze at though\neither, as they both give powerful performances as well. And Sacha\nBaron Cohen and Helena Bonham Carter add the right amount of comedy to\nthe film. Les Miserables will be a real treat for lovers of the\ntheater, and perhaps for some others.\n"
"\nOK, so I know the music, never seen on stage: so perhaps this is a\nrating that goes with the first time you see LM : 10/10. I was so\nemotional at the end I couldn't even speak and needed a very big scarf\nto both mop up my tears and hide my face. They will criticise some of\nthe vocals but they are real and come from actors singing live and\nperhaps thats why this grips the emotions. Great acting great songs and\nwow Anne Hathaway has created one of those movie scenes that joins my\ntop ten. Without a doubt this is one of the best films I have ever seen\nand not been this blown away since NCFOM (thats there to recover some\nshred of masculinity seeing as I have been a blubbering wreck on the\nway back home)\n"
"\nThis movie is simply breathtaking in its dramatic presentation of this\nliterary masterpiece. All the actors did a fantastic job drawing us in\nand causing us to feel the emotions and become a part of the action.\nThe fact that it is a musical will be a turn-off for many, but this is\na musical like no other where the songs here are rich and deep, the\nplot well-crafted, the characters fully engaged, and the costumes and\nscenery simply breathtaking. This is a movie for both men and women,\nboys and girls. It is fun, sad, thrilling, and contemplative all in\none. I went with low expectations and was blown away by the movie. It\nexceeded my every expectation and is now my favourite movie of all\ntime. It is nice to see that Hollywood can produce something that\ndoesn't depend on vulgarity and crude humour to attract their audience,\nand can deal with the theme of redemption from a perspective that\ndoesn't have to offend Christians. Loved it!\n"
"\nMy Mum took me to go and see this. I was not expecting such a powerful\nand beautiful movie with a perfect cast. Anne Hathaway gave a fantastic\nperformance and you could really see the emotion and feeling in her\nvoice and her face. I would name all the other actors and actresses on\nhow well they did, but i would be typing for days As i left the cinemas\ni was a mess, and so was everyone else. i can honestly not explain how\namazing this movie is, This has already hit the top of my favorites\nlist and it will stay up there for many years to come, guaranteed. And\nthose who say it was horrible because it was not like the musical, does\nthat really matter?? This is a masterpiece on its own, and does not\nneed to be spot on with the musical. The only problem i did have was\nthat it is too good and did not give the other movies of 2013 a chance.\nplease do yourself a favor and watch Les Miserables, but make sure you\nbring a few boxes of tissues.\n"
"\nthis is the best film I have seen in a few years, if you love the book\nor plays you will love this movie. I will not ruin it for anyone who\nreads this review and wishes to see the film, but I have plans to watch\nit 3 more times in the future in less then a week. damn, I want to\nwatch it now, I was crying through the whole thing. :_) this movie has\nan A1 cast I am not a Russell Crowe fan at all,but in my opinion\neveryone who was in this film deserves an academy award, I really hope\nthey at least gets nominated, for if not that would be the greatest\ninjustice, since the first Futurama cancellation. my aunt has never\nwatched the play or read the book and she was just blown away by this\nepic movie.\n"
"\nLes Miserables is a movie that will not be forgotten. Anyone who has\nseen (and enjoyed) the stage production will be engrossed in this\ncinema portrayal.<br><br>The interpretation followed stage productions very well. Casting was\nphenomenal- especially for Hugh Jackman, who fulfilled my image for\nJean Valjean perfectly and Anne Hathaway gave a brilliant performance\n(along with a wonderful singing voice. The rest of the cast portrayed\ntheir characters wonderfully.<br><br>The scenery is undeniably a piece of art. The buildings, homes and\nbarricade were amazingly real; costumes were completely true to that\ntime period; makeup on the actors helped tell the story. Details (the\nsewer scene is an example) are one of the things that makes this movie\ngreat.<br><br>For anyone who enjoys musicals (I'd guess that about 70% of the movie\nhas dialogue that is sung, yet still easily understood and followed),\nthis movie is a must see. I cried, I laughed (oh, those Thenardiers),\nand I was moved (especially by the closing scene, which was gorgeous).\n"
"\nFull disclosure, in my opinion the 1998 version with Liam Neeson a near\nperfect telling of this story. <br><br>This version is not my kind of musical, and I know this will likely\nannoy those who like the sage version, but there are only 3 songs in\nthis entire film as far as I can tell, they keep returning to three\ndifferent themes for every number.<br><br>Some of the camera work is pretty poor, losing focus, and having to fix\na few camera moves in post that were a little jarring. I get the\nfeeling that it had to do with the way they filmed the singing.<br><br>And I feel that with the exception of Cosette (young and old) the whole\nthing was pretty horribly miscast.<br><br>I was happy to watch the annoying members of the French Revolution get\nkilled in the street.\n"
"\nFirst off let me preface this by saying I have never seen the stage\nproduction. Having said that I was thrilled beyond belief to see this\nstory unfold in front of me on the silver screen. As the story\nprogressed I continued to be unnerved by the choices in camera angles,\nframing and slow focus pulls. As a film student who knows what a\nchallenge it is to achieve crisp focus in scenes and have had to cut\ngreat footage because it is too soft to use am embarrassed. I am\nbaffled why the director made certain choices, and I am not really sure\nwho is at fault but it prevented me from me being able to enjoy this\nfilm. If you are not troubled by out of focus shots or cramped in your\nface framing then you might enjoy this film. I however expect such an\nesteemed director to not settle for anything less than perfection and\nas moviegoer's we should not either. Les Mis was miserable!!\n"
"\nJust seen Les Miserables and came out of it shaking with rage. How dare\nthey reduce the greatest musical ever made to this pile of absolute\ns***. The only bearable bits I found were Russel Crowe, because he\nactually decided that acting was a good idea, and Eponine, but even\nthen she lacked the power and strength of voice to sing the part. If I\nwere to pinpoint all that was wrong with the movie I'd be here longer\nthan the show's been around. And Hugh Jackman, you have no excuse. You\nare a musical theatre actor and you have brought shame upon yourself\nand your profession for your lack of vocal control (meaning his huge\nsodding vibrato) and your decision to NOT even bother with any acting.\nAny half-wit can shed a tear and make his eyes water. My advice, GO SEE\nTHE MUSICAL! You won't want to tear your eyes out and plug your ears.\nShame on you Cameron Mackintosh.\n"
"\nMost people may not be good at spotting this but if your social circle\nincludes actual singers you'll know what I'm referring to. The acting\nwas good but the vocals killed the movie for me. It was also a little\ntoo slow for my personal taste. The movie score itself was obviously\nsuperb, can't really argue about that.<br><br>On a side note: as others eluded the actual musical (the original) is\nsuperior in almost every aspect. But if you're into \"mediocre singing\"\nthis movie might be just what you're looking for (it sure made me\ncringe a couple of times when Russel Crowe opened his mouth).<br><br>Final remark: sometimes more is more (especially when it comes to\npost-production editing in terms of the audio).<br><br>p.s. not all vocal performances were equally bad. Some were OK but\nsadly Russel Crowe and Hugh Jackman's performances undermined the\nentirety of the few good performances, I'm afraid.\n"
"\nThought parts of this film outstanding. I wasn't enamoured by all the\ncasting. Some offered great marquee value, but mediocre vocal value.\nHugh Jackman, Anne Hathaway and actress playing Epinome were brilliant.\nFor a musical to be turned into a film, this was one of the better\none's I've seen, but still prefer this one live. Nothing beats seeing\nthe volume of live singers on stage singing One More Day and Do You\nHear the People Sing. The film can't capture close to this. Aside from\nthat stylistically, I disliked the number of close ups and found the\nfact that they went in and out of focus as the performer moved singing\nirritating. Really pulled me out of the film.\n"
"\nFor fans of the musical, it is spellbinding to watch Les Miserables\nfinally come to life on the big screen. However, for the typical movie\ngoer or even a fan in retrospect, it's clear that the movie doesn't\nknow quite what it wants to be. It's a mess of gloomy, gritty sequences\nmixed with animated, silly, or downright ridiculous imagery. Although\nthere are some great voices, the majority of the film consists of\nterrible singers, which feels so out of place with all of the great\ninstrumental. Mix in some awkward, unbelievable CGI long shots and\nstrange, uncomfortable camera angles, and now we have the Les Mis\nmovie, and we aren't going to get a new one any time soon. However, the\nfilm is better than most of the movie musicals that we get. And, at the\nend of the day, Les Mis is like pizza. Even when it's done poorly, it's\nstill pretty good.\n"
"\nThis review will be given from two perspectives. The first is seeing it\nas an on-screen adaptation of the stage musicals. The second\nperspective I will give is one where we disregard the original and talk\nabout this movie as a stand alone film.<br><br>OK, so here goes.<br><br>This is an AWFUL ADAPTATION. I am baffled when I see reviews giving\nthis 10 stars!<br><br>If you play the songs side by side with their stage versions, this one\nis VOCALLY INFERIOR. (For those wondering why every line is sung, it's\nbecause they stayed true to the original.) I can barely hear what the\ncharacters are saying behind all those tears and sobs and whining and\ncrying!<br><br>Now let's look at this movie as a movie.<br><br>It is a TERRIBLE MOVIE. Acting is sloppy. Camera work is disturbing.\nCasting Russel Crowe as Javert was hilarious.<br><br>I believe that a lot of people are afraid of saying they hated this\nmovie for fear of being judged as stupid or unrefined. But no. This was\na terrible movie. Let's be honest.\n"
"\nPlease take this advice before viewing the turgid nonsense that is Les\nMiserables. This effort makes Miss Saigon look like the wackiest comedy\never. I have honestly never seen such a depressing sight since my last\ntax demand. Hopefully everyone concerned with this production was\noffered counselling. By the time Javert decided to end it all by\njumping into the swirling waters, I was on my feet ready to push him.\nDirector Tom Hooper should have told young Daniel Huttlestone (\nGavroche ) that he was no longer playing a part in \"Oliver.\" His\ncockney accent in the middle of Paris was ridiculous. \" Stone the\nRussell Crowes guv. You wouldn't Adam and Eve it\" Hope anyone who\nviewed this in the cinema went on Orange Wednesday 2 for 1. At least\nthis would be a small compensation.\n"
"\nWith so many talented actor/singers in this world why make a movie with\npeople who cannot sing. Sorry, but the point of a musical is music with\nsinging so why cast actors who struggle to carry off each and every\nsong. Performance crimes of weak voices, flat voice and parodies of\nemotion. I am perplexed by the praises but the majority always\nperplexes me in their choices. I put this in the same barrel of rotten\napples with the nauseating Sweeney Todd starring boring, over used\nJohnny Depp. How sad that in the pursuit of comedy they overcooked the\nmaster of the feast characters and scene to the point of not funny.\nYes, talented people they may be but not for a musical. Like the\ncomedian who longs to do a serious role and the serious actor who longs\nto 'make 'em laugh', are these wanna be frustrated musical actors? No,\njust actors who cannot sing, carry a tune or have any power of\nperformance of voice. Guess this is another movie fad. Put rotten\nsingers in musicals. My opinion, don't waste your money or time.\n"
"\nI remember seeing a professional theater company put-on \"Les\nMiserables\" in the early 90s. It was a romp of a performance and\nproduction. The music numbers came back to life with the movie. This\nnew movie lit up my memory, and although I commend the actors for\ngiving their best in singing, none of them save Amanda Seyfried are\nvery good. So what does that suggest? Well, here is a musical without\ngood singing, so it's not really recommended. The production was\nenhanced fairly competently by computer generated backgrounds, and I\nespecially liked the introductory scenes, however as I'm sure is\nalready noted, the movie runs and runs and...it feels like 180 min vice\n150. Anyway, if you liked the play, this may be worth a watch and\nlisten, despite it's execution, to judge for yourself.\n"
"\nAlthough I had never seen \"Les \"Mis\" before, I was very eager to see\nthe movie. I do like musicals and it looked like a very good story as\nwell. I absolutely loved the music and how passionate the performances\nwere by the actors. I actually liked the fact that the majority of the\nfilm was sung. It brought a certain emotion to it that simply can't be\nfelt by talking. The story was very touching and it was a joy to see\nthe transformation of Jean Valjean. It was amazing to see that he could\ngo from a prisoner with nothing to a man who changes his life and\nbecomes a father to a young girl who is in desperate need. I would\nrecommend this movie to everyone. It is definitely worth watching.\n"
"\nI consider myself flexible when it comes to reviewing and rating\nmovies, but I couldn't stand 15 minutes of this. As of how it won a\nsingle award (of anything) I will never understand, probably there was\nsome money involved.<br><br>It's a MUSICAL, you'll feel like being at the opera, it's a musical,\nand they dared placing it among the film industry, complete disgrace.<br><br>Having said that, by all means watch it, and see for yourselves. The\nmovie is plain boring, even with the background story and possible\nmessage, it's just plain boring. No matter how much you might enjoy the\ndrama, eventually the musical will bore you.\n"
"\n\"Les Misérables\" is filled with intolerable sentimentality and some\nsongs which are show-stoppers and I mean show-stoppers. It also has a\nsocial context, as Victor Hugo had, and this version focuses much on\nthat. Which is good. Mainstream has for too long not wanted to worry\naudiences about such things.<br><br>All actors sing themselves and Russell Crowe has some real talent for\nit. The film is colorful also for other reasons, although 2,5 hours is\na little too long. In stage versions, there is an intermission.<br><br>You can surely smell France in the early 1800s, although it maybe\ndoesn't have much to do with the mood of Victor Hugo. But it's clever\nanyway.\n"
"\nYes, the script is respectful both to the novel and to the stage show,\nwhich is no mean feat, but as a movie and a musical ? Positive reviews\nto THIS? Have people lost their hearing? Arrangements and direction are\ndreadful. Lack of good support, crying and muttering destroy most\nperformances. Only Samantha Barks sounds decent. Hugh Jackman tries his\nbest but his amateurish singing! How could his Bring him home stay in\nthe movie? Eddie Redmayne makes Nick Jonas - earnest and likable Marius\nwith mediocre nasal voice - sound like Michael Ball. There are many\ngreat Fantines, Ruthie Henshall maybe the best. Anne Hathaway, however,\nis irritating. Yes, as a tortured, dying prostitute FANTINE has reason\nto cry and moan, but this is - wait for it - musical. Hathaway won\nOscar because the Academy likes to see lot of drab, ugly movies about\nhuman suffering, that makes True Art. True Art looks crap, sounds crap,\nis crap! No, it's not crap. Just worst musical I have ever heard.\n"
"\nI really had high hopes for this movie, especially since it won Best\nPicture at the Oscars. Best picture, WTF?? This movie is horrible. I\nbarely made it through 40 minutes before I popped the DVD out. And what\nwas up with all that singing, especially if the actor could not hold a\nnote.<br><br>When I think of musicals, I think of the King and I; Singing in the\nRain; Westside Story, etc....real musicals, not this dribble. The 1998\nversion starring Liam Neesom and Uma Thurman was much, much better.<br><br>The 1998 movie was quite enjoyable. But this crap was beyond awful. I\nam so happy that I did not go to the movies to see this garbage and\nwaste $10 on it....wasting the $3 that I spent to rent the DVD was bad\nenough. Wow, what a stinker!! If you value your sanity and want to\nspare your delicate ears from high pitched screeching, do not see this\nmovie.\n"
"\nThis movie had real potential, I mean it's Tom Hooper, the director of\nKing's Speech! I always thought that the book was something for the\nscreens, not the Bright Light Way, but this movie was as bad as the\nplay!<br><br>In an overall synopsis of the story, Jean Valjean has just skipped his\nbail, and is now covering his tracks as the manager of a sewing\ncompany. Employee Fantine is fired, and is forced into prostitution, to\nkeep herself and new daughter alive. But after her death, Jean takes\nher daughter under his wing, at the same time, being pursued by officer\nJavert.<br><br>Not one bit of talking! It is all song, dance, and no talking. The\nmovie was enjoyable, but I somehow didn't appeal to it. I found it very\nslow at some points, and at others, too fast when it had to be slow. <br><br>Now, I must rate the film, I sadly give the film a 6.5 ticket stub out\nof ten.\n"
"\nHaving only seen one previous film version (1935ish), I am delighted to\nreport this version is enthralling and moving! Plan to bring Kleenex!!\nMy husband has had no experience with either book or film version and\nhad only a mild problem with following the story line. If anyone is\nplanning to go without any previous experience with this story -such as\nmy husband- my suggestion is to allow the story to lead and the main\nstory line will make sense! Music is extraordinarily moving, actors\nportray the emotions of the specific scenes exquisitely and the\nbackground scenery allows the one viewing the film to feel and be\ninvolved! So many times background scenes maim or injure the\nbelievability of the film, but this movie background does NOT!! I was\nso engrossed in the film, I found myself leaning forward and having\nlost all tract of time!!\n"
"\nI was speechless. <br><br>I would gladly kiss the feet of Tom Hooper for this film. Ignore all\nthe trolls. It wasn't boring, it wasn't badly made, it was pure\nbrilliance. <br><br>I was in shock at how amazing the film was, not just the actors and the\nsongs, but the camera work and the set was just as beautiful. The whole\naudience in a full screening gave a standing ovation which I've never\nseen before.<br><br>I would even go as far as saying that it is one of the greatest and\nmost life changing films. I honestly can't understand why anyone would\nhate it. Everyone needs to see this film. You will never witness\nsomething more amazing.\n"
"\nI was ready for this film to be fabulous due to the incredible talents\ninvolved in making it. But being unfamiliar with the story before\nseeing the movie, I was unaware of how beautiful this story is. Jean\nValjean is a hero of the first order. A man who was down and out, but\nwhen a priest offered him amazing help, it changed his life.<br><br>The film is different from the stage show, or so I've read, but it\nactually adds some things from the book that the stage musical left\nout. (I've been reading about it nonstop for 3 days now.) And this film\nis spectacular to watch. Stunning! The cast is superb. If Hugh Jackman\n&amp; Anne Hathaway don't win Oscars it will be a crying shame. Aaron Tveit\nis especially good as well.<br><br>This film is quite long, yet when it came to an end all I could think\nwas \"Gosh, I wish it was longer!\" I didn't want it to end. I will\nprobably go see it again next week. It's THAT good.\n"
"\nIn most musicals, they often try to glorify the settings, but I really\nliked in Les Miserables that they wanted it to look the actually\nsetting of how it was in the decade that the movie is set. I believe\nthat the t.v. show The Fugitive(1963-1967) was a little inspired off\nthis.<br><br>The actors are fantastic here, Hugh Jackman really shines here, so was\nRussell Crowe, but Anne Hathaway really blew me away, she really felt\nbad for her, she gave a good acting job through singing, I hope she\nwon't be missed by the Oscars, If she is I'll be very angry. Amanda\nSeyfried is alright, and Sacha Baron Cohen lightens up the movie, the\nmoments when he comes in the film. The setting is perfect, so is the\nactors in there roles, this is the best film of 2012.\n"
"\nThe movie is fantastic. It's a little sad that the movie is SO\nsignificantly better than the play. I did not really know what the heck\nwas going on when I saw the play. And the music is good in the play BUT\nin the film, everything is so vivid, up close and I know I should be\nshot for saying this... But I actually liked the way Anne Hathaway sang\nI dreamed a dream better than Patty Lapone. Something about the way\nAnne Hathaway sang it, more personal and emotionally connected than the\n\"theater\" version, Patty Lapone sings just made it so great. And ALL\nthe characters are so much more tangible. Sacha B Cohen is PERFECT with\nHelena B Carter. Hugh Jackman deserves an Oscar. The other actors were\namazing too...Cosette young ..totally adorable &amp; older Amanda S, Marius\n(Eddie R), Éponine (Samantha Barks) even Russel Crowe, all of them were\nwonderful. If you like musicals this to me is a brilliant combination\nof film and theater. LOVE IT!! Can't wait to see more like this. :)\n"
"\nLes Miserables is the best movie I've seen this year As great as the\nBroadway show was, the film is better, more action the closeups. etc\nThe cast is excellent HUGH JACKMAN should receive an Oscar for his\nperformance as should Anne Hathawy wonderful performances Russell Crowe\nis excellent as well though his voice doesn't stand up to the others\nAuduence broke out in applause several times (rare in a NJ theater)\nAfter Hathaways moving performance \" I Dreamed A Dream\" \" and \"Master\nof The House\" ( Sascha Cohen , Helen Bonham Carter hysterical,) and for\nHugh Jackmans performance of \"Bring Him Home\"At the end received a\nstanding ovation.. Long yes 3 hrs, never boring not a bad moment in\nfilm beautifully directed by Tom Holland and photographed.. The most\nsatisfying film I've seen this year ( and there are many good films\nthis yr) Note* Glad Colm Wilkinson Broadways original Jean Val Jean was\nincluded in a small part as the preacher.. Ot to be missed!!\n"
"\nIt's too bad not all of the leads are great singers. And somebody\nshould buy the director a tripod; the hand-held ultra closeups become\ndizzying and pretentious after awhile. (So many times, this movie cries\nout for an occasional wide shot. You know the famous\nwagon-pinning-the-citizen scene? We never even get to see the wagon. We\nstart right with the closeup of the victim!)<br><br>But there's also a lot right with this version: inspired casting, rich\nvisuals, and of course a brilliant score. Fascinating how certain\nthemes and moments give \"Les Mis\" a different meaning when you have\ncloseups (in this case, almost nothing BUT closeups) at your disposal. <br><br>Really glad we went. Would be gladder if the camera-work hadn't drawn\nso much attention to itself.\n"
"\nBased on the Broadway musical hit, with a cast of excellent actors, you\nget a magnificent version of Victor Hugo's book, which conveys the\nhistory, violence, poverty, revolution and rebellion and different\nhuman personalities - the maternal love, the conviction of the\nrevolutionary youth, the opportunism of the scoundrels that exploit\npoverty to abuse of the wretched, the repentant prisoner, the unjust\nand discriminatory legal system and the hard and difficult time of the\nFrench revolution that completely changed the course of contemporary\nhistory. A masterpiece of Hugo, complemented by extraordinary music,\nthat resembles more to a Wagner opera (the leitmotifs that identify the\ncharacters and events, great costumes, continuous singing, permanent\ndrama) that a film. A grim and harsh atmosphere of the big city, Paris,\nand French villages where the action happens, with a camera focused\nparticularly on the gestures and expressions of the characters, is\nhuman comedy at its best, or rather, the human tragedy .\n"
"\nLes Miserables is my favorite musical and I thought the movie was great\nand the casting was spot on. I must admit that I was very skeptical of\nthe cast when announced but they were superb. Anne Hathaway's\nperformance of Fantine was definitely Oscar worthy and exceeded my\nexpectations or her acting capabilities. I am now a true fan. Hugh\nJackman was brilliant in the role of Jean Valjean showing both strength\nand humility in this role. This movie possessed all the qualities you'd\nwant in a film; great acting, strong storyline, amazing cinematography,\nevokes a variety of emotions, and more. All I can say is well done to\nthe entire crew for this production. Truly a class act.\n"
"\nI'm an old cinema-maniac and IMHO this is one of the three best movies\nEVER made! Hugo's masterpiece novel (do read it) shines through\nenlightening and brightly illuminating the human soul! The music and\nlyrics (from the best musical I've seen) were hauntingly memorable\nbeyond any previous film - (including West Side Story) - and the\ncinematography is quite without parallel. A total ten - only because\nthere wasn't a higher rating available. Hooper should have gotten best\ndirector award but the critics are without much taste at times... Good\nexample back in the 1960's was Phillipe de Broca's \"King of Hearts\"\n(Alan Bates &amp; Genvieve Bujold) which got next to nothing in terms of\nawards but ran in some theaters for many many years. Also, Les\nMiserables (1995-C. Lelouch), with Jean Paul Belmondo... was a true\nmasterpiece but only some precious few critics saw that.\n"
"\nI for one loved this film. I came with a fresh mind keeping out the\nstage production (which I have seen in the west end). The reason I did\nthis is because unlike some people I knew it wasn't going to be the\nsame, just seemed obvious to me! This film was well paced and told the\nwhole story in general well, lots of people have complained about\nrussel, and okay he doesn't have the best voice but he has a better\nvoice than Pierce Brosnan in mama mia. And plus he fits the role well,\nas well as being a big actor to try and get more people to go and see\nthe film. In short it is a good film, 8/10 acting, 8/10 singing, 10/10\nfor the sets and overall looks. And YES it does give you goose pimples\nat the end just like the show.\n"
"\nI have seen the stage version of Les Misérables and must say the movie\nversion has taken it to a whole new level. It is absolutely amazing the\nway they took it from the stage to the big screen. The uprising of the\nlower class reminded me of a modern occupy movement that the\n\"Misérables\" stated \"we are not going to take it anymore\". It has all\nthe elements of a good story, a love interest, jealously, and a clash\nto the death. Hugh Jackman, as Jean Valjean carried this film and did a\ntop job. It was funny to see Russell Crowe sing as that is a role I\nusually don't think of him in but he did it. Anne Hathaway as Fantine\ndid well but Amanda Seyfriend emotions ran through. I totally did not\nexpect to see Sacha Baron Carter whose role as Thénadier was a\ncaricature of his normal self. Take a visit to old France and fall in\nlove with Les Misérables, this is sure to become a modern classic.\n"
"\nExcellent film in most respects; the singing is exceptional and\nperformances intense and very believable. There are however two\nexceptions to this - the Thernadiers are miscast leading to the ruining\nof Master of the House. This is a rousing song with very clever words\nwhich were lost in the film by poor delivery and not helped by the\nfussy camera work during it. You have to see it performed by Alun\nARmstrong to really appreciate it.<br><br>Having said that the orchestrations are to die for and the performances\nby Ann Hathaway and Hugh Jackman are first class and deserve awards as\ndoes direction and settings and costume. A 'must see' film.\n"
"\nI do not like sad movies, and this reminded me of how I felt after\nwatching Titanic - the actors were fabulous, the songs wonderful, but\nhad I know how emotionally draining this would be, I would not have\ngone to see this movie. That being said for those who enjoy musicals,\nit is wonderful and I did enjoy the music. There was a bit of comedy\nthanks to the \"thiefs\" and the little blue eyed boy was remarkable...\ngo see the movie, but bring Kleenex!<br><br>Poor Russell Crowe, I didn't see anything wrong with his singing, and\nwept openly at his final scene. I will do some research now on the\nsubject of the movie, the French revolution, I believe and educate\nmyself with a little bit of history. I will also download some of the\nmusic, which I loved.\n"
"\nI had never seen any stage-version of Les Misérables. I had only heard\nTwo songs from it; \"I Dreamed a Dream\" and \"Bring Him Home\" But still,\nmy expectations were pretty high. And the Movie lived up to all the\nhype! There are plenty of Amazing performances in this. Hugh Jackman\ngives one of the best performance I've seen in my life! Russell Crowe\nhas gotten a lot of undeserved criticism. His singing voice is actually\nvery good! And his performance is incredible! Anne Hathaway is not in\nthe film that long, but the time she is in it, is amazing! Sacha Baron\nCohen and Helena Bonham Carter as the Thernadiers are really funny!\nThey give the film much needed comic relief. All the other actors are\nalso amazing, but I won't take time to mention them all. They're all\nGreat!!!<br><br>The film is full of really powerful moments. I Highly Recommend This\nfilm to everyone who likes musicals, and to everyone who likes\nmovies!!!\n"
"\nThis is an absolutely incredible film. I have seen the stage production\n7 times and I was therefore wary of how good (or bad) this was going to\nbe. I wasn't disappointed - I was rendered speechless!<br><br>The voices are fantastic with the exception of Russell Crowe who plays\na great Javert but he doesn't have the strongest voice. You can tell\nhe's not quite up for the job but he gives it a go and it doesn't\nmatter because everyone else is outstanding and he does play the part\nwell.<br><br>When the credits rolled the cinema actually burst into applause and it\nwas well deserved.<br><br>Amazing film!!\n"
"\nLes Miserables is like the 2004 Phantom of the Opera conversion in that\nit is faithful to the stage show, although a few lyrics have been\nchanged and additional set pieces added.<br><br>Hugh Jackson, Russel Crowe both take on the leads well, although Anne\nHathaway stole the show for me in terms of 'big Hollywood Stars'. The\nsets are huge and impressive and no expense spared. <br><br>In my opinion there is a massive gulf in quality between the stage\nperformers and Hollywood stars, with Éponine (Samantha Barks) giving\nsuch an amazing performance.<br><br>I am a fan of the stage show and was really pleased with what was done.\n"
"\nI have never written a film review in my life, so this won't be very\neloquent, but having just come home from watching this I feel I ought\nto try.<br><br>Basically I didn't dare breathe for 2 1/2 hours, and I've never sat in\nsuch a quiet cinema (it was full!). Riveting and emotional is the best\nI can summon up. Anne Hathaway for me takes my top award - for the part\nas a whole, but 'I dreamed a dream' was incredible. If she doesn't win\nan Oscar for that one performance alone it'll be an injustice. You\nfound yourself believing every single word of that song - absolutely\nbeautiful. But then so was the rest of it...go see it tomorrow.\n"
"\nIf you have seen the stage version (millions have) then go see this\nmovie because it is every bit as good and entirely compliments the live\nversion.<br><br>If you have not seen the stage version then go anyway because this is a\ngreat, deeply audience engaging and highly emotionally charged movie.\nThe director has squeezed some quite amazing performances out of his\nplayers, shot singing without any dubbing and in brutal close-up.<br><br>Watch out particularly for Anne Hathaway's delivery of one of the most\nnotable songs in her role as Fantine. It is simply stunning.<br><br>At the end of the show the audience burst into applause - which is a\npretty rare event in a UK cinema.\n"
"\nDo I love the stage musical? - a huge resounding yes! Les Mis is easily\nmy favorite musical of the past 30 years - and I really know it inside\nand out - so like many I've been on tenterhooks waiting to see the big\nscreen version. And it is great - mostly.<br><br>The story of Jean Valjean, a victim of heavy justice who discovers\nredemption and his journey that finally leads up to the barricades of a\nParis student uprising in the late 1820 is told with verve and\nassurance.<br><br>It is moving and well done. The younger cast in particular shine with\nheart and vigor. (I did have a problem with two songs that were\nabsolute showstoppers on stage and both were curiously underwhelming in\nthis reviewers opinion.) All in all, this is a unique and interesting\ninterpretation and as nearly everyone else has noted it is not a\nstraight from stage to screen adaption that tries to reimagine the\nsoliloquies and internal dialogs in a far more intimate way.<br><br>Considering it was the film I was most looking forward to it was a\ngreat experience....mostly....\n"
"\nThis was an amazing movie. For me what made it so interesting was how\ndifficult it must have been to act and sing at the same time with a\ncamera right up front. Russell Crowe was perfect in the part of Javert\nand had a great Baritone voice. The opening scene when they were\npulling the ship into the dry dock was really cool, imagine what it\nmust have been like to build ships in those days. Hugh Jackman toiling\nin the bottom of the dry dock reminded me of Ben Hur in the guts of the\nRoman Galleon. It was hard to believe that these actors were not\nprofessional singers, they were all so great. The scenes in Paris were\nrecreated extremely well. I can just imagine what the barricades must\nhave been like. I guess my favourite song was by Samantha Barks who\nplayed Éponine. I must admit I am biased toward anything French, having\ngrown up in Québec. Where would we be without Descartes and Fourier!\n"
"\nIn this cinematic operatic production of Victor Hugo's ma gnus opus,\nthere is beautiful color, superb acting, and grand singing. The poor,\nmiserable, and destitute people of early-eighteenth-century France are\ndepicted well. Hugh Jackman came across well as the horribly mistreated\nJean Valjean, and Russell Crowe was definitely cruel, heartless, and\nhorrible as the mean Officer Javert. Anne Hathaway made you sympathize\nwith her in her role as the anemic mother of Cosette, and the little\nCosette was a heart-stealer, and you can't do anything but feel love\nand sympathy for her because of the mistreatment of her by the\nThenadiers: it was easy to fall in love with her when she became a girl\nof roughly twenty years of age. While I did like the singing, it maybe\nmade the movie comical in places. But again, It maintained my attention\nwell and is bound to be one of Universal's most outstanding\nproductions.\n"
"\nI didn't really know what to expect. We are very familiar with the play\nand all of the music and have heard some of the best performances\nanywhere--namely, Alfie Boe as Jean Valjean. The movie has to be taken\non its own terms. You can't go expecting the quality of singing\nperformances heard on Broadway, but if you don't have that expectation,\nthen just sit back and let the movie do its thing, you will find a\nremarkable translation of the play to the big screen. The performances\nwere stellar and overcame the lack of singing prowess by some of the\nlead characters. This movie is totally gripping, but in spite of the\nsometimes dark subject matter, you will leave the theater feeling\nrejuvenated and hopeful.<br><br>A wonderful experience!\n"
"\nWho are these people giving this movie low ratings and scathing\nreviews? This is a brilliant and moving adaptation of the stage\nversion!<br><br>My mother is a vocal coach, and even she had nothing to say regarding\nthe singing except for Amanda Seyfried as Cosette (her voice felt very\nweak). Hugh Jackman did Valjean justice, and Marius (Eddie Redmayne)\nwas my favorite by far.<br><br>To those people complaining about the close camera angles, I think he\ndid it because when you see it on stage, you're too far away to see the\nemotions. He wanted to capture every agonizing moment.<br><br>This movie adaptation is moving, touching, at times amusing, and very\nvery well done. I gave it nine stars because of missing verses in songs\nand a confusing song addition.\n"
"\nI saw the stage production several times and listen to the CD often, so\nI am a confirmed Les Mis fan. I loved this movie, I was totally\nabsorbed from the beginning - the opening scene was stunning. At first\nI was comparing the audio to the CD but this soon faded. As the movie\nprogressed, my throat hurt from trying not to cry out loud! Empty\nChairs at Empty tables did me in totally - he nailed it absolutely. <br><br>I'm not a fan of Russell Crowe but he was wonderful, and Hugh Jackman -\nwhat can I say. And the support actors were perfect. The three hours\ndisappeared quickly. I don't watch a lot of movies and usually don't\nbother getting DVDs but this one is a must - so I can watch in on my\nown without worrying about disturbing others.\n"
"\nI am a massive musical fan and Les miserables it is my all time\nfavourite musical even though i have never seen a professional company\nperform it live on stage. I have only see good quality amateur theatre\ncompanies and the 25th anniversary concert on DVD.<br><br>The movie was incredible and a great watch. Hugh Jackman is outstanding\nand he made the character his own. I was nervous about Anne Hathaway as\ni didn't know if she could sing - well she couldn't of played the part\nany better and deserves every award that hopefully comes to her. <br><br>As i am Australian i was proud that we had 2 Aussies playing leads in\nthis movie but when i heard Russell Crow was playing javert i was a bit\nhesitant about the singing yes he looks the part and acted the part BUT\nthe singing left a little to be desired a stronger voice was needed! <br><br>The rest of the cast was great with massive wraps on Eddie Redmayne on\nhis role as Marius and Daniel Huttlestone for his role as Gavroche. A\nMust watch and it did the musical justice will be watching it again\ntomorrow.\n"
"\nI have never reviewed a movie on IMDb before but after seeing all the\npositive reviews (I did see some other reviews that agreed with mine\nbut they were in the minority), I needed to write one. This movie is\nawful. Do not make Hollywood actors sing when they cannot. A musical\nshould be with good singers and good songs and good music. This great\nstory has been ruined by the musical format using Hollywood actors.\nThis is a story that requires dialog and there is no need to sing every\nsingle line - it makes no sense. I heard the Broadway show was good and\nI am sure it was, but this movie is pretentious, tedious and I could\nbarely sit through it. Of note, the previous Les Miserable starring\nLieam Neeson and Geoffrey Rush was awesome. If you have not seen that,\nrent it instead; if you have, see it again - avoid this version at all\ncosts!\n"
"\nJust watched \"Les Misérables\". I am not the type who loves musicals,\nbut this movie just went all the way up to the top of the list of best\nmovies of all times. I cried from beginning to end... No, I did not\njust get emotional, I cried huge and heavy tears. Not only the movie\nwas beautifully done, but Hugh Jackman and Anne Hathaway had the\nperformances of a lifetime. They both deserve the Oscars. Hugh Jackman\nshowed how an actor can reach deeply into his soul and bring out\nfeelings that are so intense that they are able to truly touch the\nsouls of those on the other side of the screen. No words I say can do\njustice to his performance.\n"
"\nI'm not going to write every detail of this movie.. <br><br>I just want to say that I have always wanted to watch the real musical,\nI have listened to the music for years. Now that I have finally went\nand watched it, I can honestly say that Les Miserables (2012) is by far\nand always will be the best musical I have ever watched!<br><br>The emotion that was brought into this movie was brilliant. I even took\nmy sister and her husband (who isn't a big fan of musicals) to watch it\nwith me.. My sister and I were in tears the whole time. My brother-in-\nlaw even told me that it was a fantastic movie!<br><br>If you are a person who can cry easily please take lots of tissues with\nyou :P<br><br>Great job with this movie!!\n"
"\n'Les Miserables' was mesmerizing. I don't believe I have ever witnessed\nsuch a spectacular story executed in so superb of fashion. <br><br>The movie gave me chills not once, but many times throughout. It made\nme smile upon humanity; smile because we are capable of creating such a\nstory which will have such a resound effect on others. <br><br>It has caused me to fall back in love with the art of storytelling. To\nsee clearly the power ans importance it holds and bestows. <br><br>From highest quality acting, to the magical script, 'Les Miserables'\nhas risen above it's time, above its World, and captured this writers\nheart.\n"
"\nI have seen Les Mis on 3 occasions so thought I knew the plot pretty\nwell, but when you see it on a big screen with such depth, and such\nacting..my breathe was taken away.<br><br>I am only going to say that at the end I was so moved it took me over\nan hour for my heart to stop aching from being wrenched about. Each\nactor personified their role. Every scene was done with attention to\ndetail. As a singer I will say that the Arias, the double arias, duets,\nand ensemble singing was well blended..I was very impressed and happily\nsurprised with Crowe's performance.<br><br>I live in a smallish town by metropolitan standards. The theater was\nfull on New Years Day, about 400 seats in the Big D, and at the end the\naudience applauded, as if it was a live show...Grown Men were\ncrying..and in the west that is a big deal..this was the most amazing\nof all the performances I have seen of this play..opera..musical and I\nfeel drawn to see it again before it leaves the big screen.\n"
"\nBesides \"The Love Guru\" by Mike Myers, this is by far the worst movie I\nhave ever seen... It is truly miserable, and therefor lives up to it's\nname - sadly... Oh Dear God, please slit my wrists and let me bleed to\ndeath quickly...<br><br>It's movies like this one, that makes people download illegally before\nbuying the movies themselves. <br><br>It has scarred me for life!<br><br>Seriously, The Gladiator himself, sounding like a hung cat... Wolverine\nhimself, should change his name to Margerine for his performance...\nBorat, in a musical?<br><br>I would rather gouge out my own eyes with a wooden spoon, and cut off\nmy ears with a dull swiss-army-knife, than to ever witness such horrors\nas this bloody movies was/is.<br><br>It is horrible, trust me...\n"
"\ni thought the constant singing throughout this film was awful. i was\nexpecting some dialogue without the cast singing and singing badly. the\nfilm had all the makings for an amazing film so its such a shame that\nsomeone decided to 'be quirky and different' and sing the whole film\nthrough. the story was a brilliant story the cinematography was the\nbest I've seen, the actors acted brilliantly. i was expecting it to be\nsomewhat like sweeney todd and have singing moments now and again. I\ndidn't even get to finishing watching the entire film as i left with 30\nminutes to go as i was cringing with embarrassment for some of the\nactors awful voices that they must hate when listening back to just\nlike everyone else in the world with a good sense of hearing\n"
"\nusually i only rate and never comment but i really hated that movie i\nexpected a good movie but never expected that bad everything was bad <br><br>from the beginning to the end i felt boring. normally i like some\nmusical movies but that was also bad in the movie i really can't find\nwords to say...<br><br>and really can't understand,how that movie got high rating how do\npeople like it ?<br><br>really Asian cinemas are getting much better than Hollywood they spend\nless money less technology but their stories, movies are much better i\nhave more fun to watch them nowadays..<br><br>for me this is one of the worst movie ever...\n"
"\nRather see the film with Jean Gabin. This musical-film is awful.\nEventhe composer decided what style he wanted to use? Mixed noise (I\nnot really consider it music), actors without singing skills. They\nreally can't sing. Uhhh, my ears. Ehh. It's wasting time see this. And\nis it nominated for - Oscars? It tells more than enough about the\nAcademy. And IMDb wants ten lines from me to review this horrible\nthing. OK, I read the book, saw about three different films from the\nstory. And my conclusion is: never ever will see this again. And never\never buy the DVD or blue-ray. Tehre were times, when there were good\nmusicals. This is not one from them.\n"
"\nThe entire movies was sung, and quite horribly by some of the actors.\nIn several recent successful musical to theater translations, the\ndirectors have done a great job of adapting the play/musical while\nretaining the integrity of a MOVIE. After a bout a half hour of nothing\nbut singing, at times too quickly to understand the lyrics, leavings\ngaps in the storyline (if you have not seen the play/musical). This is\nsimply a filming of a musical with better sets. 5 minutes in I was\nready to leave. Simply put, if you want to see Les Mis, go see the\nmusical. If you want to see a translation of Les Mis into a movie, wait\n20 years for a remake. 2stars because great storyline.\n"
"\nThis story is one of Broadway's most popular musicals yet the three\nmain actors (Jackman, Hathaway and Crowe) were horribly miscast. Why on\nearth the producer/director opted to go with non-professional singers\nis a mystery to us all other then the drawing power of Jackman and\nCrowe. Hathaway was the worst and out of her element and league. How\nsad that what might have been a Hollywood Classic for the Ages will die\na quick and slow death. Do not look for this film to garner a great\nmany nominations much less an Oscar although the only category an Oscar\nmay be extended to is the cinematography - but even that was CGI'd to\ndeath. You want good CGI? Go see the Hobbit. You want to see Les Mis as\na remarkable musical with songs sung by incredible voices? Go see it on\nBroadway.\n"
"\nAs a fan of both the book and of the original play, this movie is the\nbest combo of both.<br><br>it is basically the play if it was to have more of the story-line from\nthe book.<br><br>LOVED IT!<br><br>That book is the greatest I have ever read, so the adding of more\ncontent in the form of the play (Which is a masterpiece of it's own)\nwas a pleasure!<br><br>and the direction and the performances were amazing as well.<br><br>Summery: Great adaptation.\n"
"\nThis movie is simply wonderful, an astonishing movie. As a reader of\nthe original Victor Hugo's novel I found that the movie is a true\nreproduction of the original one, very touching, impressive . Anne\nHathaway as Fantine brought tears in my eyes, extremely afraid after\nspitting on Jean Valjean , incredible performance and incredible\ntalent. Jean Valjean the innocent prisoner , the one who feel the\ninjustice as he was jailed just because he stole a piece of bread to\nfeed his hunger, also an incredible performance from Hugh Jackman.\nFinally the unique performance of Russell Crowe, the aggressive\nstone-hearted Javert, who think he is serving God and justice, with his\nrigid cruelty look. The movie deserve not only 10 points bit 20 or even\n100 points.\n"
"\nJean Valjean, known as Prisoner 24601, is released from prison and\nbreaks parole to create a new life for himself while evading the grip\nof the persistent Inspector Javert. Set in post-revolutionary France,\nthe story reaches resolution against the background of the June\nRebellion. Hugh Jackman and Anne Hathaway give 2 amazing stand out\nperformances the same goes for Russell Crowe and this is without a\ndoubt the best Musical since Sweeney Todd there's a little bit of\nactual dialogue but the biggest part of the film is songs and the movie\nis really heart breaking especially the ending and i will definitely\ngive it a 10 out of 10.\n"
"\nMy cousin showed me a very nice film , I cried very much liked me I\nwould recommend a period our souls in this I am glad that you are\nanonymous movie paylaşo my house my mother-in- law rented We 're home\nof his uncle Ibiza care was now safe in the apartment site our pool you\nhave bestowed more beautiful to those who ask God : &gt; Mia mate Hugh\njack man God drew you to catapult him very comfortable very successful\nbi I pray for our brothers drew so much I explained to him in the film\nitself already has in itself already something like this was a man\nValle what you would expect to get halal I say shame on stores Adviser\nmy friend to everyone come a little Mia from Germany GeKD hacks until\n"
"\nThis is the one of musical movies. Some people don't like musical\nmovies, but actually, I like that. Some people says singing suddenly is\nvery strange and I agree with that, but I don't care about that so much\nbecause the songs characters sing shows their feeling so well. In this\nmovie, all dialog is in songs, so it's a little bit different than\nusual musical movies. One thing I want to say is the way to shoot this\nmovie is very fantastic! When people shoot musical movies, before the\nshooting starts actors record songs and they move their mouth without\nsinging when they shoot. But this movie takes different way. Actors put\near monitor on and sing with listening only piano. Actors sing the way\nthey want to sing, so they can act and sing very naturally. So actors\nin this movies have great and wonderful skills. This movie shows a view\nof the Les Miserables world so well. We can enjoy everything about Les\nMiserables same as the play.\n"
"\nFar and away the best musical movie ever. And when compared to most\nfilms... it's still spectacular.<br><br>The directing, especially in the first number, is absolutely brilliant.\nOne of the greatest camera angles in film history is when the people in\nthe lines face away from you and you can see the front of the crooked\nship.<br><br>The writing is great in both the music and the dialogue. The little boy\nis written perfectly, as is Jean Valjean's final alive scene. In\naddition, though this isn't credited to the film, the songs are great,\nespecially \"Look Down\" and \"I Dreamed a Dream.\"<br><br>The acting is absolutely fantastic. With Hugh Jackman, Russel Crowe,\nAnne Hathaway, and Eddie Redmayne in the same movie, that can be\nexpected. Of course, Anne Hathaway's acting in \"I Dreamed a Dream\" is\nclearly the best in the movie, and she won a well deserved Supporting\nActress Oscar for it.<br><br>A truly spectacular movie.\n"
"\nThe well known story of Les miserables as a musical, this time, for me,\nit failed to deliver. The amazing cast and the beautiful shots and\nsequences of the revolution and the struggles that people had to\nendure, are overshadowed by the failure the keep the interest high\nthroughout the movie. The songs focus mainly on the drama, but they do\nget boring, especially for someone who doesn't love musicals, but just\nwanted to see what all the buzz was about. The performances were\nsplendid, although, for me, having the con couple act as the comical\npart of the film felt out of place and sometimes ridiculous. So 3 out\nof 10.\n"
"\nThis movie was the first musical I ever watched and it made me love the\nmusicals. Cast plays really well although it is not easy to sing and\nplay at the same time. Hugh Jackman, Russell Crowe, Anne Hathaway and\nthe other cast are successful on that. I got the emotions clearly while\nwatching the movie. Of course, Victor Hugo, author of the book, Les\nMiserables, played an important role in beauty of the movie because the\nbook is one of the best. While I was watching the movie, I remembered\nthe book that I read almost 15 years ago. I perceived the same feelings\nafter 15 years and that made me really happy. The movie tells the\nvirtues of French Revolution in a touchy manner. Vivre la France...\n"
"\nLes Miserables is an incredible story of how a man can turn his life\naround from a position of utter despair to a position where he can\npositively influence the lives of the people round him.<br><br>The film was beautifully choreographed with fantastic solo performances\nfrom Anne Hathaway and Hugh Jackman in particular. It is a fantastic\nadaptation of the incredibly successful musical which has blessed us\nfor many years.<br><br>Personally, I haven't seen the play for many years so when watching it\nI felt as if I was drowning in a sea of nostalgia.<br><br>My only problem with this film is that it is a bit miserable.\n"
"\nIn 19th-century France, Jean Valjean, who for decades has been hunted\nby the ruthless policeman Javert after breaking parole, agrees to care\nfor a factory worker's daughter. The decision changes their lives for\never.<br><br>The story works very well. From my point of view Tom Hooper took a high\nrisk and won a big game. He did not chose easiest path to make this\nmovie. Every actor sang and these performances recorded on the set. The\nbest performance comes from Anna Hathaway. Her \"I Dreamed a Dream\" Hugh\nJackman did also good job but. Russell Crowe's performance reminded a\nlot Johnny Depp's performance in Sweeney Todd film. They are not\nsingers and that's why the movie suffers. Sacha Baron Cohen and Helena\nBonham Carter brings a light elements to the story. Les Misérables is\nmasterpiece which won't work for everybody. If you like musicals, watch\nthis and enjoy.\n"
"\nLes Miserables is a movie set in 19th-century France about a man, Jean\nValjean, who agrees to raise a factory worker's daughter. It's based on\nthe musical of the same name which is in turn based on the 1862 French\nnovel by Victor Hugo. It stars an ensemble cast led by Hugh Jackman,\nRussell Crowe, Anne Hathaway, Amanda Seyfried, Eddie Redmayne, Sacha\nBaron Cohen and Helena Bonham Carter.<br><br>All the actors deliver an excellent performance, both acting and\nsinging, especially Hathaway. But the movie felt unnecessarily long,\nespecially all the singed monologues. The diagonal camera angle and\nextreme close ups were a bit distracting.<br><br>There were parts that didn't make sense. For example, why did Fantine\nbring an incriminating letter to work for no reason? Or how did Marius\nand Cosette fall in love so quickly? There's another one that I can't\nmention without spoiling the movie, but it's in the first act.<br><br>It would've been nice to see the plot drive the movie instead of the\nmusic driving the whole movie. It felt more of an opera than a musical.<br><br>7/10\n"
"\nVery incredible movie that I watched in my life. I loved a lot.... A\ngive 100 stars for Hugh Jackman, and also for the brain behind this\nmovie.. Expecting more from him.. Hooper's idea to have the actors sing\nlive really brings a deeper emotion to the film not seen in other movie\nmusicals. Hugh Jackman is absolutely incredible as Jean Valjean and\ncarries the film with spectacular grace. Anne Hathaway is magnificent\nin her fleeting role as Fantine - the film's sequence in which she goes\non a downward spiral is one of the it's best moments, and her\nABSOLUTELY INCREDIBLE HEARTFELT rendition of 'I Dreamed A Dream' will\nwin her the Oscar by itself.<br><br>HATS OFF TO ALL!!!\n"
"\nThis isn't anywhere near my genre, so LES MISÉRABLE was probably never\ngoing to blow my hair back. I've seen this on stage and I know the\nstory - it's just that the songs aren't really my forté. Also, there\nwas a lot of in-your-face hand-held camera-work, and that got old\npretty quickly.<br><br>That said, I can wholeheartedly appreciate the skill herein on a\ntechnical level. Hugh Jackman felt right at home with the singing, and\nhis voice is admirable. Crowe's no slouch, either. And the title of\nthis thing pretty much describes what you're in for, so it's no dose of\nProzac.<br><br>But Anne Hathaway's rendition of \"I Dreamed A Dream\" is worth the price\nof admission, even if it comes very early on in a 2-and-a-half hour\nmovie. But have the tissues ready, because it is bloody heartbreaking.<br><br>6/10\n"
"\nWatched Les Miserables With Hugh Jackman(The Prestige) as Jean Valjean\n. Also Starring Anne Hathaway(Rachel Getting Married) as Fantine, Eddie\nRedymane(My Week With Marilyn ) as Marius Pontmercy, The Lovely Amanda\nSeyfried(Letters To Juliet) as Cosette and Helena Bonham-Carter(Harry\nPotter) &amp; Sacha Baron- Cohen(Borat) as The Thenardiers, also Starring\nRussell Crowe(3:10 To Yuma) as Inspector Javert The Films Main Villiam\n,The Film Was brilliant getting to be on The Frontlines It was an Epic\nMusical also The Whole Film is Carried by Song with Very Litte Dialogue\nalso being fan of The 98 film and Seeing the Musical in London it was\nfantastic also Crowe had an Amazing Musical Performance .also Amazing\nProduction Design By Eve Stewart(Revolver), Cinematography By Danny\nCohen(This Is England ),Costume Design By Paco Delgado(Biutiful),\nScreenplay By Alain Boubil(Abbacadabra) &amp; Claude- Michel Schonberg(This\nIs 40) and Direction By Tom Hooper (The Kings Speech) This Definitely\nThe Musical Of All Time and Worthy of Hathaways Oscar Win 9/10\n"
"\nComing from a Broadway background, I was super excited to see Les\nMiserables! I saw it in theaters twice (once at the midnight premiere\nin my city and again with my friends), and overall loved it!<br><br>There's always a \"but\", though. Casting, in my opinion, is what cost\nthe Oscar for this movie. Russell Crowe looked scared and sounded like\nhe had nasal issue; he did not meet the expectations of the masculine\nJavert, which is why I felt a little relief during \"Javert's Suicide\".\nAmanda Seyfried was innocent, like Cosette is supposed to be, but her\nvoice was too small. Hugh Jackman would've made a great Javert, and\nreally brought a grand perspective to Jean Valjean.<br><br>The make-up and costuming was outstanding and really brought out\ncontrast between rich and poor; sick and healthy. And all the death\nscenes were well produced (Fantine's Death, Little People or Gavroche's\nDeath, A Little Fall of Rain or Eponine's death, the Final Battle\nScene). Overall, it was true to the story and is really worth seeing\n9/10\n"
