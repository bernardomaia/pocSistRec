i want this movie to come out on dvd now so i can watch all the movies in the right order p
i also love how people clapped when they thought vin died
i was like have you not seen tokyo drift
i also like how they connected this film to tokyo drift
i finally get the back story on it
i loved this movie and am looking forward to them making more
i am also glad they brought in statham
i was wondering why vin came to tokyo but now i know
all the connections in this film were done very well
it was good to see the full team back together again and them come back home where they belong
i am interested in seeing how stathams role is for this movie if he plays the same type he does in his other movies
a typical fast and furious movie loaded with machine gunscarsmuscular menchicks
etc
so far this is the best fast and furious movie
very fastenjoyable with terrific and exhaustible action sequences
fast and furious fans should watch it
and i recommend for others too
actually highly recommended
it promises u for the 7th part in the end which ends up in tokyo
the next thing i wont tell
because i dont want to spoil ur movie
the movie keeps u entertained with a very fast moving plot
jay z and ludicrouss songs
furious 6 is a pure action adrenal type movie
and a must watch
go for it
dont miss this one
just watched it in france gonna admit it is just explosive and best action movie so far this year well balanced timing good fight featuring rodriguez a great tag team tornado match for the grand finally
dont even think about story line because this kind of movie can make you believe anything as long as punchlines from each characters punches from the main ones put a step further to the never seen before one of a kind car chasing e
g tank vs old cars  aircraft vs muscle cars you have to remember a wrestlemania like match feat
rockdiesel which is as good as supermanbatman fighting together
over the top  ending preparing the fast and furious team vs the transporter  2014 great year upcoming
this was certainly best movie in fast and the furious series
best in all 6 movies
like always movie goes on series of events whose solution could only be fast cars and action
laws of physics do not apply to fast movies because following laws of physics is something hollywood has given responsibility to christopher nolan
so trailers made me to go watch this movie on first day and it was certainly the best idea
it was more fun that any of fast movie
great mix of comedy action romance too
an extraordinary villain was present here who was undoubtedly best among all the villains we have seen before in this series
making money and steeling was not the focus but something else was at the stake
so watching criminals work with the police this was just amazing
dwayne johnson the rock again rocks the action scenes with his never ending style
best fast movie ever made
i was surprised by the low reviews and so much trash talk about the film
i am so happy that the entire cast from fast 5 is in the movie
film makers and directors dont understand how important it is for the characters to remain the same yet grow on screen
i am loving how the introduced the plot which is another job
not to mention sexy sexy sexy cast
im only 16 minutes in but i am loving loving loving it
the adversary in this movie is sure to leave you hanging on the edge of your seats while i am getting some hint of the first batman remake with heath ledger by some of the cars and stunts
this bad guy in the movie is giving the guys of fast amp the furious a run for their money
the cars are one of the basic elements for action movies nowadays and thats the reason for fast amp furiouss success
after rio torettos family dominic o conner mia are now at europa and hobbs ask them for help because a russian exmilitary is planning traffic with a powerful weapon one argue is convincing letty is alive
spectacular sequences big cars london and spain highways are the complement for this movie
when we think that the movie is ending takes places a story change
one of the think that like me from the movie is that between lines they promote the value of the family and one dialog from toretto show this ado not turn your back on your family even if they give it to you ifa
a excellent sequence introduce a jason statham as a new villain for the next movie and explain how han lue dead
yes this movie had a lot of clichas but they can be ignored by the fast paced and the grasping screenplay
great direction
this can be called a complete movie as it has all the essential elements like comedy action drama etc
if you are an emotional fool then yes this movie is for you too
p regarding the history of the series it would be helpful if you have seen the previous parts of the series before watching this movie
i wont say much about it you should go for it
though it is a one time watch but it is worth every penny and the time that you will spend on it
the bottom line you wont be disappointed after watching this movie
this movie has done justice to the series and the expectations
and dont walk out of the theater as soon as you see the credits coming because there is a big and i mean biiiiiiiggg surprise coming
and all i can say now is that the next part is going to be legen wait for itliterally daryhopefully so anyways go for it
great movie
810
outstanding blow of mind awesome movie
vin diesel and dwayne johnson was incredible
story was way better than before
plot was strong
must watch movie
i really liked it personally
it was worth watching from beginning till the end
worth spending money
cars i love cars story actually revolves around it
awesome techniques
what a direction of the movie
ludicrous and tyrese they both acted very well in their places
they make u laugh and enjoy the movie
i must suggest this movie as a must watch
awesome awesome awesome  excitement entertaining above all wowwwwwwww
fighting was great
stunts were absolutely amazing
worth full movie of the month
as great as the original fast amp furious
high adrenaline and fast cars
who would have guessed they would have put so much time into the storyline along with the time they put in these actors appearances
it is a great movie for those adults amp young adults who have grown up with these movies
due to the fighting and drug cartel references not a great movie for kids
this is a movie you would want to leave the kiddos home with a babysitter as you enjoy it
upbeat high energy and will leave you smiling
this is a great movie to watch with the full impact of the movie theater experience
an absolute must see
never a dull moment
the fnf crew has struck gold again yet again
man as long as you guys keeping making these movies i will be paying to see them and waiting on the blueray to drop
and a lot of sequels they dont get better they dont get it right on the second to even get a chance for a third but yours do
and adding more fire power as your franchise grows is an awesome touch for then fan base
the rock was an awesome addition
vin and paul keep up the great work
and paul im a nissan guy too so seeing the gtrs and those 240sx pop up time after time is all the better
vin you need to switch from the mopor man lol
fnf you have a true fan for life
ride or die
you might think this series of films would get dull by nowno wayits still brilliant over the top action
the main crux of this one is this is dominic finds out letty is still alive and working for a bunch of crimials
so dominic teams up with the police to find herhe does so and she
well i wont tell youbut its all brilliantly played outleaving the viewer wondering just what is going on in lettys mind
so another fast and furious and the end leaves you with no doubt theyll be yet another
the fast and furious series just keeps getting better and better so far fast and furious six has to be the best film in the series
what an amazing movie
i cant believe the next movie will have jason statham in it and as a bad guy nonetheless
there has been a rumor going around that i would like to put to rest
people have been saying in fast 7 one of the main protagonists brian or dom is going to die
this is untrue although a good contributing character will be killed
oh no
but this is one of the most amazingly spectacular movie series of all time but that is just an opinion of a great fan
for whoever reads this review i am sorry for the spoiler but please enjoy the next movie
i hope that in the next movie another new character will be added to the series which i am sure will happen
thanks to the knowing of the coming of ian shaw
i loved this movie
yes the plot scenes are way over the top but thats what makes this movie rock
its an action upon action movie it was exciting to watch the scenes fly buy the fighting was awesome all through the movie were super cool scenes the cars the locations it was just great
i dont know what the rock dwayne johnson is doing but he is a beast in this movie
the scene between him and the huge white boy at the end made me think of the fight between godzilla and mothra
the fight scenes between michelle rodrigues character and the other lady were tough and exciting
all the supporting cast did their parts well
laughter and good times by the whole crew was great to see
the plot was predictable but still enjoyable
you dont have any time to get bored because the breaks in action dont last that long
the movie is a great ride
gee unlike one of the most oddly preposterously successful recent franchise movies this one decides it will not fall into the lets make depressing entertainment category
in that other movie the psychologically damaged love interest gets used sexually and then a day later just for good measure shot in the face
in furious 6 a love interest in the series actually comes back to life
isnt this how movies are supposed to be made
guys have been trained to walk out of movies wanting to be like the hero of the movie
the box office of furious 6 restored my faith in mankind
ok it hasnt eclipsed 1
2b but theres still time left
movie was up to the mark
there were lot of hilarious moments
rock was excellent in the movie
all the characters gel up really well
letty is back d
the movie was fast and furious
the scene with the airplane in the climax is one of the highlights of the movie
i will give this a 1010 rating right away
dont miss it
go and watch it right away
i am very eager for the next installment now
the film is filled with all the highoctane speed chases and close combat scenes weve come to expect from the franchise
i think this is one of the best film in the franchise
as is the trend nowadays the closing credits provide a teaser of whats to come
in a tokyoset interlude we are introduced to yet another popular action star who will likely join the fast and furious crew for joyride number seven
keep those seat belts fastened
fast amp furious 6 is back to wheel power
this movie is so cool
it is full of action and highlytechnical stunts
i cant wait to see more of these
it has a very unique idea of how a real person can achieve everything as long as heshe has the tenacity to pursue everything
two thumbs up guys
i hope next time f amp f will feature some more scenes
some more cool races and actions
we would love to see more of these
the thrill did not get out of ourselves even after we finished watching this one
actors are really into the action
you can feel that they love the movie so much as if it were real to them
a race that would amaze us even more is what we are looking for in the next f amp f
wed love to hear the f amp f 7
this was by far and away the best of the fast amp furious series
it is nonstop from beginning to end
the opening sequence is awesome the way this movie pulls in all of the movies in the series to date and closes the loopsjumps of it is by far better than any other movie series i have seen
i have never seen a movie pull from all previous movies to make up its opening credits
having all the old crew mixed with the new crew from fast 5 is what put this movie over the top for me
i honestly cannot wait until fast 7 next year
if this one is any indication it will not disappoint
i highly recommend catching this one in theaters
it will be awesome on dvd but the full effect of the movie can only be had on the big screen
will definitely be buying this the day it is released to dvd
this movie delivered everything the credits promised and so much more
furious 6
made on a story that can be detailed in single line hobbs has dom and brian reassemble their crew in order to take down a mastermind who commands an organization of mercenary drivers across 12 countries
furious 6 is a mad enjoyable watch or some sort of guilty pleasure
lack of a thrilling storyline is covered by grand canvas ruthless action races and chases peppy background score man on man fights woman on woman fights cars against tanks and even planes
some action scenes go over the top and you need to avoid applying logic every now and then to enjoy the sequences
all actors play their part ok and their conversations are mostly laced with delicious one liners
so furious 6 delivers what it promises fasten your seat belts and enjoy the ride
great film good action and very good stunts well worth a watch
starts off with vin being abroad and the rock finding him to tell him they have found letty and that she is in a bad gang of people
so the rock trys to get vin to catch the gang and possibly get letty out
so vin needs to get the crew back together from all over the world to try and catch the gang
a lot of well played stunts involved a lot of crashing and flipping cars caused by the flip car and to top it all of even manage to get a tank in as well and flip that
but as for the cars good old british car the escort some good jumps with that
bmw flipping and smashing them
not for getting the dodge i could go on but you will have to watch it and see for yourself
other wise i could go on
based on the amount of running time i think the plot was well executed
apart from a few goofs here and there i think the car chases were superb
also the character would need to get facts right on cars especially the v12 american muscle
most of the scenes repeat in terms of cars on the road which are seen on multiple scenes
the introduction of newer cars is also superb typically the nissan skyline driven by the late paul walker
i think hobbs role has also been well done
many factual errors occur especially in the last bit of the tank scene and the chain that hangs on the bridge together with reality versus action
the antonov also takes too long to lift thus causing an unrealistic situation concerning runway length
its a great title but not necessarily for anyone obsessed with facts rather than fiction mostly on the last quarter
we would also have loved it better in 3d the 3rd dimension of things would bring a bit more realism and adrenalin
all the same i think that was nearly excellent
good work
this is probably one of the best movies in the fast and the furious franchise
it took a long time for it all to lead to tokyo drift and we finally find out what the ending of tokyo drift was all about through this movie han goes to tokyo
while most franchises lose their steam with each succeeding sequel the fast and the furious franchise is that rare exception where its later films breathe in new life into the series
the cast seems to sleepwalk through the production with only the occasional chase or explosion or plane crash to jar the audience out of its stupor
and speaking of aeroplanes the concluding sequence  which features a russian cargo jet lumbering for takeoff with cars and the entire cast either hanging from it or chasing it  goes on so long the runway has to be at least 50 miles long
in conclusion this movie was good bye
this movie revealed a powerful sequel to the 5th in the series
with the classic car chases incredible action sequences and explosive ending there was more than enough entertainment to sate even the most ardent movie goer
the quality and quantity covered within the movie revealed rekindled relationships further deepened intimacies and unexpected deaths
the movie managed to keep the franchise on track in terms of both accuracy and success
this movie was a splendid creation that is a true testament to the art of mobile action
the one anachronism that i noticed but not pinpointed by how it should of ended was the scene in the preliminary car chase where the bad guys simply fired gadgets onto their pursuers cars which in effect detonated a blow out of one of the cars tires
the question why not replace this gun with a more powerful explosive
just something to think about
i dont know why people are bitching about direction of movie is bad
this movie franchise is all about cars and crazy stunts and well ya about cars
fk the story story is secondary when we watch this fast and furious series its all about gorgeous racing cars
you want story go watch pearl seven borne
you dont go for story when you watch stepup franchise all you care is freaking dance
so to the people who didt like this movie you didt see what actually the director wanted you to look
if the movie had story primary then people would be bitching about there werent enough cars in there franchise forgot what this series is all about
get over it
conclusionmovies was awesome one of the best of the franchise
cars were new not seen early in any movies
cleared the tokyo drift ending connection
must watch for all fast and furious fans
fast and furious wont let you down
even it is a 6th installment on this series it still rocks
movie is turbo loaded popcorn entertainmet loaded with testosteroine and smell of gas
the story isnt the brightest but that can easilly forgive because this movie is exactly what you are waiting for
movie is full of great action scenes which are so exaggeration that you can only laugh for them
thankfully movie doesnt take itself too seriously you understand that at the latest when dwayne johnson is to be called as a sumerian thor
with the previous movie i was hoping that next movie get its bad guy from jason statham
it didnt became truth in this movie but the end scene promises that jason statham will be the bad guy in next installment
cant wait to see that
leave your brains to cloakroom and enjoy great entertainment
yes yes yes the film had my heart racing the fight scene were great the story was great and the cars were awesome as usual
i can even accept the story line and how everything ties into each other
romans character reminds me of my cousin always got something to say and keeps me shaking my head at him
seeing jason statham at the end was a great surprise too
im hoping the next movie will have a great chase scene
this is one of few franchises were you dont want any of the characters to die i like all of them especially han he was one cool cat
keep the films coming guys vin you are a smart business man i tell ya put me in a film too
how about an audition for a new character on the team who is longing to be part of a family i do my own stunts to
i loved this movie great action scenes and amazing on screen chemistry between the whole cast
in my opinion this is the best fast and furious yet
i was on the edge of my seat for almost the whole movie and in tears for a couple of parts
i cannot wait for the seventh installment to this franchise
im a huge fan of this franchise and the way it keeps you guessing time after time
vin diesel plays this character to a t and has since the beginning  michele rodriguez is absolutely brilliant in this film she is as good as it gets when it comes to female action heros and shows it off several times in this film
the seventh installment in this franchise is going to be great based on the small snippet show in the credits of this film
great cars fine actors amazing fights and omg the actions scenes from the car chases were good enough to make me happy and put a big ass smile on my face
even if you dont like cars this is a great example of a good action movie fun simple but with nice twists and
if you really dont like cars with this franchise you will start liking them and a lot
cant wait for the next one
finally this movies the fast and furious franchise did something other franchises should do mix the recipe change the story present new and exciting characters and make a new great feeling for the movies to come
hope other franchise do the same if necessary
i had never seen any of the fast and furious movies and i say this one by mistake and i am glad i did
i believe they did a good job at explain the back story for first time watchers
will defiantly be watching the other 5
for me there was a little to much unrealistic parts but i believe that is what happens with any high budget action movie
like i said this was my first fast and furious movie so i am not sure if every actor has been in every movie but i believe you can truly tell that they have an almost family like bond between the cast and even the crew
i believe that the fact that they have this relationship with each other truly adds to the movie
now i could be 100 wrong and they could just all hate each other and be great actors
believability of this movie is on par with xxx triple x
as someone already said there is unnecessary fight between allies that no one else but them sees
the part where vin catapults himself out of his car to catch his girlfriend is
well
i was pretty certain such scenes died out from movies ten years ago but no
the movie is insult to intelligence
i came to check it on imdb expecting to see not more than 4 and finding the people value it 7
4 is just another proof you quite often cant believe imdb rates both high and low
watch it with your kids if you must but be prepared for some royal punching in your believability synapses
with fast amp furious 6 the series starts going to a more darker path when one of the previous characters its basically a ghost and one of our main characters tries to find it and bring it back
luke evans makes an ok villain but the most amazing scenes in this movie is the ones with the tank and when the rock and vin diesel fought that big dude inside the plane
the thing that i hated the most is when vin jumps from the car grabs our ghost for those who might not have seen any of the previous ones i dont wanna spoil it thats why i dont say the name and they land on top of the car without breaking any bones so that was unrealistic but anyways fast amp furious was never meant to be taken seriously anyways guys
how should i start off this wonderful review
hmm
maybe i should start off by saying this movie is probably the best one yet in the fast and furious serious
maybe i could even say this movie is the best movie of 2013
this movie is what some people like me like to call diversified i mean it has a little bit of action comedy and a slight bit of romance
theres this special type of bond that paul walker and vin diesel have when they are acting together its like they bring out the best of each other and when you have two good actors that can do something like that it helps the other actors in the movie step their game up
ide also like to give congrats to the director of the film justin lin for another job well done
he never fails to amaze me with greatness
to sum this whole thing up this movie is great and should be seen by any and everybody
the story line is continued from the previous part
so you will find relations and references to their previous parts
it is satisfactory actually
in here they have added back a few characters lost a few
and i should say they are gonna introduce a really special character in their 7th part i should keep that a secret for now
totally combined package of guns blood bullets cars and everything you can imagine in a vin diesel  dwayne johnson kind movies
and for action i should say they have really worked hard
forget critics
if you are in the fastnfurious line this is a must watch
also they have got a tank
worth the buck
just came back from watching the 6th installment of the fast and furious franchise and it lives up to its expectations and then some
the film brings the old crew back together for a final job to stop a criminal only they can stop and of course the rock approaches them for this final task
there is plenty of action a few racing scenes and as you can expect cars being destroyed and hand to hand combat taking place
the film offers more action then fast 5 but i enjoyed them equally
there is also some scenes that will make you laugh thanks to the character that tyrese gibson plays
just when you think the film is over it is not and you are given one final encore
when the film finally does end you will see a message stating not to attempt the stunts in the movie and then you are shown a race taking place in tokoyo with an unexpected surprise waiting for you if no one has ruined it yet
the film is a little over 2 hours but enjoyed every minute
what an addition to the already top class franchise
this is paul walkers best performance of all the parts
vin diesel plays dom wellas always and dwayne johnson is the quirkysmartbig cop
luke evans plays shaw so wellhes one of the best villains of the series
the entire star cast looks well adapted to their respective character which makes the plot more believable
the action sequences are crazy
letty returnsmakes it even crazier
inspite of such a crowded star casttheres no confusion whatsoever throughout the movie
gal gadots tragic end is touching
so is hans
overallthe movie may not have such a strong storylinebut it more than makes up for it with its soulits 12 year old coresuperb actiongreat actorscrazy stunts and of coursethat background score
alsoits wonderful how the value of family is showcased
for meits superhitadrenaline packed entertainment
this was by far the best of the fast amp furious series
it had a very good storyline a great villain and the action was nonstop from start to finish
cant wait to add the bluray to my collection when it come out
the humor is just the right amount without overshadowing the plot
somehow they continue to seamlessly weave the story lines of all previous fampfs together so that it all comes together with a big aha
dwayne johnson and vin diesel wow
are both very good in their respective roles
there really is no supporting cast in this movie because everyone carries off their roles like lead actors
kudos to the franchise for a great summer kickoff
based on this latest release i cant wait to see whats next
i wasnt sure what to expect when i stood in line for the advance screening of fast and furious 6 four days before it opened in theaters to the public
all i knew was that i was a fan of the franchise thus far and had high expectations
i am so pleased to say that the movie exceeded any of my existing expectations and did some things i didnt expect at all
fight scenes great stunt work fast cars high powered weapons gorgeous men and for the men beautiful women
i suggest that you make sure that you have your drink snacks and whatever else you need to enjoy the movie prior to it starting because if you leave your seat you will miss something
there is a thrill ride every minute in fast and furious 6
action fans unite and go see this movie
dont leave just because the end credits start rolling either
well toretto went for the right thing as far as i am concerned
those black pants with the white design were worth the fight
i couldnt help noticing all those land rovers travelling at break neck speeds
way back when i purchased a surplus british land rover series iia
with fairey hubsoverdrive the best you could ever do was about 50mph
but i guess with a v8 engine you can really push it now
despite all the pyrotechnics i think the storyline was quite believable and the actors were well chosen
michelle rodriguez is striking not so much for the tough fight scenes but more so for a moral toughness
i bet she is like that in real life
the other characters were well played and fit their roles
even though intellectually you know that the scenes cant possibly be real your body believes it
the tank and huge aircraft scenes were scary beyond belief
i cant figure out what type of tank that was sort of a cross between a chieftain amp amx
ok after seeing the trailer and seeing the airplane i thought this is gonna be horrible and guess what
it was awesome
honestly there isnt a single franchise that has the 6th film be the best until now
everyone is back the story was great then action was seriously out of this world
this film makes iron man 3 look like garbage
i mean that
this is without a doubt the action film of the summer and is going to be very difficult to top
and like all great movies the ending was perfect
go see it i will be seeing it again and without a doubt buying this one on bluray
if the trailer is stopping you from seeing this dont let it its so worth your time and money
after watching the trailer you go to the cinema with some ideas or fears of silly fun
not at all
this movie is a really really enjoyable fun packed in a superb dose of action
maybe 10 is a very high note but thinking on the kind of movie we decide to see is what it deserves
the movie have a lot of jokes that really work well with the plot
its hard to get that combination plotjokes work properly but this is one of that rare cases
about the action the scenes looks very natural maybe some annoying close ups but overall very good job with chasing scenes
funny nice twists nice action scenes by far the best of the whole series
people was laughing wowing and clapping
you love cars action and fun
then you have to see it and enjoy it asap
is by far the most entertained movie released this year
the last one was good because a lot of action at the rest of the plot but this one connected all the lost cable that bring us the 3 movie tokyo drift
is sad to see how they traded one for one i mean the lost of the girl in the last part but that was necessary but the ending of this movie is going to make another epic fast and furious
i like how the director make this movie a lot of action a little of drama a little of sad part even race like the old times in the first movie
something that i did not saw was tego calderon and don omar
but vin diesel told that in the next movie will be in puerto rico or almost some part of it so the next one will be a revenge plus a add to the family of toreto the protagonist of the tokyo drift
is logical he is going to revenge his friend hank
so if you are reading this go see the movie and prepare to be 2 hours of action and in the last minute of the movie dont go  sit and watch the last part
this is not a movie its a clipshow of stunts
theres not a lot of point in reviewing fast amp furious 6 because nobody is going to watch this as a movie youll watch it to see the stunts and youll watch it for only as long as the escalating scope and scale of those stunts can hold your attention
for what its worth the heart of the i use this term loosely plot is a mcguffin
usually this device is used to drive a story in the case of fampf 6 the only thing it drives is cars trucks a plane and
uhm no that might count as a spoiler
lets just say theres a sequence that is a militarists wet dream and walk away
no character development an awesome array of destruction no wit no sense and dialogue unworthy of an 8th grade melodrama
but we do get to watch listen and cringe as vin diesel tries to do sensitive and romantic
thats worth something
but in the end remember that paul walker died making fampf 6 and that is both tragic and ironic
this movie by far is the best in the series
its filled with lots f action and the story is just excellent
its well written and id say one of the best written trilogies
they have 6 about to be 7 of these and it is still awesome
usually sequels dont last after the third one but this one is at 6 and it is still an outstanding movie
i dont know anyone who wouldnt like this movie
i also think this it one of the best movies ive seen and i cant wait for the seventh to be released but i hope the fact that its a different director doesnt change it in any way
im expecting a lot from the seventh
so awesome movie most people should love this
sometimes trailers are fast and original movie fails to deliver
this time its not the case
fast 6 is exactly what it promises to be
fast stylish crafty and intelligent
from the montage video in the title song we own it including important scenes from all the movies except tokyo drift  the series finally connects tokyo drift to fast 5
the stunt scenes including the tank are one of the best ones i have seen ever
and the emotional side of vinn diesel is one of the best
its sad that they took han and gisele out of the equation since they are one of the coolest people in the movie
this movie is definitely the finest fast and furious movie ever
loved it
must watch
i looovvveeed this moviewe were glued to our seats
let me just saythere is a lot of eyecandy in this movie
justin and vin did it again those guys
i wasnt sure about another moviebut there will be another
really most of the action was so new unlike so many movies out today
i am not sure who i like the most all of the stars are excellent and we hope the girl isnt really dead
the endingwho would have expected to see jasonthere are beautiful men in this movieomg
i am a criticserious movie watcherand i love talent
this movie is not a 10but a twelveeasy
great job guysand us moms really appreciate the fact that our familys can view this together
well done fellowswell done
i think this one is the best in the series
it has action fast cars and great stunts
the franchise is just going to get better and better
i would make one change and that is to return to its roots drag racing and a bit less circuit racing
dont get me wrong i love the movie but drag racing is just so much more exciting
i was really pleased with the return of michelle rodraguez i love her character
the car selection is great from the nissan skyline to the 74 ford escort rs2000
the casting is great all my favourite actors and actresses are back and looking good
the fight scenes where very well choreographed and very entertaining
and the way the audience is told about letty was very well planned out and brilliantly executed
i just loved the movie overall but  gal gadot should not die in the movie and also han dies in the upcoming part
i feel they give a soul essence to the movie they must not die
a movie ending on a good note is always loved by people
sir please see to this
jason staham is a great actor but just to bring a change in the new part old characters bust not be disturbed much
the problem i felt in the whole harry potter series
thanks but no doubt its a good movie with tremendous action scenes
a few points on which i will suggests you that like letti comes back in the series
somehow please try to restore the roles of gal and han
excellent movie indeed well
dom nick  vin  u made up
dude
excellent action scenes made up
i meant
every one
including paul walker and d
smith as well
waiting for fast and furious 7 movie actually goes up when obrians wife get kidnapped
else everything were going smoothly and what about latty
btw shez back no doubt
american hero
d
smith
awesome actions
especially fight scenes and all the team members of fast and furious series has done a great job
love this movie in fact
and i hope in next season of 7 you guys gonna rock everything
as of now you are doing well
you have won lot of hearts indeed
one is mine for sure
this is a great movie
this movie grabs and holds your attention as you go for fast and furious ride with the now familiar group of guys and gals who are tough on the outside and strong and good on the inside
this is michelle rodriguezs best movie to date
she is a wonderful actress and delivers another great performance and dominates her scenes
the rest of the cast is excellent too
vin diesel and dwayne johnson once again team up to create a lot of excitement
the story itself is great
it contains almost nonstop action interspersed with clever lines
the good guys are good and the bad guys are bad
luke evans delivers a strong performance as the lead bad guy shaw
although the story is farfetched and stretches the boundaries of plausibility still it works and as a result is entertaining and for that reason alone this movie is worth watching
the movie was big
it had a large scale
it had good actors and a big budget
but poor direction and bad story left it as a more than disappointing experience
the director seems to not have even the basic grasp of elementary physics
my woes arise from the many lost opportunities
there are many movies out there which have a shitty storyline but great action to make up for it die hard 5 comes to mind
but this couldnt even achieve that
the action choreography seemed to have been done by a child playing with action figures
the movie is plagued with bad dialogues and stupid attempts at comedy
frankly the only thing positive about the movie is the cast
overall it is not worth your money
this movie should have been called gone in 60 secs because thats when i felt like leaving
im giving this movie a 2 star rating because it was pretty cool when the 2 semis crashed on the highway and exploded in slowmotion
otherwise this franchise seems to have died off long ago
its no longer about the cars and racing but horrible subplots about people id rather see written off then saved
paul walker is as bad as ever but good thing is he was barely in this
vin diesel is getting to old to act and its showing
the rock also seems juiced up like always
paul walker is so bad i wanted to say it twice
if you are familiar with the newer mission impossible movies then youve pretty much already know the story
i would rather xxx then this pos
i still dont understand how the series has gone so very wrong since the 1st film was only half bad
you know how at the end of the 1st one
where vin diesel flips the cool classic car
i really wish it had landed on top of paul walkers car and killed them so this movie would have never existed
i really did not like the first movie of the fast and the furious
i like 2 fast 2 furious
i also liked fast and the furious tokyo drift
but this is better
this is a great movie
it has a great story line
it also has great acting
it has a lot of action
fast and the furious new model original parts is better
fast five is also better
furious 7 is also better
7
1 is a good ratting
but this is such a great movie that 7
1 is underrating it
i give it 8
because it is a great movie
if you like action movies then you will like this movie
this is a lot better the v of vendetta
it is a lot better then 300
this is better then suicide squad and that is not easy to do
see this movie
warning this may contain spoilers this was the biggest and the best one of the franchise
the cast is amazing each actor shines brightly in their roles
vin diesel paul walker michelle rodriguez dwayne johnson gina carano
the action is fantastic
aside from the action the film has a nice sense of humour producing a few big laughs over the course of the movie
the film is fast paced and doesnt slow down
the film has an awesome set of fight scenes
the gina carano and michelle rodriguez fighting scenes is one of the films best parts
they both show impressive skills
the main villain is good well played by luke evans
the death of paul walker was very sad i miss that guy
the director of furious 6 justin lin
he really makes this his best action film ever
watching this movie on the day it was released in cinemas in my country it was one of the most awesome cinematic experiences of my life
it is a movie that knows what it is and remains that way from beginning to end
it is a movie that every one should watch
it is lots of fun
