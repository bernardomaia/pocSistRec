friends with benefits has a predictable and unoriginal romcom storyline and its ending is pretty lame
yet this movie coasts on the charisma of justin timberlake and mila kunis and a lot of sharp and witty dialogue
as long as these two actors are talking to each other or having sex there is hardly ever a dull moment
and the reason for this seems to be simple enough
in most romcoms the actors play pretty dimwitted boring and superficial people and therefore there is no reason to take interest in anything they may say or do
in this romcom friends with benefits timberlake and kunis play fresh independent and smart people and for this reason we are interested in the lives they lead and what they say to each other
so friends with benefits does not have much of a plot but that does seem to matter because on this rare occasion we are happily distracted by the magnetism of two capable on screen actors who are playing two wellcraft parts
this movie is just
ugh
i got halfway through it and realized that i literally did not care what happened at all
i wouldnt have cared if one of them was hit by a truck and died that was the result of unconvincing characters who just sound like their spewing out bad jokes from their memorised script
this movie didnt even have the bright side of good actors justin timberlake and mila kunis may be easy on the eye but are mediocre actors at best you only have to watch mk in oz the great and powerful to see what i mean
its just so boring and predictable and as the movie goes on it gets more and more cheesy
the plot is so unbelievably clicha that you only have to read the description on the back to know whats going to happen
15 minutes into this movie and i have no idea who these two main characters are
i assume i am supposed to take the dialogue lines of eachs partner breaking up with them at face value giving us some insight into our main characters inner problems but i cant
it just all to superficial and neither of the divorced shows any emotional reaction
so nothing to identify here
neither with our characters profession two real super successful hotshots in ny now which simply aint close enough at home for a mass audience
should we admire this denverclanesque setup
but the biggesst flaw really isnt the story or unlikeable characters the real caveat is the pacing
there is simply is none
this movie moves along in a manner like it were telling you what do i care if youre watching
on the bottomline not all engaging not funny not interesting not fresh not making your heart raise or slow down just an empty shell of nothingness that happened to got almost written and film through some camera
stay away
it sucks
is not
and maybe is good
justin timberlake is like a piece of wood
and wood express emotions very hardly
is not
because sex is like tennis so
its predictable from begging to end
is not comedy to
i try very hard to find any funny moments
was hopeless
ok
its maybe any interesting story here
which mean
you can watch this movie and you dont know what happen next
sorry
no
wooden hero meets beautiful girl go to bed split up hero talk with yoda they meet again
end of story
familiar
to much familiar for me
a few weeks ago i saw no strings attached
there natalie portman can lift and rescue this movie
another wooden hero btw  ashton kutsher
big mila kunis eyes cant help here
its a pity
so
what you get
you can remember something when you get out from cinema
not too much i think
nothing maybe
you forgot this movie before you arrive home
my prediction for golden raspberries this year  worst scenario  worst couple  worst male performer  worst director
what a waste of time
same boring script weve seen time and time again
might have been a better movie if timberlake and harrelson exchanged roles
horrible
way overboard with the sexual situations and language
couple of narcissistic persons with a complete lack of morality try to hook up
you know every move before it happens
i wonder if they have run out of ideas in hollywood
the background music was way too distracting
i wasnt sure if they were showing a movie or promoting a music cd
timberlake is completely unbelievable in his role
i thought i was watching that seventies show with the cast they had
forget this one and rent another movie
i was actually embarrassed for the headline actors justin timberlake and mila kunis
the material was not good nor were the jokes
justin timberlake was bad enough to begin as usual
mila kunis is normally better than this
i guess she was playing down to her material and costar
either way the acting was horrible as was the plot and the direction
a negative trifecta
if there were any redeeming factors to the film it was the supporting actors
all of which i felt did an excellent job with the material they had to work
patricia clarkson woody harrelson richard jenkins and even jenna elfman respectively
the film was predictable which is ok in this genre
just a sloppy project in every facet
save your time and bypass this one
yes the movie made money
yes it was filmed in l
a
and n
y
where else duh
yes the old salesmen trick of repackaging the same product to sell to the same schmuck by changing the packaging a little works as usual and always has and always will
so what do the cloistered writers producers and directors in n
y
amp l
a
do with their lives well sit in little pretend manly cubicles trying to tweak another dollar out of the romcom boxedin consumer
what is the formula thats tweaked
middle class white professionals that cuss a lot to bluff toughness sex dominates their discussions monetary self interest dominates their social consciousness parties bars and objects dujour their support system
whats tweaked
change an actor or two but not too many change an officeoccupation but not too many change the social scenes but not too many
everything else stays the same predictable self including the ending
ah hah moment the monetary comfort of predictability in exchange for the psychological comfort of predictable fantasy
i might be in the minority but i found this film an example for all romantic comedies of the future
it has an extremely selfaware script which follows the stereotypical romantic comedy formula while endlessly mocking it simultaneously
the chemistry between timberlake and mila kunis is amazing and is enough to carry the film at its running length
the standout supporting performers however are woody harrelson and patricia clarkson
it is a hilarious film and is one of the few romantic films which never runs out of passion or steam
even though it bears many similarities to films like no strings attached it actually delivers on its concept better and its much more likable
yes i know its a chick flick
but on a cross country flight i had to pick something to watch on the airplane seat screen and already saw moneyball the first couple hours of the flight so i gave this a try
i cant stand justin timberlake and quite honestly he seems like another gay guy unsuccessfully trying to pass off as a straight guy but mila kunis is still a hottie so at least theres some eye candy
the movie is supposed to rip on romantic comedies but quickly becomes the very thing it rips on
it gets quite predictable and anyone in the audience could have written the ending for it
also its more than obvious that a few l
a
locations were trying to be passed off as new york like the airport scenes
overall not the worst movie ever but pretty much forgettable
this was a very 21st century movie
it seemed like it was trying too hard to avoid being clicha but it just ended up being clicha with a twist
it was enjoyable to watch and fun to see justin timberlake and mila kunis in action
above all the soundtrack is awesome just like the movie hints
the good thing about this movie that stands out against the rest of its kind is that theres more to it than the title implies
most people have to learn the hard way in life few save themselves in time
the ending credits were so much fun that i had to sit until the very end
they did a great job on this movie
few romantic comedies nowadays have as much creativity as this movie does
the premise of friendships with benefits is not a novel thing in hollywood
some might even say that it is a very old motif and lacking in originality
and they would be right
more so when two extremely similar films are released within the very same year
if you missed it the other one is no strings attached and looks like a carbon copy of friends with benefits
the punch lines and jokes delivered by main leads kunis and timberlake are often clinical and sound rushed in
it fails to connect emotionally seemingly missing the mark as a romantic comedy on the other hand the comedic parts are rather acceptable due to the help of supporting cast specifically a note worthy performance from woody harrelson and amusing cameo appearances by shaun white
i have no problem believing that kunis and timberlake are good off screen friends
but on screen they completely lack chemistry thus leaving the stereotyped ending lifeless and unromantic
if you are looking for a good romantic comedy this movie isnt it
friends with benefits is complicated
this movie does feature some good performances including justin timberlake mila kunis and woody harrelson
the script is alright clicha at times
you may be surprised to know that this movie actually does have a sweet undertone and heart felt moments
sure there are racy sex scenes involved of course there are you know that from the title but this movie has more to it than just that
there are some funny lines but unfortunately not enough
the movie drags a bit at times it slows down and you really dont want it too so thats one issue
the sex scenes are comical and hot and they work for this film
also the sexual content and nudity isnt too overly graphic so it isnt uncomfortable or awkward in any way
so overall a 610 almost but not quite
friends with benefits does not redefine the tried and tested romcom formula
it is pretty much the same as any of the other movies from this genre
however the lead actors justin timberlake and mila kunis have a mesmerizing chemistry which makes the movie really watchable
the writing is crisp and witty
the story is about two people who decide to have sex without getting in a relationship
however they eventually develop feelings for each other without admitting it
the film separates itself from the bunch by being selfconscious as the leads repeatedly mention the fact that their story is similar to a hollywood movie
however some of the melodrama seems contrived when everything seemed to be going perfectly well between the two
mila kunis shines in this movie and is extremely likable
watch it for the chemistry and sharp dialog
first half was not bad but the seconds was totally clicha
this movie makes you laugh but the real comedy is in the first half of itthe subject seems good amp the dialogs are not bad
about the seconds i can tell you that the romantic part begins amp its just like the clicha comedy amp romantic movies but it must be told that the movie itself with the showing of jason segels film tells that the end is so clicha amp we could assume that as a difference between this romantic amp the others
my suggestion the movie is not bad to see but you shouldnt have the special expectations from this film than the other comedy amp romantic movies
aimed squarely at the 1430 year old crowd benefits has two young professionals becoming friends and then sexual partners the idea being that they will not become emotionally attached
they will not be the conventional boyfriend and girlfriend as played out in the movies they love to mock
this sort of relationship is common enough in real life  all one has to do is watch divorce court
but for purposes of this fantasy we accept the situation as out of the norm
justin timberlake and mila kunis are the leads and jenna elfman woody harrelson and pat clarkson are on hand for support
veteran character actor richard jenkins plays timerlakes dad who is slowly slipping into dementia
the sex scenes are tame for an rrated flick and played strictly for laughs
they are in no way erotic for you worried parents out there
also for most of the movie kunis doesnt look all that appealing
her makeup and hair are all wrong until the closing scenes when she finally looks like the attractive actress we know
perhaps this was done on purpose
i suspect it was
i had seen no strings attached before i saw this one and everyone seemed to think that it was a great movie and that this one was not worth watching
i was anxious to watch this one and see if they were all correct
in my honest opinion friends with benefits blew no strings attached out of the water
i dont really have much desire to watch no strings attached again but i would love to see friends with benenfits many many more times
i enjoyed the humor in this movie
i love woodys performance as the gay guy
he did a super job
it was also refreshing to me to see mila and justins characters seem so comfortable with each other in all ways
they worked well together and brought something new
i cant wait to buy this dvd
810
pretty good and funny
sometime mild predictable moments but it was forgiving because of the situation
the acting and chemistry between justin timerlake and mila kunis was great
there was a good mix of drama and comedy and the film wasnt overdone with clichas apart from when the film deliberately was meant to be clicha as a joke
highly recommended dramacomedyromance film
if you are a guy dont get put off with the romance aspect of the film its not lingered upon much and is more comedy and drama and enough to appeal to a group of friends who want to see a good comedy film at the cinema or just a adult couple who want to see something for a good laugh
friends with benefits may be the first romantic comedy to be just as enjoyable for dudes as it is for girls if not more
the cleverly written witty dialogue delivered by the allaround cool guy justin timberlake and the newest itgirl of hollywood the sexy and funny mila kunis are both amazingly likable in this movie
the onscreen chemistry between the two is obvious and the way the characters they play keep on oneupping each other with witty oneliners is hilarious
timberlake and kunis are comedic geniuses and they provide laughs without ever trying too hard or being overly inappropriate
the casting of the movie is excellent i very much prefer this movie over the similarly themed no strings attached
watch this not for the plot but the actors you wont regret it
a film which should suit any age
romance and comedy which is the perfect combination
most people in live have attempted to have a friend with benefit and this film tells you why its difficult to keep it
with the sexy actor justin timberlake and beautiful mila kunis you watch two people who start of having a bit of fun end up falling for each other
its not all about the sex a part of dylans timberlake live has a secret which can relate to those who are also struggling with someone alzheimers
i loved the film and it suits anyone weather or not you havent had a friend with benefit as it just makes you laugh throughout
all my friends have loved this film as it relates to everyone so you should watch it too i highly recommend it
sexy smart and hilarious fwb is a great romantic comedy for adults
this outrageous film staring the spunky and beautiful mila kunis and justin timberlake will have you smiling throughout the whole movie
it gives you all of what a romantic comedy would
even though it is the same old romanticcomedy genre it is still enjoyable to watch
fwb really defines true love as well it teaches you a valuable lesson dont ever lose your first love
the whole concept of the movie is very related to a lot of people
of you love those romantic comedies that make you laugh and cry as well fwb is the way to go
even though like all romantic comedies it gets serious at the end it is still a good film to watch
fwb is the way to go if you are craving for a good romantic comedy that you havent seen in a while
before to go thought it was a cheesy movie and was not really r interested since the trailer is not good at all and doesnt really r brought out how funny the movie is since it promotes a regular topic
r but still gave it a chance and just came back and i was not r disappointed at all
it was really funny and i really enjoyed this r movie laugh a lot and enjoyed it for the jokes and how reality kicks r in
r r i think the advertisement was of bad quality and dont show the quality r of the movie and i misleading
r r overall the movie was really good and funny
also i love mila kunis but r thought that timberlake would be a joke but he was really good as well
r worth watching
also cant be compared to no strings attached which r was terribly bad
i loved this movie
saw a free preview of it last night and was pleasantly surprised
i was not expecting much because im not a huge fan of justins but it turned out great and mila was perfect and gorgeous
very sarcastic funny and reminded me of some friends of mine
i laughed the whole way through
only a couple of small corny parts that slightly threw it off but you had to expect it because its a chic flick
i would actually pay to see this again
i tie it with the movie the ugly truth
wish they had more of milas mom and justins gay coworker and the ending could have been more like the movie chillfunnynot so mushy
also the sexy scenes could have been a little more
