woody allens love affair with france which goes back decades finds its finality with midnight in paris the latest of allens parisian brochures which recently opened at the cannes film festival on wednesday
the good news is that allen seems to be paying attention in a way he hasnt always done in recent films and has found a way to channel his oftencaustic misanthropy halfcomic fear of death and antiamerican bitterness into agreeable comic whimsy
the nominal point of midnight in paris is that weve all got to make the best of life in our own time while longing for a past that probably never existed
if anything allen seems to be rebuking himself ever so mildly for his compulsive romanticism his obsession with the past and his disconnection from contemporary american life
allen has baked us a sweet airy parisian dessert with just a sense of sentimental substance in the finish
one of his better films in his latter years
the love between the french and the americans has always been mixed with an element of dismissal even contempt but the love is real
woody allen walks that fine line in truly inspired fashion
midnight in paris is a delight
this is he first time i actually loved owen wilson
he is terrific as woodys alter ego
rachel mcadams superb
her mean american girl is hilarious and frighteningly recognizably so are kurt fuller and mimi kennedy as her parents
what a chillingly awful normal pair
i loved the moment in which owen wilson in a great close up comes to accept whats happening around him
i accepted it too
happily
another stand out moment the meeting with salvador dali played brilliantly over the top by adrien brody
highly recommended
quite a lot of great lines carrying lifes wisdom profound reflection and insight of living the precious present expressed in a lighthearted touch
if you have your own golden age fantasy you will likely enjoy it
this movie seems to be relatively more straightforward in communicating its message than some of allens other works such as you will meet a tall dark stranger
as a plus lovely cinematography of the city of paris  mr
allen has apparently fallen in love with the good old and charming european major cities e
g
london paris barcelona and etc
very likely you will leave the movie theater with a big and warm smile on your face
woody allen takes paris and bathes it within its own glory all the while making one of his most entertaining films in decades
great cinematography classic music french food french culture and allens trademark humor are pure magic
you may see some of the familiar character types from other films but they only add to the mixture
odd man out is owen wilson but somehow he sheds his bmovie past and encompasses the woody allen humor without mimicking allen
the everevolving plot twists will have you laughing as well as entranced
this is the first allen film in a long time where he doesnt pontificate about life and death but only celebrates the present while ironically living in two eras
this is beyond oscar material
i love woody allen so already im biased
but even i will admit that hes been spotty for the last
my god
twenty years or so
curse of the jade scorpion will forever be his lowest moment and in his later phase match point and vickie christina barcelona remain the highlights
well we can add another to that list
by no means is this movie an annie hall or a manhattan let alone a husbands and wives
but if youve been bored by what youve been seeing at the multiplexes lately if you think the hangover 2 sucked and youve despaired that the romantic comedy is dead
than im delighted to tell you to go see this movie right now
see it on a big screen
its gorgeous to look at fun to watch romantic sweet smart and pleasantly oldfashioned
this movie is not a masterpiece and yet im giving it 1010 because it was perfect for what it was  a modest pleasure that left me in a great mood and even a little inspired
i really fail to see how this film can attract so many decent reviews
im no film buff but ive seen a fair few in my time and this is probably one of the worst
the scenes of paris are more like a 1980s ministry of tourism project  if you want to see sumptuous paris then look no further than jeanpierre jeunets amelie
the plot is absurd  its like a school film project  hey why dont we cram in as many famous people from the past as we can and then have the main character miraculously be able to go back in time whenever he wants
even this could be tolerated if it werent for all the cringeworthy lines such as when the main character walks into a room to meet gertrude stein and she leans over and says hey pablo what yer paintin or something equally painful in order to shoehorn in another famous character
wooden acting appalling script truly terrible stuff
after an interminable opening montage of establishing tourist shots of paris if it had been london there would have been red phone boxes and double decker buses not a north african mugger or traffic gridlock in sight all to the accompaniment of woody allens hornblowing we have woody allen directing a woody allen script in which owen wilson plays a writer of scripts who talks acts and dresses like woody allen after half an hour or so of bythenumbers comic clichas about culturally insensitive americans and pompous pseudointellectuals oh the irony
the plot stumbles into goodnight sweetheart territory as woody sorry owen stumbles through a time porthole into a 1920s paris where you cannot order a coffee without salvador dali asking have you met my friends luis bunuel and man ray
just when you think it cannot get any crasser woody er owen er woody trowels on a hallmark moral about living in the present before ditching his materialistic american girlfriend to take up with a french chick who shares his love of walking in the rain
i am astounded that this film is amongst the oscar nominees for 2012
if there was a category for best travel film it would win hands down as the cinematography is first class in its depiction of paris
but the plot is so shallow as to be transparent
the characters are likewise and define the term clicha
owen wilsons whiney portrayal of what is clearly supposed to be woody allen himself is irritating in the extreme except when he puts michael sheens character in his place with a critique of a picasso painting which i admit was the highlight of the film
i am aware of allens politics but surely he is more intelligent than hitting us over the head with his obscenely wealthy american sledgehammer of a republican family
the film is worth the nomination for art direction but the other three nominations are undeserved and to think that this sorry apology of a film has been nominated for best film when tinker tailor soldier spy has been overlooked is nothing short of scandalous
if you want some good shots of paris see the film otherwise pass it by
woody allen directs owen wilson a typical example of a modern american actor in a movie built on two elements  the magic of the city of light and the unbelievable spiritual and artistic prosperity of the 20s
as the protagonist travels back in time the viewers have the joy of watching parade in front of their eyes the creme de la creme of the artistic world of the time  the fitzgeralds hemingway eliot picasso just to name a few
some may find it a bit slow for their taste but it is certainly an interesting positive and entertaining film
a movie that reminds you that there was a time when bars were filled with stimulating conversation when everybody dreamed of becoming a poet when great people lived and thrived
this film is a genuine feel good film with a unique plot and a genuine character development
the beginning of the film sees the main character gil a bumbling confused and lost man but as the film goes on becomes more confident and sure of himself and what he wants
the famous characters he encounters such as hemingway dali ella fitzgerald were very cleverly portrayed
the scenes in paris are beautiful and magical the music a tad monotonous but i got used to it and it soon added to the charm
this film was simply charming clever well acted and well directed
after watching it i felt a warm happy feeling that not so many films have managed to do
good job woody
i dont love owen wilson but i think this role gets every good quality out of him possible and his charm really drives the film forward
midnight is the perfect woody pic because it has lightness comedy human neurosis philosophical drivel and hatred for the same philosophical drivel all wrapped up together
i love the more apatow sort of comedies that dominate today but this was a more classic and thoughtprovoking sort of film that i think raises the standard and refreshes the palette
i think it is great when a comedy can be nominated for best picture and this one certainly deserves to be this year
go see it for date night and if you are with the right sort of woman when you do you should marry her
this is the height of solipsism
in the extras in the bluray woody allen mentions in the cannes interview something about this movie that gives a clue about why it is so lifeless and pretentious he just wanted to show the beauty of the paris in a movie and shoot a movie for that story be damned
why not just ask the paris tourist bureau that he would do it for them at a discounted rate so he can indulge into something he wanted to do in a proper context
i went to see this movie hoping that it would be as decent as vicky christina barcelona with barcelona replaced by paris and the rest of the charm intact
i was so wrong
oh well i am not repeating the story etc
here as plenty of the reviewers did but you are warned
modernday hollywood screenwriter and novelist on vacation in france with his fiancae and her parents travels back in time to paris in the 1920s via a magical taxicab meeting legendary literary and artistic figures who help the writer put his work and his lovelife into focus
writerdirector woody allen seemingly in love with paris himself appealingly uses fantasy to both confuse and clarify reality
but without interesting disarming central characters the confection seems to cool early on
stepping in for woody lead owen wilson doesnt have a dynamic screen presence he fades into the foreground and even the comedic scenes that should work the smoothestsuch as a bit involving rachel mcadams missing earringshave a bland denouement
allens nostalgia for the past is fun for awhile but he doesnt use it to build momentum fairly soon were stuck in a revolving door of personalities and romantic couplings sequences which have an attractive sheen but ultimately feel a little underwhelming
from
i failed to make it beyond the first 20 minutes of midnight in paris
that miserable time was filled with a everincreasing pity for such hopelessly selfabsorbed people
sadly every woody allen movie i have seen which is by no means all has been populated exclusively with characters devoid of the quality that i cherish in real people a recognition of some thing which is greater than themselves
allens characters always seem to follow the same circular shallow lives it starts with conflicting introspection then falseawareness always followed by the deep wallowing creep of a search for a selfinduced problem that would not have existed had their selfabsorption not been their best quality
is allen incapable of writing a character that has faith
surely he must have met a person in his life to draw upon somewhere that was not endlessly bumping into other peoples psyches constantly wondering what is wrong with themselves
well maybe not
its weird for me that most of the storys ingredients didnt really interest me much
despite with all those big names in the cast list i didnt really feel that it makes the story as a whole the more interesting
one thing that interested me the most is whether the whole thing is only gils imagination or what
and the movie did enough to show that its actually a magical time travel movie after all
the thing is just like many other woody allen movies this one explored so many plot branches that becomes significant enough at the ending but this movie didnt give any of them justice in terms of solving them
this movie has many characters but they dont really develop much
the movie only relies on initial impressions of the characters much like theyre monotonous in their life or experiences
the acting overall felt really decent
with all those bigger names in the cast list its strange that only owen wilson gets to do significant parts
that said owens acting really is eclipsed by the potential that other cast members can have here but didnt do
this film will appeal to individuals with a certain orientation and background
if you feel the term romantic applies in your case you will likely enjoy this movie
and if you are steeped in the romance of the jazz age and belle epoque you will likely love it
i saw it around the time it came out and just now again
watching it this time i appreciated the fact that mr
allen cast another actor to be his protagonist
the persona he affected on the screen was limiting as the novelty wore off
having someone else in the lead makes him much more an everyman given the context
i found the other actors successful in their roles but as the late roger ebert pointed out kathy bates is especially outstanding as gertrude stein completely fulfilling my idea of what stein must have been like
if the times and place portrayed in this movie resonate with you already you are in for a treat
if not its oh nonot liver and onions again
i dont know what to make of this film im normally not mr
alans target audience
in all honesty i generally avoid his films
that being said i fell in love mr
alans dream his vision of paris
i feel compelled to tell everyone who has not seen this film to watch it and those whove indulged in it and genuinely enjoyed it as i have to share in my happiness
the crisp notes the smell of freshly pressed newspaper the smell of unfiltered tobacco i loved it all
the only truly sad moment with films such as these is the profound loss at having them end together with the fact this kind of love only exists on screen
true romance and conversation  music and beautiful leading ladies who sweep you off your feet with that simple amp delicious elegance
thank you mr
alan for the two hours of true love now back to reality
you definitely need to be in the right mood for thisluckily i was and enjoyed it throughout and could have watched for longer
of course the characterisations of the famous historical figures must be taken with a pinch of salt
yet it felt like a celebration of these figures and also introduced me to the wonders of alternative filmmaker luis bunuel which is certainly not a bad thing
as with many of his films if allen doesnt play the lead role then whoever does seems to be doing an impression of him
wilson did do this but had enough charisma and ability to shine through
mcadams also does a good job and of course so does the beautiful paris
midnight in paris is a very imaginative and entertaining film about that you should appreciate what you have in the present
the film is very nicely filmed and it shows much of the citys beautiful surroundings
its a really fun film filled with wonderful music and the actors were really good
during the film there was a lot of funny situations that gil owen wilson ended up in and i could identify myself with the character many times throughout the movie
although i thought the movie was predictable i didnt think it was any less boring
i recommend the movie to anyone who just wants to watch a nice and fun movie
i actually thought this movie was quite entertaining and had some rather funny parts
i was forced to watch wa films growing up and couldnever have understood his appeal
i dont think any of his films are very funny and ive seen about a half dozen parents love him
this film however appeals to a wide variety
owen wilson and rachel mcadems arent the only appeal but they certainly do help with the appeal of the movie
they played their parts perfectly but the content of the movie also should appeal to different generations and people of varying degrees of intellectual and humorous levels
i was not familiar with all of the characters but its not important to the overall storyline
overall the movie was very entertaining and enjoyable
i think it is a very delighful film that conveys a message that says  follow your instinct  and you wont see this image of the the movie until you reach the end and that is the beauty of this movie when you realize and see what it intends to convey at the end
i wish i could describe this movie in very few words but unfortunately the policy of website does not allow to say no more
however let me say that whether youre into comedyactionhorrorscience fiction or anything you should not miss the opportunity to see such an inspiring movie that opens and awakens your mind to a lot of things happening in your life
i know you might say this is too much to say about a movie but i believe that you will see what i saw and you will not regret seeing this beautiful movie
this is a film which i will not tell you much about storywise because you need to be surprised when you see it as i was
on a cold winter day i grabbed a few dvds from the local bookmobile and this is one of them
figuring if woody allen name is on something i probably wont hate it
au contraire
i loved it
this film starts out with a picturepost card view of paris and the film warms up from there
mr
allen shows why he is one of our finest filmmakers
in an interview he says that when starting out he just had the title with no story to go with it
what a neat story he concocted
id like to tell you more but that would only spoil the fun for you
see this feelgood movie and see if you dont well just feel good by the time it is over
a frustrated american writer owen wilson playing a role allen would have played himself 30 years agoon his hols in paris with his obnoxious materialistic fianca finds his midnight strolls turning into time travel back to paris golden years of the 1920s and the 1880s and along the way meets all manner of artistic and literary greats from paris past such as dali scottfitzgerald hemingwaymetisse etc and in the doing so realises that the past isnt as important as now
both wilson and marion cotillard shine in their roles as does michael sheen as a pedantic and ultimately sleazy friend of wilsons fianca
with great acting and beautifully filmed its a wonderful postcard of paris now and in the past
810
a time
and its crumbs
nothing more
game of testify and irony pieces of lost memories and joy to describe not very bad communism
the details are not important
the exaggeration is only for taste
it is not a documentary
but an exercise to say truth in soft way
so it is nice and amusing
a form to imagine a death world who lives in every slide of romanian reality
a story about people in the skin of totalitarian regime
a masterpiece if compare it with autobiografia lui nicolae ceaueescu
with small ambitions and great sense of ridiculous
with desire to amusing and rediscover years when to survive was the first preoccupation
and title of one talented sugar daddy director
that is all
i worried a bit in the beginning that i might find it a bit banal as i live in europe and paris is not exactly exotic to me
but oh my god the plot was fantastic
deep meaningful and real
owen wilson at his best i always loved his voice natural talent and general style and in this movie his voice and general style is a unique asset
the casting was very spoton
i would have hated to see any other main actor for this movie and the same goes for carla brunis role and most of the other smaller roles
the humor the unexpected turn of events the mystery the romantic turn to the literary past of an old city the beautiful people and gorgeous paris scenes by day and by night were just rich
i would see it again at the drop of a hat
great job
its striking midnight and we all know that means a walk back in time
its an old story in an old city and its pretty to watch
mostly charming but often annoying due to the miscast of owen wilson
it is impossible to buy him in a role of a literary well read author
he just cant pull it off
he and the actress playing zelda are problems and its too bad for all the other really excellent portrayals
the actors playing hemingway and salvadore dali are wonderful as is the brooding picasso
the fiancae her family and the know it all friend are great too
a pleasant pretty film with a great soundtrack and a casting department needing their heads examined
this is an absolutely enjoyable film on every level
my favorite part of the entire film spoiler is the slow realization that appears over wilsons glowing face when he finally realizes he has gone back in time
wilsons sitting at a party having a glorious time with f
scott amp zelda fitzgerald then is astounded to see josephine baker dancing
i could watch this scene a thousand times
this frat pack jerk actually proves theres some depth to him as an actor
first movie he played in that i actually liked
course the fact that i didnt have to put up with ben stiller or will farrell in the same picture probably helped
and i guess woody allen as director though this one seemed rather mainstream for him
one of the only good movies that ive seen in quite some time
strangely enough this film also seems to have won some awards and to have been nominated for several more strange in that my cinematic choices usually differ greatly from the critical reception
well as they say theres no accounting for taste
plus im always drawn to plots involving time travel
see this movie
it will in its own quiet way amaze you
its a romantic setting paris france a romantic story and very interesting
every night at midnight gil owen wilson is waiting on a small street corner for an old car to come by
the car takes him to 1920s paris
the first night hes meeting f
scott fitzgerald and ernest hemingway
a lot of fun
then picasso dali and several other of gils artistic heroes show up on different nights
this movie is well worth seeing and i really enjoyed it a relaxed flick perhaps for a rainy saturday or sunday afternoon
one of my favorite movies of all time
i dont know if its the paris or the protagonists romantic fantasies or the 20s that got me so deep in love with this movie
opening scene with streets of paris and jazz music are something i could watch separately over and over again
the eternal comparison of now and then of our simple everyday life and their amazing life and work
the question we all ask ourselves sooner or later are we born in the wrong century
could we be more successful and accepted in some other era
the fear that we might never be understood by people that surround us and the comfort that we seek in words of those who battled same fears
what happens when we meet those who inspire us
great story great performance beautiful picture
i am not a woody allen fan but have got to hand it to him for this  a film with owen wilson as the male lead that i found thought provoking
come on that couldnt be right
but it is
i myself have often wished for that 24 hours back in 1976 just for one day and wondered how i would perceive it now as opposed to how i did back then well midnight in paris comes close to that reality for gil owen wilsonand i found it captivating  i spent a lot of time in paris in 19981999 and it was wonderful to see so many places i had spent time appearing in the film
if you are a romantic you are going to love gil and gil in paris  i am and i did  gil saw paris with his heart not his eyes  i am a musician and have found many places inspiring i go to them often even if its just to strum a few chords on the guitar if you also pursue anything similar then you will love this movie  if you like to hear the rhythm of paris then i guarantee the opening and closing title music will haunt you
let me start with this generally i dont like woody allens movies for various reasons
but this one is definitely an exception
i enjoyed every minute of it
maybe because i am particularly interested in the 1920s and have written about the americans in paris at that time
the humour is very subtle the romantic charm of paris is present in nearly every scene of the film
there is a very nostalgic mood however it does not depressbut rather fascinates
above all it is a celebration of artistry of creativity which paris has always made to flourish for people from all over the world
we meet the artistic celebrities of the age scott fitzgerald ernest hemingway gertrude stein salvador dali etc
all of whom were charmed by paris for certain periods of their lives
i also liked the juxtaposition reality vs
fantasy
the main character chooses the fantastic world of the imagination rather than the drab reality
it is remarkable that he chooses to remain in paris at the end of the movie
before i start this review id like to just comment on the summary being noted of a quote i really liked in this movie as it doesnt have a tag line which is what i would normally quote
but never mind
midnight in paris
is one of the greatest films ive ever seen
its pure cinematic originality woody allen is a genius in the directors chair as per usual its definitely owen wilsons best film and i have to say i feel like ive honestly had dreams none too dissimilar to this movie
the romance of paris captivates you until the very end and after the movie finishes the characters are all amazingly done you hate elizabeth banks and michael sheen but you love kathy bates and corey stoll
also on a side note marion cotillard is also perfect in this movie
also i felt i could really relate to gil in this movie just his mannerisms and his views resemble my own quite frequently
not only is midnight in paris my favorite woody allen movie but its also in my top 10 movies of all time
when i eventually sort that out
anyone who has visited paris and finds themselves feeling that they miss the city should definitely watch this movie
it manages to capture that palpable atmosphere of the city from the get go and then transports you right into the 1920s
the great artist of the era are effectively played by prominent actors with dali and hemingway standing out in particular
marion cotillard is great playing the muse and captures the essence of a parisian beauty with mystery and beauty
the themes of longing for life in a different era is something that i personally fond myself relating to and the way in which the story resolves itself is very satisfying as you see the protagonist grow
also as a north american i was able to relate to how gil finds a certain magic to paris or europe that other people do not appreciate
the dialogue between the actors of the modern era isnt as snappy as you come to expect of woody allen films but it further shows why gil longs for a different time
im not a huge fan of allens movies but i must say this is a nice one
i felt really happy and after watching it
although its not exactly a masterpiece it lives up to what i expecting
it gives you a good message
if you like a script that tries something new bu simple for sure youre going to like it
the paris scenes at the beginning were great it couldnt start better
some characters are not well fit into to the story like rachel mcadams parents
speaking about her though her character it is the definition of the expression pain in the ass she really shows that she is improving and soon or later we are going to see her at the academys nominees
i never thought i would make a compliment about him but again nice surprise
he carries the whole film without making huge mistakes and most of his scenes are really but really funny
when he mets salvador dala is probably the movie best part
at last i recommend this
not a huge production but it gives you some piece of mind
midnight in paris is refreshingly original romantic comedy there is time travel involved yet a familiar woody allen film in that it is autobiographical in nature and shares similar themes with his other films
the story is about a writer owen wilson who is dissatisfied with life and wishes he could have lived in paris in the 1920s
low and behold he enters an old taxi which takes him to this very time and place every midnight where he meets many famous parisians of the time like hemingway and f
scott fitzgerald
these historical characters are all brilliantly acted my favorite being adrian brody as salvador dali who is hilarious
the film has a great ensemble cast which makes allens writing all the more impressive in that he is able to flesh out all of these characters in only an hour and a half
woody allens midnight in paris is a fantasycomedy shot in a beautifully and descriptive way
the movie tells the story of a nostalgic screenwriter named gil played by owen wilson who goes to paris on a business vacation with his fiancae inez played by rachel mcadamsand her parents played by kurt fuller and mimi kennedy and every day at midnight gil goes back to 1920s paris where he meets his literary idols such as f
scott fitzgerald played by tom hiddleston ernest hemingway played by corey stoll gertrude stien played by kathy batessalvador dali played by adrien brody who is hilarious because he keeps on talking about rhinos and his possible favorite artist pablo picasso played by marcial di fonzo bo
with this movie i think that allens direction for this film was much better than his direction for hannah and her sisters 1986 i hope that all you other woody allen fans dont get offended because i still liked hannah and her sisters
but in the end the end i think allens works are bizarre and interesting at the same time
what a concept
while on a trip to paris with his fiancaes family a nostalgic screenwriter finds himself mysteriously going back to the 1920s every day at midnight
unfairly dismissed by some this is a funny sex comedy
its not the thing to see if youre in the mood for something uplifting or something with tons of action
the film is more than just a glimpse into the life of a man who does know how to live but i was wondering if he served more as a metaphor for everyone of us as a part of the human race who live better when were on a leash
i give it a final rating of 7 out of 10 because its good but also kind of flawed
excellent movie
i felt the euphoria of character to find what he found on the nights of paris
actually always found the past better than the present
but nostalgia is always good
that curiosity to know how things were before us
the woody allen is one such wealth artculture history nostalgia and sensitivity
unfortunately this is not for everyone
a trip of dreams im a writer and this work of woody allen inspired me in many things for me is the best scripts ive seen a masterpiece
charming and delightful
i felt led me to a city beyond the tourist but as if knowing every secret of the city and its magic as one resident who grew up in the city which has much more information on it that but you know every corner every mouthful where all are someone just for tourism never know
owen wilson played a very nice role and her well the character
the casting of this highly complex imaginative film is spot on
hemingway zelda and scott fitzgerald cole porter josephine baker dali charm me into their world of literary and artistic wonder
i bought the film and have watched it several times i realize that its actually about the philosophy of living your best life at the best time which seems perhaps narcissistic but i personally wouldnt mind going back to the twenties in paris
at least the traffic would be manageable
when owen wilson quotes faulkner the past isnt past its still important and affecting us paraphrase i began to see the philosophy of this important film which owen wilson selfeffacing charm adds volumes to
i see this as an important statement about living life to the fullest with the right people at the right time facetoface
its a challenge to the cellphone computer absorption of our current 2014 which erodes the significance of human emotions encounters and literature
i love this movie
owen wilson as you never seen him it hard to know if he living in reality or there is something mentally wrong him it like the new colin farrell film fairy tail in new york he goes to paris to as a film writer with the gorgeous adams as his wife she suffers every night wondering were he goes he goes of to immerse himself in paris to feel the artistic part of his life in the early 20 century he thinks he has meet ernest hemingway to try and get his play filmed he goes to see other writers and dancers to learn the way of looking for inspiration but is he gone mad we dont know great film from woody allen and acted by owen wilson the film is a cross between being john malcovich and the time traveling wife
this is kind of a movie which leave you with wanting more
at the end of it you would think of different possible ending except for the one which actually happened
having said that this movie is a feel good movie and for those having a keen interest on becoming a writer this one is a must watch
this movie keeps you engrossed throughout and dont let you leave the place without finishing it throughout the movie you would say to yourself that this strong build up should meet with an appropriate and if possible a logical end
as per the performance every one gave a sounding work
owen wilson was simple pure and believable one who feel more and think less
i must say he steals the show
rachel mcadams was good in her part and looked convincing
cant say much without revealing the story part which i did not intend
this may not be a great movie but definitely a watchable one
this is one of best movies i have ever watched
owen wilson has done some terrific work in the movie
others to look forward to are rachel mcadams micheal sheen and our beloved tom hiddleson from the avengers
the movie begins with beautiful images of paris and i am hooked to the movie from the very first image
i just freaking love this movie
no offense but if you think this movie is not at all adorable then probably you have a bad taste
the soundtrack of the movie is well written and is beautiful
the screenplay is excellent
there are some goofs especially in the scenes during the 20s but the hooking story acting and the magic of the movie covers it
if have not watched this movie yet please watch it
it will be worth all the dollars you spend on buying the dvd
this movie is really magical
this dreamy film is especially moving due to its atmosphere and i admit i didnt know how to explain it
of course the visuals are stunning but its not just that
obviously the artsy premise is decisive for that magic feel
even owen wilson whom i usually dont like added a touch of innocence and credibility despite the fact that his character was a 21st century allen and well done for that matter
its very rare that a film suggests so strongly an atmosphere
i dont know how much has this artistic and idealized paris in common with the one in the real world of today
but its worth it
previously i wasnt that fascinated by paris as some of my friends
previously
i think that this movie really tells a message that our presentday world is in need of
it aims to make us understand that we should escape more often the rules that govern our daily life our society our entourage everything that surrounds us and makes us act like some robotized creatures dominated by mercantilism and falsity
it tells the story of the intellectual who confronts himself with socalled social problems because of his different way of seeing and experiencing life
paris is a portal for the protagonist through which he accesses the past eras that he thinks he belongs to but also the change of the living ambient that reveals the differences between his and his wifes ways of seeing things and living
great script the movie is catchy from start to end
let me just say it is refreshing to see that people are once again putting heart soul and character back into movies
i am a huge fan of hemingway fitzgerald picasso and many of the other figures that appeared in this movie and i was happy to see them portrayed how i felt to be effectively
even as a conservative i was able to laugh at some of the jokes at the republican partys expense and the tasteless view of the world gils fianca and inlaws were supposed to have as rightwingers
it didnt deter the magic of the movie for me at all and goes to show that even though i might completely disagree with woody allen politically there is no denying his true genius in cinema
very funny very charming and somewhat inspiring
i could see myself in gil more than once and it felt good to have some of my closeted inner feelings about my own generation expressed on the silver screen
great movie would recommend it to anyone for an easy and fun viewing
910
i could not manage to say a word after watching this film
it perfectly captured history and the personality of the figures in history like f
scott fitzgerald his wife zelda and ernest hemingway
owen wilson does a great job as he always does and plays the role with heart
he gives the character a personality in a way that not a lot of actors can
the writing was good and no doubt that helped but it takes a great actor to truly bring a character to life as owen wilson did in this film
the most remarkable thing about this film however is its beauty
it looks incredible
paris is a gorgeous place as everyone knows and it is captured perfectly
everywhere they go has a unique beauty to it and if nothing else it is gorgeous to look at
but the story the characters and the acting make it so much more than just a gorgeous film
it is excellent and i pity you if you have not yet seen it
the colorful musical romantic movie is a special creation by woody allen
the movie was remarkably beautiful the music and background score and cinematography are absolutely fantastic
the director cleverly balanced the future and the past of paris through his cinematic astuteness
the acting of owen wilson was nice and the characters are made so true that it never sounds like acting in this movie
while watching you will definitely feel the warm colorssoothing music and charisma of dialog in the movie
after watching you felt like satisfied and seems like the movie has left a colorful romantic musical print on your mind and heart
it would never be wrong if i say it is one of the best romantic colorful movie made in the recent era
people who love to read classics and admirer of musics and cinema definitely will love this movie
a screenwriter who happens to be an uber fan of literature time travels to 1920s paris to hobnob with his idols while having doubts about his impending marriage in the present
the fantasy element in the plot line coupled with sharp woody allen dialogue makes this film quite enjoyable
although owen wilson plays owen wilson the famous acting cameos keep it interesting
the cinematography captures the whimsy of paris albeit true to reality or not and the soundtrack gives the film a signature sound
allen has a habit of recycling his plots and inner conflicts
midnight in paris is no exception it mirrors manhattan in many aspects
allens foray into the semifantasy genre after nearly ten years pays off in the end
i cant get enough of midnight in paris
i love everything about it
it makes me want to go to paris so bad
it makes me want to go to that place where owen wilson went and heard the bells ringing and that magical car came down the street and picked him up and took him back to that magical time
the people that played the fitzgeralds and hemingway dali etc
were great
i also thought that rachel mcadams was very good in this movie as was kathy bates and really just everyone
its just a charming movie that makes you not only want to go to paris but to be back in the roaring twenties even just for one night
woody allen is a genius
i love this movie
truly a fascinating movie caries like dream up until the end
most would recognize themselves trying to escape reality and go back to a golden era
apart from the notorious and less notorious characters portrayed in the 20s this movie gives a lot to think about and delivers many emotions to the passionate watcher
its a perfect romantic movie not necessarily a chick flick ideal francophiles truly enjoyable indeed
watch it over a glass of wine and possibly with a fireplace warming you
woody proves again to be a master and is here doing a great job putting together so many nice fragments of time
is this really such a bad epoca
midnight in paris is a fantastic movie about generations upon generations of nostaligic regret and the contrast with the dismal present because life itself is unsatisfying
yes its unrealistic and coincidencially romantic at times but thats the point
its a movie about the movies and a fabricated era filled with wonder and insight into the past
man
i mean i know the movie takes notions from older movies like les quatre cents coups and its description of frances failing generation but it does it well and im glad such a good movie has been made in the 21st century with such great inspirations from the past
ive never been a woody allen fan particularly but i found this film to be one of the best ive seen in recent years
i am aware that people think some of the references go over the heads of people but i dont think it mattered at all
likewise i didnt think it too guided with the introducing by names of the characters
its a thoroughly engaging story with great understated performances
a light romantic comedy that i couldnt take my eyes off
i watched it again very quickly after the first time
okay owen wilson might be playing woody allen but im fine with that
it might be what we need in the world
oh and michael sheen is excellent
i am not a fan of woody allen even less of a fan after his marriage to his adopted daughter but it seems that hollywood and the moviegoing public can almost forgive anything
and lets face it he has not made a good movie in years
i know many think vickie christina barcelona was great but i thought it was awful
owen wilson was an odd choice for the lead and his nose distracts me but i stuck it out and actually enjoyed the film
owen seemed to be changeling woody through the whole film
i think woody wanted to play this role but realises he isnt a great actor and he is too old now
perhaps i enjoyed the scenes of paris more than the film
i love paris
i had problems with the characters especially inez played by rachel mcadams
i liked the idea of going back in time and living another life but then it seemed more about him cheating on his girlfriend which i did not like
if you love allen or paris then i would say watch it once wont be a complete waste
