how can a film this bad costing 100m get past any adult review process
it seemed like scorcese and dicaprio made it for their own egos  big budgetgatsbylevel theatrics and facetime respectively
dicaprio does a good job in the role but we all age range 25 to 65 kept waiting for the movie to come to the point
hours of redundancy of plot and gratuitous over use of swearing and sex scenes the message and context could have been delivered with about sixty percent less we kept waiting for a fatal drug overdose to change the direction of the plot and give it some purpose
we almost walked out a couple of times but did not and waited for the plot to come to a point
we didnt and suffered the full three hours
by far the best movie of the year best actor best director
the whole supporting cast is excellent as well
this movie will not disappoint it was much better than i expected and the duration of the movie is not felt at all
it definitely did not feel like a 3 hour production
scorsese put this movie together brilliantly
you are on your toes and engaged throughout from beginning to end
leonardo dicaprio is at his best
he will take you through the highs and lows of the movie with an oscar winning performance
i read about jordan belfort and it appears that scorsese and dicaprio made this movie as accurate as possible which i really appreciate
i commend scorsese and dicaprio for keeping this epic picture as authentic as possible
after all this is hollywood
i wish i could say anything positive about it but i feel the responsibility to keep people especially kids and teenagers away from this movie
this is literally the worst movie ever and one of the few i walked out on
i do not understand that this movie can be entertaining in any way
the scenes are merely numbing and the time span could be reduced to an hour at most
the plot is nothing new
even worse left alone as it seems
the possible moral value that it has to carry is not traceable
it appears that the producers caught themselves too much in the story
therefore they could not see that they are actually displaying something that should be categorized in the adult section
everything nowadays is so over hyped like breaking bad the dark knight and now this crap this movie is such a mess its a comedy that is 3 hours long thats right a comedy that is so long and so over the top and it drags on and on and on
this movie is what other countrys see us as stupid people that spend money on drugs and take from people to waste it
this movie is so stupid you will ask your self did i really pay 850 for this and why and you will find out that your day was wasted too
this movie is just a movie that will be forgotten in a year from now no one will know what it is because no one will remember this crap it is not a classic like scarface it is a anti american film that show show great jordan belford with his middle school language and intellect that make you feel dumb that you watch it
its a trashy movie with no real meaning but to waste your time and life so stay away if you have one this movie is just a nether epic fail that might get a award because it was overhyped and this movie will be on a award mistake list in the near future
a group of us watched this film with high expectations but by a third of the way through everybody seemed to be shuffling in their seats with the repetitive boredom of it all but noone daring to actually say out loud what they were thinking
it seemed to be an over indulgent lovein of quality actors overplaying everything the director trying to show off how fast he could get the cast to talk over each other with irrelevant excruciatingly long conversations of no interest to anybody except presumably the writer and every character a ridiculous overplayed cartoon cutout
even the steadfast investigating cop had to become a wisecracking caprio mark 2 when the pair finally got together for their showdown
the movie ground on relentlessly with orgy and coke snorting scenes ok weve seen you can do that please can we have some plot now and learn in much more detail how he got to the top and how he fell from grace
a waste of too much time
martin scorsese is losing his gift as a director
the wolf of wall street is another rendition of scorseses other movies
the narration actions and flow of wolf of wall street is similar to goodfellas casino and mean streets
di capiros lead character is just another version of the henry hill character from the movie goodfellas
through the streetwise narration of di capiro one learns how the system is scammed and experiences dysfunctional behaviour of drugs and prostitutes
the characters lack of morals creates the usual drama stew of low lives
scorsese tries to spice up the old recycled formula with nudity massive drug use over the top sex which can not compensate for the lack of story depth
3 hours was way too long for a half hour story
five stars out of ten
not for an instant can i recommend going to this movie
it has a few hilarious moments and for that it gets a nonzero rating but it is really too much to stomach 3 three
hours of dumb jackasses behaving like wild reckless dumb jackasses like the world only exists to serve and reward them
and time and time again confronted with the truth that some actions eventually have their harsh consequences they fail to react rationally and dont ever get out when things get hot until their actions take them to the critical point of no return where they cant keep escaping the inevitable and everything falls apart
the story seems to me just as an excuse to depict all that stupidity
i dont know if many people will bear it i really didnt
it was a relief to see the movie end
this was like watching a cheap soft porn flick
the drugs were glamorized as if they were harmless like crack being smoked as if it had no more harm than a cigarette
the sex was like watching a cheap porn flick with full frontal female nudity in several scenes and the sex scenes left little to the imagination
the only thing not shown in the sex scenes was penetration
but the sex too was careless sex like whores who use condoms unless you pay them more which is what he claims to do and then another statements when he went nuts over a beautiful woman that he does not care if he gets aids from her he just wants sex with her
this movie was recklessly and carelessly done for the younger viewers
this was a terrible movie
one couple left the theater after 45 minutes
this is an utterly boring movie that dragged on for 3 hours
i dont know what part of the movie made it to the cutting room floor
the entire plot can be aired in no more than an hour and a half
i do believe i saw more tna than i have in the past decade in this movie
the amount of drug and money glorification was sickening but only to be out done when the main character punches his wife steals their kid while on a cocaine high and crashes the car with the child in the front seat
sadly i stayed until the end only to be courteous to my outoftown guests
otherwise i would have bailed
some genius slapped scorcese and leonard dicaprio together and knew that the world would love the turd baby that is the wolf of wall street
add some drugs hookers and a narcissist somehow they even screwed up the typical loveable asshole there is nothing likable or sympathetic about this character
8
510
really
nothing stands out in this movie except for the fact that it is certainly verrry loooong winded and wow i dont think i could watch another characternarrated martin scorsese film without being reminded of the bitter stench of this stinker
the wolf of wall street my god
i liked jonah hill before
so dull
poor acting
unintelligent
i would just like to say that i got absolutely nothing out of the viewing of the wolf of wall street
it is easily the worst effort ever from martin scorsese
the story line is almost non existent  dicaprio is just a loser with a loud mouth and all the surrounding characters are one dimensional
i dont see any moral battle being fought i dont care about seeing hookers lots of drugs being taken  or stupid parties very boring
the real role model in the story cites his heros as gordon gekko of wall street don johnson of miami vice and richard gere in pretty woman what a completely shallow loser even in todays bottom feeding america
the whole effort is simple b movie territory not just because of the 80s and 90s settings
couple this film with american hustle and you have a pretty awful state of 2014 filmmaking
while leonardo is one talented actor and does an incredible job in this movie the film could have been shortened to 2 hours to make its point
stronger cautions of content should been out there
pornography was clearly evident several people left the theater and we thought about it midway through
seemed like 2000 fbombs versus the reported 500 were voiced
we liked leonardo way better in to catch a thief and titanic
people have mentioned a possible oscar nod for mr
decaprio for this but my preference would be for him would to get it one day for a future body of work
actually writing this review is not a good use of my time so
stopping here
im not sure what they are trying to do here other then glamorize lecherousness
the movie has no original theme and you can tell how the story will progress from the very beginning indeed even just be looking at the title
im amazed at why this movie was presented for oscar nomination
there is absolutely nothing interesting or original about it
it was a total waste of time watching it especially because it is so damn long
i forwarded it most of the time
it also reflects on how powerless the american public has become that they can no longer steer what they are made to watch by the powerful media
i hope that the number of negative reviews will serve to put this movie back in its proper place
the humor is not bad and there is a decent amount of it throughout the movie
710 the acting mainly leonardo was fantastic
9
510 the story is a bit shallow
basically a bunch of people lying cheating stealing and runningescaping on wall street and making a lot of dirty illegal money
then talking talk and talking bad about other people who are honest but make less
the movie portrays a picture that money is the most important thing and it is what brings you happiness very well
210 near the end it shows that being controlled by money is very bad but it wasnt portrayed as well as it did trying to argue for money bringing happiness
it shows a bunch of rich folks who have nothing but money thinking theyre above everyone else
no health no relationships no integrity no manners no respect no honesty no time nothing but money and the animalistic drive to get more and destroy everything in the way
this movie should be rated x
still impressed the american public is so desirous of porn and drugs use
and thinks it is funny
congratulations to scorsese for knowing his audience
interesting to see so many people under 18 laughing at the drug abuse
imdb requires 10 lines of text to issue this review but really how long was scorseses outline of this movie
i doubt it was that long
lets see show lots of naked bodies throw in continuous offensive language snort all the cocaine off the naked bodies villanize stockbrokers
yep that is a great formula for getting high ratings and making lots of money
anyone who feels there is a shred of merit to this movie needs to take a second look at the emperorahe has no clothes
that an iconic director like scorsese would fashion such a juvenile indulgent and ultimately boring piece of trash like this is unimaginable
its as if shakespeare were to pen a couple of episodes of gilligans island or mozart to compose a jingle for justin bieber
that it was nominated in the academys best picture category to the exclusion of movies like the butler or inside llewyn davis is reprehensible
its also pathetic that mr
scorsese seems to be following in the dirty old mandirector footsteps of stanley kubrick eyes wide shut by offering as much nudity and sex as possible for no apparent reason other than crass titillation
but thats not the biggest problem here
i dont have any problem with pictures that deal with sex or aberrant relationships or violence or excess as long as theyre created with some artistry
i do have a problem with pictures that are simply tedious
shame on you mr
scorsese
i went to this movie with a group of six other people
six of the seven of us deeply wished we had not wasted our money on a really stupid woman hating movie
anyone who tells you that the movie is criticizing the woman hating attitudes of the wall streeters in the movie is ignoring the fact that not a single woman in the movie gets to say anything with the slightest bit of intelligence or criticism of the attitudes of the men towards them which another filmmaker would have done to make women in the audience have at least someone to identify with and cheer on for even two minutes of this three hour self indulgent crap
american hustle was great a movie for grownups unlike wolf of wall street yet i am kinda ticked of at cristian bale acting like robert deniro and leonardo dicaprio wanting to be the next jack nicholson
the wolf has some serious parts very few the rest is a mindless carnival of bull i am surprised how bad everything was even hated dicaprios performance for the first time he was phenomenal in django i had big expectations for this movie it tries to take a stab at a lot of film styles but succeeds in none it is a shameful movie from great artist a i was disgusted walking out of the treater
i will have to watch the departed a few times to get this out of my system
i give dicaprio a thumbs up for his impeccable portrayal of the perpetually greedy jordan belfort but overall i disliked the movie
this is based on the memoirs of jordan belfort a notorious stockbroker and selfmade millionaire whos penny stock brokerage defrauded 1500 clients of 200 million during the 1990s
he used aggressive sales tactics and adrenaline charged locker room motivational chants to persuade his vagabond group of 1000 wannabes to follow his lead get rich at any cost especially to the client and make a name for their brokerage stratton oakmont
at three hours the movie is overly long given the numerous scenes of drug use drinking sex and raucous office parties not to mention the nonstop foul language throughout
one clearly gets the message that mr
belfort is a debaucher gluttonous disloyal lewd immoral fanatical corrupt demanding and ambitious hence the title
two hours would have been sufficient for this intense roller coaster ride of greed
i wonder if mr
scorsese is vicariously trying to relive the wild 60s in this film
there have been big scorsese productions that i wasnt particularly fond of like gangs of new york and the age of innocence but this is a first a scorsese picture i actually disliked
nothing can change the fact that martin scorsese is one of the great american film auteurs
his body of work is virtually unparalleled
but this picture is a big misstep for the great director
it is a failed satire if indeed it was meant to be a satire
its overlong overwrought and ultimately boring
he means to show us something about wretched excess i suppose but he fails to create a single character about whom we might give a damn except for the antagonist and in the end all you can do is yawn and be happy its over
wolf on wall street should be renamed filthy rich
two hours and fifty nine minutes of filth
i was mislead by the previews featuring a top notch actor in dicaprio and director scorese
that was the primary reason why i went to see this film
i cannot believe this film showed graphic sex and foul language scenes for almost 3 hours
watching this film amongst 50 people at a amc theater they sat as i did in stunned disbelief
i do not need 1000 words to describe how disappointed i am in wasting my monies seeing this filthy film
i hope i was not recognized by anyone whom i knew coming out of this amc theater
if i wanted to see a porno movie i would pay monies to see a porno movie
producers should be fined for misleading movie goers
there are great actors in this movie
the story line is awful
the characters are awful
this is the boring life story of a crook from wall street
why do we care
so what if it is real
it is boring
it is not an 8
2
it is one of the worst crime dramas ever
a movie best on a true story can be good
this is not one of then
to many people like movies just because they are best on a true story
it does not matter that the writing stinks
good actors wasted there time being in this awful movie
do not waste your money
do not waste your time
do not see this awful movie
bad movie bad movie bad movie
i need more lines and i am running out of things to say
this is without a doubt the most disgusting movie i have seen in years
welcome to modern day babylon folks
those of you who thought this a great movie take a good look at yourselves in the mirror
i am a person that enjoys a good or great movie but i struggled to get through this one
what is the matter with humanity today that we worship thieves that have no alliance to anything but their own greed
it truly is a sorry ass world that we live in today that lets hollywood rewrite this guys past
how many trusting folks have put their money in this crooks hands only to lose their life savings
if he had done this to my family he would be dead
the wolf at wall street is an utterly awful movie and a complete waste of three hours
the movie offers absolutely nothing in terms of depth or insight beyond these stock brokers are bad
there is no substance with a plot that moves painfully slowly and characters that by design dont change one bit throughout the entire movie
okay we get the idea
these guys suck
and they will never change
and the justice system is screwed up
you could have showed us that in 5 minutes
instead we get three hours of shallow meaningless repetitive and most of all completely unfunny nothingness with stock brokers screwing prostitutes and snorting cocaine
there is no depth here
this is nothing but cheap entertainment and if you dont find something as shallow as what is portrayed as entertaining then youll be staring at your watch for three hours wondering how time can pass so slowly
the one redeeming feature is dicaprios acting
a complete waste of time and money
a true story i believeathat still continues to this very day all over the world
the movie itself was very well done but the content and the story was really bad and disappointing
only drugs and obscenity during the entire film based on lies and deception to rob innocent people of their money to gain their own wealth
the movie is worth seeingato take learning of the moral of the movie
the society cannot function in a good manner if this kind of behavior is accepted and would inspire others to do the same if successfulaworldwide moral is declining and people are more than never behaving disgracefully and bad
money is for many the true goal in life and the more you have the better life and power over others you gain
unfortunately yesaits true but to what cost
to make others suffer and get hurt
no thank you
i rather stay poor and happy than rich and miserable
i will not see the movie again but its not a bad movie in that way its very well directed and well made but its moral and content is depressing and sada
i think this is a very well crafted movie
the performances are excellent and the director and all his staff made a wonderful job
and this has the best dialog i have heard in years  despite the frequent fwords
yes this is one of the ragstorichesandthentojail movie
but somehow i missed the largerinlife character gordon gekko who has already become a living legend although he is only a fiction from stones wall street
the main character is just a brat with addictions drug sex and money
like a teenagerforever type
he never grows and he never learns
at the end he is still making money for himself and some avid listeners
i hope his methods are legitimate now
but there is virtually no reference to the outside world
no political or philosophical connotations
and during this time inside wall street was happening a lot
later we found out what
so my only complaint is that this movie tries to be a novel apparently epic novel for 3 hours
but manages in only being a short story
leonardo and jonahs acting was so overshadowed by the sever vulgarity of this film
i dont understand how it is possible that this film got the r rating and wasnt nc17
i get that the director wanted to capture the essence of the true story but if he was going to be this graphic it should have been nc17 to give the audience some warning
we saw it before anyone i knew did so i had no idea how extremely vulgar it was
if u havent seen it read imdbs parent guide description and youll definitely know what youre in for
just wish i had then i would have passed on seeing this explicitly vulgar film
ill definitely be reading the imdb parent guides for all r rated films i see in the future since apparently critics love xxx films masquerading as r rated
there are movies with sexdrugs and money in all shapes and forms in hollywoodbut this movie is just repulsive
i didnt get to midget throwing part but ive watched on the trailer
really
are millionaires morons
there were no funny moments at all
plain stupid lines
the no you didnt kind of movie that i regret watching even the hour i did watch
what really made me stop watching was the scene where a hooker inserted a candle in dicaprios ass
why show this stuff
i dont care what people do in privatebut why do i need to see a scene like this
and pay for it
repulsive
this movie is scorseses worst job everworst than that movie with nicholas cage that was pretty crappy
but this one is actually disgusting
dont watch
about 75 of the movie consist of sexual content and consumption of forbidden substances
when i went to see it i hoped to see another aviator or catch me if you can
unfortunately this movie is not even close to any of mentioned masterpieces
the main character is an ordinary control freak who is constantly anxious and tortured by the fear of losing control and tries to remedy that by sex drugs and booze
teenagers will be happy to watch something hangoverish here but for a responsible adult the main character would look despicable and offensive
if you are a teenager you should see this movie for sure you will catch a lols and fun
if you are a grownup man with a sense of responsibility this may be plainly boring for you
and god forbid you from taking your wife to watch it together
this film might have been made the best way it could be made
seeing as it was chronicling the real life of a stock market corrupt team
but it wasnt enjoyable to me at all
it might have served the role of informing us that stock market workers are corrupt
but i think most people going in were already convinced of that
my take is that the subject of stock market corruption could be better covered as a dark comedy in a similar style as dr
strangelove
or the film could have been entertaining if the entire thing was covered from the perspective of the cops who took belfort down
the way this film was made just makes me hate the world for producing such nastiness both in the real world and on the big screen
not all films have to be happy
but there has to be some hope involved in the story somewhere
sure the guy went to jail at the end
but his sentence was so small that it felt just like another defeat
also the film was reaaally long
hardly a masterpiece
very uneven in terms of quality
some good moments and dicaprio is at times very effective
at times
it cant quite decide what it wants to be
it cant really explain the central characters decline into debauchery and selfdestruction so it is instead a kind of celebration of decadence
the humor is truly juvenile and the constant parade of sex rarely reveals character or furthers the plot
it seems more an opportunity for the director to explore his own pornographic interests
it actually gets boring
indeed the film is at least an hour too long
just when you think decaprio has reached the end of the line another meaningless hour is ahead
a strange combination of long scenes of exposition and rapidly moving decadence
it doesnt work
im sorry to say but for the first time the critics were pretty spot on with this
the acting performances of both leonardo decaprio and jonah hill were top notch and most definitely worthy of the accolades they have received but the movie it self seemed like it was on massive quantities of drugs
it was a great story but it was told in such a choppy manner some of the scenes were so over the top i felt like i was watching another tucker maxx movie
i was really hoping for more
great acting rob reiner deserved an oscar nomination too
ok movie
and it was way too long
i dont know how he did it but scorsese managed to drag this out for almost 3 full hours
he couldnt do a 3 hour version of goodfellas or the departed but managed to extend the life of this for 3 hours
again i was really hoping for more
before this film i could start watching a decaprio flick without second thought and i would know that the movie is going to be brilliant but this movie changed it all
although it has the element of entertainment performances were good direction good but had too much of crass element in it
a man who has no respect for law no respect of peoples feelings no sensitivities toward anyone but himself and that man is being shown as a hero is just untoward
never expected such lowly kind of film from brilliant artists like decaprio and scorsese
although its doesnt matter to anyone but i no longer feel like calling myself a decaprio fan
way to go
i know it was based on a real person but im sure there must have been healthy amounts of literary licensing taking place
it was just overdone and stupid stupid stupid
literally made me want to kill dicaprios entire team
literally
it was just that dumb
i was really disappointed since i was expecting a good movie
im surprised this got good reviews from the critics but what the hell do they know
back then i wondered why this movie didnt receive any oscars when it had such high reviews and acclaim
but i guess now i know why
this was more like watching animal house on wall street than anything else
so whack
i couldnt believe how disappointed i was in both dicaprio and scorsese
this is a terrible film simply 3 hours of shouting
its repetitive lacking in narrative or plot no drama no character development no wit no light and shade no insights  in short nothing at all to recommend it
its true that dicaprio gives a good performance but the totality of the film is so bad its not worth watching just to see him
the great puzzle is how director martin scorsese with his track record could come up with this rubbish
the fact that it gets good reviews just confirms to me that people get dazzled by star names and directors and lose their sense of judgement
i cant see any other explanation for an 8
2 imdb rating
the movie shows bad habits and inspires young people to hope for something like this
easy money scams no moral no humanity
maybe use the movie as a bad example
i do not understand why someone would like this movie
this movie could be liked by people that were born with a lot of money spoiled and search for new ways to be amused
for the rest of the world we have another important thing called life
and in order to live you have to work be honest try hard no cheating no shortcuts
thats my opinion
leonardo di caprio has a few good movies but lately a lot of bad ones
i believe that there are people like this but i have no idea how do they live with themselves
it is not the life anyone should hope for
what a noisy stupid movie this is
and repetitive too
an hour could have been cut from the film with no harm done
it is oddly like a drama by christopher marlowe or one of the other lesser elizabethan playwrights there is no real plot line no character development but rather a constant and increasingly frenetic repetition of what has gone before
the selfindulgence of the whole is reflected in the performances
mcconaugheys chestthumping scene is painful to watch
jonah hill does his usual thing
leonardo dicaprio smirks his way through the film though admittedly that may suit the character
but pity those early enthusiasts who referred to the lude scene as brilliant
bright spots are kyle chandler as the fbi agent admittedly i may have liked him because i hoped he would arrest jordan and cut the movie short
margot robbie however was unabashedly terrific and really the only reason for watching
leonardo dicaprio is such a brilliant actor
everyone in this movie performed nothing short of excellence
martin scorsese has done wonderful work in this movie as in all his others in bringing out the best in all characters
i have watched several movies that have won accolades for various performances
at the very leastthe wold of wall street is as remarkable as other great works
i watched the movie on blueray but wish the experience in the the theater would have taken the experience to a new level
prior to watching the movie i watched the trailer and read about the plot which provide a glimpse only
watching this movie has been gripping enthralling captivating and a good learning experience
spoiler alert  all this movie has is sex drugs and filthy language
there is no actual financial anything about this movie
waaaaaaaayyyyyyy too much nudity and foul language
this movie should have been rated x not r
the acting was horrible
the plot was so predictable
the photography and scenes were pointless and uninspired
too say the very leastgt it was a porno
who in their right frame of mind would make this movie let alone pay to make this movie or even pay to watch this movie
i really think that the producers needed to really think this project through before proceeding
i hated it and would not recommend this trash to anyone looking for a decent movie to watch
it was a complete waste of money
i will be completely honest with you
the last few projects leonardo dicaprio has down have really gone down hill
this one was the icing on the cake
from now on any movie that comes out with leo in it
i will know not to see it and avoid at all cost
because it will be bad bad and horribly bad
didnt have the charm of a typical scorsese movie
leo did great but everything he does and almost the entire move feels onedimensional
it lacks the depth that leads to deeper thinking and reflecting which im sure mr
scorsese would love the audience to have
people all say jonah hill is great but im not sure he can hold up such a big supporting role against leo with all due respect of course
i loved his small roles across the board which were all absolutely hilarious but in this one again i think his role lacks depth too
all said matthew mcconaughey is absolutely brilliant in his short appearance
im glad he and leo both won golden globe but im gonna have to go with him for the oscar even though leo is long due for sure
im going to keep this short and sweet dicaprio was the main reason i went to watch this film scorsese
movie genius but this
this was total garbage 2 12 hours of swearing drug abuse sex
wait there was sex
12 hour of somewhat suspense well
jonah hill was a waste of time in that movie the other characters i have no damn clue what their soul purpose was in the film movie lacks substance its fabricated truth i just dont get why i got sucked into watching it
this movie should be called dicaprio cause hes the only reason why this movie was worth watching
i take that back
i wish i never watched it
hyped up overrated
dicaprio deserved the grammy though
well as we all know this movie is the talk of the world and i was so keen to watch it could not wait and all i have to say is why
i have seen so much better from all actors and producers
dont get me wrong its a good movie but with how much hype and awards this movie is getting its not that good at all i thought it was a biography about jordan belfort and all it really showed was him running a muck and having a good time no effort in showing how he got to where he was and just about nothing on how he was punished pretty much it was a ripoff of projectx so i rate this movie 510 like i said its a good watch but nothing to what everyone make it out to be
just back from the wolf of wall street
its story is based on autobiography written by jordan belfort
so as is usual with all autobiography the author will portray himself a hero
its an entertaining film but a stupid film
right from the selling techniques of de caprio to the money laundering in swiss banks  everything is too convenient and at times plain stupid
its supposed to be a dark comedy but the tone is over the top
de caprio is good in some scenes and has overacted in a lot of scenes
his scene where he has an excessive effective of a drug is so loud and drags too much its almost irritating
he looks like an overgrown kid with wrinkles
jonah hill is also good in some scenes and hammed in many other
margot robbie plays de caprios wife
looks hot and acts the best among the cast
i am surprised how it has won so many award nominations may be due to the big names associated
that is how most of the jury around the world works
i dont understand why this movie has consistently been given high ratings
the plot can be summed up in 30 minutes yet the movie is very long
an hour and a half is devoted to establishing jordan belforts debauchery but it is overkill
we do not need this many scenes depicting his lifestyle
the acting and cinematography are very good but since it has these two aspects and no plot it only has two of three very important pieces and does not deserve higher than a 66
additionally each time the movie is viewed belfort makes money
he is only required to give 50 of his profit to his victims to whom he still owes millions of dollars
well filmed per the usual for scorcese funny in parts but thats part of the problem funny ha ha about massive greed and addiction
the story is a mess as well you really dont know why things are illegal people really dont on screen suffer much from their addictions there is little here that balances the celebratory with the downside so you never really get a sense of the actual consequences in other words the artistic message is muddled characters come and go
mostly we are shown a wonderful world of luxury with little real irony no matter the feeble attempts to show the downside
and what about the shipwreck
thats a whole story in itself yet its treated like a lark
maybe its all suppose to be a cartoon fantasy but this reeks of obtuseness given the massive inequalities in the us
strange misfire from scorcese
cant understand why this movie is getting the acclaim that it is getting
yes theres many like me who found the three hours squirminducingdull and much in need of an editing scissors
for a much better choice in the same subject matter try boiler room better acting better story and much more disciplined direction and editing
although it is contrary to my nature and even though im writing a review which is essentially saying that this movie is overlong too wordy repetitive and should be edited down to remove all the superfluous fluff i find myself repeating myself here even though my credibility as someone who appreciates conciseness is now in jeopardy
the wolf of wall street is a black comedy giving hints of drama
natural comparisons will fly to oliver stones wall street which is accurate but you can see subtle hints of films like trading places glengarry glen ross and even american psycho
thats a testament to scorseses outstanding direction and terence winters masterful screenplay
scorsese keeps wolf lifesize sprinkled with characters that are both geniuses and morons but functioning morons
theyre like the frat pack group that sat in a corner on my college campus being loud and obnoxious and made terrible life choices that they still arent aware of until this day
scorsese puts together an allstar cast to inhabit these beings that includes dicaprio jonah hill margot robbie matthew mcconaughey jon bernathal and kyle chandler
all of which seem to be having the time of their lives
selfindulgent film that glorifies instead of satirizing the excess
4050 could have been cut and the movie would have been better for it
endlessly repetitive and not even remotely believable party scenes as if all the apparent idiots in the audience had not yet fully grasped the idea that these characters were a group of truly awful people incapable of evolution or redemption
no motivation to keep watching
i was done after the scene when jordan was so loaded he could not walk down the country clubs stairway
i was so looking forward to his being killed in a onecar accident after he crawled into his porsche and that would finally put an end to this movie
no such luck but thankfully there is a stop button on my remote
so glad i didnt waste my money going to the theater for this one
i had a coworker raving about this movie for weeks
i had heard it was essentially porn with a story but for lack of better judgment i watched it and should have quit after the first 10 minutes i want the 3 hours of my life back
this movie should have been 90 minutes not 3 hours plus
just removing the fbombs would have cut it down to 2 hours   there needed to be an editor for this sleazefest
there were some funny linesscenes which is the only reason i didnt rate it 1
scorsese seems to like to portray people who have no redeeming qualities like the boxer in raging bull and seems to have a habit of dragging his movies out way too long
if you are into porn drugs and profanity you will love this movie
this movie is a crap a real crap
how is possible many people to praise it
it does not even deserve a second from you time to watch it
boring plot it is really bad
better watch a puppet show than this
wallstreet
where is the wallstreet guys
show it
the trading the stock where are they
lower manhattan style
totally bad movie real trash
no catchy soundtrack bad actors selection
bad director
what this kind of movies are still being made is the question
some trashy popculture cool drunk stuff
what else
this movie does not offer something more that that
much like a tired prostitute downtown this movie tried too hard but got nowhere
the story while not inherently bad was nondescript and reasonably predictable from the movie summary listed online
somehow it still took 3 hours to squeeze in every possibly ounce of tired tropes
guy has money
guy likes drugs and women
guy progresses through a typical set of circumstances from that point forward
why this movie has received this degree of celebration and praise is beyond me
halfway through you dont notice nudity or drugs because it blends into the background
while i can respect that as an artistic choice in this case it just seemed like they added a half cup too many boobs and a tablespoon too much coke to the film recipe and no one had the heart to tell them
after an hour i started watching the clock wondering how much longer they could stretch this story out
its very very rare that after a movie i have that feeling of frustration at an evening wasted
in this case i can resoundingly say that i wasted my night on this particular movie
i had heard some negative things about the movie but finally ended up seeing it on a flight
its a long movie but doesnt feel like one
dicaprio acts brilliantly yet again
the movie is a true story of a wall street guy and depicts his journey to the top its a telling commentary on human greed
the fact that it was a true story somehow made a bigger impact on me
a valuable insight i got from the movie was how most of us are suckers as far as aggressive salespeople are concerned
they can cheat us and yet keep selling to us again and again
such is our greed and meekness
scorcese is great at making biopics
the wolf is brilliant with its fangs however it veers sometime from the main drama of wall street too much sex and drug abuse gives an undesirable image of wall street caprio and scorsese are brilliant i felt the single concept of stones wall street to be more riveting the film is too long and at times repetitive
on the whole a valuable experience of human traits
money brings in all kinds of comforts as well as problems has been brilliantly portrayed
the ensemble acting is very good
martin known for his gangster films tackles the financial racket with equal poise and is in total control
it gives at times a little bad taste with its explicit immorality in the money market however the human greed is well brought out
im very far to be an expert so my opinion is just the one of a common person who watches movies in the night to have fun  enjoy some time
my opinion is that the movie is very attracting its fast and you dont get bored
there is a good plot and when you can get lost or bored there are some scenes that make you laugh or anyway catchy enough to catch again your attention
anyway after 2 hours i have to say that ive started to look at the watch because i was tired
thats it
it was absolutely enough without removing anything special to the plot to have a 2 hours movie
di caprio is absolutely great but the other main characters are great too
my vote would have been 9 without doubts
i saw the movie wolf of wall street and i didnt think it was that great like everyone has been saying it is
i saw lots of parallels between that movie and the movie goodfellas 1990 from the same director  scorcese
the same kind of voiceover the same kind of characters plot movements etc
scorcese was copying himself which i thought was really really weak from such a renowned director
like no original ideas in this one just a lot of naked women added to it
i think the naked women shocked american audiences and made the movie be more remarkable here but its really not that good of a movie
the crooked shenanigans that the traders were doing on wall street stock exchanges to make tons of money so fast were phony and fakedvery unrealistic and exaggerated
dicaprios acting was over the top which i liked a lot that he could do that
that was the best part of the movie for me was watching him
very rarely a movie comes which is entertaining yet disappointing
the wolf of wall street makes you wonder why there was a need to tell a story about a personality like jordan belfort
jordan isnt a hero or a role model whose life should be celebrated or emulated
he made tons of money illegally disrespected the law and the system abused drugs and had multiple sex partners
there is no reason to why he did it and nothing extraordinary about how he did it
the movie is about jordan having no limits
he did whatever he wanted and how much he wanted
there is no greatness about his life or a lesson to be learned
sure the movie is filled with fun humor and brilliant performances but for a biopic it could have been about a hero
the stupid success stories
its a stupid message that links success to prostitution and drug use and makes them innocent
if you have a lot of time to spare and you can get rid of it get ready for a 3 hour torture
the fact that such a bad film score so much encourages producers to use only eroticism
and this is not a human look
its sad
i guess if you had never met anyone like that the characters in this movie might shock and surprise you
i guess if you didnt already know that shtty soulless sociopaths run the world this movie might be edgy for you
ignorance is bliss
martin scorsese is a master film maker
over time we have seen that he has a fascination with the american experience specifically with the lives of americans who make their fortunes outside of the law
i get it
martin is doing just fine
the wolf of wall street is well directed well acted well written and worthy of whatever praise and accolades it can gather
my only complaint is that sociopaths are shtty boring people and their stories are unworthy of glory
empathy kicks ass
mr
scorsese make a movie of that
we attended this film with several family members of different genders varying ages and jobs
we all were sorely disappointed disgusted actually
the previews and notoriety of the cast create a false idea of quality and content
thus we were scammed into paying for tickets
we hoped it would be a wellacted intriguing depiction of corruption on wall st
basically its vile exaggerated overthetop and monotonous  not to mention awkward
this film seems to be all about gratuitous sex and drug use  sadly its more fantasy and less reality
its hard to watch the childish dumb and dumber behavior of the characters
its an insult to viewers
this film is skating by due to its wellknown director and popular actors
basically it brings down the level of film making on many levels
i hope its seen for what it is  offensive nonsense
