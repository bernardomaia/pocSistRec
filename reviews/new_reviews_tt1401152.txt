an effective thriller with a good twist in the ending
not since the sixth sense has a movie given me such a surprise at its ending
liam nieson keeps your attention fixed on the action throughout the movie although some of his lines did not match the scenes or his character
if someone is trying to kill you maybe some emotion would be shown
the car accident at the beginning is very realistic and makes liams amnesia credible
the car chase scenes in the movie will also keep the action buffs happy although the black car driven by the assassin is a bit too corny to believe
bruno ganz as an aging former stasi agent gives a standout performance and diane kruger supports nieson without the usual hollywood theme of girl following for hero
maybe its because nieson is old enough to be her father
this film is no masterpiece but if your looking for a couple of hours entertainment with an interesting ending this will fit the bill
the movie sounds intriguing since from the beginning and keeps its sense of mystery and intrigue till the end this is a good quality once reminding hitchcocks thrillers with the difference that in unknown the thrilling aspect cannot be separated from the frenzy typical of action movies
the result is an entertaining involving pic never losing its strong and quick rhythm and letting the viewer staying attached to the screen till the end
set in a depressing berlin covered by snow always marked by the sad signs of a more or less distant past a good photography gets to capture the overall gloomy atmosphere of the story and the mystery of a character whose vicissitudes seem as much incomprehensible as much needing some resolution and an effective final twist as well
liam neeson plays skillfully although not always sufficiently expressive he gets to convey the sense of void of someone looking for some identity
a standout performance is offered by bruno ganz and also diane kruger supports neeson quite well
certainly not a masterpiece but worth the ticket
one of the most embarrassing painful and boring movies within the last decade
zero suspense
awful script
talking heads with dialogue making no sense at all gretchen hes finding people
it starts with the question how can a superkilleragent be stupid enough to forget his suitcase at the airport
and it ends with the question how can a director and his producers be brainless enough to expect that people havent seen total recall and bourne identity to make this movie as predictable as a mickeymousecomic
dont believe whatever good reviews you might have read
youll want your money back after having wasted the first ten minutes with this terrible mistake
this movie would have felt more original before jason bourne hit the screen but we already have one blackop operative with amnesia out there
i truly wonder if anyone mentioned the similarities when this being proposed
granted there is a good plot twist when he is told who and what he is but smart people would have noticed something wrong when he drives like a professional and fights as if hed been trained to
just like bourne
i did not find very many original concepts in this movie and once i make the comparison to jb sorry i mean bourne not james bond or jack bauer
jb is just a good set of initials for this sort of thing i guess
i kept thinking that there was more ingenuity in the bourne movies and a lot more investment in character development
this movie is watchable
barely
and i have no desire to watch it again
just got back in town yesterday and decided to watch unknown
looks good and i really enjoyed taken
after watching it my mind quickly changed and unknown is added to my blacklist
for everyone thinking of seeing this be warned this is a bourne clone
it follows the same premise
a man in europe loses his memory and forgets hes a spy
throughout the movie he finds clues that piece his memory together
at the end he figures out hes a spy and has a change of heart and stops the bad guys from completing their mission which was hes mission in the first place
save yourself from un originally and just rent the bourne identity
what makes it worst is that matt damon is young and is much more believable as a world class assassin then liam nelson is
judging by the poster and the plot synopsis this movie seemed like a cashin on the success of taken even more so than taken 2 but i was surprised by the different style and the fact that neeson is slightly less implausibly badass
hes just an average guy that tries to prove everybody is framing him he doesnt do much fighting but it isnt required to keep the compelling plot interesting
the story is genuinely wellcrafted and gives you a conclusion that you dont see coming from miles away unless youre amazing at that type of thing
oh and bruno hey isnt that hitler from der untergang
ganz is in this a highly underrated actor that effortlessly adds a bit of class to any movie hes in
in the end things may get a bit unbelievable but the movies twist is such a great find that i doubt youll mind the lack of realism
having seen an advance screening of this movie i really loved it
it was slow to start but the 2nd act really picked it up and the 3rd act was amazing
but i did notice the word oz showing up in the background at my last count 6 times probably more
anyone know why
the theater was packed and people really seemed to react positively to to the movie
it was as usual fun to watch the socalled bad people get what was coming to them
a great story of redemption and at asking the question do we ever really know who we are deep down inside or is it all a trick of the mind
i would highly recommend this movie to anyone who loved taken or the bourne movies
the car escape scenes were some of the best i have seen in a long time and worth the price of admission alone
unknown is a solid espionage thriller with a very good cast and excellent locations in berlin directed by jaume colletserra and preceded by the spaniards third film orphan
liam is a rock not the rock in the lead now thoroughly established as a main man in the action movie business and he has excellent support from frank langella diane kruger and january jones but it is bruno ganz who steals the show in terms of acting chops as a former stasi officer indeed the short scene that he shares with langella is the films most tense and poignant superb acting
theres something of the feel of roman polanskis frantic in the perilous pursuit through a european capital although this is a grittier affair and probably the better for it
not to be confused with taken which is a completely different animal
it is not an easy task to write a review about this thriller
thriller by its definition needs to get you involved swiftly grab you by the throat and hold till the amazing and unforgettable finish
so by that measure this a very successful flick
there are car chases people jumping back and forth quite a number of dead people etc
of course none of this makes any sense whatsoever
you could poke thousand holes per minute if you were so inclined
but to what purpose
the filmmakers didnt lie nor misrepresent themselves
it is what it is
liam neeson a very talented actor suffers from the same ailment that any reluctant action hero does
too busy running and ducking to act
fortunately we have marvelous veterans frank langella and even more bruno ganz
smart director knows that he needs little meat on this movies bones
my expectations were met completely
the story is very intelligent written
the cast as liam neeson diane kra1 4ger and bruno ganz played their roles very cool
there are many puzzles to solve and many turns and twists
i love it when there is suspense
there were a few slow paced sequences but it didnt stop the dynamic countdown
the car chase were really top mixed with some product placements
the action scenes have also been executed on a very high level
the cinematography seemed too much displaced and could have been better
anyway congratulations to all the stuff
this is another example how thrillers of nowadays should be made
i could really feel the atmosphere of berlin and it is a nice city to visit once
6510 dont miss taken
not quite as memorable as taken but liam neesons presence lifts this film out of the ordinary
liam convinces the viewer for most of the film that hes a devoted husband until he learns and we learn the shocking truth that hes in fact an assassin
somehow partial memory loss from a car accident reverses his true nature
once happy to eliminate a top biotechnologist he later attempts to save him so that the world can benefit from a drought and pest resistant corn
however the fighting skills he had as an assassin are also partially lost with the partial memory loss
several times he manages to escape attempts on his life by his former colleagues who want to eliminate him in case he jeopardizes the plot to kill the biotechnologist
he befriends a young female illegal immigrant taxidriver who saves him from drowning in the taxicrash and twice saves him again as the story unfolds
despite the usual deviations from reality that thrillers seem to contain its primary purpose to entertain is not diminished
unknown really is a great thrilleraction packed type movie
i was looking for one when i started watching the movie and i got it and much more
from the starts out a bit slow but once you get into the jist of the movie you will not be able to stop until you find out what happens
i wont reveal too much of what happens i will say it will be a surprise either way
i really liked the way the movie ended up being and was very enjoyable movie
i really liked the way the characters developed throughout the movie especially the main character the movie tends to draw you in throughout and thats how i got drawn into this particular movie
there are many twists and turns to hold you in until the end
very funenjoyable movie
i decided to watch this movie because it had liam the harrison ford of the second millennium the cute kruger and a change of locations with berlin
in addition the story sounded like a mystery
now the result is average not totally awful but not worthy of a second watch
i have never went there and maybe its due to winter time but this berlin looks a cold industrial city that surely dont have the beauty of paris or londona then i didnt understand why kruger doesnt play a german girl
about the plot its a sort of reboot of a frantic a  same professor same hunt in a foreign country same companies game same help from a young woman same little flata maybe the difference is the twist but there there is a lot of inspiration from a xiii a
the action sequences are maybe well orchestrated but they are totally unbelievable especially the car chase
at the end my last question is why its a french movie when everything and everyone arent not french
the theme in this movie is amazing and i think it would be much interested with a different casting and different director cause full potential of this theme is far by used
neeson is not convincing at all i think this is one of his poorer performances and i can say same for kruger
effects in the movie are also poor they are not contributing properly to the main action
only light spot for me in this film is january jones cause her acting is so natural opposite to others
its really a shame cause with this brilliant theme some other people could made a great movie
but this one is just slice over the average
i enjoyed this movie a lot
the acting was rich and professional
the story was entertaining with lots of twists and surprises
the car chase was amazing and berlin gave a lot of charm to the movie
the visual effects are amazing especially the bomb at the hotel
i loved that this story can show how mafia and terrorists think
its a mix of love grudge suspense and surprises
liam neeson did an excellent job with great performance
ur heart will break to see all those mercedes cars destroyed  but its germany where cabs are mercedes
violence is accepted in this movie as its not so bloody and disgusting and same for sex its just right
this movie kept me entertained from minute 1 until the last 113 minute
i asked 11 people to watch this movie and pause it after 45 minutes and try to think of a scenario to explain what has happened
not one person could do it
i couldnt either
in the last 30 minutes of the movie you are given a perfect explanation to describe the events
this movie is extremely clever and very well done
i thought it was one of the 5 best movies of the year
if you think you are good at analyzing movies and foreseeing endings i challenge you to figure out where this movie is heading
the ending is unpredictable and very rewarding
if you are a fan of liam neeson this movie is a must see
ive watched it six times and i am still pulled into on each viewing
best tittle for this story
liam neeson is always at his best in these kind of roles
movie has a lot of action and interesting moments where your mind goes puzzled like what is going on
as the movie proceed you also starts predicting the story like this should be the case but all your predictions goes wrong in the end
movie is clearly described in the end and you will have all answers to your questions
movie has a lot of suspense and twist and turns which make a movie more interesting
there are also few chase sequence
direction of the movie is good with all thrill and suspense
you find this story similar to bourne series but as the movie proceed you find it with a entirely different plot
if you really like watching thriller and suspense kind of movie then you are going right
i must recommend you to watch this movie
liam neesonwhenever this name is in the star cast you are forced to see the movieat least i am
though most of his movies has the same plothim being thrown in absurd situations yet all his movies keep you at the bay till the end
in this movie his character of dr
martin harris grasp your sympathy within first 10 minutes
you keep on thinking what must have happened that he is in this situation until the end when your mind goes off burst
nice thriller yet flawed a bit in the middle
still worth watching
liam neeson is impressive again
diane kruger also is good
this time there is more of acting than beauty
nice work by a new director
the location in the movie are also and add to the thrill of the plot
the chase scene in the middle is nicely done and keeps you at the bay
overall a nice movie and worth watching for all thriller fans
a very satisfying thriller with a brilliant script full of misdirection taking us along for the ride noticing little inconsistencies and oddities and then at the end a total surprise ending makes all those questions fall neatly into place
for me it was the script that put it way above the normal fare and then all the elements were well executed
and its always fun with a thriller for an audience to be taken to a foreign locale and in this case seeing much of the city of berlin from the heights to the depths
our total sympathies lie with the liam neeson character who is trying to establish his identity and the very people he knows so well refuse to acknowledge that they know him
and the ending managed to work out to everyones satisfaction most of all the audience
a good example of the thriller genre with the complexity modern audiences demand
a much more interesting movie than taken which was a linear recover my daughter story
while id hardly leap out of my seat to see much of jaume colletserras back catalogue goal ii house of wax remake i have to say he has turned in a highly functional and always engaging modern day thriller with unknown
liam neeson seems to now find himself at home as the 50 something action hero and his performance is suitably frantic which is another film that springs immediately to mind in the early stages
neeson is supported well by an impressive cast featuring diane krugerjanuary jones and two heavyweight actors in the shape of bruno ganz and frank langella
while you never quite feel the goosebumps brought on by taken theres still enough thrillsspills and twists to fill up the running time and things never at any point drag
my wife and i very much enjoyed this film
we were hoping it would entertain us as much as liam neesons earlier movie called taken
in fact i thought this is a better movie than taken
there was nothing predictable about it
the movie leaves you hanging on the edge of your seat from beginning to end
it didnt seem like a cheap action flick either
it seemed well made like a high budget film
i think neeson plays these roles very well
the strong mysterious sophisticated characters
much like the type of roles that harrison ford played in his hay day
will definitely be on the lookout for a next neeson film because we truly enjoyed this
the title of my review says it all as far as i am concerned
the memory loss the trainedtokill thing the hero being hunted by the organization he was trained by even the illegal girl it looks and feels just like the bourne trilogy but is by far not as well made
its quite a ridiculous ripoff
just that there are good actors in this flick doesnt make it a good film
there are too many incredible mistakes made by a lot of characters
and most of the script is just not credible at all
i mean irl nobody waits with killing an enemy especially when he is considered extremely dangerous
then why here
and why an exploding car when we all know they dont explode from falling a long way
those kinds of indiana jonesateameffects should have been kept far from a film like this
i rated it 2 cause it was fun watching yet when it finished i couldnt believe the loads of absurdity this movie encompassed
seriously a very nice idea that has been tarnished by stupid plot and subplots
for example a a highly qualified and ruthless assassins that killed dians friend just as they bumped into him on the stairs
why didnt they kill her when pinned her to the floor b while killings were left and right why didnt they just kill liam when they had million chances why that guy in particular should be killed in an accidentlike murder he was the only one who was nobody c this movie is a cheap replica of the bourne identity and not believable too yet has the same ingredients multiple passport a girl that gets paid in excess lost identity a murder attempt highly qualified assassination unit
etc all there only presented poorly
bottom line do not watch its such a waste of time
neeson plays martin harris who is visiting berlin for a convention
after waking up from a coma resulting from a car crash someone else seems to have taken his identity
unknown suffers terribly from a most clumsily written screenplay and appallingly wooden acting from just about everyone in the film
the story itself is utterly ridiculous and presents itself through the use of computer generated turns of plot with a car chase here and a fist fight there exactly on queue
the fact that harris finds an attractive young female to aid his quest to find out what is happening to him redefines this particular movie clicha
i hope someone finds the time to reprogram the software responsible for this nonsense or to decompile it altogether
so this movie was by far the worst this year
it is so poorly written with plot holes galore
the idea was good though ripped off from other movies but the actions taken from the actors to achieve their goals were ridiculous and made it so when the mystery was revealed i was so taken out of the movie that i didnt care
it seemed like twenty minutes to long and by the end which was so bad and made no sense why it happened that waynot worth the money i spent and i really wish i waited until it came dvd so i could of paid a dollar at the red box for it
save yourself the trip and the money and hopefully liam picks a better project next time
a man meets an accident
when he gets up from the coma he finds that a stranger has taken his place and no body is ready to believe him
he sets on the task of reclaiming his identity
the story is initially intriguing
why would someone take a random mans place
why would even the wife of this random person reject his claim and not identify him
the movie raises the expectations of the audience but the payoff is crap
the mystery resolves itself in a manner which is a copy ofinspiration from the bourne movies among many others
when you look back at the 105 minutes they seem like a complete waste because overall the movie does not offer anything new and treads on the old tested landscape
2 out of 5 for this disappointment
liam neeson is preforming many harrison ford style of serious action and drama roles
liam neeson i believe is replacing harrison ford as ford gets older
the unknown is another harrison ford style actiondrama film
however even liam neeson could not save unknown
unknown has a good story and well acted
there is a but here and the but is the film seemed to be made in a rush and gave a disjointed feel
i was tired when i saw the film which could affect my view on the film
unknown could be a film i need to view more than once to appreciate it
i give unknown a 6 or maybe a 7 out of 10
my wife liked the movie more than i did
if you have visited berlin the choice of location on the oberbaumbra1 4cke for the accident should be questionable but only logically
if you go to seek directions from google maps for hotel adlon to tegel airport there are indeed two river crossings
go to street view and you end up with two rather ordinary looking bridges neither of which are the scene of the taxi accident
type in oberbaumbra1 4cke on google maps and note the location in relation to the route between hotel adlon and tegel airport
go to street view and theres the scene of the accident
now thats a nice bridge with some history and a spectacular backdrop for the scene of the accident
it is one of the most wonderful movies i have seen this year come to think about it it is the best
usually i am able to predict the end but not in this movie which shocked me as it will shock you
the characters are very well set and the suspense is escalating till the end
usually this kind of movies bore me but in this movie you see the facts as a person who lost some of his memory in an accident and you see the plot as his memory is gradually coming back
simply it is one of the best movies of this year
i am wondering why a 7 out of 10
this movie deserves an average of 8 and above
what more could someone want from a movie of this kind
a ripoff of the story line of total recall
an agent believes his cover is real
the people who hired him try to kill him and he doesnt know why
he works to prevent a terrible tragedy with the aid of a beautiful woman
he finally meets his boss who is ultimately killed
the acting is a little week and the action scenes are kind of lame
at the beginning he cant punch his way out of a wet paper bag but by the end of the movie he transforms into chuck norris
they should have gotten somebody a little younger to play martin harris
liam neeson is what
pushing 60
and that was a lousy hair piece or dye job he had in the movie
this movie is a testament to the fact that hollywood is has run out of ideas
i thought this movie would have a big twist but having seen the whole bourne trilogy plus the original bourne identity as well as nowhere man this movie seemed incredibly derivative
its pretty much just a big long chase with a little twist which you totally see coming if youve seen anything along this line before and maybe even if you havent
lots and lots of long drawn out car chasing
villains always on their heels
lots of fighting
it also kind of reminded me of another movie of leeson  i
e
taken which is also one big long chase
so between the plot being so derivative and the similarities with taken this just didnt have much new or interesting for me
also while the loststolen identity plot worked well in earlier works along these lines it really seemed out of touch with current information technology which made it even easier to figure out the twist than it would otherwise have been
this is a very well done thriller
its good to know there still are good stories out there to be made
great on location european feel
the cast is all superb
its a bit like frantic but more action based although not as over the top action as taken
the always earnest liam neeson is a good central figure
diane kruger is really getting to be a very good actress  totally believable and with just the right amount of european accent to be understandable
january jones is the ideal beautiful good icy hitchcock blonde
good to see aidan quinn in a big movie again
good satisfying storyline that doesnt confuse or have silly red herrings
the german supporting cast is good too
berlin looks pretty miserable in the winter though
a must see for 2011
i watched this movie with no idea what to expect except liam neesons great acting skills
when i finished watching this film i was astounded and deeply satisfied with it
the film was enveloped in deep mystery action and drama at every minute
liam neeson portrayed as great work or even better as he did in his previous actioncrime role in taken
however after viewing the film i saw the trailer for the movie and realized that important and rather revealing parts of the film are exposed in it
this disappointed me
my advice to you is if you havent already dont watch the movie trailer
it will make movie much more enjoyable
overall unknown is a great actionmystery thriller that everyone can enjoy
its an interesting kind of nightmare a spyversusspy movie with good acting good cast and decent action sequences especially the underwater rescue and the spectacular car chase
fans of liam neeson will find a likeness with taken and will probably like lims character with his fight scenes  in spite of the catchphrase and quips
given that unknown is not special at all although there are famous actors like neeson jones and diane kruger in addition to nice sights
nothing about unknown is exceptional most of it isnt bad  it only purports to show a moral which it actually doesnt have
its been marketed as a smart thriller whereas its more a thug movie presented as james bond like story
what certainly this film doesnt lack is the action and suspense
unknown plays like a mix of hitchcock frantic and the bourne movies with none of the zest or intelligence of any of those it mimics
for a while it comes off as a decent action film with pretty dull actors and a nonetoonew story
however the further it goes along the further it falls apart
in its final act it degrades into complete madness with a twist that drags the entire film down into pure stupidity and an event that had me laughing harder than any serious ever should
one of the more unfortunate films ive seen in recent years with no real logic or interest to it whatsoever
as someone who got a real kick out of taken this was quite the surprise for neesons next big action thriller
it felt like he was sleepwalking through it and the whole thing felt absolutely stupid for lack of a better word
i rarely bother to post a review but this movie was so terrible i felt obligated to try to help other people avoid wasting their money
although there is one interesting plot development overall this movie is one of the most preposterous i have ever seen
it is full of plot flaws and inconsistencies
although i saw one professional reviewer who thought the car chases were great my girlfriend and i thought there were too many that they were too long and that they were so unbelievable that it was hard to be excited by them
as a minor example of a plot flaw how could there possibly be such long car chases in a busy major city with no police in sight
regarding the acting january jones cant  shes a wooden post
liam neeson does emote a lot but its one note that gets tiresome
diane kruger is the only reason i didnt give it an even lower score
as i sat in the cinema i was excited to be seeing another liam neeson movie
but as the movie went on that excitement turned to boredom
the story lacked strength structure and excitement
and even now as i write this i struggle to remember the whole entirety of the movie
the basis of the story was brilliant but how the movie came together lacked anything bordering on interesting
maybe my expectations were too high or just maybe i am picky these days and find it hard to find anything that is not just average but to me this movie would be better watched on a rainy day on dvd
liam neesons acting as always was brilliant though any depth to his and the the other characters in the movie failed to shine through
unknown 2011  liam neeson diane kruger january jones aidan quinn bruno ganz frank langella sebastian koch
