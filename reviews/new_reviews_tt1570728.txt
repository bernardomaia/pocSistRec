you know usually im not into romantic comedies as i find that most of them fall short amp are extremely cheesy
i really liked this movie though
one of the great things about it is the acting is great
everyone plays their part perfectly and you actually kind of feel for them in their individual situations
usually when i think of steve carell i think of a jokester
he was great in his serious scenes though very believable
and ryan gosling oh my goodness ryan gosling
he has always been one of my favorite actors
he plays a ladies man in this movie trying to get carell back on his feet after splitting with his wife
the two of them have great chemistry together and provide plenty of laughs along with touching moments
i just saw this movie yesterday and i already want to see it again
that almost never happens that i want to see a movie again right away
very cute
this movie has a little bit of everything and i think that most people would enjoy it
910
i will admit from opening bell that i do enjoy sappy love movies
it was a movie that made you laughcrywonder and cover your eyes
steve keeps true to his on screen character and his own real life strength but never forgetting to mumble some sort of funny line even in his most sappyest of moments
i give this movie two thumbs up for its twist at the end and keeping it out of viewers sights so well
i do however wish that they would have developed a little more back story with ryans character but still a movie to be enjoyed by all
emma delivers some nice side humor along with her friend in the movie as well
i believe steve may have surpassed expectations of his ability to play that main love role and still maintain his funny guy image
i feel compelled to write as i cant believe the rating this movie has
weve seen it all before many times and this movie brings nothing new
ok let me begin the first 40 minutes are funny if it ended there it would be 10 carrell amp gosling give good performances and really gel as a duo but like so many comedies it loses its way and the mid section drags only to find that the finale is a big sentimental schmaltz that really shouldnt be present in a comedy
why do american comedies always do this sandler carrey
its better than just go with it it couldnt be any worse
and the performances are all first rate its just a pity the project is wanting
just the usual storyline
parents break up in the beginning and get back together at the end
but the things that happen in between makes this movie a lot different a lot better than other movies of same genre
the positives are the way they have treated this story line the cast their acting steve carell keep this movie going and ryan gosling looks really stunning with his perfect abs
but the screenplay cud have been bit better
most of the scenes takes place in the bar
those thing make the movie go slower
and also the same old clichas like mom cheating over dad and dad getting back to the family in a thought provoking eye opening speech in the end are bit dramatic
but whatever said if only the pace of the movie was good then this movie could have become one of the best movies in this genre
i wasnt sure if i wanted to see this movie at the theaterbut i am really glad i did
the characters are well played out not very likable at first but after you get to know the cast you really feel for everyone
i thought julianne moore amp steve carrell had great chemistry with their relationship
super script nice directing great casting with robbie the son
this movie will surprise you at how good it is
i loved how you saw the characters at work at home at the bar amp with their friends
this was very well played out amp comes together in the end extremely well
ryan gosling is very hot even when he is sleazy
great date night movie
i usually cringe through these cheesy and dramatic moments but in this movie i didnt i actually enjoyed many of them and that has to be because of the great acting and that i like these actors especially emma stone and steve carrel
and the story is really well done interesting and enjoyable with good twists
i had few laughs as well through the movie so if you like romantic comedies you like this one especially that this is not a typical love story between two persons that you know they will end up together besides the drama is really well done here
a great message is delivered through this movie as well that you will get to you without too much cringing
crazy stupid love
is a very known film for a reason that i dont have any idea of
the characters are somehow interesting but the cast is just as hack as it could be considering theres just no new actor at all
therefore as you can imagine the movie as a whole is just another merchandising for those actors whose performances are almost always the same
ryan gosling on the other hand is someone i had rarely heard of and even thought he seems to be a copy of david arquette
moreover there isnt much to be said about this picture since it didnt stay in my memory due to the uninteresting plot that has been showed
maybe crazy stupid love
is just another movie from the hollywood that well hardly remember of
i was disappointed maybe expectations was too high because of high ratings
almost nothing was funny
i find there are very few good comedies from hollywood during last years probably there are some problems in this genre
to make a good comedy must be way harder than chunks full of special effects
another one dumb
i cant call it comedy a romantic film neither
waste of your time
nothing in this movie was plausible
a middle aged man whos wife is vice president in some company wears dirty running nb shoes matched with too big suit at his office and restaurant and when he finds out his wife wants divorce throws himself out of running car
then comes the saver and helps to get appropriate dress and the whole trite story begins
really boring
crazy stupid love is one very funny romantic comedy that pokes fun at the dating lifestyle and longtime marriages
subplots involving teenage love and jilted lovers create a tangle of funny complications
while the plot is contrived the entertainment kept me laughing
julianne moore steve carrell and ryan gosling delivered in their roles as well as marisa tomei and kevin bacon who get caught up in the family conflict
steve carell as cal was the husband who reacted with the cold silent treatment when his wife and lifelong love emily julianne moore asked for a divorce
he then embarked on a freewheeling lifestyle with advice from jacob selfproclaimed dating expert played by ryan gosling
marital problems lead to outside love interests that overlap families neighbors and work associates
the middle of the movie sagged a bit but was redeemed by some very funny scenes
all in all a family situation fraught with a maze of hilarious complications
crazy stupid love is a romantic movie
but it is also a comedy
the story  emily announces to her husband cal that they must get a divorce
cal accept it moves out of the house and every night visits the same bar and speaks of his story
there he will meet jacob a rich attractive man who will teach cal how to date women one night stand usually
however cal is still in love with emily
the movie has lots of twists giving the audience enough to satisfy them and keep them entertained till the end
very funny and clever dialogs keep the interest high
the actors are great each one at presenting a different character quite convincing
all in all a great movie about relationships and love
a huge cast steve carell ryan gosling julianne moore emma stone kevin bacon marisa tomei struggles mightily with a glib prefab screenplay by dan fogelman packed with awkward situations that go nowhere
each character seems to be prepared to espouse platitudes with the utmost sincerity any time the script deems them appropriate even if credibility suffers which it almost always does
with the exceptions of the agreeably smooth gosling and the warm and witty stone everyone has done better work they seem lost in all the talk carell in particular alters between cowering and manic but always just happens to be articulate enough to hammer home the literal points fogelman is intent on making
overlong and unengaging
crazy stupid love is one of those movies i can watch over and over again and never get bored of it
emma stone and ryan gosling have great onscreen chemistry and it shines through in this movie
although the story line is somewhat predictable with the badboy changeshiswaysbecauseofagirl and the typical thebabysittersinlovewiththefather storyline its nice to see the development of the characters through their hilarious experiences
im not the biggest fan of romantic comedies but crazy stupid love is definitely an exception
i always picture steve carell to be one of those awkwardly funny comedians because of the 40year old virgin and the office but his role in this movie opened up a new perspective
he still has his steve carell charm but brings in a new side of him as a man who has been broken by the love of his life
i have a newfound love for him after this movie
theres a lot going on with the plot of the story but its easy to follow and i was never left uninterested
good job
like so many other movies i have seen it started out great but ended weak
gosling was perfect in his role and carell was hilarious as always
emma stone was also very good and crazy hot
the problem i had was that the situations between everyone became more unbelievable as the movie went on
but those situations while not great werent terrible either
the one thing i did have a major issue with was the son
every time i saw him i wanted to slap him and shave his head
maybe that is a little cruel for a child that cant act to save his life and has an absurd haircut but whatever
still if the movie had wrapped up nicely it would have all been worth it
but the speech at the end went from dumb to just plain ridiculous
and if whats her faces dad was mad before i wonder how he will react to being the father of a registered sex offender
you know the polaroid deal
i mean seriously
wow you can imagine my excitement
that scene where ryan is just looking over the balcony and it is all in slow motion and he is wearing those tight pants and eating the pizza i was drooling
not for the pizza watch this just because he is in it
and beautiful emma stone nannaanna she is such a joyful actress she is full of life and love and i am so glad her and ryan end up together
the teenage girl on the other hand that loves cal is so gross he awkward face and body creep me the hell out i would have enjoyed the film so much more with out her in it
i felt like that was an unnecessary side story
do you wanna get out of here
is the line most girls will want to be said to them by the end of this film because we all want to have the time of our life
oh stop it fiona with all those cheesy puns
you will understand if you have watched the film
it would be a good movie if it werent for its indecision between being a funny movie and a serious sentimental one
but anyway it has enough of both features to make it agreeable to watch though on the whole it has too many funny scenes to be considered serious and too many serious scenes to be considered funny
but it has some witty dialogues and a few powerful sentimental scenes along with funny ones
the story tells us about a few crossed love situations a 13 year old boy in love with his 17 year old babysitter who is herself in love with the boys father a husband and a wife who seem to be on the verge of a divorce which appears not to be wished by the husband and maybe also not fully for the wife despite of her confessed adultery a husband who tries to take lessons of seduction from a professional philanderer and a few confusing situations that finish with a great surprise in the end
in sum a pleasant but not too ambitious movie
its true the high average review for this movie is somewhat warranted im happy to report as i enjoyed this movie when it was at its best pulling out the stops and spoiler heaping on the surprises
and this movie exceeds at doing that
crazy stupid love is a movie which packs in quite a few laughs while managing to mostly veer away from the crude humor something that inandof itself deserves praise
the whole steve carrol and ryan gosling character relationship and development was a hoot
this is probably steve carrols best movie to date and thanks in no small part to gosling
carrol is more or less in a reprieve of his usual character but the script helps uplift him
thereare unfortunately the occasional almost forced scenes of sentimentality too that feel misplaced
especially a lot of the dadtoson talks and wife and husband talk  which i patiently waited through as the heavyhandedness of those scenes would abate
still let me emphasize the occasional nature of those scenes not enough hurt my recommendation of a rental or checkout
i really like juliana moore she is pretty and so is emma stone she is so i dont know there is just something about her and then marissa tome is also really pretty
i dont usually like romantic comedies but this kind of wasnt it reminded me a little of 40 year virgin only better because it gave perspective of younger people and the older
if this is a twist and you havent watch dont read more i didnt know until it happened in the movie emma stone is steve carrels daughter
that scene to follow made me laugh it was great
it got me to thinking to about dating and stuff and i can kind of relate
maybe you have to connect with the characters or find them attractive i dont know but coming from a 28 year old male i liked it and would watch it again
i love this movie
ive seen it like a dozen times
ive seen selected scenes many more
the scene at jacobs house is fantastic
im in love with hanna banana
of course i can do lines
my mother didnt want to watch it because she doesnt care for steve carell either but it was on while we were getting ready to go to the casino
she liked it
i dont know how many times ive listened to so you think coffee and sleep dont mix well they do if its highpoint its decaffeinated
coin bears indeed
who are the writers these people are great
casting
wow
i loved everyone in it
there is so much talent joey king is lost
reminds of the gas station scene from waynes world
where they replace the guy with charlton heston
huge star with a tiny role
start to finish wonderful
love the babysitter analeigh tipton
love the asian friend
gotta get her name
brb
liza lapira
the human valium david lindhagen six degrees of kevin bacon putt put the asshole scene
this is a great movie
i ran out and bought the dvd
i thought this movie was hilarious
it made a bit of a mockery of the pua lifestyle which if you dont know what that is you wont get some of the jokes
there was a few rude things in there but it wasnt over the top like the disgusting and unfunny movie ted
i found myself laughing out loud carells sense of humour is like an art and he is just so natural
i read some people complaining about the story line editing and humour
they claim theres no romance or humour
trust me there is
if you find certain sexual topics a bit uncomfortable to watch with you family be warned
they arent graphic or disgusting just a bit awkward
overall very funny movie well worth the watch and not a second of boredom
honestly i really liked this movie
it really made sense and really stuck to the point that it was trying to make
it shows the ups and downs of love
plus it was really funny
there was a cast in this that i really enjoyed watch in this and they did an incredible job
kevin bacon was also a very good edition as well emma stone tries to hesitate ryan goslings charm but when things dont work out with another guy she finds her way with him and i like that
i mean who cant resist ryans charm
dont know
steve carell did a great job himself
he gets advice from ryan once his wife cheats on him and at the end some weird results go on
amazing romantic comedy
this movie at first i thought was going to try too hard to be funny
however it was way better than i ever expected
it has the perfect blend of comedy drama and romance
the best performance would have to be ryan gosling playing jacob
there are no weak links in the movie though
the plot flowed nicely with very few holes
the soundtrack has a very good mix
the lighting and editing were both top notch
there were a few moments where the acting was over the top but really didnt take away from the movie
the ending wasnt all that great but thats the only reason i really took 1 star away from my rating
this movie is perfect for a laugh and a movie that isnt too predictable
i didnt know what to expect when i went to see this film but ive now watched it three times
the way that it follows a lot of different story lines makes it interesting and all of the actors made their characters believable
i especially like the character of 13 year old robbie  jonah bobo  i think that he plays to his character very well and it is a very real portrayal of a teenage boy
steve carell shows that he can play serious roles and ryan gosling is the perfect choice for the character of player jacob palmer
there are a lot of funny moments and some more serious but heartwarming scenes
with some cute speeches and a theme of fighting for your soulmate this film is a great hit with teens and adults alike and went down well with my whole family
the characters are relatable to and its nice to hear their individual stories
i would definitely recommend this movie
this movie is your basic funny movie about a cheating spouse
this movie draws you in quick with the basic routine lifestyle of a family that gets bored and looks for a spark even if its from a fling of cheating
this movie hits the nail on the head numerous times but falls short with a few boring scenes and some of the script writing
the actors seem to do the best they can with what they have to work with or with the characters they are representing
i didnt agree with some of the actoractress playing some of the characters
some just didnt seem to fit the role of the characters
but still ok
this could be one of the top 5 funny movies if the edges were sharpened some
this movie will captivate you from the start with its unusual story and great performances it will make you laugh make you feel good make u enjoy every second of it at least that was in my case
every penny that you spent on this movie is more than worth it trust me and if u like this kind of movies the only thing you will be sad about is that you cant watch this movie for the first time ever again
its that original and funny with an epic ending conclusion which will put a smile on your face for a long time youll be smiling even on your way home
actors did a really great job in concluding this masterpiece especially steve carell and ryan gosling spicing it up
i wish i had alzheimers so it gets new every time i watch it  joking aside really great cinema experience
1010 go and watch it
no worries no spoilers crazy stupid love is a perfect title for this movie
its all about love obviously and how it can vary between gender and ages
in the beginning i thought it was funny but was kind of wondering where it was going
well if you go to watch it dont worry about it because the end shows all the connections in a hilarious way
it has to be one of the best endings to a movie that ive seen in a while
steve carell is a great actor and shows his softer sad side but does it in a quirky funny way
ryan gosling also plays his character to perfection
its a fun lighthearted movie with an outstanding cast
i would and have recommended it to friends
worth your money just for the ending and to see ryan gosling with out a shirt
this was strangely one of the best films i have seen in recent years
i went into it expecting it to be just another chick flick
i came out with almost completely the opposite feelings
first off what a stellar cast in this movie
steve carell ryan gosling julianne moore emma stone and marisa tomei
i was expecting it to be very similar to dan in real life a disappointing watch
crazy stupid love incorporated all the elements of what a romantic comedy should be
the name itself is enough to summarize the story
ryan gosling portrayed a very different role that we know him to be an unhappy richboy who has an epiphany and meets the right girl
his normal role is one who starts out happy or sad and just dives deeper down the rabbit hole stay drive u
s
of leland etc
crazy stupid love was an incredible movie that evoked numerous emotions out of me which is hard to do and would probably everyone else who gives it a shot
i loved this movie
it was funny sweet heartfelt and showed character growth and maturity
i love steve carell and he does an amazing job as per usual
ryan goslings characters transformation was amazing
julianne moores character did a great job showing the difficulties and how confusing love and marriage can be sometimes
emma stone was sweet funny cute and did a great job
the young son of steve carell was heartfelt adorable and really added to the movie
the ending actually surprised me not sure if it was just me but i am never usually surprised in romantic comedies
nothing too sappy nothing too inappropriate or raunchy
the movie was almost 2 hours long but did not feel like it
for a large cast they pulled all the characters together very well
the characters stories are realistic making it a great movie
not a chick flick just for women gosling and carells characters relationship is funny for all
this is a great movie for anyone to watch and portrays how crazy people really are when they are in love
a surprising movie on many levels
sassy humor mixed with grounding reality
the story seems to sprawl a little in the way it goes all over the place at times and yet it manages to create a fun gem of an evening
i havent laughed so hard in a theater in a long timeand it wasnt over the crude humor that so often gets the crowds going which i dont care for
yes there is crude humorit seems to come with the territory in steve carell moviesbut that is not the basis for what makes this movie great
nor is it great in the sense that i expect it to land a bunch of award nominations
but if youre looking for a movie that mimics life but presents it in an entertaining way youll probably enjoy this one
the actors portray their characters well the plot twists keep it interesting and it is really a deeper story than the surface value suggests
realistic in its unpolished perspective towards love and uniquely entertaining in its raw disorganized humor crazy stupid love strays far from being a regurgitation of all other artificially sweet romantic comedies by a considerable amount
as predicted steve carell adds his oneofakind awkwardly amusing touch that goes so well in practically any comedy this one not being an exception
steve carells goofy attractiveness conjugated with the more gallant and serious mien demonstrated by ryan gosling adds a pleasantly balanced overall mood to the film
crazy stupid love unlike most others in its category centers its focus on both the blissful side and utterly disgruntled and havocfilled side as well such an encompassing approach is what yields the positive differential that sets it apart and incorporates an added level of excitement
this movie will keep you guessing throughout
its a funny and sweet story of life mixed in with all types of love
steve carell plays a great sullen character as always in reaction to his chaotic surroundings
he is mentored by a mysterious wealthy and handsome young man in which he learns a thing or two about picking up women and fulfilling his inner man self
youre never too old to learn something new and youre never too young to love
this movie is filled with surprises leaving the audience in dumbstruck in some cases
love isnt always clear sometimes its crazy and stupid
the journey of love is always surprising especially when you reevaluate your life at the same time
the best scene of movie was when at the surprise party dad finds out who is his daughters boyfriend
a funny struggle but also complicated
emma stone role and action was amazing
but falling in love for a 13 years old kid was not attractive
also movie had a slow rhythm some stereotype substories that could be more different and attractive by injecting some more creativity into the writers brain
adding sexfactor and stupidsuddencoincidences are not a maturenoble way of writing but unfortunately these things always work people need to be entertained withoutthinking and just having fun
i laughed loud at several moments of this movie but that was totally temporary and really stupid
i thought when i sat down to watch this that it would just be another silly film with steve carell in it but i couldnt have been more wrong
its a very well written romantic comedy that looks at the life of steves character cal weaver who has been asked for a divorce by his wife and soul mate
ryan goslings character jacob sees that cal is distraught and offers to help him become a better man and a womanizer with some funny results
the film also looks at his 13 yr old sons crush on his 17 yr old baby sitter that is also very entertaining
its just a brilliant heart warming film with brilliant acting
steve carell is brilliant in it as is ryan gosling
enjoyed every minute of it
the best romantic comedy ive seen to date hands down
this is an exceptionally enjoyable movie for what could typically be expected out of it
first i am not a fan of steve carell but he does very well
also ryan gosling is very appropriate for his part
however i rated the movie 8 not because of the actors or the somewhat enjoyable plot but because there where some moments that were really good
and not romantic comedy good but truly fresh funny and well played
of course it didnt manage to avoid all the banalities which we in one or another way see in most romantic comedies however it did stand out with those small moments that really made me smile
crazy
stupid
love is a bit naive for sure but it is also inspiring and at some parts truly touching
crazy stupid love was an okay movie
it wasnt as funny as i thought it would be but it did have a good plot
they should remove the genre of comedy from the movie because its a normal drama with different love stories along with a few funny parts just like any other movie
my favorite character in this movie was jessica emma stone shes a great actress and played her roll very well
she and ryan goslings chemistry was actually believable
i love how the two completely different stories link together towards the middle and end
i would recommend this movie to anyone who likes a drama film as well as a funny story line plot and cast members
the love in crazy stupid love is not that crazy
but the movie is kinda stupid indeed
after watching the trailer i thought i was gonna see a romantic comedy that can actually tell me something about love
however it didnt touch me or tell me anything at all
especially the directors completely loses control of the movie when emma stone brings ryan gosling to parents
im giving 4 points
for the first one its the minimum for a movie
the second one for the director telling a story
nowadays a lot of filmmakers even fail at this part
the third point goes to steve carell and julianne moore for their chemistry while they totally dont look like a couple in person
the last one is given to ryan gosling for being so hot
as for emma stone i had a lot of expectations for her
but she still looks like the high school girl from easy a and not attractive at all
ryan is just too sexy for her
anyway its still a good movie to kill time
i really regret wasting 118 min on this movie
in general the story line is very common and even in that its not rich at all
yet its not even flowing in a realistic believable way
it might be a weak try to critic the sex free social life in a not very funny sarcastic way
yet it does not represent that message in a good way
not a funny scene or a quote would last in my mind from this movie
however there was one line that really stuck in my mind as it did not fit in the theme and there is not even a weak explanation on what it meant in the script it was when cal weaver told emily weaver am glad we switched babies at the hospital
a line that did not mean any thing related to the story
it could be 2011 best off topic movie line
well i would say we have seen the same story again n again
only the difference here is they have some twist in the end which i found totally out of place
this movie was a total let down and i would not recommend anybody wasting their time
the whole execution the story is really poor in my opinion and none of the scenes make a lasting impression
i had expected a better movie than this and the twist in end i found as been put together forcibly just because they want some twist to regular story
well let me talk about performances steve carell is good gets advantage as he is producer of film
julliane is ok
kevin is small rolereally good actor emma stone just lost her one fan in me
i mean seriously
ryan is ok and gets little scope but good as flamboyant playboy
his story is undeveloped and should have been better told
steve carells youngest daughter is really good actress
if you have not watched her film then you should check out ramona and beezus
rest of the cast is ok and did give ok performances
i love my wife
let me say it again i love my wife
i have sat through brokeback mountain and i have watched the notebook for a tradeoff for her to watch shaun of the dead
tonight i willingly tried to watch crazy stupid love
i have never seen a movie that was so predictable
the characters the lines the situations come on
i dont watch movies to see someones abs or someones chest
i watch movies to be entertained
this movie was so far from entertaining it was ridiculous
steve carell was enjoyable not as much as in the 40 year old virgin but not bad
the only thing is this type of character can only pull a film so far
it is the epitome of female fantasy
cute young guy older aging guy old exwife young female love interest
where did they hope this film was going to go
it went nowhere
at least the notebook had a story  however sappy brokeback mountain was a cinematic marvel kudos to ang lee
this movie has nothing
if i were able to rate a 0 i would have
