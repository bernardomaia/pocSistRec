"\nThis was one intense movie-going experience. Throughout the entire\nrunning time of the movie, the suspense never lets up.<br><br>The director masterfully weaves the haunting atmosphere, and I was at\nthe edge of my seat. The plot is a wonderful puzzle, unraveling slowly\nto reveal hidden layers of depth and complexity. The acting was\nwonderful, emotional and nuanced, with some unforgettable moments (The\ntwo leads - Gyllenhaal and Jackman - give their career best\nperformances, but the biggest achievement in my opinion is Paul\nDano's). The musical score contributes to a sense of dread, as well as\nthe rich sound design and the chilly color palette of the breathtaking\ncinematography.<br><br>All those parts add up to a rare, gut-wrenching, dark and fascinating\nmasterpiece - the kind that lingers with you long after the credits\nroll.\n"
"\nHugh Jackman takes you on a trip through the intense emotions a family\nis put through during its darkest hour. This may be his best role to\ndate. From the trailers you know that his character will be out for\nblood as their daughter was kidnapped, but throughout the film you feel\nhis pain, anger and moral struggles as he deals with this situation.\nThe director does an excellent job of keeping you invested in the film\nemotionally even through some intensely violent scenes. Its dreary\nsetting provides no comfort, but goes hand and hand with the narrative.\nThis film may not be for those faint of heart but should be a must see\nfor most viewers.\n"
"\nI just came back from the theater and to be honest I went into this\nmovie with very low expectation! But WOW did it prove me wrong. The\nfilm left me on the edge of my seat all the time, one could argue\nthings were slow sometimes but it only adds to the beauty of the big\npicture.<br><br>Performance are top notch and if it was for me I would give Jackman his\nvery deserved Oscar for this amazing performance, of course all the\nother performances were really great also but Hugh's stands out for me.<br><br>This movie is worth your time, and I'm sure by the end of it you'll\nkeep talking about it with your friends, for me that is a success stamp\nif the movie can keep my mind busy all the time.<br><br>This is not your feel-good movie. This is a perfectly paced thriller\nwhich I haven't seen anything like it in a very long time. For me this\nwas a totally new experience as I usually go for lighter movies in the\ncinema, but after this movie I will go out of my comfort-zone in movies\nmore often to find masterpieces like this one.\n"
"\nPrisoners is extremely suspenseful and equally disturbing. Canadian\ndirector Denis Villeneuve, whose last film was the equally spellbinding\nand disturbing Incendies, builds up the tension from the first frame\nand does not let up for the full 153 minutes of the movie. Aaron\nGuzikowski's script, though on the surface a child kidnapping thriller,\nbucks all Hollywood trends and, as well as being a taut thriller, poses\nserious moral issues. It also helps that the film has a first rate cast\ndoing outstanding work: Hugh Jackman, Jake Gyllenhaal, Paul Dano,\nTerence Howard, Melissa Leo, Maria Bello and Viola Davis. Prisoners is\nnot for the faint heated but is likely to feature strongly at next\nyear's Oscars.\n"
"\nThe first 15minutes are rather good and gripping, then the plot becomes\nweaker and stupider by the minute, it made me think they made up the\nstory as they went along filming.<br><br>You've got one implausible fact and character after another, for one\nthe detective works alone, fails repeatedly to call for backup. The\nmany violent scenes seem purely voyeuristic and don't bring much to the\ntable.<br><br>Jake Gyllenhaal's acting abilities are terrible (and not only in this\nmovie), he's got two facial expression either the doleful look or a\nkind of smirk. <br><br>I watched this movie after reading the NY Times review, please someone\nfire the journalist who wrote it!\n"
"\nTo anyone who misrepresented this movie as being worth more than 3\nstars simply because it had a decent cast... I'll make the wild\nassertion that you don't know what a decent \"crime-drama-thriller\" is.\nIt wasn't thrilling. It wasn't drama. It was just a crime. You could\nhave bigger thrills holding your breath until you pass out from lack of\nintelligence. It was like Three terrible episodes of Law-and-Order\nwithout the good parts, topped off with a weak ending. I hope Hugh\nJackman hates this movie. {PAD} {PAD} {PAD} (Attempts to pad the\ncomment with junk words can result in your account being blocked from\nfuture submissions.) This movie wasn't worth 10 lines of text.\n"
"\na complete waste of time, full of errors and nonsense e.g. what value\ndo the teenage boy and girl add to the movie?, is Jake gyllenhal the\nonly cop in town?, the guy locked up in that little prison is bleeding,\nwithout food or water for over a week and he is alive?, underestimates\nthe audience's intelligence. <br><br>initially i thought this was all about getting the two little girls ala\n\"taken\", but the movie goes nowhere. It is painfully slow and runs on a\nreally poor scenario. <br><br>the birch's don't take any initiative to get their daughter back? they\njust follow Keller's approach?! <br><br>instead of screaming HELP, Keller uses his daughter's whistle?!\nreally?!<br><br>absolutely ridiculous...seems like people had money, threw it together\nwith big name actors, and voilà, a motion picture for the masses...not\nimpressed!<br><br>i do not know how it got a rating of 8.1!!! totally misleading.. \n"
"\nSome ground rules. Legend has it that the first-time scriptwriter for\nthis oddity was paid a million dollars, and then the project was\nshelved because they could not figure out what to do with it. Then they\nhad a brainstorm. Just make it. And here we are with an\nalmost-Hitchcockian pseudo-thriller that occasional resembles a police\nstory and even sometimes a horror film. The story gives new life to the\ncliché, \"plot holes you could drive a truck through.\" Hugh Jackman\ngives the performance of his life, but his character is so lacking in\nempathy that this might not be enough. Jake Gyllenhaal plays himself\nwhich ironically is more than enough to carry the role. Maria Bello is\nlost. Dennis Villeneuve is a great director who can make even the rain\ninteresting and one would like to see him try his hand at something\nbetter written. Like the phone book.\n"
"\nI figured out the most of the plot after the first 45 minutes of this\npainfully slow moving painfully wannabe suspense movie. 'Prisoners' is\nself-indulgent mind-numbing fare. It parodies the film noire genre\nwithout intending it.<br><br>The audience is treated as a fool, and the director apparently gets\naway with it--if the praise showered on this con-job of a movie on IMDb\nis a reliable indicator. Hugh Jackman out of the Wolverine character is\nwhat the audience wanted to see in this film, and he tries hard but he\ntotally wasted in this 2-1/2 overstretched and subdued melodrama.<br><br>Watching Andy Warhol's slow motion movies at a further half speed would\nbe more entertaining.\n"
"\nThis is the worst movie I have seen in so long I can't remember a worse\nmovie. Perhaps there was one that was worse in the past but this movie\nis the new champion of \"worst movies I have ever seen in my life\". If\nyou believe that suspects can shoot themselves while under custody at\npolice stations and torturers can stay out of prison after being found\nout, then this movie might be for you, especially if you enjoy watching\ntorture. They even throw in a pedophile priest who murders a murderer.\nAfter all Hollywood can never resist a slam at Catholicism given\nHollywood's high moral compass. I rarely write reviews but this piece\nof crud is such a waste of time that I'm writing it for those people\nthat enjoy Hugh Jackson (I like his stuff) and want to see a movie with\nhim in it. Even the acting stunk the place up, including Hugh's (I\nguess torture really isn't his bag). If I could give this movie a minus\n1000 I would.\n"
"\nReally surprised that this has garnered so much praise. Many comments\ntalk of great acting performances but as I frequently point out to\nfriends, shouting with intensity is not great acting! I can't believe\nHugh Jackman agreed to take such a risible role. You always know you're\nin trouble when there's SYMBOLISM! The policeman is Loki, Norse God,\neveryone is 'religious' though nothing stops their sadism,etc. Subtext\nlink to US forces in Iraq - being bad to bad guys just perpetuates the\nviolence. The 2 mothers are ciphers, with no characters, letting the\nMen do the work! Come on this is 2013! Great cop who's solved every\ncase- yeh, right!- who misses every clue. And at 2 &amp; a half hours...in\nthe end, I didn't care.\n"
"\nIt has some essential ingredients for a good movie, such as some good\nperformance by Jackman, Jake Gyllenhaal and Viola Davis, and a good\ncinematography, but awful script and bad directing. The movie is full\npacked with stupid gaping holes in the plot, which cannot be digested.\nThe character of the detective is shallow despite the acceptable\nperformance of Gyllenhaal. There are many attempts to make the movie\ndeeper than it is, but in my opinion failed big time. Also,the film had\nway too many wasted moments. Most of it did nothing to move the story\nalong.Overall, it's disappointing, and I felt I was the prisoner for\ntwo and a half hour.\n"
"\nThis movie implies the idea that torturing someone for days is\nforgivable in response to a supposed kidnapping. It seems that it is OK\nto do justice with your own hands.<br><br>Besides, throughout the movie, Hugh Jackman's character keeps breaking\nthe law numerous times. He drives recklessly, \"drink and drive\", etc.,\nagain with the implied message that it is OK for this matter.<br><br>Moreover, the boy who drives the van (Alex) clearly had mental issues.\nHe should have been sent to a mental illness hospital, which would be\nable to better understand him. Movie is full of mistakes and the\nmessage sent is against the law.\n"
"\nI usually agree with IMDb's ratings but unfortunately not this time,\nThis movie was mediocre at best and really nothing we haven't seen\nbefore, A lot of Clichés and suspense tricks we've already seen in\nother movies of this type, I could not really relate to the characters\nand felt that the dialogs were corny and that I have already seen them\non other movies. I could have given it a 7 but it was way way way too\nlong, Could have easily fit into 90 minutes instead of 153 !!! To tell\nthe truth I fast forwarded at least 30 minutes of the movie because I\njust got bored. The acting and plot were believable for the first hour\nbut after that it got too much for me to even care, This is really NOT\nthe masterpiece everybody here are talking about.\n"
"\nThis movie had a strong character lineup with great acting all around.<br><br>The plot was solid, typical good guy bad guy storyline.<br><br>They gave away everything in the movie with little hints of what to\nexpect, as if you were watching a Crime Television show.<br><br>The ending, this is my biggest peeve. If you spend the time to make a\ngood movie 2 1/2 hours long, FINISH IT.<br><br>I would have rated this movie an 8 of 10 if it weren't for the terrible\nending. This type of ending ruins so many movies. This is the exact\nreason why people don't pay to see them in theaters anymore, you always\nend up mad at the end because they couldn't finish it.<br><br>Just sayin'\n"
"\nA movie about an old lady kidnapping small kids and giving them drugs\nwith a needle... Wow!!! and a parent losing it and torturing a guy with\na deformed face in an abandoned property of his, which he cannot repair\ndue to economic problems. I think that movie adds to the mission of\ncinema and cinematography in general. No wonder why there are so many\nweirdos overseas... And I have to write ten lines the least for my\nmovie review to b posted. So I'll start say awful things about this\nmovie... Don't even try to press play on this movie it doesn't worth\nit. The Spiderman guy tries to act as a detective and the Wolverine guy\ntries to act as a family guy. The first has a tick and I believe that's\nwhy this movie is having an 8.1 average in IMDb and the latter has a\nproblem with alcohol and he can't be convincing for even a second. Ahhh\nmy ten lines (or more) are complete. Go Away from this so called movie.\nGO AWAY!!!\n"
"\nThis film was on cable one night. It lost steam quickly as the story\nbecame bogged down with pointless silly situations. The plot meandered\nso much that I had to read the synopsis as the story progressed. If you\nhave a PVR and your recorded it, feel free to stop it and check other\nmovies on cable. That's what I did. However, I did finish watching it.\nIf this movie had been quiet throughout, it would have helped\ninsomniacs to finally get a good night's sleep. Watching paint dry is a\nbetter alternative. <br><br>One of the ironies of this film has to do with one of its producers -\nMark Wahlberg. Wahlberg was one of the leads in Peter Jackson's, \"The\nLovely Bones.\" Prisoners is a poor ripoff of that movie. The Lovely\nBones was a superior film in every respect. Prisoners isn't a film\nthat's worth watching more than once. The Lovely Bones is.\n"
"\nIt's very troubling that this movie was even nominated for ANY award.\nThe actors were fine but the script and directing was just ridiculous.\nThe director had no idea how to connect the dots. I'm not making a\nspoiler here because there are so many loop holes in this it's like\nSwiss cheese.<br><br>I did get a screener for this but it's insulting that Warner Bros.\nshould send this out to even be considered for an award. People who\n\"thought\" they had a handle on this garbage should watch it again\nbecause you screwed up the 1st time. The director needs one good swift\nkick in the pants.\n"
"\nSuspense? Thrill? Edge-of-your-seat-movie? After seeing these words in\nthe reviews, I couldn't wait to see the movie.... and for me it was\njust boring, absolutely no suspense at all. Yes, the acting was good,\nbut I hated the father's and the policeman's character as well, so I\nhad nothing out of the good acting. :) Although there were some\nstunning looking scenes, the whole movie was dark and depressing, and I\nwas surprised when I saw Roger Deakins as the director of photography.\nI just love his work and would give him not one but a couple of Oscars,\nbut not for this one, it's not so impressive. Before the end it got\nslightly better, and I had no problem with how it ended, so because of\nthat and because of Roger Deakins it became a 6 instead of a 5 for me.\n"
"\nAfter viewing this film, my wife and I argued about whose fault it was\nwe had borrowed it from the library. I insisted she was responsible;\nshe said I chose it.<br><br>We don't understand why this has rated so highly with other viewers.\nThere are so many absolutely absurd holes in this plot that we spent\nmore time pointing them out to each other than watching the film. The\nsoundtrack was poor, which was unfortunate, so we often missed key\nwords or sentences and that didn't help, I'll admit. But it really was\nthe writing of the plot that put us off. If actions taken by the\ncharacters don't make sense, then we lose interest and that's what\nhappened with us about an hour in.<br><br>I'll not bother saying more than that as it would constitute spoiler\nafter spoiler if I picked apart what we saw. You can make up your own\nmind if you watch it and perhaps you'll make more sense of some of the\ncharacters' actions than we did.<br><br>I'll just end by saying that it might try to be a modern \"Silence of\nthe Lambs\", but it falls far short of that high standard.\n"
"\nI have never seen as many people walk out of a cinema as I did when I\nwent to watch this - I would guess that a minimum of a third of the\naudience left!! It is ridiculously slow and about an hour too long. The\ndrama is not drawn out at all and you just end up wishing that they'd\nget on with the storyline. Attempts to draw out the tension are basic\nand laughable, while the excellent cast are forced to use tortured\nfacial expressions to give the film any semblance of feeling.<br><br>Overall an incredibly disappointing experience. I was expecting to love\nthis, I ended up wanting to follow everyone else out of the cinema.\nRidiculously poor, given the promising subject and excellent cast.\n"
"\nThis film has absolutely no redemptive value. Filled with great actors\nand yet the story is full of plot holes, unbelievable dialog and\ndisrespectful to the audience's intelligence. How did it ever get\nmade?!? Do NOT watch this film. AND, the snake scene is absurd! There\nis not one character in the entire film who is someone that draws you\nin or evokes sympathy or empathy. By the end of the film I was hoping a\nmeteor would fly out of the sky, hit the town and blow up the entire\nplace! Two and a half hours and $6.99 (Amazon.com) gone from my life!\nBy the end I felt like I was the one held prisoner and tortured. I\nreally hated it.\n"
"\nI was amazed by this movie. Characters are powerful and emotional. My\nfavourite is Gylenghall because I never saw him in such a way - nervous\nbut calm, devoted to his job. Of course it seems that he doesn't have\nany personal life, and I think it is a little minus. Like I didn't\nbelieve some of Hugh Jackman character's actions at the end of the\nmovie. Tha'ts why I give it 9 stars. The strongest part of the movie,\nwhy I will remember it - it's story. So twisted, puzzled and provoking\nemotions (anger, pity, sadness...). Although this movie falls into\nsimple category of \"dissapeared children movies\", it is one of the\nbest! The story ant acting makes it so.\n"
"\nPolice 101: Never enter an interview room with your duty weapon. This\nmovie displays why.<br><br>Police 102: When a person is examined and displays the mentality of a\n10 year-old, yet possess a driving license, a detective worth his\nweight would enquire at the license office how this came to pass.\nSomething might be learnt which sheds light on the reality of the\ndisplayed behaviour. Something a seasoned detective would not ignore.<br><br>Other law enforcement failures, but the movie does do well otherwise.<br><br>Jackman and Gyllenhaal play very believable characters. I was quite\nimpressed with Jackman's part. His emotions are running wild as he\nwants his child found. And Gyllenhaal does well feeling stymied by the\nsystem and a Captain who is more worried about perception and budget\nthan solving crimes. <br><br>Great acting on all parts. Very enjoyable film.\n"
"\nPlease, if you're reading this as you consider seeing this awful excuse\nfor entertainment, run away! DON'T DO IT! My only consolation was that\nI saw it on HBO rather than having wasted $10+ at the theater.\nPointless, virtually plot-free, full of idiotic red herrings,\nderivative, BEYOND gratuitously violent - need I go on? I will go on -\nI created an IMDb account just so I could warn people away from this\natrocious mess. I kept mentally comparing this movie to \"7even,\" which\nin spite of the violence had an actual plot, made sense, and lent us\nsome insight into the characters' psyches and motivations. The red\nherrings in \"7even\" were woven into the movie and not just thrown in\nfor - what? - effect? Distraction? Shock value? I think they were for\ndistraction - to distract us from the fact that \"Prisoners\" just blows.\n"
"\nwhat was this maze all about? i thought at end there could be something\nabout that maze. what was that bob taylor story about? the captor knows\none of her captives has escaped yet makes NO EFFORT to leave, clean up\nevidence, DO ANYTHING AT ALL, just stays there.

"\nIf I could give a rating of less than 1, I would. <br><br>The best part of the movie was the trailers of coming releases.<br><br>Had I left after the trailers, I would have been better off.<br><br>After a good suspenseful start, this movie drags on and on with no\nclear connections between events.<br><br>The characters are not really convincing in their roles, except for\nmaybe Mr. Dover.<br><br>Unless the story is deliberately trying to convey ineptness on the part\nof the characters, there are far too many missed connections between\nelements introduced early in the story.<br><br>As Lisa Simpson says, \"it is just a bunch of stuff that happened.\"<br><br>A better crime drama can be seen on any syndicated police story.<br><br>It is a major disappointment.

"\n153 mins. Why?<br><br>The opening sequence is joyful. I got a laugh when black dad couldn't\nplay the trumpet, and the kids were happy. Then the disturbing\ndisappearance.<br><br>It's intense, it's elaborate. But it's just an extended episode of a\ncop show - and there's loads of unrealistic scenes where the cop\ninvestigates on his own. That's denial of pension rights there.<br><br>One great thing is the performance of aunt Holly, but the director cut\nit short. What about a chase scene where a lithe granny outshoots a\ndull detective? Never seen that before.<br><br>And one great irony was the torture of the child-man by the desperate\nparents - how could they ignore this in the end of the story? Nuts.<br><br>I've read great stuff about this director, but it felt ordinary (except\nfor the snake thing - like the spider in Enemy?).\n"
"\nI was so excited to see this movie, I love suspenseful thrillers and it\nhas been too long since a good ones come around. Prisoners delivers a\nmix of predictable suspense with some elements of surprise, like the\nending. The movie entangles you in an emotional roller-coaster then\nstops prematurely. I loved the movie, but left feeling twisted &amp;\nrobbed. The cast was superb and the story unraveled nicely but\ncollapsed hard on you at the end. Its a terrible feeling that the\ndirector puts you through and I hate him for that. I would wait for the\nDVD and hopefully he will fix the ending on a special extended\ndirectors cut edition then you will have the ending this movie\ndeserves. It is just not complete, why start something if you are not\ngoing to complete it? Its like an incomplete sentence you get from a\nloved one on their death bed. \"I left you a million dollars in cash in\nthe back of .........?\"\n"
"\nVery well directed, poorly written, badly cast, well filmed waste of\ntime.<br><br>Predictable, trite but pretty film with poor performances from all\nexcept Paul Dano who was absolutely brilliant.<br><br>The narrative didn't go anywhere you couldn't predict and trod ground\nalready well worn and muddy. Jackman seemed insincere, Maria Bello\nmiscast and extremely annoying. Considering other features of the\ngenre, Silence of the Lambs springs to mind and makes this look quite\namateurish.<br><br>A polished turd.\n"
"\nI had such big expectations for this movie. The trailer made it look\nvery interesting. And, I love thrillers. I love Hugh Jackman and Maria\nBello. In fact, all the actors did a very good job. However, this\nseemed to me no more than a Criminal Minds episode stretched to over\ntwo hours. The storyline was all over the place. The end result made\nsense, but took too long to get there, leaving trails never completely\nfollowed, or throwing things in that were never explained (like\nJackman's not drinking for 9 1/2 years). And the end... well, unless\nthey're doing a sequel, the end just left me thinking \"that's it?\". I'd\nprefer to watch Mystic River again than this.\n"
"\nThe real problem with this movie is that it doesn't know what it wants\nto be. I don't understand what the director was aiming at. The film\ntries to be Mystic River and Seven at the same time. Was it a drama?\nWas it trying to be suspenseful? It fails both way. It's too full of\nthriller clichés to feel dramatic, it's too morally ambiguous to be an\nentertaining thriller. Everything is quite good: acting is great, the\natmosphere too, and Villeneuve is a great director. But all the\ningredients just don't blend together, I felt like I was watching two\ndifferent movies at the same time. Still trying to understand what the\nending is supposed to mean.\n"
"\nThe whole \"Crime:In the name of Love\" story is not that attractive due\nto the mass editing problems,some scenes seem to be a little strange\nwithout any logic senses.The director has tried so hard to show the\nstory with two parts including the Dovers and the Detective,but also\nfailed to dig the real meaning from it,about crime,about faith,about\nlove and belief.The whole frame of the story is so vacuous that\neverything seems to be unreal,so are the performances.To be frank,Hugh\nJackman has given us a convincing father who has suffered a lot,but\nsome of his behaviors still remain incomprehensible.Jake is awesome as\na police detective,but I'm not sure if he can get another Supporting\nActor nomination.Oscar winner Melissa Leo has shocked me indeed.\n"
"\nIt was unique and amazing, had my attention the whole way through. One\nof the best movies I have seen in a while. Brilliant acting and\ndirecting. Intense and wonderful. Definitely should and will win\nnumerous awards. I strongly recommend seeing this film. It was a\nmasterpiece and captivating. Acting by Hugh Jackman and Jake Gyllenhaal\nwas inspiring and chilling. It it was very clever and creative.\nDeserves a 10/10, it was one of the greatest movies I have ever seen\nand who ever made it should be knighted and presented with the most\nhighly regarded awards. Spectacular and so good and great just the best\never and wow so good\n"
"\nStory was good. But I don't think it could have been directed any\nworse. First of all movie was extremely slow. The pacing the timing was\nso awful. There were a lot of unnecessary scenes that could have been\nshortened or not used in the movie at all. I can say at at least 1 hour\nof the movie could be cut out and the story wouldn't change, in fact it\nwould be better. The slow rhythm of the movie made it like drama more\nthan a thriller. There were parts where it got really really boring.\nJake Gyllenhaal's bad acting made the movie even worse. And it had the\nworse ending ever. The only thing good about the movie is Hugh Jackman.\nHe's kind of saving the movie with his great acting. Other than I can\nsay that it has a good and strong story, but unfortunately turns out to\nbe a really bad movie.\n"
"\nThis movie is too long and many scenes go nowhere or unanswered.<br><br>After one of the girls escapes and is in hospital recovering while\nstill affected by the drugs given has the other father rush in and\nstart screaming at her ( what parent would let that happen ) asking\nwhere his daughter is. Finally she says \"you were there\" he knows right\nwhere to go to confront the old woman.<br><br>The father finally finds out that his daughter is alive and is very\nclose by and freezes in his tracks when an old frail woman points a gun\nat him even tho he declared the whole movie he would do anything to get\nher back.Then he handcuffs himself , drinks poison , moves a car ,\njumps in a hole in the ground all because the old woman tells him to.<br><br>The detective who seems to be the best sits around watching old videos\n, looks at old newspaper clips looking for clues ignores the suspects\nthey have arrested and follows the father. He also ends up at the old\nwoman's house.<br><br>Thats just a few , way over the top acting on both main characters.\n"
"\nAverage plot, Average movie with well above average Actors.<br><br>This is probably what makes the movie watchable. The movie seems like\nan incredible waste of the highly talented actors they were able to get\nto make it. It makes me wonder if these actors made this to fulfill a\ncontract obligation with the studio. Nothing else makes sense. Hugh\nJackman, Maria Bello, Jake Gyllenhaal, Terence Howard, Paul Dano,\nMellisa Leo, and Viola Davis.<br><br>If this group of actors had a good script, well, it boggles the mind\nwhat they would be able to do with it. They took this ordinary fare and\nturned it into a moderately entertaining movie. Huzzah!!\n"
"\nThis was a very teeth grinding kind of movie. very emotional. some\nreally good acting on everyones part. they did not mess around and\nbuild it up to when the girls would be taken. right at the beginning of\nthe movie they would kidnapped. and right then i new it was going to be\na emotional ride through out the whole movie. I feel that the police\ndid do what they could and only could do at the time when they arrested\nthe man in the RV. now Hugh Jackman did what i think any father would\ndo. my self included. I'm a father to a wonderful little baby girl. i\nwould do anything to keep her safe. You could feel the anger and the\ndetermination in Jackman when he was questioning the young man. great\nmovie all around. its a must see.\n"
"\nsimply awesome. may be the best movie of this year. Best Acting in a\nleading role huge jackman do his best. I chose him Oscar for this\nposition. O my god what a movie....!!!! jack gyllenhaal i was not your\nfan before this movie...and huge jackman too.... a lot of\nsuspense..thriller,drama. if you love thriller/drama you should must\nwatch it. Prisoners is a dark and grimacing movie. It doesn't really\nshow how Hugh Jackman really wants his daughter back so to say, it\nshows even more grimace and more depth in the horror of what is one to\ndo. Hugh Jackman is the heart of this story. He brings on the true grit\nof his character which was fantastic. So no more talking...\n"
"\nDenis Villeneuve's Prisoners possessed an intensified, unrelenting\natmosphere that is provides a uniquely captivating atmosphere. This\npsychological labyrinth covers multiple layers of how people are\nprisoners in their own complicated world. The film thoroughly and\ninformatively explores all the character perspectives with refined\ndetail, however in instances this tight grasp the story has on\ndepicting the explicit stress each person displays perhaps gets in the\nway of a fluent, coherent story line. Subtle moments in the film such\nas Loki's tattoos, Bob Taylor's boxes of snakes and more significantly\nwhat was the ultimate outcome to Alex Jones go unexplained.\nNevertheless with phenomenal lead performances, you can happily ignore\nminor plot flaws to this riveting mystery and cynicism this film hits\nthe audience with.\n"
"\nPrisoners is nothing like you expect it to be from seeing previews, and\ndrawing conclusions. It's exceptionally fast paced, and though it has a\n2 hour 28 minute running time, it flies by. Boasting an All-star cast,\nand a plot mildly familiar to The Lovely Bones (though slightly\ndifferent, and far more adult than The Lovely Bones), it was more than\nThe Lovely Bones could have ever hoped to have been.<br><br>With fantastic Direction from Denis Villenueva, and spectacular acting\nfrom Hugh Jackman, Jake Gyllenhaal, Maria Bello, Paul Dano, and Terence\nHoward, this film is extremely engrossing, and powerful.<br><br>An absolutely spectacular, engrossing, suspense-filled drama. Superb\ndirecting, acting, and a brilliant plot. <br><br>8.4/10\n"
"\nThank god the prayer came true,<br><br>This movie truly captures how devastating having your children abducted\ncan be. It portrays the atmosphere perfectly, the desperation and\ndespair.<br><br>Jake Gyllenhaal performs as well, if not better than he did in Zodiac.\nHugh Jackman gives one of the best performances of his career, an Oscar\nworthy performance in my opinion.I have always thought Hugh Jackman\ndidn't know how to play anything well except for Wolverine. However\nthis movie in combination with Les Mesirables has changed my mind.<br><br>This movie is definitely one of the best of 2013. It stands up there\nwith Gone Baby Gone and Mystic River as one of the best movies about\nchild kidnapping there is to date. It grips you throughout with an\natmosphere of suspense and mystery. Showing how the kidnapping effects\nthe families and the detective associated with the case. A definite\nmust watch for anyone who appreciates an excellent thriller or drama\nfilm.<br><br>A 9/10 for me and it earns a spot on my favorite thrillers list.\n"
"\nI was still expecting for a great thriller/drama this year and i think\nthat \"Prisoners\" is the one. The movie manage to keep you in a great\nsuspense the whole time and the ending was well put. Also the actors\nmanage to love the movie by the end. It s close to another great movie\nwith some kind of a resemblance, \"Mystic River\". The main plot is not\nso different end the ending is also similar. For a two and a half hour\nmovie i would recommend you those two movies. You won't regret watching\n\"Prisoners\" if you like thriller/drama kind. Too bad i didn't saw it\nfirst on the cinema, it would have been a better experience to watch. I\njust hope it won't take long until i'll watch another great thriller.\n"
"\nFull of emotions and with all the necessary twists and turns\n'Prisoners' achieves to keep its audience for the full length of the\nfilm concentrated and awake. It simply makes you think how far will you\ngo to protect your family.<br><br>Though its plot is not unique, the performances by the main actors keep\nthis crime thriller among the better of this type of movies.<br><br>It is definitely one of the best films for 2013. It is probably the\nbest movie i saw with Jackman and definitely one of Gyllenhaal's best!\nIt shows very clearly to all, the grief, agony and pain parents feel\nwhen something goes wrong with one of their children.<br><br>I recommend this film as one of the best of its kind!!!\n"
"\nDetective Loki (Jake Gyllenhaal) is searching for a child serial\nkiller, and catches Alex Jones (Paul Dano) in an old RV. Meanwhile,\nKeller Dover (Hugh Jackman) and Franklin Birch (Terrence Howard) lose\ntheir daughters during a gathering. Loki has to let Jones loose, but\nDover is not letting him go.<br><br>Paul Dano always does a great creep. Jake Gyllenhaal does a capable\ncop, but I think he overacts sometimes. The interrogation room scene\ncomes out of nowhere. I think that was a mistake. The big acting comes\nfrom Hugh Jackman. He's the key to this movie. It's possibly his best\nperformance. He is intense without being melodramatic. What Keller\nDover does in the movie is absolutely fascinating, and morally\ndangerous. I do wish the film go full out on that route. The film does\nlet him escape morally a little too easily.<br><br>Director Denis Villeneuve is a skilled Quebec filmmaker. He has\nfashioned a tight intense thriller. However, it resolves too neatly.\nIt's a dirty dark movie. I'd prefer an ugly dark ending. Although I'm\nnot going deduct any points for that.\n"
"\nPrisoners .. Although this movie might have some holes in the storyline\nbut overall, it is a real great thriller and suspense that you will\ndefinitely enjoy .. The movie has an intense amount of suspense and\nhesitation that keeps you always asking yourself who did this .. who\nkidnapped the girls .. and slowly the plot keeps opening clues that\nwill eventually lead to a complete story .. The ending scene and the\ncut, shocked me a bit since I was looking for something more beautiful\nthan this cut but the movie is a great enjoyable experience ..<br><br>One final thing, I believe that Hugh Jackman deserves an Oscar for his\nacting skills in this movie ! He was awesome !!\n"
"\nThe previews/trailers for this film never resonated with me so I had it\npretty deep on a \"to see list\", but the opportunity arose to take in a\nshowing recently. This film has stuck with me for a while now--it has a\npresence about it that crawls underneath your skin. It deals with very\nadult themes and can, at times, be tough to view, but it is an\nimportant film that allows us to witness how some individuals handle\nadversity and frustration. Many of the critic reviews acknowledge the\nwork by Jackman, but it is the work by Gyllenhaal that really wowed me.\nHis cop was a fascinating character who appears to have had a rough\nupbringing, has overcame it, but now chooses to dwell alongside the\nlowest forms of society. A beautifully filmed movie with tremendous\nacting.\n"
"\nIn my opinion this movie was great and the director truly managed keep\nthe experience thrilling throughout the whole film. I couldn't easily\ntell what was about to happen which I usually can do when I watch\nmovies. The mystery and confusion, you was really left wondering and\nasking a lot of questions and most of the time I was glued to my seat\nfollowing the ongoing hunt.<br><br>Jake Gyllenhaal did a great job portraying his character of a police\ndetective who works tirelessly to complete his job. So it's definitely\na big up for the best performance in his career in my opinion. A lot of\npeople has complained and raised a lot of questions about the ending\nbut don't be discouraged. If you use critical thinking and extrapolate\na little bit you'll understand.\n"
"\nIf there is one thing someone could say about this film, that would be\n\"woah... has it been 2h30m already?\". I must say, I heard a lot about\nthis film before watching it, I even read the reviews. Everything about\nit lived up to my expectations. What I was expecting to see was a film\nthat would keep me at the edge of my seat, which it literally did, a\nfilm that would have me guessing all the way through, which I tried\nreally hard not to do but did anyway, and finally a film that -as a\nfriend had told me- would have a predictable \"twist\", which it sort of\ndid. This is a very good action/thriller/drama kind of film that really\nmanages to capture you from the very beginning and keeps you at the\nedge of your seat throughout. It's not that we have not seen stuff like\nthis before; kidnapping movies tend to be ubiquitous, but there is\nsomething about this one that stands out. Jackman gives an outstanding\nperformance, easily said about the rest of the cast as well. I highly\nrecommend this film for everyone.\n"
"\nWhat would you do if suddenly your son disappears without leaving any\ntrace? What would you do if you felt your son's life was in danger?\n\"Prisoners\" shows us that our worst fears can sometimes take control of\nour minds and change our way of acting and thinking. So what if you\nlost your daughter and no one is capable of helping you? \"Prisoners\" is\nthe story of two families who are confronted with this exact situation.\nIn 153 minutes we are invited to look to the changes in the family\nmembers's behaviors while they lose their hope. Finding his daughter is\nthe one thing that Keller Dover, played by Hugh Jackman, has on his\nmind and when he sees that Detective Loki (Jake Gyllenhaal) is not\nfollowing his clues, he decides to make justice by his own hands. This\npowerful and emotive story about families, love, and fear is one great\nDrama full of suspense and outstanding performances by all cast\nmembers. \"Prisoners\" is alongside with \"Gravity\", one of my Oscar\npredictions for the next year.\n"
"\nA subtle mix of suspense, tension and questioning that doesn't fade for\ntwo and half hours. A psychologically harrowing and almost disturbing\nstory that takes advantage of the balanced and well played actors\nperformance. A special mention to the stunning symmetrical evolution of\nthe main actors characters played by Jackman and Gyllenhaal. The\ndirector gives us the free choice to pick up our character side, which\nevolves with the complexity of the situations. This leads to a constant\nquestioning about the right and bad way to solve the case. I just\nregret that the intrigue lacks a bit of pace. Overall a great movie in\nthe pure line of 'mystic river' and 'Zodiac'.\n"
"\nPRISONERS is A dark, disturbing, and often grueling viewing experience\nthat definitely pays off if you stick around for the climax. Its Well\nshot, well acted, and well paced. Hugh Jackman and Jake Gyllenhaal both\ngive great performances. It was really good, and my personal favorite\nfilm of the year so far....If you liked the movie \"Ransom\", I think\nyou'll like this. It might be too much for certain people, especially\nchildren.....This director could probably do a really cool Wolverine\nmovie with Hugh Jackman.....the plot involves Hugh Jackman and Terrence\nHoward's characters and their families spending the holidays with each\nother when their daughters suddenly go missing. They enlist the help of\nthe police to help them find their daughters and things get\ncomplicated....The movie isn't just intense and scary but thought\nprovoking and realistic.<br><br>8/10\n"
"\nThis film deserves the praise it is earning and here's why. Firstly you\nhave a very solid cast. Each character play out their roles with solid\nperformances, solid enough to become emotionally attached and sharing\nsome part of the pain they are feeling. The films tempo is also nicely\napplied, applied correctly so that throughout each scene, you become\ninterested and curious as to what may happen. Much of the storytelling\nis done in a stripped back style, a muck more basic ground of\nstorytelling but an elegance that makes it so fulfilling and worth much\nmore than that. If ever you've played the game The Last of Us, then\nyou''ll understand what I am trying to explain. Overall I highly praise\nthis film for being such a great watch, but also the feelings I was\ngiven whilst watching this movie, such as; suspense, intimidation and\nthe thoughts of each scene I still have after reaching the conclusion\nof this film. If ever you gain an opportunity to watch this film, I\nhighly recommend you go and see it.\n"
"\nJackman and Gyllenhaal give career best performances in this\ntantalizing suspense thriller. The story, the plot, the screenplay, the\nacting, the direction, the set everything is perfect and is comparable\nonly to the legendary 'Silence of the lambs'. I generally do not dare\nto compare any movie to the later but i am just compelled to mention\nthis here. For a movie to be this good everything has to come together.\nIf the story does not pack the punch than no matter how many dollars\nthe producer spends on the movie it can't become legendary. Prisoners\nis an excellent story which is fully complemented by the acting\nperformances of Jackman, Gyllenhaal and every other cast member. Paul\nDano (little miss sunshine) who plays the character Alex is worth a\nspecial mention here. He plays a disturbed kid in this movie and is\nessential to the maintenance of suspense and he does it seamlessly. I\nurge you to watch this movie in the theaters. It makes sense to\nencourage and appreciate brilliance which today is so rare in the movie\nbusiness.\n"
"\nAre the days of promoting team playing over? Leading characters in\nPrisoners are strong individualists who are committed to pursue their\ncase and obtain results at any cost; feelings of people close to them\nare less important.<br><br>True, observing vigorous personalities is always catchier and attracts\nwider audiences - and the movie in question has enjoyed big popularity\nand positive attitudes already. Director Denis Villeneuve has skilfully\nutilized Hugh Jackman's and Jake Gyllenhaal's skills, and supporting\nactors like Paul Dano or Viola Davis are always a firm choice. Tensions\nare high, viewers can ponder about guilt and remorse, gray and rainy\nbackground boosts anxiety... The length, however, is too much (pace\ntends to fade at times) and motives of the chief offender could have\nbeen different. The ending is versatile, a kind of summing up all\npreceding events... Unexpected, but still not wow!.<br><br>Thus, a decent thriller, recommended to those fond of gloomy\nsurroundings dinned by weather. But take/save your time as ca 2,5 hours\nare ahead...\n"
"\nI went into this movie \"blind\" (i.e I did not read any reviews ). I\nwasn't expecting much but was pleasantly surprised by the movie. The\nending may have been a bit predictable but getting there was a fun and\namazing ride. Hugh Jackman gives a very powerful performance surrounded\nby some excellent supporting performances. Paul Dano is fantastic as\nalways. The material is dark and the movie is not an easy watch but it\nwill keep you interested until the bitter and controversial end. If you\nlove good acting and a pretty decent story then this is the movie for\nyou. I also was impressed by Jake Gyllenhaal's under stated\nperformance. I don't usually like the guy but he's great in this one.\nHe's also surrounded by great performers so it's hard to shine. All and\nall you will enjoy this movie but , as a parent, it's not an easy\nwatch. In fact it can be down right disturbing and will having you\nthinking about the content for days....but that's what good movies do.\n"
"\nThis is a masterpiece thriller with good acting both from Hugh Jackman\nand Jake Gyllenhaal. It's a good kidnapped story, however I must say\nthat I'm quite depressed after watched this movie. Perhaps,it's too\nemotional and gripping. Around 20 minutes before the movie finished,I\ncan guess the kidnapper and here you can expect a twist and clever\nending. I am impressed with Hugh's acting since I only saw him as an\naction hero like in X-Men or Wolverine.I do hope to see him in more\ndrama movies. If you want a simple thriller movie, then be brace\nbecause it can be too emotional for you.I also love Melissa Leo's and\nPaul Dano's acting.\n"
"\nI really loved this movie and it made me emotional. I really felt like\nI was there with the families going through everything they were going\nthrough. I felt their pain. I thought I knew what was going to happen\nand then something else happens and I am drawn into the movie just\nwaiting to see what happens next. I kept thinking what if this was my\nfamily? What if I was in that position? What would I do? <br><br>This is one of the best movies I have seen in a long time. Hugh Jackman\nand Jake Gyllenhall do an amazing acting job for this movie and it also\nhas Terrence Howard and Maria Bello. <br><br>I have seen many movies this year including Elysium, Despicable Me 2,\nWorld War Z, Star Trek \"Into Darkness\", Iron Man 3 just to name a few\nand this was by far the best movie of the year so far. If you like\nsuspense thrillers and emotional movies then this is a must see movie.\n"
"\nVery few thrilling flicks grace the movie screen that has you almost\nyelling right in your seat like the movie Prisoners. The acting is real\nas Maria Bello leads this all star cast down a real road of what do you\ndo when your children have been kidnapped from right from under your\nnoses. Jake Gyllenhaal is spectacular as the detective who investigates\nthe mystery crime in the small town. Paul Dano plays the suspect in a\nway that only he could do it. What makes this so real is the other\nacting of Hugh Jackman, Terrance Howard and Academy Award winners\nMelissa Leo and nominee Viola Davis. The movies only 2 1/2 hours long\nbut seems like 4 hours with the intriguing story line.\n"
"\nThis is probably one of Hugh Jackman's best roles yet. However,in the\nreal world wouldn't the FBI be involved from the beginning as they do\nin all kidnap cases? And, how could there be only one detective on the\ncase? usually they always work in pairs and the detectives and the\nCSI's would have torn the suspects home and property apart from the\nbeginning and ultimately found the car/well/ pit .<br><br>The girls mother (Hugh Jackmans' wife) also made a marvelous recovery\nas soon as her daughter was found but her husband went missing.<br><br>A great story but a little far fetched in the real world of law\nenforcement.\n"
"\nA haunting, suspenseful and masterfully acted ambitious picture with\nemotional complexity and a sense of dread, especially if you are a\nparent considering the subject matter, that makes for an absorbing and\ndisturbing view. The film is several steps above most other recent\ncrime thrillers or revenge stories, deciding to not only be\nunforgettably intelligent with an intense story while being brilliantly\ngrounded in reality, but to care as well. It's so potently riveting\nthat I couldn't turn away from it until the first ending credit. I\ncan't praise this film enough and I feel that it deserves to have the\nhonor of being discussed as a potential awards contender starting with\nboth Hugh Jackman and Jake Gyllenhaal, who give what is perhaps the\nbest performances of their careers as their character-driven roles as\nthe two leads were raw, real and makes you start questioning about what\nwould you do if you were ever put in the exact same position either\ncharacter's shoes were in.\n"
"\nThis is a really good example of its genre and is a rewarding watch.\nThe performances really make this film, especially Maria Bello and\nTerrence Howard in their supporting roles. It's two and a half hours\nlong, but doesn't feel like it's dragging on. It's not especially smart\nbut there's enough suspense and grim mystery to keep your attention. I\nthought it picked up nicely during the vigil scene and kept my\nattention from then on. I liked Gyllenhaal's portrayal of Loki, and\nthought the eye tick and neck tattoo underscored the dysfunctional\nmotif. There were a few clues along the way that make sense once the\nfilm reaches it's conclusion, which I guess is fun if you like figuring\nthings out. It's a good movie and the actors did a good job, but it's\nnot one I would watch again soon.\n"
"\n\"Prisoners\" is the kind of mystery/drama that stays with you long after\nyou've left the auditorium. Denis Villeneuve's choice to emphasize and\nbuild tension by long takes gives the film an engrossing feel, and also\nhelps the actors to really sink in and disappear into the characters.\nSupported by Roger Deakins' masterful cinematography and Jóhann\nJóhannsson's haunting score, the film develops a bleak world which will\nkeep you captivated for days.<br><br>P.S. The film's mood reminded me of two shows that I immensely love:\n\"Twin Peaks\" and \"Forbrydelsen\".<br><br>Be sure to check them out, if you dug this.\n"
"\nPrisoners. It's a slick dark crime investigation thriller raising few\nquestions on moral ambiguity. The theme is based on kidnapping of two\nsmall children in a small town where police fails to make much progress\nand a parent takes matters into his own hands. Like Ben Affleck's\nsmashing debut Gone Baby Gone, the movie's journey is about putting the\npieces of clues together and in parallel questioning how much evil you\ncan become to counter the evil? Lead actors Hugh Jackman and Jack\nGyllenhall give their best and supporting actors provide nice support.\nMovie takes the conventional route of a crime drama but it's the\nunsettling intensity in atmosphere through grey background and chilling\nperformances that keep you puzzled in a good way from start to finish.\nLike other classic crime thrillers, it asks you to provide your full\nattention and makes you discuss it more and more long after the movie\nhas ended.\n"
"\nSurprised by the conflicting scale of reviews on this film , its not\nthe film of the year , but its a very good one. The cast are excellent\nso much so that my wife has now gone from liking Hugh Jackman to seeing\nhim as some sort of mad rampaging bully, perhaps that's more to do with\nhis treatment of Paul Dano who she has a soft spot for. It isn't Jake\nGyllenhalls finest film much preferred him in end of watch but it is a\nsolid performance. Paul Dano is excellent in his portrayal of the prime\nsuspect &amp; the film builds up a true sense of menace &amp; suspense leading\nto its conclusion. The miserable setting a weather adds to the\nundoubted despair of the characters &amp; the direction is solid. If I have\nto add one criticism its that the film is 30 minutes longer than it\nneeds to be which leads to a feeling of this is being dragged out for\nthe sake of it. Excellent supporting cast , well worth a watch , but\nnot a fun night due to the subject matter.\n"
"\nJust watched this with my movie theatre-working friend who watched this\nyesterday though he didn't mind seeing it again. Hugh Jackman and Jake\nGyllenhaal are quite compelling as a frustrated parent of a missing\nchild and a police detective who tries to do everything right in\nfinding this child, respectively. They both go after different suspects\nand it's quite interesting what the results are. Plenty of\npoints-of-views of methods and which suspect is guilty abound and it\ngot me hooked for most of the narrative. One might be disappointed at\nthe way things end but since the dialogue offers clues as to what could\nhappen, one should still be partially informed enough as to the\neventual conclusion. In summary, Prisoners could be good enough for\nanyone not minding everything not spelled out in a neat tidy package.\n"
"\nSuspenseful, moody and wonderfully acted. A worthy contender with the\nlikes of 7even, Gone Girl or Zodiak. More Hitchcock than all out gore\nfest, a prime example of how to put the viewer in an awkward position\nand question the integrity of those in the movie.<br><br>I very rarely have to pause half way through movies just to have a\nthink and a break- but this did it. It makes you confront our own\nmorality and pushes generic stereotypes (such as the priest) to the\nlimits of our own minds. <br><br>It's also rather poetic, the prisoner theme dips in and out but the\nending really ties it all together and gives the title more meaning. <br><br>A dazzling display of cinema.The same director will be doing the next\nBlade Runner and at this rate, with this directors background - it's\nsure to be incredible too. Bravo.\n"
"\nWow, that's one really overrated movie (it even got an Oscar\nnomination). I don't understand why director Dennis Villeneuve is hold\nin such high esteem but this drama/crime/mystery film is just boring.\nDespite the shiny cast and the atmospheric direction this is just a\nmediocre missing persons crime movie that is painfully slow and\nlengthy. Good luck trying to cope with 153 minutes of slow motion\n\"action scenes\", like watching people crossing a road in the rain in\nreal time (and in slow pace)! I do not know how everyone considered\nthis movie an \"emotional, absorbing and disturbing viewing\" (rotten\ntomatoes critics consensus) but I would say that is just a disturbing\nviewing. period.<br><br>Grade: D\n"
"\nI love movies and I love the mystery movies the most and sorry to blow\nmy own trumpet, I have seen a lot of them.<br><br>Prisoners is one of the best mystery movies with a gripping plot. The\nperformance delivered by Jake and Hugh are simply amazing. You feel the\ncharacters and play them. While Hugh Jackman is on screen, you feel his\npain of father searching for daughter and while Jake Gyllenhaal plays\ndetective, you feel like a true detective. The movie keeps you engaged\nin solving the mystery. The ending is completely satisfying and\neverything, though appears to be so enigmatic all the time, makes\nsense.<br><br>This is a masterpiece and a must watch for all the movie fans.\n"
"\nWhat makes Prisoners so special, is that it is more than just one of\nthe most tense thrillers ever seen, classified into the ranks of\nthriller-titans, like \"Seven\": It raises questions, builds up\nlabyrinths and puzzles, twists the plot countless times and leaves\nspace to interpret. You must watch out, be attentive and curious in\norder to find out everything, and even then you have to watch the film\ntwice if not more times. Rounded by a genius-like actresses performance\nof Hugh Jackman, Paul Dano and especially Jake Gyllenhaal playing the\ndetective Loki. How would I have reacted in cases like this? What means\nthis? Finished with a great ending, Prisoners is a must-see for every\nfan of thrillers or just movies better than the rest.\n"
"\nI think that a movie needs to be watched at least twice to know whether\nit's good or not. Lots of movies aren't worth a second viewing but\nPrisoners was OK enough to see again.<br><br>The first time I liked it. The plot is interesting, quite original\ndespite the topic, kidnapped children. It's a bit depressing and not\nfor sensitive souls. The actors are doing a great job and there's a\ndark atmosphere throughout the entire movie, mainly because of the\ngreat cinematography.<br><br>When I watched it a second time and the story was no longer a surprise,\nI thought there was too much added thrill factor/action scenes. I think\nit would be a lot better without the excessive violence, a rapid car\nscene that is way too long and so on. <br><br>I rated it an 8, a bit high maybe but I tend to like cinema with\ncertain atmospheres and this thriller does it quite well.\n"
"\nLegendary director Alfred Hitchcock could easily have crafted this\nbrilliantly written, incredibly riveting and intensely suspenseful\nthriller. Instead, the virtually unknown Canadian director Denis\nVilleneuve is responsible for what is without doubt the best movie of\n2013. There are staggering performances from Hugh Jackman and Jake\nGyllenhaal,intricate plot twists that keep you on the edge of your seat\nand atmospheric elements that will make your heart race and interfere\nwith normal breathing patterns. Before viewing this movie, It is\nrecommended that you keep a brown paper bag by your side to prevent\nhyper ventilation and make sure to trim your fingernails as you will be\nbiting them to the very end.\n"
"\nIt was good to see Hugh in a movie besides Wolverine and I knew it\nwould be a definite movie to watch because you could see all of the\ndifferent emotions he was going to be going through throughout the\nmovie and that's what made me really want to watch it and I'm glad I\ndid. It was hard to see Keller beating on someone so relentlessly, some\nof the movie was a little slow but I thought it was still pretty good\nall in all. Most of the movie was easy to follow and I didn't figure\nmost of it out until the end, I know I'm a little slow but the worst\npart of the movie was the ending.....ARE YOU KIDDING ME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\nI don't care if he would have ended in jail, I just wanted to see him\nrescued.\n"
"\nEverything about this movie is just amazing. Hugh Jackman gave away one\nof his best performances, he was so good in playing the complicated\ncharacter that you sometimes hate and in other times you feel bad for.\nJake Gyllenhaal also did a great job, his character is so interesting\nand you just want to know more about him. Paul Dano is unrecognizable\nand the whole cast did a brilliant job.<br><br>We have seen so many abduction movies but this movie is different from\nthem with its scary realism. The movie is very intense and some scenes\ncan be very violent but you can't look away for one second because you\nknow you will miss something.<br><br>The cinematography and the soundtracks in this movie are wonderful and\nadded more to the intensity of the movie.<br><br>The movie is very interesting and you don't feel bored throughout the\nwhole running time, it's a very dark movie and can be hard to watch at\nsome points. It's thrilling and very suspenseful with a great ending.\n"
"\nAfter a disappointing summer of lame movies, the autumn looks more\npromising, with a bunch of great movies that haven't been as forced\nupon us. \"Prisoners\" is the best of them I've seen so far, and is in\nfact the best movie i've seen at the cinema in a while. Though that\nwouldn't be hard.<br><br>With a promising cast, and controversial storyline, \"Prisoners\" looked\ngreat to me, and it is. The Plot is actually better than I expected.\nWith great twists and turns throughout what is actually (as everyone\nsays) a thought provoking story.<br><br>Plus the cast do the best job possible in bringing it all to life. In\nJake Gyllenhall, Terrence Howard and Paul Danos Case that won't be that\nmuch of a surprise. But the main draw of the movie is watching Hugh\nJackman act his socks off as the grieving father. I always liked Hugh\nJackman, so its great to see him actually act his a** off for a change\nand put away those shiny \"Wolverine\" claws of his for a while to make a\nproper dark and interesting thriller.\n"
"\nAt first it is a very long and boring movie.2:30 hours without\nexplaining nothing.what was happening to the girls?what is the maze all\nabout?they found the man in the end?too many scenes crying and wasting\ntime,except that,i would prefer showing more about the maze and more\ncreepy things because i saw the movie is a horror/thriller.this movie\nis an absolute waste of time.Also the movie has a lack of inspiration\nand the director just couldn't think of some scenes and leave them\nwithout the spectators knowing nothing.i would like to add that\ndetective Loki was not acting very well,i didn't see emotions.DO NOT\nWATCH THIS MOVIE I REPEAT DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE!!!\n"
"\nProbably one of the worst movies ever. The plot was slow and\nexcessively idiotic. Either the majority of human beings who rated this\nmovie above 7 are all imbeciles (it's quite possible that they are), or\nthe algorithm of rating is skewed. The story of the priest, the killer\nand his old disgusting wife and the rest of it is unbelievable. We feel\nno sympathy for any character. The idiotic Alex is repulsive and him\ngetting beaten is warranted, he should have been beaten more even\nthough he turned out to be an innocent victim in the end. The end is\npoor beyond belief... The girls are found and the father disappears\nbecause the old woman kills him ?!!! an old fat freak, he could have\neasily knocked her down even while half-asleep but he didn't. What's\nthe point in writing more... In the end I do not blame the writers or\nthe actors for they are known to be stupid but I am very disappointed\nwith the IMDb users who rated that movie as high as 8/10... Really\nthere are so many retards in this world.\n"
"\nThe plot is so unrealistic and badly written, I really regret my time.\nMy advice is not to waste your time watching this movie. I'm surprised\nto see it in the top250.<br><br>There are so many questions that arise when watching it, it is even not\nfunny.<br><br>The worst movie I've seen since quite long time.<br><br>First plan roles are plaid stupid, they act illogically. Second plan\nroles are very bleak. I hope even the youngest public is able to see\nthat.<br><br>Once more, I'm surprised to see such a high rating for this. It is\nabsolutely not worth even 1 point.\n"
"\nThis is a movie about two families and their two little girls that\nvanish unexpectedly one afternoon. This story will make you experience\none of every man's worst fears. Loosing your child. You will feel\ncompassion, pain, quilt, doubt, conflict. The acting is amazing and i\nmust admit, i had a long time to enjoy a movie purely for its acting\ninstead of its visual effects or the complex story. The plot is simple\nbut interesting, with a few twists that will keep you on edge until the\nend. Despite the length of the film, i did not get bored at any point.\nBoth Hugh Jackman and Jake Gyllenhaal do a terrific job and i can not\nimagine anyone better for their roles. The rest of the cast is evenly\ngood and the actor playing the prime suspect fits perfectly the part.\nAll in all, it is a movie that will make you feel sentiments to the\nextreme and that is quite rare nowadays. I recommend it undoubtedly!\n"
"\nAn amazing descent into annihilated and compromised morality. Abounding\nwith complex characters, and hidden plot levels. <br><br>It takes the dare of repeatedly skipping forward briefly in time,\nmaking us catch up and fill in pieces, pieces that we do fill in. But\nthe result is an acceleration of time that allows the makers to focus\non the unfolding and deepening horror. <br><br>It deeply explores how trauma redirects the moral compass. It's also a\ngreat murder mystery. A great detective story. It's rich and complex.\nIntensely emotional. In many ways almost as powerful as Silence of the\nLambs, but more of an ensemble piece. We see the evil in supposed\nheroes and the innocence in supposed villains. We see unredeemed evil\nincarnate and total heroism. <br><br>All in all, quite a ride.\n"
"\nThe movie was so suspenseful that i had to deal with it by going to\nsleep multiple times while it was running. In fact, my whole crew was\nsleeping while it was still on. Save 2+hours of our life and watch\nsomething better instead. With such a wonderful cast, the whole project\nwas badly executed. Bad bad bad, too much time span to deliver such a\nuseless and unbearable story line. I hate it to my guts. Don't start\nwith giving time to pick up, I gave it a chance and believe me this was\nthe worst movie i have ever seen in my lifetime or hopefully will ever\nsee. I have never written a review before but this one really deserved\nmy Oscar.\n"
"\nThis is very excellent movie . I mean wow ! This movie contains\nabsolute thriller. And the drama they put in this movie is remarkable.\nThanks to all the casts, directors all those people who made such a\nwonderful movie. The cinematography and story telling of this movie is\njust awesome. You cannot pause or leave the movie in the middle (\nunless you are soft kind of person and you don't want to see brutality\nas this movie contains a few scenes).<br><br>It is really must watch movie. Really great !!\n"
"\nTwo very good actors ply their trade very well. Jake Gyllanhaal plays a\npoliceman who is utterly driven in his quest to find two kidnapped\nlittle girls. Hugh Jackman plays a survivalist who \"prays for the best\nbut expects the worst.\" During Thanksgiving dinner, two little girls go\nup to a rusty old RV and shortly thereafter, disappear. The prime\nsuspect is a mentally handicapped young man, the driver of the RV. But\nthe girls are nowhere to be found. He is held for 48 hours and then\nreleased. It is then that Jackman takes matters into his own hands. He\nkidnaps the young man and, convinced he knows everything, tortures him\nand beats him for days. Meanwhile, another suspect arises but Jackman\ncan't handle this and keeps pounding away. There are numerous twists\nand turns that seem to work well. Gyllanhaal is a troubled guy himself\nwho has some anger issues that he keeps under wraps. I had not heard of\nthis film and it was a treat to view it.\n"
"\nI loved loved loved this film! I was in doubt if I would like it but\nwow!<br><br>There were a few things I had a hard time with, for instance, the scene\nof a tree? I didn't really understand that, and they had a few random\nmoments. I also thought the kids weren't the best actors when they were\non screen. But otherwise, I think it was a great movie which takes the\naudience on an emotional ride!\n"
"\nThis is a very well made film. Quiting its first 30 minutes, the rest\nof the movie it's a time where you got to think a lot. Predicting the\ncharacter's movements, thinking about who's going to be the criminal\nand guessing the end of the movie, makes this film a really watchable\none. If you like thrillers, you're going to love this film! Watch it!\n"
"\nThis movie is one of the greatest movies I've ever seen. The\nperformances from every single cast member is 1000/100, there will\nnever be a better cast in a movie than Jake Gyllenhall, Paul Dano, and\nHugh Jackman. The cinematography by the amazing Roger Deakins is so\nbleak and dark, you feel dirty just by watching the movie. The writing\nand directing are tight, there's no scene or line that deserve to be\ntaken out. If you love crime dramas, watch this movie.\n"
"\nJust watched with my girlfriend, who falls asleep at every film we\nwatch... she didn't fall asleep during this one. <br><br>Kept on the edge of our seats for 2 hours, with the film playing you\nout like a flute. Would recommend to anyone looking for one of the best\npsychological thrillers I have ever seen. <br><br>Side note: After the film, my girlfriend just went to the loo, so I hid\nin one the rooms opposite, waited for her to finish and walk past the\ndoor before I JUMPED OUT ON HER. Think she soiled herself... funny as\nhell. <br><br>** DO NOT READ THE SPOILER ALERTS **\n"
"\nI don't want to write to much. All i can say is that this is a movie\nthat will keep you at an aery uncomfortable suspense the whole way\nthrough. This is the ideal definition of a Thriller. Not to mention the\ncast consisting of Hugh Jackman who goes from a loving everyday person\nto a broken, desperate father having to use unconventional methods to\nfind his daughter. Than of course we have the great Jake Gyllenhaal\nwhich plays a cop though an intense performance.<br><br>This is a must see for the masses and if you love thrillers, you just\ncan't afford to set this one out. It's hard to describe the movie in on\nshort sentence but after a while it dawned on me that in many ways it's\na near perfect example of what a thriller should be.<br><br>Jonathan Katz\n"
"\nThis is one of the best movies I have seen in the past 20 years. I\nmainly watch thrillers and this is a Thriller directed well, acted\nwell, and keeps you interested throughout the whole movie. This movie\nis why Jake G. is now one of my favorite actors. This guy has an inborn\nacting intensity that is very rare. I wish they had a sequel to this\nwith a new case for Jake's detective character - and of course it would\nstart out with a better conclusion to this one - I just could not\nhandle the end...I have to imagine my own ending, because as far as I\nam concerned, this \"Prisoners\" movie is not over. It's too late for an\nalternative ending but, seriously, the detective has not thought this\nthru. The pattern of the character that is missing was to pursue\nfinding his child...he never would have stopped unless he was dead.\n"
"\nWow. I expected a nice thriller before going to bed. And man, did i get\nmore than i bargained for. This is a great movie.<br><br>It starts very atmospheric, but straight like any other well made\nabduction movie. Thanks to the great direction and the work of the\namazing cast it doesn't drop. No, instead the movie takes one turn\nafter the next, as the families glide into desperation and the\npoliceman doubts each and everyone. The drama is very believable and\nkept me on the edge through all to 2.5 hours it lasted.<br><br>In the end i was puzzled scratching my chair begging the movie to solve\nthe intriguing mystery it had built up. And it did. Simply an amazing\npiece of movie-making.\n"
"\nThis is a great movie, especially the role of detective, an actor that\nI like. first of all I thank you for the movie cold well. thus becoming\none of my favorite movies. The prisoners made we think that from the\nbeginning of the story we already know the principals actually, but in\nthe end it turns out we have to make an educated guess wrong. really\nthrilling to watch this film up to second the end of the last movie,\nreally a valuable experience, I highly proud to be able to watch this\nmovie. This is a great movie, especially the role of the detective, an\nactor whom I like. First of all I thank them for cool movie well. thus\nbecoming one of my favorite movies. the prisoners make us think that\nfrom the beginning of the story we have actors actually know, but in\nthe end it turns out we have to make guesses wrong. really thrilling to\nwatch This movie until the last second the end of the movie, really\nexperience precious, I'm very proud to be able to watch this movie.\n"
"\n\"Wow, such an amazing movie!\" Well, that's what I was saying for 2\nhours and 20 minutes. OK, I still agree with that old me, to some\nextent. :D But... the last 20 seconds... a cliffhanger like that?\nSeriously?! OK, when it comes to the whole story, the producer really\ndid a wonderful job, but why on earth do some producers think audience\nwants this kind of ending? Fine, it doesn't have to be a happy ending,\nbut give us SOMETHING :D we just wanna know how it finishes for God's\nsake. Anyway, definitely one of the most exciting movies I have seen\nfor quite a long time, and the actors... should I really comment on\nHugh Jackman's and Jake Gyllenhaal's acting? I just wish I had stopped\nwatching a few seconds before the ending. :)\n"
"\nPrisoners was one of the most intense movie-going experience I have\never had! Denis Villeneuve masterfully weaves a haunting atmosphere and\nit had me on the edge of my seat the entire run time. It creates a\ncomplex puzzle of a plot that is just impressive to behold. It unravels\nslowly to reveal hidden layers of depth and complexity. The actors felt\nreal as they were emotional and nuanced, with some unforgettable\nmoments that were just simply terrifying to experience. This film is a\nrare, gut- wrenching, dark and fascinating masterpiece that will be one\nof the most underrated of all time. Everything about Prisoners from\nit's acting o it's gorgeous cinematography, excellent pacing,\nintriguing writing and fabulous directing makes Prisoners one of my all\ntime favorites. But I don't recommend parents watch it with their kids.\n"
"\nWhen Keller Dover's daughter and her friend go missing, he takes\nmatters into his own hands as the police pursue multiple leads and the\npressure mounts. But just how far will this desperate father go to\nprotect his family? Thanks to 2 great performances by Hugh Jackman and\nJake Gyllenhaal, great suspense and even some horror or action\nPrisoners succeeds thanks to good writing and direction. And it's a\nshame that none of this 2 won an Oscar for their performances\nespecially since Jackman didn't pretend but actually cried in one of\nthis scenes. The bad thing about this film is definitely the ending\nwhich totally destroyed the movie but also the fact that one of the\ncharacters gets trapped and 99% dies down there which totally ruined it\nfor me but that won't make me down grade the movie because it's still a\ngreat dramatic thriller.\n"
"\nI personally think this is the best Denis Villeneuve movie. This is\nDenis Villeneuve breakout movie and he is one of the best director of\nthe 2010s. He made one of the most complex and the most intense movies\nof the last 2010s. If I have to give three movies to explain it;\nSicario, Enemy, and this movie Prisoners. For this movie, this is not\nfor the weak stomach and I will say it once, this is so good. This is a\ncomplex and deep in the rabbit hole, you will not know who is the good\nor the evil. By recent years Roger Deakins the cinematographer is\ncollaborating with Dennis Villeneuve which that makes the more better\npart. This movie will have the cinematography that not a lot of modern\nday movies will have and that makes it more intense. Prisoners is a\nmodern day classic but not a lot of people will know this classic. So\nif you think that you are a movie buff and you are into a lot of\nmovies, go see this movie and I bet you, you will be excited to his\nnext work and you will have the best time in recent years for a movie.\n"
"\nReal rating: 7.8/10 Those who love dearly are destined to be victims of\nwrath, a true yet cynical thought. A decently paced thriller for its\nlength struggles with the weird morals of its characters, or lack\nthereof in 80% of the cast, as well as their inability to see that they\nare all prisoners to their own ideals, beliefs, desires and wants. They\nare inhumane creatures being portrayed as humane and no better example\nof this is the wife character thanking god for one of the most heinous\natrocities an average human could conduct. The acting, while a touch\nover the top in scenes, is stellar, the cinematography is excellent and\nthe directing superb, the writing is actually the let down, though it\nfeels like it shouldn't be and most will be able to gloss over this as\nwe the viewer tend to accept weaker writing so long as our emotional\nstrings are being played eloquently.\n"
"\nI saw the film on a long haul flight which is not the best environment\nto watch a film. Prisoners follows the investigation into the\ndisappearance of a pair of young girls Anna and Joy from outside their\nhomes. The main focus of the film is the father of Anna, Keller Dover\n(Hugh Jackman) who is not happy with the urgency of the police\ninvestigation being led by Detective Loki (Jake Gyllenhaal).<br><br>The premise of the film is quite interesting as the parents are\nobviously desperate to find the children as quickly as possible. They\nsee the police investigation to be very slow and find it extremely\nfrustrating. I couldn't help but think the film could have been better.\nThe film feels like it's been edited to suit the mass market whereas it\nshould have stuck to it's indie roots. That may be the problem with\ngetting big name stars as the money that is handed out to the cast\nneeds to be recouped via the box office.\n"
"\nI went to the cinema with absolutely no expectations about this movie\nand luckily, I found it to be quite entertaining. The basic plot (I'm\nnot spoiling don't worry) involves two couples whose children get\nkidnapped. The performances are quite good and even more, the\ncharacters are quite empathetic (especially Jackman since you can feel\nhis frustration and anger rising throughout the movie, Gyllenhaal does\na good job as well). I wouldn't say it should have been an Oscar\ncandidate but it's still an entertaining movie to rent or even to go to\nthe cinema like I did. In general lines, it's an entertaining\nwell-paced movie with a more than decent script.\n"
"\nWatching the trailer on \"Prisoners\", I was convinced it was gonna be\nbig fat cliché and dud, but while it does have some of the storyline\nand suspense we're used to and maybe even clichéd, I surprisingly\nenjoyed the movie thanks to some excellent performances especially by\nHugh Jackman and Melissa Leo, and some slick cinematography and\nediting. The director, Dennis Villeneuve has put together a serviceable\nstory with infused emotions and great settings. The closest movie I can\nthink of that has a kindred spirit to this is \"Winters Bone\". Both rely\nheavily on hostile and dark woodsy settings. The mystery comes together\nfair enough, but the actors take this movie up to a solid 7/10.\nRecommended.\n"
"\nI don't normally write reviews, but this time I have to do it. The\nmovie deserves a solid 9/10 , but because of the ending, I \"took\" off 2\nstars. I mean really? The ending is not COOL, is frustrating, is not\nsomething which let's you think about it, how it might ends and such.\nNo, it just \"tells\" you that there is a happy ending, but without\nshowing it, which from my point of view and with this kind of a story,\na somehow NORMAL ending would have been amazing.<br><br>An ending which should have let you think about it, was an ending\nwithout the last whistle or an ending where the cop was staring at the\ncar, like a thinker with that nice soundtrack on the background. That\nwould have been a far better ending and NOT this ending where somehow\nit tells you \"hey , oh, you are there, nice, let me just....\" and then\nthe director says \"CUT! Good job everyone\" .<br><br>Anyway, up until the ending, the movie is very strong with some minor\n\"lefts out\" here and there. Worth seeing it.\n"
"\nGreat actors in a great suspense story. Unfortunately, too many loop\nholes in the storyline. This could have been one of the best suspense\nfilms ever made if it wasn't too long, it carried on with insignificant\nplot lines. I expected the ending to be sad but left you wondering. I\nlike closure in movies, especially one as suspenseful as this one! So\nagain, the ending was a let down.<br><br>This movie reminded me of the demented and sick people who prey on\ninnocent children. I worried that some scenes would be gruesome, that\nwas never the case. <br><br>Hugh Jackman did the best job selling his determination to find his\ndaughter.<br><br>Hated the ending after a LONG movie!\n"
