this is seriously one of the worst movies ever made and i feel compelled to tell all who is just thinking on spending a dime on this useless movie if you can even call it that  dont do it
only good thing about the movie was michael cera who had approx
2 mins all in all
funny stuff by him but as a movie it sucked in every category imaginable script acting special effects
the list is long too long for me to even have the energy to continue this review
but i will say one last thing and that is how the hell is it possible to get the rating of 7
1
imdb should really soon create some sort of ghostreview detection because no way in hell would this movie get above 3 avg
if someone had not boosted it with multiple tens
cant believe it  create a shitty movie with well known actors and get away with it by tricking the audience on imdb
robbery in broad daylight if you ask me
besides the weak gay plot theres nothing at all to it
childish and lame
and to be able to rate it i must write 10 10
lines of text about it
this is only line 7 and as much as i would love to write something useful about it theres nothing i can add
a waste of time
this is of course just my opinion
oh no wait
theres no skipping with paragraphs
this is now line 7 so i actually have to keep going about a movie that added nothing to the 7th art
and i was wrong this is now line 8 so the previous was line 7
by now i think it may be clear how much i disliked the movie i actually like always watched it to the end and as rarely as it does the movie was bad to a level that im here hoping to save someone else from watching it
i think this is 10 now
how can this movie have a rating of 7
0
one of the worst movies i have ever wasted my money on
seth rogen is the same in every movie this is no different
jonah hill was awful in this movie what happened
franco nobody else is going to hire you if you keep churning out this kinda crap except rogen who hopefully nobody will ever sponsor for another movie
what do you do when you cant write a full length movie
you make one like this
film like you are filming your buddies at a party and then include clips from other movies youve made
the only reason i gave it two stars instead of one is there were a couple of spots in the movie that scared me enough to jump in my seat
other than that this movie was pure amateur hour crap
i want my money back
i honestly expected this movie to be funny not wowamazingjokesfunny but you know a bit silly a bit funny
it was quite sad how bad it was
i cant really believe the actors agreed into doing this movie
i watched because seth rogen has been in some quite good movies and i was hoping for some laughs
i guess putting a lot of famous hollywood actors is no certain ingredient for success
it was worse than the movie new years eve
the only part i liked was in the last 25 minutes when it really got silly with all the demons and stuff
it went to another level much more ridiculous but since it was too much it worked
i honestly dont know if youre supposed to be a bit stupid or high to actually enjoy the movie
sorry
if this is what passes for comedy these days count me out
there are a lot of words that describe this twisted filmmoronic juvenile misogynistic insipid and insulting are just a few
i knew i didnt like it about five minutes in and why i kept watching ill never know
i guess i was hoping it would get better but instead it just got worse and worse
the script must have been pretty easy to write as every other word started with f usually delivered as a scream
it got to the point where i was rooting for the invading monsters
oh and if this is the type of people ill have to deal with in heaven i think ill opt to spend eternity somewhere else
okay we all have seen a lot of comedy movies but they were not good as we expected
or we always had to wait for a scene to laugh and t only made us to smile a little bit
this is the end is a great movie
surprisingly good
they are a lot of scenes that you get surprised and that makes you laugh hard
the plot of the story is based on true character names and that makes you wonder are they really the same person in the real life
it was confusing because some part of the movie was exactly about the real characteristics of the actors and thats what i like about the movie
i think this comedy is far one of the best comedies ive ever seen
highly recommended
1010
this movie is by far the worst piece of trash ive seen in a good 5 years
its a shame because i was looking forward to seeing this after hearing they were going to bring all the cast in to do a comedy
comedy it was not
long story short dont waste your time
you can pretty much get every comedic highlight by watching the trailer
the rest of the film is slow not funny and just plain stupid
my wife and i watched it together
were both in our mid30s and enjoy slap stick comedy or even improv at times
but this one was a complete insult to human beings and christianity
is seths trademark to add the males member to every flick he makes
i think the guy has a serious problem
anyways dont waste precious hours of your life to see this piece of trash
and by the way im appalled emma watson signed on to this crap
i was looking forward to seeing this movie
i cannot express how disappointed i am
with such an all star cast you would think they would be able to come up with more than dick jokes every 30 seconds
i am amazed this movie grossed 100 million
i found the drug use found throughout the movie to be very inappropriate and very stereotyping of hollywood
it was aimed at being funny but in the end it was very lame
there are all kinds of opportunities for the cast to be very funny
but the script being so poorly written robs both the actors and the audience of any
i realize this was made quickly trying to capitalize on the success of the worlds end
but as they say
the copy is usually poor quality and never as good as the original
if given the choice skip this movie
it is a waste
im justing voting 2 because i liked the rihana part when she gets slammed in the butt
the rest was totally nonsensically stupid
smoking weed in heaven was definitely stupid
this director really likes to spend money for nothing because this movie the one of the worst american garbages ive ever seen
the apocalyptic theme was not creative
it could have been more satirical like clever monthy python style
the end of the film is surely the worst of all
i just cant believe i wasted my time watching this trash
if i knew this movie was that bad would would have watched porn instead and jerked off
just dont waste your precious time with it
i was surprised i didnt like this movie
really enjoyed pineapple express and many of the other movies these actors have been in
i thought it started out well but it was almost like they only had the first few scenes written and then they tried to fake the rest
i think i laughed about 4 or 5 times but that was it
my wife said it might just be the worst movie shes ever seen
way too much with the sexual jokes and references it even lost its shock value at some point because they went on and on about it so much
glad we only rented this and didnt see it in the theater ended up wasting more time than money
was really hoping for the end about 12 way through
this is one of the worst movies i have ever had to sit through
i thought the movie was going to hilarious since i love all the movies the actors were in previously but that was not the case
drug and sex jokes the whole movie which i do not mind either in a movie but i hate when the whole movie is based around those two things
the only reason i watched the whole thing is because everyone i talked to told me how great the end was
the ending is the only reason i gave the movie a 2 star rating instead of of a 1 star rating
having the backstreet boys sing one of their classics at the end was the best thing ever
the backstreet boys saved this movie from a 1 star rating in my opinion
there is no reason for this film to exist
its a foul odious cretinous waste of time
no talent was wasted in making it because there is no talent evinced in its performances
there is no reason for seth rogen to exist in the entertainment industry
hollywood already has a curly haired idiot in will ferrell
there is no need for an unshaven potaddled version
if the phrase fk man were struck from rogens vocabulary he would be rendered mute
james franco should be given a show selling knives and baseball cards and forgotten for eternity
i watched 20 minutes of this movie on cable turned it off and threw myself against my apartment walls for 90 minutes
it was a smarter use of my time than this movie
this is one of my favorite comedies
i enjoy it all the way through
the plot is that some friends get trapped in a house during the apocalypse but they are all celebrities
nearly everyone who shows up in this movie is willing to make fun of themselves some of them in really nasty ways
what really makes this movie for me is danny mcbride
hes kind of playing kenny powers here but thats fine with me
they give him an epic entrance and a great send off and thats what more movies need to do show respect to mcbride
treasure him showcase him for he is unto us the most hilarious performer working today
but im going to say it again i enjoy every moment of the movie right up to the satisfying final scene
worth owning
this movie kept me and my girlfriend laughing so much throughout that our throats were hurting in the end
it was inappropriate in many parts but somehow even the parts that were grotesque were still funny
i found the film very fresh very real even though it was over the top and the religious themes were very cool and accurate even though presented tongue in cheek
basically just a really funny movie at the same time over the top and realistic presenting truth in a way that is disguised and not obvious while awakening the kid inside
i wasnt high when i watched it but still laughed non stop
its 85 funny and then has some unexpected serious scenes
simply amazing fantastically written
need more comedies like this
the idea that they portrayed themselves gave this a unique type of comedy that i think hasnt been done before at least not to this level
the next best thing would be for this cast to take this idea but turn it into either some sort or trip movie or some other adventure and not the world ending which did give it a serious edge
if you see this and think it is as amazing as i dogo ahead and find yourself watching james francos roast it can almost make this movie even sweeter to see the real life crazy friendship they have and to almost see that perhaps the jamesseth obsession that they portrayed in the movie could almost be real
enjoy the watch
worth the time
cant see anyone kicking themselves for watching this flick
a bit of a modern day animal house with some very funny scenes
we see actors play themselves as real life people and evolve as examples of true selflessness
very good dialogue helps keep the movie move along nicely
definitely some good action and a surprise cameo or two
my only complaint may be the special effects
absolutely a good movie if your in the mood to laugh andor feel good
danny mcbride and craig robinson are hilarious
theyre the best part but pretty much the whole movie is funny
other reviewers on here bitching about cursing and sacrilege need to stick to disney movies wtf were you expecting
the only complaint i have about it is jay my god hes a little too good at being a whiny little bitch
i really cant stand him in this i have watched it several times and he annoys me more every time
his voice and that godawful accent of his are like nails on a chalkboard
but literally every single other actor in this is funny as hell
expected a story of sorts and some comedy with end of the world but all i got was my intelegence insulted poor acting silly story and even worse it wasnt even entertaining where are these people going iam of the understandding that cinema was aplace of entertainment over the last 2 years its decended into a pit of utter degradation and excessive swearingunnecessary completely if ifs not funny they start fffing and fart jokes is this the quality of american writers no have look at lots of tv its seems to be so called younger hollywood stars stars thats a laugh we as society supposedly look up to these stars if this is the case god help the world as seen by others the usa is like this
all this leads to more anti usa feelings around the world
when i was to watch this film involving jonah hill seth rogen craig robinson michael cera or some of the rest from the cast i was not with expectations for an oscarwinner
while preparing my popcorn i thought i would enjoy a comedy that at least will not make me grumpier of what i was
well they proved me wrong
not even that i could not eat my popcorn but i thought i would not finish the movie
the only reason that made me see the credits is that i wanted to see how far the stupidity of the whole crew  i am angry not solely with the cast but the writers one of them mentioned twice the producers etc
anyone who was responsible for launching that feature throughout the theatres
i do not how they even managed to win anything
respect to the game of acting but these young actors represented the opposite of that
flat scenario even flatter acting in this film
i went in watching this thinking i was getting light hearted humour only to be faced with multiple freak deaths that were upsetting
recycled dark humour that is just off key and uncomfortable
great to know kids these days will be watching these degenerate pot heads thinking its how to live
im tired of drugs being glorified in modern movies
to quote the paparazzi in the movie why cant seth rogen play another type of character
the deaths were gory and uncomfortable
and of course black woman gets killed off first and pretty sure i saw two black people die subsequently after that
speaks volumes of our society today that gore is found to be funny and that death is something to be made fun of
this is the end of high minded society as we know it
story was well
interesting
pretty much a ridiculous take on the apocalypse
human nature points in the story were a tad much to watch
expect seth rogan and james franco comedy and you wont be disappointed
if you expect steve martindan akroyd brilliance you will be disappointed
take it for what it is what with cheap jokes as fillers between really good ones and youll have a good time
its kind of a dude movie in case the trailer didnt look like one
and dude movies are almost their own genre please see the term chick flick
anyway a lot of the jokes were actually very original and thoughtful in spite of some of the delivery
it was a silly movie and i was fairly satisfied
this is hands down the worst movie i have ever seen
it started out mildly funny then degenerated into something completely stupid then completely disgusting and unfunny and i love crazy quirky movies in general and i found myself actually getting angry at these so called actors for not only making me waste my money thank gawd i bought this on ppv if i paid to see this in the theater i would have been livid but wasting my time as well watching this drivel
it just seemed like an extremely lame attempt by a bunch of stoners to film their stream on consciousness most crude thoughts while extremely high
maybe funny to them and perhaps a few other really stoned people but otherwise a complete waste of time
toss this one into the garbage
i really do not understand how this movie has gotten so many bad reviews on here
i mean it is not an oscar worthy film and i think some of these morons writing these reviews were actually expecting something like that
i honestly dont think i ever went more than two minutes without seriously laughing hard
as an intelligent adult i expected a movie where the actors were playing themselves for the actors to act like themselves
so if you think these dudes are funny in real life you wont be disappointed
danny mcbride was non stop cracking me up and the back and forth between him and franco was hilarious
i just wish that cera lasted a little longer and paul rudd too lol
this was the worst movie i have ever seen
these guys dropped in my eyes
all the movie was about was getting high
it appeared that all of them were doing a last ditch attempt in hollywood
i only watched half the movie
not even worth the 1
60 i spent at red box
if only i could get my money back
if i can give any advice do not rent the movie
i think i got stupider by watching this
it was worse than the spoof movies
i thought it was their way of making fun of the spoof movies
but it wasnt
its been years since hollywood has come out with a good movie
this movie was a complete waste of time
i dont think they really made any money from the movie
usually we ask how awful can it be
well it is the worst movie i have watched in terms of comedy so far
did not laugh till the end
and at the end you start laughing cause you have waited so long so a laugh
i think the ones who are laughing are people like seth rogen and jonah hill
i know weed is good and all that but i wouldnt make a movie out of a weed nightmare
stamp it with all the good names
and sell it to the public to make some money
shame on all the actors like james franco michael cera emma watson
all the sh
ty memories of this movie will haunt you in your future works
and it should cause you made us suffer
this movie was exactly what i expected and more
filling it with dirty jokes weed cameos the apocalypse religion demonic possession and much more
the idea and plot of actors playing themselves is unique and fresh
during a party at james francos house the world begins to crumble
seth rogen craig robinson danny mcbride jonah hill jay baruchel and james franco all try to survive the apocalypse and most importantly try to survive from each other
from making a homemade sequel to the pineapple express to getting high and listening to that ridiculous gangnam style song this movie has a little bit of everything
i highly recommend this is the end
the idea seemed like a good one
a group of current hollywood a listers playing fictionalized versions of themselves in a fictionalized idea of how the world will end
the basic idea is funny
what is presented to us on film is not
what we have here is a viletastelessvulgarsacrilegious piece of garbage of a movie
the language in this atrocity alone made me sick to my stomach
that seldom happens to me
you blew itguys
you took what was a hysterical idea that could have potentially been labeled a classic sometime in the futureand turned into something i wouldnt contaminate my garbage with
i went in wanting to like itand came out wishing i hadnt wasted the rental
ive enjoyed a slew of films seth rogan cowrote or acted in only to feel mislead betrayed and lied to by the critics who praised this tasteless and largely humorless except to teenagers and those with teenage tastesfilm so vociferously yes im addressing you michael phillips and you richard roeper  you lied
while i found about 10 gags to be genuinely hilarious most of it was repetitive vulgar solely for the shock value of being vulgar and largely incoherent
with the exception of emma watsons tongueincheek on the face not on the butt where most of the jokes landed performance the acting was subpar for a seth rogan flick
i can see how teens could like it but dont call this a good film in any way
adults of any age beware
awful
awful
awfulll
how the hell this movie got 62 meta score
now im seriously doubting on imdb credit score
not even a single good laugh in this whole movie
watch a documentary instead of this movie youll get something out of it im sure of that
no doubt seth roger produced this movie
no other person in his right mind will produce this movie
none of the characters in the film are likable in the least and they are supposed to be playing themselves
i do not know why people are treating seth rogen like he is incapable of mailing it in because this is the end is lazy and feels like it was mailed in to fulfill an obligation to the movie studio
i also feel cheated by the excellent reviews this movie received from the paid critics
how did anyone find this trash funny
just dont watch it
waste of time
this is one of the worst movies i have ever seen
the acting is good in some cases awful in others
the story
what story
someone wrote some things on a paper while high on drugs
complete non sense
the beginning does not promises much but you can stand it but as soon as the aliens or whatever was that happens its the worst piece of crap hollywood spit out on a long time
this movie lives from the names of the actors and nothing else
its not funny rather dumb and its dumb on a all new level of dumbness
the dialogues go for what seems like forever with no objective in sight
the movie is called this is the end and i really wanted the end to come fast but it last for what seem like a millennium so i just went way
what a waste of time
this movie is not funny at all the jokes are not even jokes but just pathetic swearing using gay references in the sentences
if you have seen the movie my name is bruce which was a crap then be ready to see worst
i wanted to stop the movie at the middle when watching it i was hopping some change or something coming out after but unfortunately nothing came out
i was just feeling my brain going out at every minutes
i think that people should stop to go to see movies like this so producers would produce proper movies like in the past e
g madame doubtfire
after finishing the movie i was wondering if the world started to be like in the movie idiocracy which was not good as well by the way
i fear for the future of the cinema when i see the kind of profitable trash which can be produced
this is a great movie
it is what you would expect from seth and his friends
its hilarious
the morons who gives this a bad review needs to read a self help book of how to stop being such uptight as
how can you review a movie from the perspective of a 9 grade english teacher with a paddle in his desk for a just in case scenario
just watch with a sense of humor
i know the bad reviewers most likely applaud at the end of every foreign art film in black and white with a anxious grin with worried thought of not making it to the 5 oclock wine tasting
the point is be your own judge
if you love any of seth james or jonas  s movies this would be worth making an effort to see
love the movie hate the haters
i cannot believe the high rating nor the critic reviews
this film was overly long and not funny
i like all the actors in this film and have enjoyed them in other films
i figured putting them all together in one film cowritten by seth rogen would be a winning combination
i was shocked that the film dragged and hardly had any funny moments
this was a major disappointment and i feel that i was mislead by the high rating and mostly positive critical response
you do wonder if they saw the same film you saw because id like them to explain to me what was so funny about this mess and why did it have to be so long
i think our expectations have become so low because there are so many bad unprofessional films being made
if this qualifies as exceptional comedic material then its time for me to stop watching comedies
so watch at your own risk and good luck
i was fortunate enough to watch a screening today in miami and let me just point out this movie is exactly what you would expect from seth rogen in terms of comedy
its non stop laughing from the opening scene to closing
everything about this movie is great the story the actors and the comedy
having such funny actors like james franco seth rogen jonah hill jay baruchel danny mcbride and craig robinson playing themselves all in one movie just makes it that more entertaining
if you liked the comedy in superbad and pineapple express you will love this is the end
i recommend this movie to everyone who has a sense of humor
like everyone that stood in line with me to watch it almost two months early you wont regret it
1010
i can not believe these actors acted in this movie well did they actually do any acting
no they did not it was one big ego trip
my opinion of all the prats in this has dropped i cant imagine why they did it unless it was for free drugs sadly
dont waste your time it isnt a real movie but if you do then try and get really drunk before it starts
all jay baruchel expected coming to la was a fun time with seth rogen with all the wild partying to have both by themselves and at james francos housewarming party
suddenly the rapture hits and the biblical apocalypse has begun
now jay and seth are desperately sheltering in james house for rescue along with a few other friends
together they must band together to attempt to survive the end of the world only for jay to find that they are all too dumb and superficial to do it until they discover the only way out
although this is the end is not a bad film dont expect more from it it packs some laughs and i liked that emma watson is playing emma watson and she is completely nuts also come famous actors and singers die here and there and channing tatum is also in this film and it showed me again why i think he is a terrible actor and even the ending was a bit over the top with a whole film being over the top on its own but if youre a fan of this kind of films you wont be disappointed
coming from school of pineapple express school of comedy this is another stoner comedy on a bigger canvas
directed by evan goldberg and seth rogen and starring seth rogen jay baruchel james franco jonah hill craig robinson and a host of other actors playing themselves this is a stoner comedy wrapped in the cloak of disaster and apocalypse
the above mentioned actors try to survive an apocalyptic event by holing out in francos new house
while trying to survive their interpersonal relationships come into focus and makes them introspect
theres little significance of actors playing themselves in the movie apart from adding to the quirkiness of it
the comedy gets stale after sometime
the plot and the pace of the movie are its saving graces and keep you hooked to the story somewhat
watch it if you are a fan of pineapple express kind of comedy
it is an anti thesis of the big budget big drama big action disaster movies hollywood has on offer
my opinion might be a little bit biased just because i like any movie with seth rogan in it
i liked the choice of actors in it
and i also liked how they made the actors in this movie play themselves its pretty original and not a bad choice
the plot had a few turns but it did get back on the subject there was also a good amount of a supporting cast as well
the movie kept me laughing and entertained throughout the whole movie the only issue i have is this film has a little religious propaganda i personally have no problem with that but i believe its just not necessary
but all in all i enjoyed the ending as well
so if youre a fan of the actors in this film then you should definitely watch this movie i guarantee you wont be disappointed and i really would consider watching it twice
this is a good basic story  some actors playing themselves facing the apocalypse occurring while at a housewarming party  but spoilt in my estimation by excessive crudity
there are many and lengthy references to sexual acts graphic phallic symbols and references to rape homosexual acts and other things that are totally inappropriate in a mainstream film
otherwise the story was actually quite good and i enjoyed the film
it is a pity that it was spoilt for me by these distractions
the acting was also variable and i suspect that several of the actors were a little embarrassed to be taking part in this film
i would have preferred to have had a better developed story better special effects and a more imaginative ending
i watched this on starz the other night
at first i thought this was going to be really good seeing all of the actors that are in the film
the problem is there really wast much to the story
basically it all comes down to being the apocalypse and how each character eventually reacts to it
there are funny moments here and there but just a lot of silly dialogue
danny mcbride hast been funny since tropic thunder and he really gets annoying in this movie
jonah hill hasnt done anything good since moneyball
in fact his humor seems to repeat itself
i do believe you are to think he gets raped by satan
in 21 jump street and the watch he refers to giving oral sex to men
its a bit nauseating and old hat
seth rogan was last funny in the 40 year old virgin
its almost like these guys are running out of good ideas
i like the use of the music by black sabbath in the movie since they are my favorite band
i don t know what else to say about hence the 5 stars
i may opt to give it another watch but this movie was just not put together well
seth rogan cowrites codirects amp stars in this 2013 comedy also starring jay baruchel jonah hill craig robinson danny mcbride and james franco
rogan and the cast play their wild actor selves who attend francos party
soon they try to survive the apocalypse facing demons fiery explosions and such
they try helping each other and make the most of the situation but it becomes difficult
michael cera rhianna paul rudd emma watson and others also appear as themselves
the cast is funny as usual and its nice to see them together again
i recommend this good comedy thats kind of a spoof of ghostbusters and the exorcist
before i saw this film i was pretty excited for the unique approach and possibilities that it brought upon itself
the idea of actors playing themselves in an apocalyptic setup already had me laughing
but what i got was so much more then what i thought i was going to
this is the end offers a mixture of comedy action disaster and horror film all wrapped into one unique and flavorful film
furthermore i hope they make more films like this where the actors play an exaggeration of themselves because it makes for some really great opportunities for some great comedy gold
or at least really bright silver
however there are some issues thought
no movie is without flaws but aside from that it is a good time to watch with friends or just by yourself
either way this film is worth buying at full price and a movie fit for a grand movie collection
check it out you wont be disappointed
here are my grades for the film comedy a uniqueness a acting a visualspecial effects b music b directing a overall a
i have no words to describe this film
i mean seriously
its awfully pathetic and idiotic and probably the most ridiculous effort yet that ive seen in that judd apatow kind of comedy
what can be said in a review about this film anyway
i couldve been talking detailed how idiotic is the scene where james franco and danny mcbride are mimicking that they were throwing sperm in each other and how stupid the idea of playing a whitney houston song while seth rogen was being saved was cheesy and ridiculous but i realized that it would be a pointless exercise simply because i would be pointing the obvious
the goal of that film is being as absurd and ridiculous as possible so anything said as critic would be pointless as well
its hilarious
so lets make it simple
no review at all
i just want to say that sometimes its forced and really looks lame but that is the intention
i think the world is starting to accept that kind of stupid comedy and that is what is worrying me
its hilarious anyway

i like how most of the reviews on here are negative
the movie was pretty funny
i laughed and smiled on many parts
i guess this movie is aimed towards younger people and you have got to have a huge sense of humor to see this movie
if you dont like pineapple express or seth rogen in general then dont see this movie
simple as that
anyway i thought this movie did pretty good for a funny apocalypse
maybe over the top on some parts but it was only making fun of certain movies which i thought was brilliant
so again if you dont like seth rogen in general then dont waste your money on this movie
it wont be worth it but if you have a huge sense of humor i think it would be worth seeing
the whole idea of this movie was great
i felt a little sacrilegious when i left the theater but it was all in fun
i got a lot of laughs out of the movie
people who go into this movie with outrageous expectations will leave disappointed but if you go into it wanting to have a laugh and an open mind you will enjoy it
sseth rogan jay jonah james and craig were hilarious
emma watson although her role was very small was pretty funny as well
heck rihanna looked good as usual but didnt play a major role in the movie
loved the way each character played themselves
i hadnt seen too many previews before viewing it so i was surprised to see it was a movie about them and each of their characters
comedies dont get any better than this
the main cast couldnt have been better suited for one another mcbride rogan franco hill robinson barushel you get these crazy bastards together and things are going to get ludicrous and hilariously funny
this movie did not disappoint not for a single moment
i found myself laughing so hard that i felt compelled to experiment to see how many viewings would still elicit laughs and it was at least seven and if i were to leave it on the shelf for a few months then slip it into the ole bluray player for another go it just might work its magic one more time
rogan and his writing partner are comedy geniuses
this farce is a must see
i loved superbad and for superbad lovers stay away from this
it has nothing to do about it
its a piece of crap
these guys smoked some joints and came up with this crappy screenplay
hate it
gave 2 for charity because actual vote would be 1
i cant figure out how this got 6
7
i can just think that because some people rate it high because of the actors and they actually didnt see the movie
i love these guys too especially jonah hill seth and michael cera but this movie
i cant find the exact words but it sucks big time
i hope we get to see more great movies from this crew in the future but rating this high isnt helping them distinguish crap from good work
i hope they come up with a superbad ii and clean their image maybe im able to forget this horrible movie one day
the movie doesnt follow any plot  the start seems very promising for a nice comedy of alien invasion  apocalypsis  zombieland or whatever is coming to the end but as the movie goes on the more boring it gets with a couple of funny moments at start and the beginning of the movie  it is worth it just watch 30min of the film but no more
the acting looks like for a very friendly environment with all the actors using their real names but it doesnt really suits it because is not either that friendly or funny so the movie it doesnt achieve that goal  it really looks like is the first film for the directors
it doesnt kill you to watch this movie but i guess for a vastly general audience will not get any recommendation for this film either

this deserves a 0
one of the worst movies i have ever seen
i signed up for imdb just to rate this movie and to say who ever liked this movie is a moron you know who you are
also i dont like imdb anymore
i have to have ten lines for a review i am not to happy about that i should be able to keep it just short and simple which is what movies movies need
good or bad or just horrible
this movie horrible simple as that
