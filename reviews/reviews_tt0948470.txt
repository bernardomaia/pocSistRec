"\n*Not meaning to offend anyone just sharing my honest opinion* Really?\nare you kidding? I wasted my money on this! OK so they talked about\nPeter Parkers parents disappearing about 20 minutes of the movie and\nfor that 20 minutes was a waste of time since it didn't even tell you\nwhat happened to them! <br><br>And WOW i cant believe how ridiculous the death of Peters uncle was!\nthe guy picked up the gun and the uncle just like runs into him or\nsomething honestly i really don't know what happened there.<br><br>The only halfway amusing part about it was the old man listening to his\nmusic and seeing them fight behind him! Oh and Peter never found the\nkiller of his uncle(unless i missed that part!) and thats lame he never\ndid since that was the main reason he even made his suit and\neverything! <br><br>****I REALLY HOPE HES NOT IN THE NEW AVENGERS*****\n"
"\ni love this film. it does the character of spider-man justice. Andrew\nGarfield was chosen perfectly as peter parker. After spider-man 3 we\nneeded a change and this is a great fresh take on the character. It is\nmore comic accurate than the Raimi films such as the web shooters and\nGwen Stacy as the love interest instead of Mary Jane. I liked the new\nsuit because it looked like a teen could make it. The villain the\nlizard was a great first foe for spider man. Uncle Bens death scene\nmade me want to cry and Garfields reaction was sad. I love how Gwen\ncomforted him and Flash didn't bully him out of sorrow. i love how\npeter went from being a vigilante hunting his uncles killer to a hero\nfighting all crime.\n"
"\nFirst off, Andrew Garfield, Emma Stone, Martin Sheen, Sally Field, and\nDennis are all Perfect in their roles. This movie is very different\nfrom the original, except for the origins which can obviously not be\nchanged. The action is what spidey fans have always dreamed off. The\nchemistry between peter and Gwen is priceless. New and interesting\nstory lines are created to be explored through out the trilogy/saga.\nThe new suit is great in my opinion, but it has been changed for the\nsequel, yet either way I like them both. Andrew Garfield's emotional\nscenes are unbelievable. Finally, I absolutely loved the humor. And the\nending left me satisfied and happy, yet excited for what is yet to\ncome. Overall, this is an origin that succeeds on many levels and out\ndoes the previous origin (which is still great) and only Spider-man 2\nis equal in its acting, style, humor, action, and theme.\n"
"\nHaving realized I'm a sucker for all these comic book adaptations, of\ncourse I had to see this one as well. I never did like the earlier\nSpiderman movies, being the main role or the supporting ones, I'm not\nsure; but they still stand among the movies I'm not eager to watch\nagain. But this one, on the contrary, was actually quite entertaining.\nNot was it only packed with really great CGI, but it had a great flow\nbuilt up on both action, drama, romance and humor.<br><br>At least for me this is what makes a good movie. I never once thought\n\"Oh, my goodness that was lame\" (which I often actually do), instead I\nwas rather surprised I was laughing out loud in more than one of the\nscenes.<br><br>All the actors did a MARVELous job, meaning all the jokes, the depth of\nthe drama, and the sincerity of both the romance and the action stood\nsolid throughout the movie. Speaking of the actors: the casting was\nbrilliant. All of the main actors (and I guess most of the supporting\nones) was perfect for their roles, and must have made the script it\nself proud.\n"
"\nAlrighty this movie was awesome! Yeah it could of used a little here\nand there, but the fact of the matter is that it is SPIDER-MAN. I am a\ncomic fan, and after watching this I could agree that they captured the\ntrue spider-man, not some Toby creation<br><br>The moment i realized that he was building his own web slinger i knew\nthat this was going to be good! I loved how Spider-man made funny\njokes, he didn't shoot his fingers as guns and people walking by, he\nactually was funny, nerdy, and AWESOME!!! Gwen Stacey is great! Dr.\nConnors is amazing, when he transforms its gnarly, it gives you the\nfeel of how he is being taken over.<br><br>There are some plot errors, like how does he get the web slinger stuff,\nand what happens to the semi transformed cops, while they are\ntransformed. but other than that it flows pretty nicely.\n"
"\nI will keep this short but after seeing all the other reviews I am very\nsurprised at the negativity and tbh I think it is the usual resistance\nto change in a lot of cases.<br><br>As a spider-man film, and as a Marvel/DC fan of over 30 years, I loved\nit. My 9 year old also came out thinking this is the best spider-man\nfilm yet, trumping the Sam Raimi ones, which while excellent didn't\nhave the same amount of 'soul' for me. <br><br>My best friend and his wife didn't want to watch this due to the\nnegativity surrounding it, which is a real shame as I think they have\nmissed out on a real gem. <br><br>A 9 from me, the average of mine and my son's rating. :)<br><br>P.S. I watched this in 2D as I find the vast majority of 3D films get\nin the way of the movie experience, Hugo being the notable exception.\n"
"\nThe Amazing Spider-Man came out in 2012, but I only saw it about a year\nafter it's release, but before Amazing Spider-Man 2 came out in\ntheaters. I enjoyed Andrew Garfield allot more than Tobey Maguire's\nperformance as both Peter Parker and Spider-Man. Andrew had the wise\ncrack of Spider-Man because if you read the comics or watch any of the\ncartoons, you'll see Spider-Man as a wise cracker and as Peter Parker,\nhe has nerdy, but he is more than just a nerd. He was also a teenager\nwho had friends. Emma Stone was a much better romantic lead than\nKristen Dunst. And I thought the action was much better than the first\nSpider-Man. Overall, I give The Amazing Spider-Man a 9 out of 10, a\nfantastic movie.\n"
"\nHere are my quick thoughts, <br><br>I had my reservations and kept my expectations in check going into this\nfilm and didn't know what to expect but thankfully Marc Webb managed to\ndo a fantastic job despite the fact that he did hit a lot of the same\nelements from Sam Raimi's 2002 Spider-man, nonetheless this is a\npromising start to a new trilogy.<br><br>Andrew Garfield hits it out of the park with his performance as Peter\nParker and Emma Stone is Wonderful as Gwen Stacey their chemistry is\nobvious from the start. The inclusion of Dr. Curt Connors/The Lizard\nwas long overdue and was played adequately by Rhys Ifans, Martin Sheen\nand Sally Field were great as Uncle Ben and Aunt May as was Dennis\nLeary's Captain Stacy.<br><br>In short, a solid cast, great story and wonderful effects inject new\nblood into an already great blockbuster franchise.\n"
"\nI know people spidey fans will disagree with what I am about to say but\ni think that the original spider man trilogy is like avatar in the\nsense that they are good movies but are completely over rated. they\ndon't have anything on other superhero films such as say The Dark\nKnight trilogy, The reason why I preferred the new one was because it\nwas less corny and more satisfying than the originals. The only part I\nwas disappointed with was the fact that peter parkers school bully\nbecame his friend at the end, because I was glad to see how they made\npeters bully was sorry for beating him up when it came to a life and\ndeath matter but when he became his friend it was taken to far and felt\nto corny. other than that it was defiantly worth seeing.\n"
"\nThis movie was utterly fantastic ! I seriously loved it, ignore all the\nhaters, these people just can't get over the fact that This film was\nsuperior to Spider-Man 2002. It is a 'realistic', contemporary and a\ngrounded approach onto the Character by the Director Marc Webb, yet\nstaying faithful to its source materials( combo of The Amazing and The\nUltimate Story lines). Of course, there are a couple of plot holes, but\nI am sure they'll be explained in the upcoming Sequel. I Must say that\nAndrew Garfield brought justice to the role of Spider-Man. An\nabsolutely amazing and a highly gripping movie. I highly refer it to\nany True Spider-Man Fan, as the people who have never read the comics\nmight call it a 'rehash' of the First Spiderman movie, but actually,\nthis movie stayed fairly true to the comics from the beginning to the\nend. <br><br>9/10 stars from Me ! Looking forward to the The Amazing Spiderman 2.\n"
"\nThe Amazing Spider Man is a reboot of the popular trilogy called\nSpiderman.<br><br>Peter Parker is a teenager who suffers from getting bullied.One day he\nfinds his dads briefcase and decides to explore his old work.Peter\ndiscovers a chamber that are full of mixed species of spiders.All seems\nwell until he gets bitten by one and gets super powers.After his uncle\ndies from a gunshot Peter uses his powers to become spider man.<br><br>Peters love interest this time around is Gwen Stacy.This movie follows\nthe comics far more better than the previous titles which is a good\nthing.Its not as dull as the others and it has the most enjoyable Stan\nLee cameos so far that I'm not going to spoil.<br><br>Overall the Amazing Spiderman lives up to its title.Amazing.I'm giving\nthis a nine out of ten.\n"
"\nI enjoyed this movie because it was a superhero film with many funny\nbits. I like to be able to laugh while watching a movie, not just watch\nloads of CGI action. I also liked the fact that the villain wasn't\nkilled just defeated and put in prison, giving him a second chance.\nHowever, I do believe that was partially do to the fact that the\nproducers/writers wanted something to write a future film on. I think\nthat Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone did exceptionally in their roles.\nGarfield really seemed to actually be Peter Parker and I love to see\nthat in a film. Although this movie is a superhero movie I do believe\nit was geared toward a younger audience, unlike the Dark Knight. The\nfact that Spider-man is a teenager in this one and that it is not\nnearly as dark as some other films certainly convinced me of this. I\nrecommend this to anyone who enjoys action and superheroes. Side note:\nDenis Leary was great!\n"
"\nMan that's an excellent movie. The acting is so much better than the\noriginal Spiderman movies with Tobey Maguire. The new Peter Parker is\n10 x's a better actor than Tobey Maguire. I enjoyed the Avengers movie\nbut the Amazing Spiderman's plot works much better to me and the\nstory-line just seems to pulls you along effortlessly and keeps you\nintrigued and interested at the same time. It's the great blend of\nstory/plot, good acting, and action-adventure and fight scenes with the\nbad guy. As far as comic book movies go, this is one of the better\nones. I think it's most definitely better than the last two Spiderman\nmovies and probably better than the first one but not by too much.<br><br>It is worth the price of admission to watch this movie and it would be\na great movie to take your kids since their isn't anything crazy\nhappening in this movie.\n"
"\nnot the best film but a great film for a action movie. it follows the\ncomics a little. when I saw the film I saw it in 3D man it was good but\nthis maybe is the best spider man film. a action film for people who\nlikes action . but for some will say it is the worst spider man film .\nlike the school scene that scene was a good scene really action the\nbuilding the sewer this could also be a family film .<br><br>this did not waste my time my buddies also liked it so did a lot of\npeople .recommended film for people. good acting good movie . since\nmarvel is better than DC in my opinion so I liked it a lot. but at this\nfilm it looks like peter parker or spider man seemed weaker than the\npast film. really action good for kids adults etc.<br><br>If you are a fan of spider man you will like this.<br><br>the villain the lizard was was really powerful maybe stronger than some\nvillains in marvel. the spider man villains usually is stronger than a\nlot of other villains<br><br>Good film overall 8/10\n"
"\nMany years ago, Stan Lee crafted a story with, perhaps the worlds most\nbeloved superhero. Spiderman is the story of Peter Parkers life. It's\nthe quintessential story capturing all essences of humanity, loss and\nlife. A must for anyone human being to empathise with. The story of a\nteenager, not extremely social (who really), smart, bullied, has to\nsuffer loss of family (his uncle) and is to be how you want to.<br><br>This interpretation of that beloved story is brilliant! The direction\nis brilliant, soundtrack is great in my opinion and Andrew Garfield\nmakes a fantastic Peter Parker, and his performance is well\ncomplimented with all the other likable cast.<br><br>Even with it's drawbacks, the movie is great fun! :)\n"
"\nThis movie in my personal opinion was the best Spiderman film of the 4!\nThis movie came the closest to the comic that any of the other three!!!\nThis movie developed the relationship between Gwen and Peter and sadly\nleft Mary Jane out of it!This movie was funnier better written and\nbetter actors than the first 3! Why they choose The Lizard for the\nvillain is beyond me! That was the worst park of the movie!<br><br>The nest logical choice for the villain is: The Jackel, obsessed with\nGwen, for the 2nd film. The Green Goblin, throws Gwen off a bridge, for\nthe 3rd film. That way the can develop the romance between Mary Jane\nand Peter Parker in the 4th film, if this film franchise reaches that\nfar.\n"
"\nThis was the first \"super hero\" movie I have ever seen in theaters, and\nlet me tell you - Spider Man is my new favorite super hero! The plot\nwas amazing (no worries, no spoilers! If you want to know the story,\nwatch it!) The acting was phenomenal - my friends and I significantly\nunderestimated Andrew Garfield's performance before seeing the movie. I\nwant to see it again and again and again - he is amazing as Peter\nParker!!! Emma Stone is amazing as Gwen, and the other actors and\nactresses will blow you away!! (Martin Sheen was the one that surprised\nme the most!!!). Love this movie...if I could, I'd give it an 11...a\nmust see!\n"
"\n***Note: May Contain Spoilers*** Plot: High schooler, Peter Parker, is\na photographer, a social outcast, and is fascinated in science.

"\nThe surprise hit of the summer! Everyone was looking forward to the new\nBatman movie this 2012 summer! Batman turnout being a bust and\nSpider-Man is the surprise hit Batman was not! I am tired of comic book\nmovies. The comic book movie has become the seen it done it before with\nthe same old C G I effects. However, I went to see the Amazing\nSpider-Man because people keep saying Mike you got to see this film.\nAfter avoiding Spider-man over the summer I finally saw it. What a\ngreat film. Spider-Man is a great film because the movie is excellently\ndirect were the old story is excellent told with new twists. The actors\nblend the character development into the story perfectly. Martin Sheen\nplayed a perfect Uncle Ben. The 3 D effect added to the C G I and give\na new excitement to the usual special effects. The same old story told\nin a better way. I give The Amazing Spider-Man a nine out of ten.\n"
"\nI'll keep it simple. I loved this movie. Spiderman has been my favorite\nsuper hero since around 1983 when I got my first Spiderman action\nfigure. This is the Spiderman movie I have been waiting for. Fine, it's\na reboot, and everybody wants to compare it to the first series, but I\ndon't care. I felt that the movie had just enough humor, cheese, drama\nand teenage angst and awkwardness. I liked that Peter Parker and Gwen\nStacy actually had some chemistry. P.P. felt more believable as a\nteenager than in the first serious...and I dig that he made his own\nwebbing rather than it just spitting out of his wrist. <br><br>The spidey suit was way cooler in this flick than the first series. It\ndidn't look CGI throughout the whole movie like the originals. It's\nactually a dude in a suit. When he takes out his cell phone to talk to\nwhoever, that's pretty hilarious. <br><br>It's got action, fun, adventure, a coming of age aspect, drama and\ncheese. It makes for a good film.\n"
"\nI'm not a huge fan of the Spiderman films and I had heard little or\nnothing in regards to this one from friends and colleagues alike.<br><br>However the movie was I think better made than the previous versions of\nthe character. Purists will find holes in some of the explanations of\nthe character and his abilities if they compare it to the other movies,\nbut better to take this movie on it's own merits rather than\ncomparisons.<br><br>I found the acting was very good from all the players and the filming\nhad a very classy feel to it, the effects were enjoyable and not over\nthe top. Above all there was a good sprinkling of humour from the\ncharacter punctuated with good timing throughout the movie.<br><br>Andrew Garfield played the part very well and surprised me with his\nclear acting abilities,Denis Leary is as good as always.<br><br>It felt like money well spent picking this one up!\n"
"\nBy far the best Spider Man movie ever made. This was what every other\nSpider Man was missing, great actors, gripping story and tons of\naction. The new Spider Man captures the true essence of the comic book,\nand delivers a story that could be taken from a comic book itself.<br><br>Going forward i can't see another actor being used in the role of\nSpider Man, Andrew Garfield is the embodiment of Spider Man, and he\ndeliver a super hero performance.<br><br>If you are a fan of the comic book, or of action super hero movies,\nthis one is a must see.<br><br>Great Movie.\n"
"\nWOW. The Amazing Spider-Man is just that. AMAZING. All around great\nmovie I liked it way better than the other Spiderman movies and glad\nthey did a re-boot. It was great how they led up to him getting his\npowers and explained it all. <br><br>The guy who played Spiderman (Andrew Garfield) was great and perfect\nfor the part. A really likable hero. Emma Stone was also good and they\nhave good on screen chemistry.<br><br>I usually don't like 3-D too much but this was way cool, especially the\nscenes where he flies through the air using his webbing. Also the 3-D\ndidn't hurt my eyes or make me dizzy like some movies do. 10/10 Stars.\nGO SEE IT.. NOW!!\n"
"\nPersonally, I prefer Tobey   Maguire but strangely I like this\nSpider-Man more than the previous one.  At the first time that I saw\nthe teaser of \"The Amazing Spider-Man, \" I'd never ever wanted to watch\nit. However, thing change when I glanced at the trailer and I'm really\ngreat that I made a right choice. <br><br>You can know what'll happen in this movie but the truth is you don't\nreally know it. Everything was so new ,,, so interesting, and in my\nopinion, it was also more drama (the story really moved me). The action\nscenes were fabulous.  <br><br>I also liked the Peter's personality because he made me laugh but at\nthe same time made me felt sad for him. The Lizard was great; however,\nyou also could see these type of villain in many movie.<br><br>Maybe next week I'll watch it again if I have time. Such a great movie\nyou guy shouldn't miss it. \n"
"\nI went to the midnight premiere for the Amazing\nSpider-Man........WOW!!!! I did not like the trilogy because of the\nlack comedy and tie ins from the comics. I also had great doubts about\nthis movie. But all was good, no...AMAZING! Andrew Garfield was an\nabsolutely drop dead outstanding choice for Peter Parker. I didn't see\nsomeone try to play Peter Parker, I saw Peter Parker. Emma Stone was\nalso a wonderful, important part of the movie. Rhys Ifans as Dr.\nConnors was absolutely brilliant and his transformations as the lizards\ncould not be any more creepy! Marc Webb owned Spider-Man with the fight\nsequences and web slinging. The best Stan Lee cameo of all time. Webbs\nversion was overall way better than Raimi's depiction! The movie stuck\nwith every comic book aspect including the web cartridges and Peter's\nfirst love Gwen Stacy. A must see movie and it does stick in your mind\nfor a bit.\n"
"\nLike The Raimi Versions This One Was Just As Good But I Do Have Points\nThat Are Negative ... 1) Uncle Ben Never Gets Around To Telling Peter\nThat \"With Great Power Comes Great Responsibility\" This Is The Single\nEpiphany Of Any Hero/Good Guy And The Founding Stone Of Who Peter\nParker Goes On To Be ... 2) Since In This Movie A Lot Of Work Went Into\nThe Stacy Story Line I Would Have Like To Have Seen It Play Out The Way\nIt Did On The Comics When I Read About The Death Of Captain Stacy ... I\nWill Never Forget His Words \"Please God Let Me Not Be Late\" (Those Who\nRead Amazing Spider-man #90 Know) ... Otherwise The Special Effects\nWere Done Well ... Acting Was On Par With The Other 3 Movies And Marc\nWebb Did An Excellent Job Directing\n"
"\nPeter Parker (played by Andrew Grafield) was just a teenage student at\nMid-Town science university and who was one day went to the Oscorp\ntower to look for his father workmate, but instead he found something\nelse that would change his life forever and have to face many changes\nin his life and also found love with Gwen Stacy (played by Emma Stone).\nDuring his change, he encountered so many problem that every others\nnormal teenagers at his age have never encountered before but he knew\nhe alone will have to face and solve those problem at all cost and that\nis include the way to defeat his powerful enemy that he have never\nthought before to save and bring back peace to New York City.\n"
"\nWhy? Why this film is created? I wish Spider-Man 4 wasn't canceled. The\nscript was so mess up that Andrew Garfield was mumbling. The Lizard\nlook like a big snake with legs and it kinda look like a dinosaur.\nUncle Ben in this film did not say the most use words by the other\nUncle Ben \"With great power, comes with great responsibility\". Why he\ndidn't say that. The video game is better then the film.\n"
"\nI am a big Spider-Man fan. I've liked the character and the multiple\ndifferent forms of media he's been in for years (except Spider-Man 2\nand 3). But, this movie is utter garbage. The acting was OK I guess but\nthe whole movie was such a bloody drag that it had me feeling slightly\nsick inside. It's worse than Spider-Man 2 and 3 and I absolutely HATE\nthose movies. This one is somehow worse. Mainly due to the fact that it\ntakes a more darker tone which is something that doesn't work well with\nSpider- Man's character. Spider-Man's character is witty and cheesy and\nthis Spider-Man still has that wit but there's not enough of it. The\nentire movie is just this really gritty and dark setting which works in\nsome places but it isn't the Spider-Man we know and love so much. You\nknow what I really want? A Spider-Man movie that is actually good.\nBecause we haven't had one in 15 years. I do not recommend this. Watch\na good Marvel movie or the first Spider-Man.\n"
"\nEverybody waits for Marc Webb's films. And spiderman series are the\nbest among them. But while watching this movie,a lot of times I said to\nmyself what is going on, why this idiot is doing such a thing. I think\nAndrew Garfield needs more time to develop his acting. Most of the time\nhe over reacts. He does such things that seem stupid to me. No offense\nbut choosing him as a hero of spiderman made angry many viewers.\n"
"\nIt's hard to judge the Amazing Spider Man without bias having seen Sam\nRaimi's version<br><br>You can argue that the movie succeeds by the standards of the\nincreasingly tiresome superhero genre. It's linear rather than muddled,\nwith a distinctive start, middle and end, and plenty of action, but\nit's just too damn predictable. <br><br>Andrew Garfield as Pater Parker doesn't compel me as much as Tobey\nMacguire did. HE does not have the hapless, sympathetic nerd factor of\nMcGuire, nor does he have the fire in his eyes of a motivated warrior\nof justice. <br><br>Rhys Ivans is well cast for a villain. He is an actor who, when at his\nbest, is exceptional. Unfortunately he falls into the generic narrative\nof the brilliant scientist who becomes a CGI monster.<br><br>Aside from Gwen Stacy, The Amazing Spiderman brings nothing new to the\nmaterial. It's nothing but the kind of cash grab that makes millions of\ndollars, which will then be spent on yet another sequel, and then\nanother and another.\n"
"\nI was very happy with this movie, i was anticipating it ever since they\nannounced it, the trailers, posters etc. <br><br>So i went in with very high expectations and I loved everything about\nthis movie it was everything that i wanted from a spider-man movie and\nit was fantastic it gave me a lot of heart and i felt connected with\nthe movie\n"
"\nthere are different interpretations of spider-man. original being steve\nditko's version and then you have others like the ultimate version.\nspider-man was always witty but marvel toned it up in the ultimate\ncomics almost similar to deadpool without the crazy violence the red\nand black suited anti hero would bring to the table, which is a good\nthing. parker is a clued up smart guy and when he puts on the mask he\ntones it up ten fold. without the mask he tries his best to stay\nhumble. interesting concept which this movie tries to capture. maybe\nthey should of called this ultimate spider-man and called the toby\nmaguire movies amazing cause it don't make sense if u know what I'm\nsaying. this is a decent movie with some good scenes. all the cast are\ngood ( leary, ifans, stone and garfield etc..) fight scenes always good\nin a spider-man movie but there just seems to be something missing.\ncant watch this over and over again unless spider-man fighting lizard.\nmaybe it was released too soon to the rami ones\n"
"\nI watched this on Starz in two shots because I found the first 45\nminutes or so to be not very good. It was acceptable, but I just wasn't\nanxious to endure another slog through the origin of Spider- Man. After\nthe film gets through that bit, though, it gets much better. Andrew\nGarfield as Peter Parker absolutely nails this character, bringing to\nthe role a kind of vulnerability Tobey Maguire never quite pulled off.\nEmma Stone as Gwen Stacy is awfully cute and does well here, but she\nappears to be at least five years too old to be in high school, and I'm\nafraid I found that distracting.<br><br>The POV shots of Spider-Man web-slinging his way through Manhattan are\nastonishing. Visually, this film is a triumph. I'm glad I finally\ncaught up to it and will look forward to the next one.\n"
"\nMy Favourite Super Hero of them all time like many of you Is The\nAmazing Spiderman.<br><br>After the rein Toby Maguire, some of us spidy fans were left with a cup\nhalf full. <br><br>But then came The amazing Spiderman, some thought including myself that\nit was too soon to re launch the franchise. But boy am i glad they did,\nthe new peter parker although less bumbling had more charisma and\nlike-ability, it had a lot more charm about it. the cast as a whole was\nstrong with clear character choices at points. there was the odd flaw\nbut its fantasy so we can get over it.<br><br>writing this review just to acknowledge my enjoyment of the film.<br><br>Thanks Guys\n"
"\nThis is a colourful film that appeals to all ages, its light, its funny\nand its got lots of action.The director Marc Webb hasn't necessarily\ntried to make a summer blockbuster, this is a strong slice of spider\nman and is unique from other superhero films. Some of the action\nsequences were a bit goofy, and the story line changed little from\nraimi's first spider man, but this is a lot more enjoyable.Some things\nhave changed from the original spider man to the modern day\none,obviously time has moved on so the styles have changed, he has a\nskateboard, earphones and hoods that make him more like the modern day\nspider man. Except from the main character,there is little character\ndevelopment ,this film is also less realistic in what would happen in\nthe story,but in the end it is a superhero movie!This film isn't too\ndark or heavy so don't expect a amazing flawless piece of work,but I'm\nexcited for the sequel and hope to see more of this universe.\n"
"\nLet me begin by saying I tolerated the Batman movies and only watched\ntwo of the original Spider-Man movies and I liked neither. They were\ntoo much like Batman for me. <br><br>I did like Iron Man, The Incredible Hulk (part of that may have been\ndue to Norton's acting), Captain America, and The Avengers.<br><br>If your likes match up with mine fairly well you will like this movie.\nIt's not perfect. In my opinion Spider-Man movies often have\nridiculously hard to swallow villains and this one is no exception.<br><br>Having said that I thought it was an interesting portrayal of Perter\nParker.If you pay attention you'll get why he acts the way he does and\nthat it's caused by the small things happening at the moment but by the\nlarger underlying problem which is pretty clearly spelled out.<br><br>Movies like anything else are a matter of taste. I liked it and it will\nbe the 1st Spidey movie I see twice.\n"
"\nWhat a disappointment! So stupid film. I don't know if this is the\nworst film of Marvel, but in the last films I'm sure that it is.<br><br>A storyline so basic, with incredible performance, with all this EMO\nstuff Who I am? Nobody understand me?....holly crap!<br><br>So obvius, so boring.... To me, that film is worst than Spiderman 3 and\nthat's very sad.<br><br>Even Martin Sheen, great actor, makes one of his worst works. Uncle\nMay? Once and twice and three times makes the same scene.<br><br>The bad guy in the school....oh my god, he has feelings, and at the end\nis peter's friend... <br><br>I love haven't pay to see this film.\n"
"\nI hate to admit this but I watched this movie and caught myself quietly\ncheering, 'Toby!  Toby!  Toby!' Alas Andrew Garfield did a fine and I\nwas cheering for his version of Spiderman as well. Did he do as well as\nToby  I won't tell  and that is not fare. My feelings on Martin Sheen\nand Sally Field are all over the board  both are great actors in their\nown rights  but tend to wear their political affiliations on their\nsleeves like arm-bands. That being said, I am surprised that there\nwasn't any in-your-face-and-not-so-hidden-hidden message in the movie.\nWell I guess there actually were some. Let's see there was an\nanti-science - anti-business themebut that is the definition of a\n'safe' bad guy. The evil big bad scientist or businessman  phew  as\nlong as real criminals are not offended  we are just plain swell.\nOops, sorry, back to the movie. The special effects were very well\ndone, but did not override the storylinetoo much. The actors all did a\ngood job and the story did keep my interest. I would recommend this\nmovie  highly.\n"
"\nFor me, the biggest failures of this movie were: 1. Shallowness We\nnever really get inside the character's heads and most of the dramatic\nscenes (with Uncle Ben giving advice, dying etc.) are shallow and\nuninvolved - merely doing lip-service to the events (\"oh, yeah, and\nthis happened as well and we should make a scene out of it\").<br><br>2. Villain The villain was a shallow shell and ultimately very\nuninteresting.<br><br>3. Aunt May She seemed to have something to do up until Uncle Ben died,\nbut then she really did not do anything else but stand around. We\ndidn't even see her grieve properly. So, shallow again.<br><br>4. Bad love story The movie was long, but still failed to tell us how\nPeter fell in love with Gwen. Certainly he stuttered around her a lot,\nbut they never seemed to actually talk about anything or make a real\nconnection.\n"
"\nAgain, in my opinion this is another movie that should not have been\nmade. I love super hero movies, especially Spiderman. I really enjoyed\nthe older movies with Toby. Now a new hero and it all just seemed to go\ntoes up for me. I did not enjoy this movie. I really hate remakes and\nextensions of movies unless they stay close to the original and carry\noff the heart of the original movie, like Pirates of the Caribbean,\nlike Spiderman 2 and 3 with Toby. They did not feel like a new movie,\nthey were an extension of the one we loved. Some movies are just done\nto death and the changes in actors just seems to sour things for you. I\nthink this is what happened with this movie for me. It becomes a\ncompletely different beast then the original. I am no way saying this\nmovie was bad. It was a good movie, it just ruined the whole Spiderman\nhero for me.\n"
"\nAh, reboots. I kinda saw this coming, but I didn't expect it to\nbasically ignore the previous franchise. You don't need to tell the\nentire origin story again; just give us the basics. Garfield is\n/definitely/ not able to pull off being a high-schooler, but this\ndoesn't take away from the movie. Emma Stone may not be at her most\nattractiveness, but she and Garfield have wonderful chemistry. Much\nbetter than Tobey Maguire and Kirsten Dunst failed to have.<br><br>The Lizard is also an improvement on the previous villains. I could\nactually understand and somewhat sympathize with him, though I felt\nthat the ending was just the CGI team showing off their talents. It has\na few slow parts, but noting a bathroom break can't fix.\n"
"\nI was in my first year of school when the first Spider-Man film from\n2002 was released. Since then, it has remained to be one of my favorite\nsuperhero films. The second one only got better, but the third just\nstank from start to finish. Coming off of that, a re-boot seemed to be\nthe only way to go, but of course they made it too early. It's only\nbeen ten years since the first from 2002. That's my main complaint: the\nfilm decides to retell the origin story when I'm sure most of the\naudience remembers the first film. Aside from that, the acting is\nsurprisingly good, the villain is pretty good, and the action doesn't\ndisappoint. Just a couple dumb moments, otherwise a welcome re-boot\nthat makes me want to see more, but please make it better.\n"
"\nSo I just got back from the movie, having expectations moderately high.\nI watched the commercial, saying it is, \"The Top Movie in the World\".\nThat gave me some mixed messages I couldn't really comprehend. <br><br>I really liked Andrew Garfield when he played the role of Eduardo\nSaverin in The Social Network, so I was pleased to hear that he'd take\non his first lead role. But with this, I was a bit disappointed. <br><br>PROS -It was more like the original comics -The fighting effects were\nwell done<br><br>CONS -Garfield was too caught up in Peter Parker's attitude -The story\njumped sometimes <br><br>There really isn't much to say about the film. I'm not saying it is\nterrible! I enjoyed most of it. But I don't see the real point of this\nrecreation from the Tobey MacGuire series. But yes, it is an\nimprovement in directing, but not the acting.\n"
"\nThe actors did an amazing job, but have failed to portray their own\ncharacters (especially Andrew Garfield). He just doesn't seem to fit in\nthe character of Peter Parker. Another big reason, this movie is an\nabsolute waste of time is that it fails to refresh the series. Why?\nWell, guess what? It had no story! The plot makes it till the half in a\nvery clumsy manner and then it just ends. Andrew is an amazing actor\nbut he is just not fit for the role of Peter Parker. If you are\nexpecting anything better than the previous franchise 'Spider Man',\nthen forget about it. This one isn't even close to the awesomeness and\ncinematic delicacies of the previous franchise.\n"
"\nSam Raimi's Spider Man trilogy began in 2002 and a decade later we have\nthe reboot with Andrew Garfield's more geeky hipster take replacing\nTobey Maguire.<br><br>However the film feels pointless, we have another origins story with\nPeter Parker getting bit by a radioactive spider and learns to harness\nhis new powers and then the tragedy of Uncle Ben dying and realising\nthat with his powers comes responsibility.<br><br>The villain here is a Green Lizard instead of the Green goblin, a man\nwanting to regrow his arm but the experiment goes horribly wrong. The\npolice pursue Spider Man as they believe he is a menace and Parker has\na touching and believable relationship with Gwen Stacy whose father is\nthe policeman pursuing Spidey.<br><br>The film is well made, slightly darker hued after the rebooted Dark\nKnight films, a good mix of action special effects and humour although\nthe CGI lizard could had been better but the film feels empty despite\nthe efforts of Andrew Garfield. A soulless film made solely so Columbia\nPictures can retain the rights to make Spider Man films.\n"
"\nI didn't know this, but I guess just within the past few years an\namazing new tool for making movies has come to the forefront, computer\ngenerated images. Some guy back in an office dicks around on a keyboard\nfor days on end and never has to be at the actual set to make a movie-\nisn't that mind-blowing? Think about it, no need to use film, no need\nto use lighting or make-up or costumes, no need for actors, no need for\nwriters or directors- just get a team of programmers together and let\nthem cobble together a digital file. The future of film making, point\nand click. Does that in any way ring hollow to you? Does some sh*tty\nfuture of lazy drone programmer film makers bother you at all? When did\ndoing something for real become second rate to a virtual experience?\nWhat did you get for what you gave up? The Amazing Spiderman 2? How did\nthat work out for you?\n"
"\nThis is a great movie that tells a more modernized, less strung out,\nversion of the Spiderman story with a few twists from the original\ncomic books. <br><br>I think they did an awesome job at making the Peter Parker character\nmore \"real\" while giving him that more sarcastic feel that you may have\nremembered from the comic books. Being traumatized by the awful\nSpiderman movies that came out in the early to mid 2000s, I was almost\nafraid to watch this movie in fear of what they may have done to the\nwhole idea of Spiderman, but I am glad I watched it. <br><br>Not too over dramatized and not too modified, which is what you found\nin the previous films. The story isn't exactly like the comic book for\na few reasons, one of them being the fact that they would drag the\nstory out too much and cause it to be boring as we seen in the last\nattempt. So if you are one of those people who think that everything\nshould remain unscathed in the comic book story-line then this probably\nisn't for you, otherwise, I would definitely recommend it.\n"
"\nWow, I really disliked this movie. I'm a big fan of Sam Raimi's first\ntwo Spider-Man movies, and while 'Spider-Man 3' wasn't up to much,\nthere was no reason why the series couldn't just carry on with a new\ncast - the Lizard had even been set up, ready to go.<br><br>Instead we got this reboot, which is a joyless, boring and ultimately\nredundant spin on the Spidey mythos. In order to differentiate itself\nfrom the Raimi films, which were still fresh in the audience's minds,\n'The Amazing Spider-Man' darkens the colour palette, stuffs Andrew\nGarfield into a terrible costume, bolts on an entirely superfluous\nsubplot involving Peter's parents, and turns Peter himself into an\nobnoxious, entitled and moody jerk who learns bugger all from the death\nof Uncle Ben. <br><br>It's not a likable film, it's not fun, it's not exciting. It's boring.\nIt's gloomy. It's Spider-Man seen through the Dark Knight filter. It's\na machine-tooled summer product with no personality of its own.\n"
"\nI must say that the casting took a different role and did not cast\naccording to looks. The child at the beginning of the movie looked more\nlike the woman that Parker is in love with than Parker himself. One\nmust notice that the boy had a round face and very small chin while\nPeter Parker had a long face and prominent chin. The woman had a round\nface and not a prominent chin. The special effects look like nothing\nbut cartoons. I give the special effects people a zero on this film. I\ncould hardly watch this film as it has no capacity to even keep one\ninvolved. The fact that there is a sequel amazes me. poorly\nwritten,very poor acting and the lack of story only shows that comic\nbook people will love anything. This so called movie would be great if\na 13 year old child had written the script. The acting is sometimes\ngood and sometimes very bad. The man who plays the father of\nSpider-mans love is a very bad actor or he has been given a very bad\nscript. If I was 5 years old. I would love this movie.\n"
"\nI don't even know why I watched this. I was bored. I knew it was gonna\nbe the same old Spider-Man story, AGAIN.<br><br>Though I didn't expect it to be this bad. This movie is cliché, cheesy,\nand really really stupid. I really have tried to sit back and accept\nthat maybe this movie isn't supposed to be serious.. its trying to have\nthat comic feel. But no, acting is terrible and jokes are cheap, and it\njust constantly feels like the creators are looking down at our\nintelligence. (So many face palm invoking moments..it's just not funny)<br><br>The first movie franchise started very well compared to this, it had a\nmuch better cast and depth (as if this one has any) and- as far as I'm\nconcerned this is an unnecessary, stupefied recycle attempt. If I had\nnot known better I might have thought this is a bad parody. (Something\nlike \"Superhero Movie\" but that was actually pretty good)<br><br>It's just sad movies like this are doing well. (But people are gonna\nkeep watching it just because its Spider-Man)\n"
"\nStop making Spiderman movies. <br><br>I never understood why this new movie needed to be made, so shortly\nafter the last three with Tobey Maguire. I mean, the concept has been\nmilked to the max, nothing could be added and indeed, this movie\ndoesn't add anything. <br><br>The story is pretty lame, the characters aren't surprising, different,\nor in any other way interesting and the new bad guy is just plain\nboring, if not at least completely superficial. Lizardman misses his\narm, co th entire city needs to be transformed into lizards??? Please,\nthat's just dumb...<br><br>Sure, the special effects are nice and advanced, but that is absolutely\nnot enough to carry this movie to any noticeable heights.<br><br>I would not give this sad attempt more than a three and why the F.. it\ngets a sequel? I dunno...\n"
"\nI didn't think I'd like this. But I ended up loving it! All the\nactors/actresses in this film were so good, so believable! There was\nsomething really believable about the new Peter Parker, Andrew\nGarfield. He acted like a true awkward (and raw) teen! Also, when I\nwatched the Captain America film, my girlfriend complained how\nunrealistic it was that Cap adapted to his new body immediately.\nWhereas in this new Spider-man film, Peter Parker was ripping out\nbathroom taps (US: faucets) by accident, and shattering glass whenever\nhe shut the door hard (again, accidentally). It took him time to master\nhis speed and coordination too. It was really, really good - really\nbelievable. My friend - a long-time Marvel fan - told me that this\nPeter Parker was more like the one from the comics, a true\nwise-cracker. I never intended to watch this film, but am so glad that\nI did! This is a true Spider-man film! (Though I preferred the villains\nin the Tobey Maguire films - the Green Goblin, Doctor Octopus. The\ncurrent film is like a more serious version of the Maguire films.)\n"
"\nI like this movie very much. It was one of the best Marvel movie of\n2012. This movie is for the person who like Action, Adventure and\nFantancy. The special effect on the movie was very nice. It was the\nremake of older version of spider man with few changes. It has a\nwonderful graphics. The acting of all the actor of this movie was\ngreat. The story was also very nice. The sets was also very nice.this\nmovie is not a waste of time and money. you will enjoy this movie very\nmuch. This is great movie from the Marvel. It is also a family type\nfilm. This movie can be seen by your whole family.So have a try and\nwatch this movie. Every thing on this movie was perfect, from action to\nstory. i liked the animation of this movie the most.\n"
"\nOne can only hope that there are more movies made with this cast. The\nSpider-Man trilogy was a disappointment to me, so I was hesitant to\neven watch this one, but I am glad I did. My faith has been restored in\nhow good a Spider-Man movie can be.<br><br>To me the trilogy played out to much like a soap opera where as this\nfilm tended to stick to the plot and storyline that carried the film.\nThe actors and actresses were a success to there related characters as\nwell.<br><br>If you even remotely enjoyed the previous three Spider-Man films you\nwill most certainly enjoy this one as well, because it was done in\nbetter taste, was very well scripted, and the cast was better selected.\nIf another one is made you can bet that I will go and watch it on the\nbig screen.\n"
"\nYou always open yourself up to criticism when you attempt a review of\nmovies spawned from comics.<br><br>The purists will jump at any chance to criticize any deviation. Not\nhaving a background in the comics, I opine only about the movies\nthemselves.<br><br>I love spider-man. My favorite is Sam Raimi's Spider-Man 2, with the\nbest of the series' villains, Doc Ock. I am going to go out on a limb\nand say this is the second best.<br><br>It was very realistic, in my opinion, from the typical adolescent hi-\njinks by Peter Parker (Andrew Garfield) in the beginning, to a real\nattraction with Gwen (Emma Stone), to the realization of his mission in\nlife as outlined by his uncle Ben, played brilliantly by Martin Sheen.<br><br>Denis Leary was great, and Rhys Ifans has come a long way from Spike.<br><br>Curious to know how long he will be able to stay away from Gwen.\n"
"\nIf I hadn't have seen the original Spiderman trilogy I would have\nprobably rated this movie higher, but I have so therefore I can't help\nbut to compare it. In itself, this movie is good- Emma Stone played the\npart very well and the plot line was believable for a 'comic book'\nmovie. The problem is that I don't think Andrew Garfield was the right\nchoice for the lead role; he is a good actor as we saw in The Social\nNetwork but something was just missing for me, lack of Peter Parker\nquirkiness? <br><br>The plot line was believable as I said but also predictable - there\nwere no interesting plot twists and I found myself getting bored in the\ntalks bits, the dialogue between the characters could have been written\nby a 9 year old! I understand that not all action movies need to have\naction 24/7 in them, but honestly, this needed more! There were only a\nhandful of decent action sequences and most of them were pretty short.\nAll in all I was disappointed leaving this movie, I will see the sequel\nand hopefully Garfield will have stepped up to the role.\n"
"\nThe movie has some very good parts and also some funny parts. The story\nline is basically the same as the first Spiderman, which is cool to be\nfamiliar with the film, but it makes the story too predictable and\nboring. <br><br>Some good parts I liked, which actually made me think outside of the\nmovie. The amazing quote Uncle Ben stated and the old picture of him\nwhen he was younger just made me realize that we as people have to\ncherish more in life. Stop taking everything for granted and thank\neverything we have. If you're a good person, don't let the bad things\nget in your way, pound them down and move on. Don't let the bad bring\nyou down, when you're originally a good person.<br><br>I felt like the bad guy did not play long enough in the movie and there\nwas too much of an intro to the movie than anything. If the directors\nand writers decide to keep moving on with this movie than I would rate\nthis film 10/10. Other then that it gets an 8/10.\n"
"\nAs a boy I loved the first Spider-man movie. It got me hyped! It got me\nobsessed with Marvel comic movies. Then the second film came around and\nit got better. The third...well...I liked it. When I heard they were\nmaking a reboot I got furious. But when I took some time to calm down,\nI figured I should give it a chance. It was WORTH IT! This makes up for\nall the faults the trilogy had and the effects were top-notch. Granted,\nthe effects in Spider-Man 2 got better, they even got an Oscar! But the\ntrilogy was cheesy. But it was marketed for kids, it's suppose to be.\nThis film was more for mature audiences. I loved Danny Elfman's score\nin the first two movies but when I read James Horner was composing this\nmovie I got even more hyped. And yes, the score rocked. The acting is\nsolid, the action is awesome, the casting is perfect, the villain is\nNOT over-the-top like Goblin and Doc Octopus which is better; it's just\nthe right superhero movie we needed. It did Spider-man a justice. I\nwill pay to see the future sequels.\n"
"\nAll the reasons not to see this movie can be summed up in one sentence:\nat a critical point in the movie, Spider-man is hanging off a building\nand needs to be rescued, as he has suddenly and inexplicably forgotten\nthat he can climb on walls.<br><br>There are a hundred other reasons why this movie is bad, like how\nthere's plot reset every thirty minutes that causes all characters to\nforget their previous motivations and never mention them again, but the\nabove should cover the worst of it: whenever convenient, Spider-man\nforgets that he is Spider-man, and the writer and director somehow\nassumed that you would too. And you just might, because aside from the\nnames and the costume, there's not much left of Peter Parker or\nSpider-man in this story reboot.<br><br>The action sequences are okay (but not great), and if all you want is\nanother generic superhero movie, then this is decent, but that's all\nyou'll get: a generic, forgettable movie about someone with a vaguely\ndefined set of super powers.\n"
"\nMost people might have overrated this movie, just because they went in\nexpecting this to be one of the worst Blockbusters made (in recent\nyears). Fortunately that is not the case. Just the fact they cast\nMartin Sheen and Sally Fields as a couple was one great coup. Great\nchemistry there. All the actors work in this one actually, but those\ntwo bring some weight/gravitas to the whole movie.<br><br>Of course the movie does have its weaknesses, such as logic or other\nthings the screenwriter couldn't be bothered with. But that doesn't and\nshouldn't be an obstacle you can't overcome. Because otherwise you\nwouldn't be able to enjoy the movie as the majority did (as is evident\nby the voting on here).<br><br>Of course it is a bit weird seeing a similar origin story again after\nonly 10 years (most will still have the Raimi movie fresh in mind). But\nit does work, which did surprise me too.\n"
"\nWell it is realistic as weird as that may sound, but it was pretty good\nactually, I didn't know how I would like Andrew Garfield as Spiderman,\nbut he was great! Not as good as Toby though, Toby was the\nquintessential nerd for me. He's awesome in every movie he is in. Emma\nStone was so much better than Kristen Dunst. I love Kristen Dunst\nthough, she is pretty and likable. A very likable movie and a very\nlikable Spiderman if I may add, but no Jonah Jameson these days. Dennis\nleary was a surprize as the police comissioner. I like Gwen Stacy more\nnow. I've always been more of a Kitty Pride, mary jane kind of a fan,\nbut yeah she was good in this movie, unlike Spiderman 3, which totally\nsucked I mean what is this Sam Rami some middle finger to everyone who\nhas ever liked Spiderman I think no I know it was. I mean they were\ngoing to make 6 of the original ones which is too many I think. 5\nmaybe.\n"
"\nThis is my favourite film this year, so far anyways.. I really enjoyed\nthe scenes of SM swinging through the building at night way above the\ntraffic.<br><br>I did think it was quite jumpy at times, especially towards the end.\nNot completely sure that the 17 year old grad was the idea cast\nselection for someone of this age, but hey its the movies, anything\ngoes right.<br><br>I will be looking out for this on DVD when it is released, one for the\ncollection. Also interested to see more from SM in the near future.<br><br>Great entertainment and cool visual elements.\n"
"\nI saw the Tobey Maguire trilogy, and I liked it, those movies were\nsignificant in my childhood, then I began to read the comic-books and I\nliked Spider-man even more, it was my obsession, and I realized that\nthe movies were so different than the original story.<br><br>Now, this brand-new movie comes out and I feel good with the result,\neverything is better! The cast, of course, is more accurate to the idea\nof the original Spidey, while in the other movies Sam Raimi used mature\nactors, a big mistake, Peter is a teenager! Point to TASM. The story in\nthis movie was not perfect, but I liked it. Acting was great! All of\nthe actors got into their characters so well. Visual effects were\nawesome, beautiful, well-done. And finally something that cannot miss\nin any spider-man story, the humor, in The Amazing Spider-man the humor\ngoes by funny and smart quotes and situations, while in the previous\nmovies the humor was a little bit ridiculous.<br><br>Finally all I can say is, now I'm older, and after watching the four\nmovies, my thumb-up goes to this one, a true success.\n"
"\nI have to say, I actually thought this was very good. Some people liked\nit some people didn't. It definitely can't beat the Spider Man 1 and 2\nwith Tobey Maguire, Kirsten Dunst, and James Franco, however; I thought\nthat it portrayed the background of Spiderman really well. I have also\nheard that this one follows the comic more. One thing I really liked\nwas the background info given on Peter's parents. I also liked how he\nhas the web developer in this one rather than pressing on the palm of\nhand or whatever Tobey Maguire did in the first one. I also found the\nvillain interesting-the lizard. I thought the scenes where Dr. Connors\nturned into the lizard were cool, however; I DO NOT Recommend SEEING IT\nIN 3D; I SAW IT IN 3D, I APPRECIATED The STORY AND ACTING BUT NOT\nNECESSARILY THE 3D VISUALS. Andrew Garfield did an amazing job as\nSpiderman. He embodied the role so well; Emma Stone did a great job as\nwell. There was good humor in it too but not as good as the original. I\nthought it was funny when he broke the alarm clock. I also liked the\nscene with the basketball.\n"
"\nThis movie was excellent and it amazes me that I continue to see\nnegative reviews, so much so I was spurred to write on myself. I really\ncannot see any element in which this movie does not surpass the\noriginal. The actors- I believed that Garfield gave a role that\nawesomely fits spidey from the comics, he delivered wit smoothly while\nalso embracing Peter Parker's nerdy persona. Emma stone likewise filled\nher role quite well and her acting abilities surpass Kirsten Dunst.\nFurthermore, the action and special effects. Anyone reviewing that says\nthis element of the film is subpar is just being biased and lying to\nthemselves. The fight scenes were incredible and there was so much\nsuspense I was on the edge of my seat sweating. The special fx was\ndelivered so flawlessly everything looked unbelievably realistic and\nnot only that spider man's animations were awesome, pure awesome. I had\nhigh expectations and was not let down, don't let these negative\nreviews scare you away!\n"
"\nThis is the long awaited 'The Amazing Spider-Man'. Everything about\nthis movie can be summed up in one word 'NICE', it is a very elegant\nmovie with very elegant actors/actresses everyone played their roles\nbeautifully. Andrew Garfield is the next big thing, Emma Stone is\ndestined for greatness, everything is nice but i have got to say that\nit was not as expected. The story line is very predictable, it was not\ncreative enough some details were actually kind of useless and\nexaggerated. To sum up 'The Amazing Spider-Man' is a nice and decent\nmovie and is highly recommended for everybody whether you are a Super\nHero movies fan or not.\n"
"\nWe all love the original Spider-Man series. The main lovable character\nPeter Parker was played magnificently by Tobey Macquire. When you watch\nthis, you can''t help but to compare it with the other series. The new\nPeter Parker was played very well, but for some reason, you just can't\nsee him as Spider-man. Granted, this movie had a nice storyline, good\nvisual effects, and even a different idea of how he learned to control\nhis power. Directing was good, but like I said, they tried to get us\nattached to this movie like the original one did, but it just didn't\ncatch on. Graphics weren't bad, but they were good enough to make it\nseem realistic. Overall, this movie is worth seeing, but don't expect\nit to be as good as the first.\n"
"\nI really liked this film.<br><br>I was never really a person who was a big fan of superhero movies but\nthis movie has turned me into a superhero fan.I absolutely love Andrew\nGarfield and Emma Stone, they are perfect together!I did miss Harry\nOsborne and Mary Jane, them being known as Peters best friend and\ngirlfriend. The people who first loved the original could possibly be\nupset they weren't there, as i am, although I love the character Gwen\nStacey and think that they worked that perfectly into the film. <br><br>I love how for this film they went a bit further into the story of\nPeters father, although it wasn't much it was still something to\nexplain a few things that had people wondering from the original films\n(which were also great!)<br><br>To sum up, i loved this film. As the title states, it was amazing. So,\nto sum up, i thought the movie was, as the title states, amazing!! I\ncan't wait until the second comes out\n"
"\nFirstly, I will say a massive well done to the casting director.\nSeriously, every actor was so well selected to their respective roles.\nMartin Sheen, Sally Field, Rhys Ifans, Emma Stone and by no means least\nAndrew Garfield. In fact the most negative thing I will say about this\nmovie is that I will find it hard to watch the other Spider Man movies\nthe same way now!! The movie plays out well and is not in too much of\nhurry to get to the main storyline. The effects are not too much that\nyou are thinking CGI Oh my god!! Andrew Garfield plays Spider Man so\nwell that he has truly made it his own. Watch it and you won't be\ndisappointed.\n"
"\nI never really understood why they were doing a remake of spider-man. I\nwas hoping for something stronger in concept, perhaps better acting,\nbut i was sorely disappointed. I didn't understand why Gwen (who is a\nhigh school student) is an intern in some acclaimed lab. I didn't\nunderstand how peter came up with that webbing, or how people of the\ncity liked spider-man enough to help him out in the end. It made no\nsense! However, the room with the spiders spinning was pretty cool and\nhow peter got bitten was pretty cool, but that was about it! The comic\nrelief between uncle Ben and aunt may held nothing more than that,\ncomic relief. The death of uncle Ben in the previous movie was far more\npoignant than in this movie, but it does make for a logical explanation\nfor how spider-man came into being. The back story with how peter's\nparents went missing seemed merely an excuse to make another spider-man\nmovie. It didn't seem all that fleshed out, and peter just happens to\nstumble into all of that mess and mystery, is just flabbergasting. So\nwhy was this movie made again?\n"
"\nThe Amazing Spider-Man is an entertaining film, but I liked the\noriginal, Sam Raimi's Spider-Man better. This one has better visuals\nand 3D effects, but the script was too weak for it to surpass my\nexpectations.<br><br>Overall, the film gives you the thrills, thanks to the visual effects,\nbut a better story line could have made it a worth watch. The shady\nscreenplay doesn't make things better either. Watch it without\nexpectations, and without comparing it to the original Spider-Man.<br><br>Acting: 8.5/10 Story-Screenplay-Direction: 7/10 Technical Aspects: 8/10\nIs it worth your time and money??: For the visuals and the 3D effects,\nyes!! Nothing so special otherwise.<br><br>For a detailed review, please visit sasikanth.me :)\n"
"\nIf you go theater for having fun and have the money in your pocket you\ncan watch it.But if you looking something special and something could\nchange your look to events (For God it's just Spider Man!!) you came to\nwrong place.<br><br>Actings are good.Webb does his role good enough and others are good to.\nSpecial effects are moderate . But that lizard animations are terrible\n. But there is no untold story. It's just like other Spider Man movies.\nBut it is not a insult or something . But I read it's comics and a fan\nof 'em and it's not like comic books and like i said there is no untold\nstory. 3D is good enough too.<br><br>IF YOU GOT MONEY AND WANT SOME FUN WATCH IT BUT DON'T WAIT SOMETHING\nSPECIAL.\n"
"\nIt is hard to believe that some DIE HARD fans of Spider-Man have hated\nthis film....Probably because of the recasting.In My opinion it was a\ngood film Well i would say better than spider-man..! Yeah personally i\nfeel what was not in the original film was in TASM..like when uncle Ben\ndies u really feel sorry for Peter...in the original one\ni,literally,laughed at the poor crying boy..The chemistry between Emma\nStone and Andrew Was also great to watch. In terms of acting Everyone\nplayed their part quite well.. i personally and genuinely feel that\nAndrew Garfield is a great Spider- Man/Peter Parker.It was funny,it was\nsad,it was \"AMAZING\"..It has great scope as a franchise ..i think Sony\ntook a right decision in rebooting the series. Waiting for TASM\n2....Nuff Said!\n"
"\nNo idea where all the negative feedback has come from. This is a great\nfilm. Its brilliantly acted and the story flows. The characters behave\nbelievably and all in all its much more spider man than the previous. I\nsuspect that a lot of the negative comments on here are due to a love\nof the previous series but for me they were never that tremendous.\nSpider-Man acts much more like Spider-Man should with his quips and\nattitude and is far more genuine than the last series. All in all its a\ngreat film I thoroughly enjoyed it and found far superior to the new\nBatman that everybody seemed to love so much. Would definitely\nrecommend it to anyone.\n"
"\nI didn't really like this version, don't get me wrong the original\nwasn't that good either, but this one was pretty cheesy compared to the\nfirst one, I mean c'mon..., like the part where they line up the crains\nso he can swing (pretty cheesy),and the unbelievable part where he\npicked up someone else's badge and the guy that owns the badge comes\nand they don't believe its him...really? in a place where they create\nsuper spiders and grow arms back they cant create a security system\nthat surpasses someone saying \"yep im this guy\" even when the guy came\nthey should have immediately asked for ID and then kick peter out.\nthose are just some of the bad things, oh yea almost forgot the fake\nlooking CGI. I wouldn't waste 13$ to go see this guys, if you really\nwanna see it wait for the DVD.Forgot to mention, the scenes are\npredictable.\n"
"\nSo before i saw the movie i was reading reviews on here and they almost\nturned me away from seeing this film. There were a lot of \"bad action\",\n\"stupid dialogue\", and so forth...but i thank god that i decided to not\nlisten to this reviews as i found them to be completely wrong! I was\namazed at this movie, it was beautiful in every way, and compared to\nthe past three spidey movies...well it would be like comparing George\nW. Bush with Abe Lincoln, it just...is so wrong...this reboot is\nprobably one of the best i have ever seen. the Acting was superb,\nAndrew made Toby look like a horrible actor, and Emma.....well\neverything she is in is so amazing...and well it doesn't help that she\nis absolute eye candy, and yes she beats out Kirsten easily, though i\ndo like Kirsten's acting, just not in the Spidey movies.\n"
"\nI was told not to go and see this movie, good thing I didn't listen. <br><br>My husband and I really enjoyed this movie as it had action, drama,\nfamily friendly, wondering what is going to happen next, a scary\nmonster. We did not see the 3D movie but that didn't matter as it was\nscary without having things coming at me.<br><br>I gave it a \"9\" because I am don't want to wait to long before the next\nmovie.<br><br>Stay to after the ratings because there is still another scene. <br><br>Only draw back that I had was some stupid person in front of me kept\nusing her cell phone.\n"
"\nWhile this Spider-Man reboot is certainly more enjoyable than most\nmovies, the previous version was better. The writers went out of their\nway to change all the little details from the previous version, but\nkept much of the same major plot points the same.<br><br>This version's morality points, catch phrases, romance and emotional\nmoments just weren't as well done. And there was almost no comedy.\nThere were no major plot holes, but there were multiple small ones that\nbugged me. On the other hand, the acting was excellent, by all the\nactors, and the awkward teenager aspect was well done.<br><br>But on the whole I prefer the previous version.\n"
"\nAfter watching Sam Raimi's previous 3 versions i had a lot of\nexpectations on this Amazing Spiderman.But did this satisfy me?\nDefinitely not. First of all there were many scenes which we have\nalready witnessed in the previous trilogy.Eg- Living with uncle and\naunt,uncle dies,a scientist mistakenly becomes a bad guy etc... So you\nwant find anything much new here,even the CG isn't good enough. To\nmaximize the thrill the villain should have a deadly role,but here\nDr.Corners just makes us laugh at him bcoz the lizard looks funny. Why\ndo all villains transform after an experiment getting failure?We have\nalready witnessed it in the previous trilogy too..... Anyhow I'm a big\nfan of Spidey.Expecting a lot from Amazing Spiderman 2\n"
"\nThe other movies are OK. They stick to the original storyline and the\nacting was fine - it involved quite a few of my favourite actors. But\nfor me, the movies lacked the engagement I had with the comics as a kid\nwhen Spiderman was my favourite superhero. Therefore I got bored to the\npoint that I didn't even bother watching the third film. I am pleased\nto report that for me this is the Spiderman from the comics come to\nlife on the big screen. Andrew Garfield plays the geeky, hopeless,\nclumsy hero who even though he has amazing powers, is still a nerd at\nheart. I did prefer Willem Dafoe's Green Goblin but I do love Rhys\nIfans who does a great job. The storyline he is attached to is modern\nand relevant. Martin Sheen is always a pleasure to watch and I shed\nreal tears when he inevitably dies. I had been put off by the last\nmovies but this was much better than I expected. The only thing that\nputs me off is that Garfield looks so much like tennis player Andy\nMurray it's weird to see him smile...\n"
"\nI think that this movie is very well done, well scripted and well\nplayed by the actors. <br><br>Many say that this movie is much worse then the other spider-man movies\nbut i honestly this this one is better. The other spider-man movies are\ngood, but i still missed the spider-man that i read in comic books when\ni was younger, the fun side of spider-man. <br><br>The spider-man that i like is the sarcastic one, that is joking around,\nand i found that in this movie more then i did in the others. Sure, the\nother movies had their moments but i think spider-man was played much\nmore to my liking in this movie.<br><br>Brilliant movie, i have already watched it a couple of times and i love\nit.\n"
"\nI Came Into The Theater On The 4th of July and i was so pumped my\nchildhood was spider-man with Tobey Maguire but then i saw this was a\nmagical film Andrew Garfield Did A Wonderful Job As Peter Parker But A\nMagical Job as Spider-Man He Was Perfect I Heard There Was Going To be\na Trilogy So I Thought Lets See If He Can Pull it off For 2 More Films\nThen There's The Gorgeous Emma Stone Playing Gwen Stacy I Thought She\nWas So Adorable In This Film Her and Andrew Are So Cute Together and\nI'm a guy The Best Part Was The Acting and the effects are great The\nLizard Just Pops Out At You and i saw this in 2D so amazing the one\nthing i hated was it felt like they skipped like 20 scenes\n"
"\nAndrew Garfield's Peter Parker is excellent, he's funny, smart ass and\nstill has a bit of teenage angst. He handled the more emotional scenes\nvery well. <br><br>Uncle Ben's death was handled so much better in this series, the moral\nwas too spoon-fed in the last series.<br><br>The fighting is very good too, less swinging around between skyscrapers\nand more close combat. <br><br>the movie takes its time to tell the story, some may find there's too\nlittle action before the final showdown. But there're lots of comic\nmoments in between and they're good!:)<br><br>the villain isn't very interesting, but this isn't batman, the villain\ndoesn't have much a character development arc, so no surprise.\n"
"\nPrepare to be amazed? Well I certainly was! This was an awesome re-boot\nof the movie franchise and I was very impressed. I have been a\nSpider-Fan for years now, and was highly anticipating Spidey's new\nrelease. Andrew Garfield does a better job than Tobey Maguire, simply\nbecause Garfield looks more like Peter does in the original comics, it\nwas also lovely to see Gwen Stacey introduced in the beginning, like\nshe should have been in the 'Tobey' Trilogy. Beautiful plot line, nice\nlevel of sarcastic humor, brilliant CG and stunts, awesome costume\nre-design, hilarious cameo by Stan Lee, simply amazing! I loved the\nfilm! Well done Marvel! &lt;3\n"
"\nLet me start off by saying i will not spoil the film for you by going\ninto great detail. This movie has been criticized, for what, i don't\nknow this is truly a masterpiece. The movie stays true to the comics\nwith Gwen Stacey being peters first love and not Mary Jane! Also his\nweb slingers are introduced because in the comics spidey couldn't\ncreate webbing the movie shows peters struggles and build up to become\na better person and a great hero just like in the comics. He is also\ncomical and arrogant just like the comics so why hate just because its\ntrue to the comic doesn't make it bad the acting is great and Garfield\nplayed a better spider-man than Toby. The action is great and not\noverly hyped and the story is true and believable...well more\nbelievable than Toby's spider-man movies. All around this is a great\nmovie and one of the best super hero adaptations of all time.\n"
"\nIn early summer 2007, Sam Raimi directed the 3rd and final film,\nSpiderman 3. With it's disappointment, Marc Webb,decided to retell the\nstory in a different way. And it works. Should he have waited.<br><br>Yes. <br><br>Was it good. <br><br>No. It was Great.<br><br>Originally, I intended not to see this film, I was out of spider man.\nBut it grew on me as its anticipation rose as well. <br><br>The acting was incredible, the action was incredible<br><br>If you haven't seen it, go now. I would also like to mention that if\nthis was the untold story, then it would need more explanation in\nspider man 3.<br><br>You'll see why when you see it\n"
"\nI must say, I didn't have much faith but was a bit excited just to know\nif they would be able to impress me with yet another Spiderman! Yes,\nloved Garfield's nerdy clumsy character evolve into a modest hero. Two\nthumbs up for me, it was a wild ride 8-) Always love Emma Stone,\nalthough not as a blonde so much but she was a cute match for the\nmovie. I had the opportunity to see Garfield in a movie called Never\nLet Me Go. So I knew that he would handle a part like this with ease.\nIt took me a minute to get used to his smaller physic, not the muscular\nToby Maguire but yuck who cares about him anymore *short cringe* I am\nhappy that Marc Web was able to clean up such a pitiful excuse for a\nsuper hero movie blah ... So I must say Well Done!\n"
"\nAmazing, finely a movie that surprises and is not afraid to do some\nthings different, the \"nerd\" character is so over done, i'm glad to see\nspider man is a cool guy and not some sissy geek, the action is great\nthe drama is great the acting is great, all of that makes your mind\ndive into this flick, i always value movies by how much enjoyed them,\nthat's the whole reason we go to the movies no?<br><br>This is my first review of a film, and it's been a while since i\nenjoyed a movie like this, so wanted to give it a try.<br><br>This is a \"remake\" done correctly and beautifully, i highly recommend\nthis movie.\n"
"\nThis movie was Amazing!! Betther than the first three in my humble\nopinion. Some people don't think so because of the origin story being\ntold more than once. Well I think that Marc Webb did a great job\ntelling the story once again because he didn't have to go in depth all\nthat much because we all know what is going to happen. The actions\nsequences were amazing and better than the previous trilogy. The fight\nscene in the school was the best fight scene. I though it was the best\nbecause it showed how agile Spider-Man really is like in the comics.\nAndrew Garfield is a way better Spider-Man than Tobey Macguire because\nhe brings Spider-Man's humor which was rarely shown in the previous\ntrilogy.<br><br>This deserves an easy 10/10\n"
"\nI am not a fan of super hero movies and watched this only because my\nkids wanted to watch it. <br><br>The cast was top rate. I thought Andrew Garfield was pretty impressive\nas Peter Parker and made a better Spider-man than Tobey Maguire. Emma\nStone is a fantastic actress and always worth watching and adds charm\nas Gwen Stacy. Martin Sheen was as good as ever and Rhys Ifans makes\nfor a pretty good villain. <br><br>The film was beautifully shot and the set pieces where Peter Parker\ndiscovers his powers were amusing and well filmed. The action sequences\nthroughout the film were exciting and well executed.<br><br>This is an old fashioned and uncomplicated telling of the tale and much\nthe better for it. This to my mind is the finest Superhero film made\nand certainly much better than the recent Dark Knight films.\n"
"\nGirls will love this movie and guys will enjoy it more than an average\nrom-com but this sh**ty unnecessary piece of sh*t will have all true\nspider-man fans gagging and rushing for the exit. Too bad it's already\na commercial success so there will definitely be a sequel which pobably\nwill be even sh*ttier. Like everyone I'm appalled by the lack of\nrespect for Sam Raimi and for the original comics. I'll admit\nSpider-man 3 was a mess, but this was the fault of the studio- execs\nand not of master Raimi... <br><br>It seems its success is biggest in India home of Bollywood movies. So\nmaybe next time Spidey will be singing and dancing..\n"
"\nNothing But a Remake - NBAR! Maybe it was just me, but since the First\nSpider Man was still modern; still relevant, on the heels of Toby\nMacguire and Cliff Robertson, WHY did we have to make the same ol thing\nover again? What: To see if there was an upside down kiss? C'mon! I\nexpected more. The spoilers are...wait! Only everything you saw in the\nlast one! That's all. The kid gets bit on the back by a spider, albeit\ndigital one; Kid meets girl - falls for girl; Uncle gets shot dead;\netc., etc. Couldn't they come up with some creative ideas, enough to\nwrite a new flippin' story? Like after several Batman movies, we were\ntreated and rewarded with \"Batman Begins\"! as a great example. This\nspider movie version, because of the disappointment of watching the\nsame old plot lines, makes this nothing but a quick spin, with a few\nnew faces and a few changes with story and villain -- this ends up\nbeing nothing but a 'cash cow' for the production executives and all\ny'all have fallen right into their trap. Yes, true. Me too...except I\ngot in free.\n"
"\nJust been to the movie and the movie was just as predictable &amp; boring\nas expected. It lacked in every department from the highly predictable\nstoryline to the stale acting to the poor humour which strangely some\npeople found funny.<br><br>I do wonder if directors nowadays have any creative bone in the body to\nmaybe have a bit spontaneity in the movie instead of regurgitate every\nscene in the movie.<br><br>I do wonder if the lack of quality storyline &amp; over excessive action\nscenes has to do with trying to make as much money as possible to\nentice the lowest common denominator.<br><br>I do wonder how people in movie theater are so easily amused that they\nthey must have laughed on 10 different occasions when in reality they\nwhere actually hardly any funny scenes.<br><br>I do wonder how easily pleased people are that a movie like this get's\na rating of 7.6 when it has mediocrity written all over it.<br><br>To finish it off if you want great acting, storyline, humour,\nchemistry, or any great adjectives to describe a movie then this is not\nthe movie for you!\n"
"\nThe main actor for SM was much better than Toby. They girlfriend was a\nlot better looking than Kirston Durnst. But the fact of the matter was\nthat the script was terrible. There were a few bit and pieces of action\nbut the main story was a love story or no story. I would recommend you\ngo see the Avengers again or wait for Batman. Or just rent it. I almost\nfell asleep. I have most likely seen 90% of every movie ever made and\nam a huge fan of superhero films. Saw the Avengers 3x in one week. This\nfilm is a total yawner. The main villain is just hard to believe and\nwas poorly cast. Special effects were OK, sound was OK. I was forced\ndue to times to see it in 3D which I hate. But the 3D was actually\ndecent for this film.\n"
"\nThis reboot had a different feel then the other spiderman movies. The\nreason being is that this reboot felt more directed towards adults.\nThis is not to say its not appropriate for younger viewers because its\nperfectly fine for most youngsters. This spiderman has very little\nscenes that grab at children rather more of a straight action film with\nno comedy. Spiderman was much closer to the original hero in this film\nand i can and did really appreciate that. I found that spiderman 4\nwould have probably done just as well as The Amazing Spiderman. The\nmovie seemed to drag on much longer then needed with a very slow start.\nI think the only real thing that would appeal to people is that\nspiderman is not played by Tobey Maguire which in itself is worth at\nleast a watch.\n"
"\nI had huge expectations from this movie. I had thought andrew would\nbe,as they say, amazing. unfortunately, he was, well, himself!<br><br>The story is pretty different from the previous spiderman movies.\nHowever, the first half is similar to the first half an hour of\nspiderman 1! yes, it is that boring! <br><br>Andrew Garfield has done a pretty good job, but his dialogue delivery\nis kinda sad. I was really impressed by Emma Stone. she looks pretty\nand has a don't-mess-with-me attitude,which is crucial for her\ncharacter. <br><br>I found myself looking at my watch for almost most of the first half.\nThe story, however, picks up in the second half with the advent of the\nlizard. The 3-D was mediocre, almost useless. <br><br>So, basically, do not waste time and money at the theatre to watch this\nmovie. you'd rather rent this movie out or download (oops, did i just\nsay that?)!\n"
"\nThere have been five movies that have come into play since year 2000.\nThey were in the year 2002 2004 2007 2012 and 2014.The best movie\naccording to me was in 2007 (spider man 3) and the not so good was in\nyear 2012 (The amazing spider man). What I most disliked about the\nmovie released in 2012 was the process how spider man comes into\nexistence, it was unrealistic. However it was good in portraying\nactions of spider man, which were not so good in previous movies.<br><br>What would have been ideal process of spider man coming into existence?\nIt could have been scripted better. For me it would have been a bite of\nspider followed by some sort of laser rays falling on subject.<br><br>Any process that guarantees easy build up for super humans would result\nin their large number. Thus portraying such a process is wrong.<br><br>Thus my ratings: Spider-Man (2002): 8/10, Spider-Man 2 (2004): 8/10,\nSpider-Man 3 (2007): 9/10, The Amazing Spider-Man (2012): 7/10, The\nAmazing Spider-Man 2 (2014): 8/10\n"
"\nThe Amazing Spider-Man tells the story we have all seen before but in a\nsignificantly darker tone. Although I won't argue that this feature is\nbetter then the Sam Rami Spider-Man trilogy, I still stand by that this\nmovie does things better. These things include acting, character\ndevelopment, and effects. Overall I enjoyed it but I see why people\ndon't.<br><br>6/10\n"
"\nThis is a decent reboot of the Spiderman series as we get a \"refreshed\"\nlook at Peter's backstory. I liked the scenes where Peter gets bitten,\nthe basketball gym scene, the subway scene, the battle with the lizard,\nthe part where Uncle Ben gets shot, the part where he rescues the\nlittle kid, and the parts where Spidey's slinging through New York\nCity. The movie has a decent story, an excellent cast, and good action\nscenes. Some people didn't like this. I liked it. Emma Stone was good\nas Gwen Stacey, and Denis Leary was great as the chief and Andrew\nGarfield was great as Peter/Spidey. Any superhero fan might like this.<br><br>*** out of ****\n"
"\nI'm not sure why studios feel the need to keep rebooting these comic\nbook superhero movies every couple of years Batman, Superman etc. The\nlast Spiderman wasn't even that long ago -4 years- did we really need\nanother remake already? And on that note I preferred the version with\nToby Maguire (Spiderman) especially this first inception story.<br><br>Anyways. This was still an entertaining movie, fun with good special\neffects. I enjoyed the cast; Rhys Ifans as the lizard man, Dennis\nLeary, Peter's parents Martin Sheen and Sally Field. Andrew Garfield\nwas fine as Peter Parker, full of teen angst and nice to look at, but I\njust kept comparing him to Toby Maguire. The romance was kinda meh, it\nprobably plays out better in real life (wink). <br><br>So once again we follow high-school outcast Peter Parker as he embraces\nhis destiny as Spiderman, investigating his late father's secrets,\nfalling for the beautiful Gwen Stacy and in this version battling Dr.\nCurt Connors aka the Lizard. 9/21/14\n"
