flight is a great film
in a day and age where almost all hollywood movies try to thrill us with special effects and gore flight soars with extraordinary acting and a story that will change lives
i went not knowing really what to expect
a drama about a crashed airplane right
well this film is much much more
it is truth
truth about life
truth about addictions
denzel washington does an awesome believable job as an alcoholic airplane captain struggling with his addiction and accusations after the plane crash
john goodman plays an interesting character and provides some laughs
without giving too much away i will say that if you like drama movies or denzel go see it
if you are or know anyone who is struggling with an addiction of any kind
go see it
it just might change your life
910 a
washington gives what is nothing less than a performance of a lifetime in this tension filled film dealing with a pilot wrestling with inner demons
the aviation sequences are stunning and the crash one of the most breathtaking ever filmed
the director is highly gifted and his skill and passion are clearly evident
the script is superb with intelligent plotting and sharp dialog that captures reality
it is once again washington who shines here above all else
his power as an actor is what truly gives this movies its fire
his portrayal of a substance abusing addictalcoholic is painful to watch because of the humanity he brings to the part
it is a tremendous accomplishment and one of the finest studies of addiction ever filmed
this is hands down one of the worst movies ever the only good part was in the trailer the rest is just one long painfully dull story about a pilot that cant admit he has a problem with alcohol and the people that care about him trying to get him to see it
dont waste your time on this one
it was a huge disappointment lots of nudity but to no purpose to the story what little story there is
i usually love denzel washington and his movies his acting was good but it was the story or lack thereof that made this so bad
its a long movie 2 hours and 18 min of boring
the aa groups will like the promotion but really who wants to watch some guy coming to grips with his addiction so slowly and stupidly sigh truly bad
denzel washington shows us yet again that he is one of the premier actors of the past 25 years
his convincing portrayal of an alcoholic is downright painful to watch and i mean this in a very good way it is such a believable performance
he is the pilot of a plane that crashes yet his skill as an aviator saves almost all of the passengers
the aircraft is clearly in need of an overhaul but its his drug and alcohol addiction that comes prominently into question
with a great supporting cast including john goodman whose character lights up the screen in the few scenes hes in and someone hes worked with before fallen in 1998 and with the rolling stones music figuring in both films
and don cheadle a much more straitlaced character than mouse from devil in a blue dress 95 where he played opposite denzel
kelly reilly is also wonderful as an addict who befriends whip denzel
great characters in a well told tale
denzel gives a highflying pun intended performance as whip whitaker a commercial pilot who may have a drinking problem but hell certainly be the last to know
directed with restraint by techwhiz robert zemeckis in his first liveaction effort in more than a decade flight is a gut wrenching film with its power grounded in its lead performance by mr
washington
he too acts with a restraint unseen in his oscarwinning work as a bad cop in training day instead opting to bare his soul with his eyes
man those are some heavy storied eyes
and they should be
from the films riveting opening crash sequence zemeckis time to shine to its gripping courtroom ending we take a saddening journey through whips life as it spirals out of control faster than a fullpitched plane in a nosedive
at times a tad preachy but ultimately satisfying you can go ahead and reserve a seat for denzel on a direct flight to the oscars
and it would be a cryin shame to not mention john goodmans knockout turn as a drug dealer
wow hes brilliantly funny
the movie started out great
witty entertaining and had you on the edge of your seat
the entire plane scene was excellent from the action and acting to the photography
sadly it was all downhill from there
while denzels performance was good it was unoriginal
as an alcoholic nicolas cage did a far better job in leaving las vegas than denzel
the character of nicole went no where
her storyline never materialized
basically nicoles character appeared to be an afterthought that got interrupted mid thought
the best part of the movie was john goodman  two brief appearances that were highly amusing and added some life to a comaesque movie
still confused as to what all the hype is about
many say that this is denzel washington at the top of his game i tend to agree
washington plays whip whitaker a senior airline pilot that on a wing and a prayer makes a miraculous
albeit crash landing on the way to atlanta
nearly everyone aboard is saved as whitakers training and skills help him avoid a midair catastrophe
waking in the hospital whip finds out that he is a hero but as the crash is investigated it comes to light that his lab work reveals alcohol use
his future and reputation are at risk
as more government scrutiny unfolds whitaker is forced to not only face his demons but the honest truth as well
compassionate as it is compelling
washington brings realism to the forefront and is helped with fine performances from costars nadine velazquez don cheadle and tamara tunie
you dont realize the movie is well over two hours long
drug and alcohol use along with some nudity and intense action makes flight rated r
denzel wahington once again reminds us why hes such a great actor in this drama
flight is not a film about planes or a pilots life but it is an amazing character study about the demons of a man
this man portrayed almost flawless by washington in an award worthy performance is a man of addictions trying to overcome these
and that is what the movie is basically about a man trying to fight his disease and how the people around him react to his actions
whats so great about the movie is how you actually sympathize with the character of denzel washington i mean there are literally many times during the film when i actually was talking to denzel in my head like oh dont do it man dont drink that stuff come on and i believe that says a lot about the movie cause you actually care for the characters in this
flight has great performances a great story and it is beautifully told
robert zemeckis epic comeback indeed
deserves a watch
there is not much to the movie that pulls you to watch it again
the character is portrayed in a bad way
you feel that he deserves everything bad that happens to him
it is because he had no control over his life
denzel has done a great job
the plane scenes were very well made
there are lot of characters in the movie who werent used much
it just focuses on the main character
many characters were not used
the choices the character makes are questionable
you are left to think how foolish the character really is
even an addict would feel that the movie is just too much
there is little believable
the director had so many things to assume for the audience that at one point you really feel the movie is just made to feel dramatic
this spoils the mood of the watcher
flight is movie that albeit having scenes involving a flight is about a man more than an object
the plane crash is just an excuse to bring the story of whitakers life which is full of problems like alcoholism drug addiction bad parenting etc
this story felt particularly touching for me considering i have lots of relatives with drinking problems so if you also do be prepared to see something kind of heavy
denzel washingtons acting is ok but in my opinion the one who steals the show is brian geraghty the scene in which whitaker comes into his hospital bedroom proved that geraghty knows how to perform a serious scene mixed with a lot of feelings
directing and soundtrack are just regular and maybe thats why flight doesnt seem to impress spectator in any moment
i believe that a stronger directing and a louder soundtrack could have made this film a lot better
all in all this isnt anything remarkable and the ending may be a let down for some but its an entertaining picture to be seen and reflected about
i had high expectations for this movie before i watched it
im a fan of denzel washington and this movie was highly reviewed and nominated for two oscars
im also a fan of the director robert zemeckis
i was mildly disappointed
the beginning of the film was very interesting
the plane scene was action packed and had me at the edge of my seat
i couldnt wait to see what would happen next
however after that not much happens
the last 34ths of the movie is basically just denzel washingtons character getting drunk all the time despite being investigated for flying a plane while drunk
i found it very difficult to relate or sympathize with his character
i guess he redeems himself in the end and owns up to his behavior but by then i had lost interest in him and the film in general
i am not an addict but i wont lie about lying
this movie has a potential to touch each one of us
a pilot who bears the guilt of deaths of his crew members tires and fails to fight his addiction but in the end embraces the truth
simple yet so bitter a truth
the burden of lies upon lies crushes our souls and this movie gives us courage to break free
there is also an implicit explanation of the addiction that most try to turn away from
hiding truth from our own selves is one big reason for continuous pain
watch and you will agree
an astounding acting a superb rollon story and a wonderful end
a must see drama that we all live in
my vote 810 straight
the trailer and poster of the movie looks great
the movie starting is also great
the main highlight is the part in the plane the small details where the director had worked such as drinking the drinks in the flight etc
but after the crash the movie goes bit slow
the after crash is all the drama related to the hospital scene and the place where the pilot meet his new friend
after that the drama gets bit boring for me as its confusing
the only interesting part is that where the pilot mention he is alcoholic and had drunk that day
on average 6 stars is good ratings as it lacks of action except the flight scene and also the drama is not so good despite of the good actors
this film is totally contrast throughout there are moments of absolute brilliance and also moments where i was so bored i wanted to turn the film off because i was bored
denzel washington stars as a pilot which lands a crashing plane while under the influence of alcohol and the film documents the trials and tribulations he must endure throughout
now i must say first denzel washington completely deserved his oscar nomination for his performance as his performance is the part of the film that you follow and he is the character that the audience needs to connect with
the side characters are all believable in their role and are superb in their performances
to properly describe this film the opening part where he is in the plane crash is heart stopping and fantastic but then it also stops and slows down a lot which is the boring part and then it becomes heart wrenching and tense towards the end of the film which makes this film a great film but not to the level of other similar films like the wrestler
flight is one of those films that has you in the passenger seat to watch a journey of emotions and personal drama to unfold
all in the end it reveals truth no matter how painful it is or isnt
the man denzel washington is whip whitaker a hotshot airline pilot who after a night of binge drinking and drug snorting in which in a hotel room he had sex with a hot sexy colored bra wearing flight attendant named katerinanadine velazquezmiraculously lands his plane after a malfunction
still this landing first looked at as heroic was clearly a bad accident it cost lives and plenty of injuries
and you guessed it questions arise as with any drama it seeks the truth still this drama is a character study of redemption and truth seeking
it shows the struggle and courage of one man and thats whip whitaker who admits his guilt and struggle as ending with the discovery of truth is what matters most
although it seemed a bit lengthy and seemed to wander a bit too much in directions that made it hard for me to stay interestedi really enjoyed denzel washingtons performance as demon battling airline pilot whip whitaker
denzel never fails to impress in anything
hes that good
his performance of the main character is what kept me going
i cared about what happened to him and was hoping the ultimate outcome of the film was a suitable one
thankfully it was
there are no more real highlights to brag about here
as i saidthe film otherwise ran a little too long and went into some areas that made the story fall flat
thumbs up for denzel
beware
the trailer make you believe that the film is about the plane crash and the captains trail
it is a scam  the movie is about alcohol addiction  and a mediocre one
maybe the acting is good but you seen this kind of addiction story too many times
nothing original in this script
the 5 points i gave are for the first 30 minutes which are entertaining
the rest of it is a waist of time
if you want to see an almost boring and obviously unrealistic movie i cant believe that a boeing pilot did not have blood test periodically about a alcoholic pilot than go
if you want to see a movie about a pilots trial or an action movie avoid this one
this is a very unrealistic movie concerning the aviation part as well as the alcoholic part
if something is wrong with the aircraftstabilizer and you can not control the pitchattitude you will never be able to control the pitch all of a sudden when you fly upside down
and a drunk pilot is flying better than a healthy and fit pilot trying to do the same thing in the simulator
also if your a strong alcoholic as this pilot you will never be able to leave the booze alone for 9 days without any help
and during the final hearing he only has to respond yes to get off the hook
how many people would dosay the same thing as he does
but besides this all the movie is slow and boring
only the first 15 minutes are interesting the crash and the minutes of the ntsbhearing
the whole dramatic middlepart could have been shortened by the half to make this movie at least not as slow as it is now
a disappointing movie and almost a waste of the time watching it
how amazing is when the director wants you to hate the main character
and at the end they want you to love him because he gives a lesson of live to his son
like the common american hero
one more time is the story about a man who gets drunk every day uses cocaine
no matter where
in his home in his job
the viewers can only hate him because they see themselves in that plain suffering that accident but just after having seen how many drugs and alcohol the pilot had taken
during the film the director wants you to change your mind because at least he learns the lesson and stop with that horrible life and began to teach others how drinking and drugs is a kind of chains for everybody
remember kids say no to drugs and alcohol
anyway i like the professional work of denzel washington once again
the first part of the film was awesome
the rest not so much
the flight and crash sequences were fantastic
but then
the film turned into a standard character arc about addiction
it was all done very well with good acting by denzel washington and kelly reilly
also good were don cheadle and john goodman who seemed to have come from a different movie
but people need to get their drugs somewhere
and how lovely was nadine velazquez
wow
but come on the addiction thing has been done to death
i dont mean to be offensive but i have seen it so many times that it bores me
i gave it a better score than it really deserved due to the cast and the production values
much as i like thrillers especially films involving planes i was disappointed in flight
this was not much of a thriller  not much suspense here
without resorting to spoilers let me simply say that i found the plot riddled with clichas and oversimplified improbable situations
in particular the ending was so banal so neatly tied into a pretty ribbon that it ruined any saving graces the film had for me
perhaps i am too cynical or too unfamiliar with the effects of alcoholism to be that sympathetic to the hero
this film left me with the feeling that it could have been much much better
nevertheless having said that kudos to some good but not stellar acting although it was hampered by unfortunately weak writing and and even weaker plot
the plane crash was the best film portrayal ive ever seen
fearful flyers be forewarned
this movies about the long spiral coming between the period when someone exceeds any limits and when he acknowledges that he needs help
a valid dramatic material not only about addiction and recovery
it shows how a decent person will do terrible things when drunk and shows the power of compulsion
in a way the storys very predictable
flight is wellmade motion picture but not funny or entertaining and offers an interesting twist in addition to raising two fascinating questions
what if the pilot had been sober would the tragedy have been worse
and conversely was it the alcoholcocaine cocktail in his blood enabling him to risk 100 people
to sum up a different kind of movie from director robert zemeckis
it is amazing to me that you can take a chunk of metal mixed in nuts and bolts and attach some engines and you can fly pristinely across the sky
more importantly are the pilots that guide these crafts through the air
flight is quite a movie it chronicles the self assured pilot whip witaker denzel washington as he takes the controls of a typical flight from orlando to atlanta
along the way the flight hits some turbulence and begins a free fall
whip keeps the calm and uses all his skills to guide the craft
the scene is riveting and i caught myself closing my eyes is it going to crash or not
after the big event the investigator come in and seek a scapegoat was the incident caused by mechanical malfunction or pilot error
this movie is full of suspense and is one hell of a ride
flight 2012 12 denzel washington kelly reilly bruce greenwood don cheadle john goodman melissa leo tamara tunie nadine velasquez garcelle beauvais justin martin
washington gives a superb performance as a barelyfunctioning alcoholic pilot whose heroic act of saving his airliner from a catastrophe leads to an criminal investigation and has him on a path of salvation or selfdestruction
with the unlikely aid from recently sober heroin addict reilly sublimely perfect a fellow traveler and questionably moral support from colleagues greenwood as an airline rep and goodman as dr
feelgood enabler washingtons troubled antihero has some stumbling blocks to overcome namely himself
craftily and cannily directed by robert zemeckis welcome back from the dead zone of motion captured animated crap and an unorthodox screenplay by john gatins incorporates stateoftheart cgi one dilly of a plane crashlanding and moral turpitude
i thought this would be about denzel washington being clean and having the crashed based on unfortunate circumstances but i was wrong
denzel is an idiot in this movie even though hes a nice guy
i loved kelly reillys character a lot and i loved the cancer patient who was only around for a few minutes
don cheadle was fantastic as a guy who does his job even though he hates his client and bruce greenwood is decent
the movie was okay at best but im happy that movies can still be made without being taken from anything
the special effects for the plane crash were just amazing though and watching it near the end was so cool
if you like denzel youll probably like this movie
this movie has a strong cast headed by one of my favorite actors
after some needless frontal nudity and lurid scenes from the drug underworld the film gets to the crash sequence that put the bodies into the theater seats
but that is the high point of this story
afterward the plot meanders around detailing the seamy excesses of its main character and doing little else until it reaches its highly unrealistic highly unsatisfying climax
i thoroughly disliked denzel washingtons character which shows i guess what a good job he did since i like the actor himself very much
but his skill isnt enough to redeem this dud of a story
halfway through the climactic scene i realized what was coming and i felt very much ripped off as though id been treated to a preachy and inferior remake of days of wine and roses
gratuitous nudity fwords and grungy bathroom scenes notwithstanding its still at bottom just a corny endorsement of alcoholics anonymous
i cannot recommend this movie
the only reason why im garnered up 4 stars for this is because of the first 30 minutes leading up to the interesting flight scenes which are really gripping and due to denzels awesome performance
i have no doubt that denzel totally rocks in acting but i really prefer him in the more action roles like training day  safe house  out of time etc
the movie takes off really well
until the flight crashes
literally
after that its total downhill
i never figured out the requirement of kelly reilly in this movie
the movie would be exactly the same without her
ok i am wrong here
the movie would be better without her
and of course the way it ends is soooo disappointing
i feel they could have done much more with this movie
if you really want to see denzels acting and waste time i suggest you wait for the dvd
a very well executed film in my opinion
acting is great from denzel don and various others later on
the realistic portrayal of the plane crash done the film a huge credit
it kept my heart out to whip until the climax
the struggle of an alcohol addiction was done out very well in this film
denzel does a great job at showing all of that and also at the climax
the film does throw in some spots of humour to balance out the bleak subject in the form of john goodman
in the end i feel the film touched on some great issues of denial blaming and addiction and shows hope through addiction
a film i would definitely watch again
i am a huge fan of denzel as i find him phenomenal in action drama horror and suspense
this one was no different
great story line and progression of the end results
it started great with a plot bar none that i am sure anyone who has flown has thought about
however i found the end abrupt that left a lot of loose ends i thought would have been great to follow through on
the main female flight attendant i felt needed following through
i get he did not want the blame pinned on her but her role in the beginning and at the funeral i felt required giving her more credit then she was given
would i watch again sure
would i have paid to see this in the theater i would have been disappointed if i had
this guy is a functioning alcoholic and he has a flight problem that causes a life problem for some of the passengers
gradually he comes to cases with his life long problem with booze and drugs
hes a gifted pilot and he gets away with his shenanigans for a long time
the reason that washington was so good at this role is because he very likely is a stoner in real life
the opening shot features a beautiful actress stark naked so thats an extra bonus
later on its another junkie chick who is there to illustrate something or other
the scene with the aa meeting makes me glad i dont attend anymore
but i still have almost 11 years
i also never operated anything but a dice layout when i was stoned so no worries there
in closing this movie is okay and i have watched it twice
fortunately it was not that memorable so watching it the second time was fairly interesting
flight forces you to view the safe crash from another perspective thats what i summarised the movie with
in the first few scenes of the movie you see a drunk pilot saving a lot of lives but still losing a few
my reaction immediately was what a great pilot saving so many souls
the movie however suddenly turns dark and forces you to view the crash from another point of view from the dead passengers
even though technically the plane was not in tiptop state and not ready to be flown the pilot wasnt in good state either
you as a viewer slowly start to realise the technical problem wasnt even the biggest problem the pilot was
as the pictures start rolling by you realise that the pilot wasnt great he wasnt good
he pulled some nice tricks to keep most passengers alive but still putting so many lives at risk is even a bigger problem
the slow realisation as you can call it is one of the strong points of this movie
even though i dont think denzel washington is one of the best actors there is he did a great job with this film
an outstanding job
i could not have been a defense attorney
i have a masters degree in theological studies so my brain is not that bad
people say i talk well enough so my speaking is not that bad either
but human nature is so amped up that i would have been in the courtroom screaming and crying and throwing things and threatening judges and prosecutors and plaintiffs and plaintiffs lying families etc
i would have lowered myself and been as bad as everybody i was judging
robert zemeckis disturbed me at the end of this movie like he didnt even in what lies beneath and it had nothing to do with denzel washington flying the plane upside down and it had nothing to do with his drinking problem
everybody around denzel washing in this movie needed something i will not preach about today
for christs sake
and i mean everybody
zemeckis gets it
mankinda isa evil
who would have thought that robert zemeckis would be capable of making a film of such emotional power
a lot of that has to do with the script and the fantastic performance by denzel washington
kelly reilly was outstanding too in her role of companion to whip
her character is compared to desdemona in an othello reference near the start of the film which is ironic as i had the pleasure of seeing her play desdemona in a production of othello in a london theatre
anyway flight is a very powerful emotional character study of a man who i would call a functioning alcoholic
the reason why i only gave this 9 instead of 10 stars is that the ending felt a bit trite
however i would highly recommend this film to anyone the flight scene was amazing and you really felt like you were on the plane about to crash
watch and enjoy this near masterpiece
flight is one of my best dramatic movies ever
this movie remind me about the nature of all human beings
which being weak and always seeking for pleasure
whip whitaker played by denzel washington an addicted pilot who find a problem in his plane which led the plane to fall
with the good judgment of captain whip he could crashes the plane in an empty field and saves many lives
however six people died cause the crash
the investigation indicated that captain whip was drunk during the flight
and he may have a life sentence
and then begin the story
the story of struggling between being in the real world or being in the unreal world
as expected from denzel washington the acting was magnificent
on the other hand i think the plot was a little bit predictable
otherwise i enjoyed with the special effects
especially in the plane scene
and i cant forget about the amazing ending
extremely i recommend this movie
after many times of trying to watch this movie i finally managed to watch the whole thing
im a robert zemeckis fan
i was really hoping this movie would measure up to his past work
it definitely through me for a loop
i was jolted by the crash scene as i found it very intense
i honestly thought that the copilot had pressed something that caused the malfunction
when i really learned what happened i was shocked
this movie however is very slow in the middle part
it seemed like it took forever to get to the ending
i kept waiting for something to happen and was annoyed
i do like this movie but its not a favorite
i thought it was thoughtprovoking  much like an action thriller should be  but tiresome after a while
i do recommend this movie but beware that youre going to have to be patient
all the bad reviews that i read are essentially written in ego maniacal fashion
all the good reviews are by people who detect the societal moral dilemma within in the film
if you are a commercial pilot and the crash is 20 minutes long do not base your entire review on the plausibility of the crash because believe or not the movies is absolutely not about that
neither is solely about his drug addiction
it seems to suggest how criminal lawsuits can be rigid to a mans story only looking at facts not giving weight to desperation versus malintent
its an audience splitter
have to write on more line to fill the requirement
from the trailer you might think this is a specialeffects laden blockbuster with a bit of court intrigue and a heroic outcome
which is great because the masses need fooling into watching what is in actual fact an intense and ultimately beautiful portrayal of one mans addiction his journey to a conclusion
washington truly does give the performance of his life
washedup slightly tubby convinced of his own lies and selfcentred his character is a hero and arch villain in one
zemeckis has directed some of the biggest movies of the past 30 years and yet this film is most closely related to one of his least commercially successful  contact  in that it takes a huge spectacular theme and surrounds it with carefully crafted stories of personal failure and spiritual success
beautiful moving and really really unexpected
im a denzels biggest fan i watched this movie with high expectations but unfortunately it was a disappointment
it contains a message for the alcoholics and the community but for me this message was presented in the most clicha way possible
the struggle with alcoholism was fascinated with a touching and mind blowing performance from denzel
the story in general was good but the ending was more like a high school essay written by a teenager to make every thing good
it was confusing for me life doesnt make sense and there is no ultimate good in it in this movie a man who was really a superhero fell into the illusion of common sense he made a very stupid decision at the end
the writer can reach to that message in a more clever outofthe box way but he the writer intentionally took a direct and a trivial approach
at the end denzels performance was amazing the plane scenes were very professional the overall storyline is ok but the ending ruined everything
this film has brought denzel back to his brilliant best after his recent below standard performances in unstoppable and safe house he plays this character like no other actor could with heart emotion and sheer sincerity goodman who doesnt appear often brings the laughs and those head nodding moments johns character is wrote similar to one he played in the big lebowski but that is definitely not a bad thing the film itself told a great tale of one mans fight to become a better person and the realism of his mistakes in life it delved deeper than i thought and showed addiction in a way that only trainspotting could rival great performances from the cast alongside a wonderfully told story makes this a must see in 2013
an excessive alcoholic pilot makes a successful plane crash and heroically saved almost all people on board
but later during investigation of that flight he starts to fight against his dark drunken nature to disprove his intoxication as the cause of crash
zemeckis is superbly back to the real mainstream world after a long era p the storyline is excellent and bears a deeper message about the prohibition of alcohol and drugs
the flightcrash scene takes too much engrossment to make thrilled p denzel washington appears again at his best
he provides a supernotched performance to play a perfect tipsy role and solely carries the plot with elegance d
i saw this with trepidation after reading the main pages review on this film of 110 not expecting much but to be honest i was most moved by it overall
yes it starts brilliantly with the plane bit and does get kind of drag in the middle but it all sort of came together at the end
quite moving and funny in places
theres an all star cast in this so you kind of expect it to be big and i wasnt disappointed hence the 710
brilliantly acted by denzel and a must see especially if youre a fan of his art
well recommended by me
enjoy
and watch out for denzels short term gf in this
shes only had bit parts in english tv and pulled off a great performance
as a 40 year professional pilot i can almost always manage to watch and enjoy any movie that involves airplanes but this debacle was so awful i couldnt make it all the way through even after trying on 3 separate occasions
the plot the acting and the script were just abysmal other than that it wasnt too terrible
at least i didnt pay money to watch this abortion
i cant understand why directors dont just go ahead and hire a professional pilot to consult when they make movies about airplanes it would be a minor expense and would help to eliminate the idiotic and embarrassing mistakes they all seem to love so much
a good performance from denzel washington as the alcoholic flight captain starts with him having a sex scene with a 10 bodied white prostitute bushy beaver and all and getting up in the morning for a couple of hits of liquor before he goes to work
unfortunately its a shitty day and his plane soon flies into a nightmarish storm and develops problems that eventually after a hairraising few minutes that might put a few million americans off flying ever again denzel is forced to fly upside down to try to rectify them
finally he wakes up alive and is rushed to hospital where horror of horrors he faces an investigation
there is a way out by blaming it his dead copilot but he does not take it and confesses to alcoholism getting a heavy prison sentence that will wreck his life
the movie is really about alcohol and not flight and the title should really be changed
a good outing by back to the future director robert zemeckis
it apparently made 60m profit
having found myself in the middle of situations created by alcoholics often during my life i found denzel washingtons portrayal of such an alcoholic spot on
from accentuating an amazing single accomplishment to the utter denial of his condition i believe he was spot on
he is such a good actor willing to play a heavy with a soft edge yet stay true to character that at times it is hard to dislike him
i truly disliked his character throughout his arrogance self satisfaction and smugness really aroused my senses
if theres a criticism its more with the formulaic plot the deck stacking the carelessness of those who surround these people
nevertheless when ones greed and other motivations play a factor they can lead to unpredictability so i guess this is forgivable
this is a movie about contrition
when one gets to the brink it can go either of two ways
decide for yourself if it works
flight is one of the better movies released this year
its a emotional movie and i think it served this movie well
the entire cast was great that you cant say for a ton of movies that have been released lately
the story its self flowed evenly thru the movie
i havent seen to many negative reviews of this movie and thats a good thing
it shows a lot of reviewers and movie goers know a good movie when they see one
for the few negative reviewers of this movie  i bet hangover 2 and transformers are movie master pieces in their eyes
and thats really sad
i hope hollywood producers and directors take more time to release movies with better storys plots and drama
its amazing a director like zemekis didnt search any help from a aviation expert to do this movie
the scenes from airplane are a all bunch of crap
this is almost unbelievable
getting full power after cutting off the engines
if the stabilizer was blocked in a full down position how did the airplane stabilized in level flight in the end
speedbrakes with no hydraulics
flaps and gear no hydraulics
performing passengers speech out of the cockpit
i dont think so
no procedures in the cockpit
no checklists
what kind of airline was that
dear zemekis there are millions of pilots with families and friends and airplane enthusiasts around the world
dont assume everybody is stupid about aviation issues
you watch movie for first 10 min and you can be sure that this movie is going to be exhilarating
a great start of the movie with denzel a heavy alcohol addict rides the plane
ride doesnt start smoothly and very soon plane develops malfunctioning and then denzel washington being the pilot of plane makes a great attempt to avoid the full crash
and being an alcoholic and drug addict how is he gonna prove that its plane malfunctioning not him responsible to the plane crash
though it gets slightly boring in the middle it makes up toward the end
other characters doesnt really make an impression and denzel steals the show
overall a great act by denzel and a treat to watch
first of all i expected an action movie with one of my favorite actors dezel forever
but i got a drama about a hero with a massive alcohol problem
the action sequence flight catastrophe is only short but nevertheless very intense
the rest is about the investigation of the flight catastrophe and about how different people handle their addictions
as i worked for some time with alcoholics i think i know a little bit about the whole subject
this said the movie is open direct and without pathos
it shows reality and denzel is wonderful as ever
therefore the 8 points
but definitely no action movie
