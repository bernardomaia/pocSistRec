"\nI have to agree with the previous reviewer. This is the best thriller\nI've seen in years. <br><br>Definitely kept me on the edge of my seat.<br><br>The writing is outstanding. All four principal actors do well and\nGyllenhaal, especially, carries the plot forward extremely well.<br><br>At the start, I feared a stock, predictable Hollywood thriller. But\nsoon I found myself en wrapped in Gyllenhaal's puzzle-within-a puzzle.<br><br>At the end, the Industry audience for this screening erupted in\nspontaneous applause.<br><br>Duncan Jones is definitely a young director to watch.<br><br>If you like thrillers, go see this film!\n"
"\nI was very fortunate to be at the World Premiere at SXSW in Austin and\nattended the Q&amp;A after with James Duncan, Vera Farmiga, Michelle\nMonaghan, Jake Gyllenhaal and Ben Ripley. The story line keeps you on\nthe edge of your seat and adds in enough humor to make it a thoroughly\nenjoyable experience. There is amazing, subtle chemistry between Jake\nand Michelle which really is the star of the film, performances by all\nthe actors are excellent. Beautiful cinematography that will make\nChicago proud. The ending brings up more questions than answers, but it\nfeels right, so that's OK with me. I am not a big sci-fi fan, but this\nfilm delivers on romance, suspense, mystery and thrills. Highly\nrecommended.\n"
"\nWhat a movie. The price is worth paying. This movie gets straight to\nthe point. You know you see a lot of movies that waste so much time\ngetting into a story. Not this film, virtually from the off, we are\nthere, in the film. It's like there is no beginning, but a middle and\nan end. Obviously you guys know the storyline so I'll not waste time\ntelling you what it is about, just go and see it. It is a film that\nkeeps you looking, you actually feel like you are 'in the source code'\nwhich is fantastic. The only downside to this film is that it feels\nshort, it was 93 minutes but it simply flies by. Maybe that is a good\nthing? Shows how good this film was!<br><br>GO CHECK IT OUT!\n"
"\nSource code is one of those few action/sci-Fi movies that work\neffectively without exaggeration or embellishment. When we see Source\nCode we see the certain resemblance it has with ''Déjà Vu'' with Denzel\nWashington but Duncan Jones, with his own talent his own style prevent\nthat from happening. Source Code has is own method and approach, which\nis quite entertaining and enjoyable. This movie is certainly\nrecommended for all the action-junkies because this has all to be a\n''Summer Hit'' which confuses me, why hasn't this opened in June or\nJuly, it had the potential and the content of an ''Summer''\nblockbuster. Jake Gyllenhaal is not your typical action hero, since but\nhe really pulls everything off really well. Michelle Monaghan and Vera\nFarmiga are both absolutely gorgeous women with talent. On the whole\nSource Code is pure entertainment at its best.\n"
"\nI was looking forward to seeing \" Source Code \" ever since I saw the\n1st trailer, and I was lucky enough to catch it in an advance\nscreening, before it officially released here, and it just exceeded my\nexpectations. this is the type of movies that will keep you interested\ntill the very ending . it's probably the best sci-fi/thriller since\nInception ! no big action scenes, no big explosions, no usage of\nunnecessary CGI, well-written story, solid performance from Mr.\nGyllenhaal ( who is now officially one of my favorite actors ) and\nanother hit from my newest favorite filmmaker Duncan Jones. don't miss\nit !\n"
"\nI can't believe just how bad the movie was. It's totally worthless at\nboth its \"action\" and at its \"meaning\" level. It's not just that the\nplot's ideas are far-fetched. They're not even consistent or logical.<br><br>E.g. how could it be possible to construct a whole parallel world from\njust memories of a handful of people? At some point we learn that \"some\npart\" of the main character's brain is \"still functioning\". It would be\nabsolutely impossible to undertake the complex cognitive tasks he does\nwith just \"some part\" of his brain. Etc, etc. <br><br>As for the \"meaning\", what was it supposed to be? That we should learn\nto care about every moment of our lives? That there exist worlds\nparallel to ours? That we should love our neighbors? Whatever it was,\nit's an utter cliché. It's hard to believe someone in Hollywood\naccepted this script. Obviously they consider viewers idiots. I hope\nthey are not right.\n"
"\nThe hole technology on which movie's story is based was conflicting\nwith the story itself so badly that it ruined the movie (even for a\nsci-fi lover as myself). And it comes in 15min.. I tried to forget that\nillogical details and enjoy the movie, but the end just \"killed\" me. If\nthe movie would end 10 minutes earlier, I would put much better vote.\nBut now the movie could be rated good only if you didn't understand the\nhole concept then comes \"wow - how nice...\", but if you follow the\nstory and have logical thinking - you'll be very disappointed. The\nacting wasn't so bad as many reviewers said, the hole story was a bit\nbanal and in such case you can't act neither brilliant neither bad.\n"
"\nThe idea is nice, it begins very mysteriously and when the general\nconcept is presented you sense there are going to be mind blowing\nthings, something like Inception perhaps. Sadly, the scientific idea is\npurely presented and the writers give too much place to romance, it\nseems like the movie tries to attract women and do so by weakening the\nsci-fi part. I hate movies that try too grab too many aspects, the\nmovie could go a little bit longer and actually build the idea of\n\"Source Code\". The romance is forced upon the story, like the writers\nwere told they had to insert love and did it wrong. To sum it up, a\ngreat concept not so greatly presented. See if you want to satisfy your\nthrill hunger.\n"
"\nI like sci-fi but sorry this is far-fetched crap. The premise is\nutterly absurd. The whole concept and story is like swiss cheese, full\nof holes. You might enjoy this movie if you are the type who doesn't\nthink much and takes everything presented on the evening news as\nabsolute and unquestionable fact. This movie is also laced with the\nfollowing recurring messages we are bombarded with daily:<br><br>The government loves you and wants to save you from any harm. Any who\nquestion the government are \"anti-government\" terrorists. Now clean cut\nboy next door looking white guys are the terrorists. The government\nalways does the right thing in the end. <br><br>Condensed version of review:<br><br>To be fair, the acting and execution are excellent. The scientific\npremise is not even remotely believable and the film is cheaply themed\nwith pro government, pro military over the top terroristic fear\nperpetuating crap.\n"
"\nA young man is caught in limbo (= in religions the state between death\nand rebirth) and used for the war against terrorism. Now, the prospect\nof somebody caught in limbo or something similar was used in \"dark\nstar\" by John Carpenter and that film showed what could be done with\nsuch a concept. This film however, is a totally different matter. Even\nbeyond death this poor soul is haunted by lackeys with the gibberish\n\"war on terror\" -bs. Nowhere it is pronounced that only the most\npowerful nation on earth could be said to engage in any terror. Of\ncourse not, because this is by no means a \"leftist\" film and instead a\nfilm for idiots. Vance Packard once wrote that the American society\ndefended the right of the businessman to seek out the morons and make\nthem still more moronic. This film seems to work along these lines. I\nhad to write this review only because the film had received such good\nrating on IMDb. This shenanigans must be stopped!\n"
"\nThis movie as far fetched as it is, wasn't THAT bad up until the last 5\nminutes or so. I love(hate)how writers throw the illogical in at the\nend to spin the whole story around. Then you get all these dumb ass\nintellectuals coming in trying to explain it. Their explanations are\nmore incoherent than the movie itself. It's a lazy version of Deja Vu.\nI would love to hear an explanation of how this guy's memory is\nincepted into Jake's head. How can he see other people and places the\noriginal guy didn't even view?? And as for parallel time lines, give me\na break, you can't possibly rationalize that... Just do yourself a\nfavor and go see something else. This movie like Inception portrays as\nan intelligent script but really just insults people's intelligence\nwith nothing but holes in the story line...\n"
"\nI would never say Source Code is a bad movie, but there are simply way\ntoo many gushing reviews - from critics and viewers alike - than this\nfilm warrants. That the film is a highly suspenseful thriller cannot be\nargued. I quite enjoyed the main character's recurring trips inside the\nsource code scenario. The problem is that the central premise of Source\nCode is implausible at best and quite possibly ludicrous. It's as if\nthe filmmakers felt that if they peel away the layers of plausibility\nvery slowly, the audience won't notice. It does seem like many viewers\neither didn't notice or didn't mind the holes. I'm willing to entertain\nthe occasional logical stretch, but when it is the film's central\npremise being stretched beyond recognition, that's when I begin to have\na problem. As much as I wanted to go along for the ride, I just\ncouldn't go all the way. By the end, the cumulative effect of all the\nliberties taken by the filmmakers became enough to bump Source Code\nfrom out of the sci-fi genre and into the fantasy world.\n"
"\nNot sure what other people are seeing in this. Within 10 minutes I had\nthe plot worked out. I very much disliked the cinematography. From the\nfirst scene with the cut aerial shots sweeping to the train and over\nthe city I did not like it. The relationship between the girl on the\ntrain and the man was ridiculous. He had more on screen time and a\nbetter relationship with the military girl. I just thought it was not\nvery good, boring shots very like good TV, very little drama. I do not\nunderstand the people on the edge of there seats comments. A 6 film,\nnot awful but it felt like payola to me. The studio must be delighted\nto have somehow gotten away with it.\n"
"\nI had heard a couple of very good reviews of Source Code, but must\nconfess to being slightly disappointed with it myself.<br><br>Source Code tells the story of a Colter Stevens who is placed onto a\ntrain that is about to be blown up in 8 minutes. Colter Stevens takes\non another persons identity when he is placed on the train. He must\nsolve the crime in order that a follow up crime can be averted. He is\nrepeatedly placed back on the train to see if he can work out who is\nbehind the plot.<br><br>Maybe I'm a bit too old to buy into a plot like this, so consequently I\ncould never warm to the film. I am a big fan of Jake Gyllanhaal and he\ncan't be faulted for his performance in Source Code. The same can also\nbe said for Michelle Monaghan who certainly brightens the mood as his\ngirlfriend on the train. The interplay between the two leads certainly\nbears comparison with a similar situation in Groundhog Day.\n"
"\nWhile \"Source Code\" does have an interesting concept idea and is\nentertaining enough, it just didn't stand out as being exceptional or\nmemorable. The movie is solid enough for a single viewing, and that is\nabout it. Once viewed for the first time, I doubt that anyone will make\na second return to the movie.<br><br>The story is about a soldier named Colter Stevens (played by Jake\nGyllenhaal) who is part of a military experiment where he is sent back\nto thwart a train bombing. However, he only has eight minutes in the\npast each time he is sent back through the Source Code.<br><br>There are some interesting aspects to the movie and some complex ideas.\nAs such, the movie does well as a thriller and provides good\nentertainment. It is the type of movie that you quickly immerse\nyourself into.<br><br>The acting was good and people were doing good jobs with their given\nroles and characters. And they had cast some good talents for the\nvarious characters.<br><br>It is just a shame that the movie doesn't have enough contents to\nsustain more than a single viewing.\n"
"\nThis was one of the worst movies I've seen in the last few years. It\nwas contrived and wholly unbelievable, even for Sci-Fi. The story\nseemed to be written by a hyper active, overly-intelligent 7th grader.\nIt was just FULL of holes throughout. The acting wasn't bad, but\nnothing spectacular. I can usually sit through just about anything and\nfind SOME redeeming quality about it, but not this one. For all the\nhype this movie received before release, and still does, it failed SO\nhard to live up to it. I found myself checking my phone a few times\nthroughout the movie just wanting it to be done so I could go do\nsomething worthwhile with my time, but it just went on and on and got\nmore and more stupid as the minutes crawled by. Even my wife, who's a\nhuge Gyllenhal fan, was blasting this stinker as we were leaving the\ntheater.<br><br>If you don't like ANY thought put into your Sci-Fi movies, this is a\nmovie for you. If you like your stories to follow ANY kind of logic,\nskip this and go see, well, just about anything else.\n"
"\nI love movies that make you think, and Source Code will do that, the\nproblem is, that what you're thinking is probably what's going to\nhappen. This film is a take on the TV show Quantum Leap, but instead of\nleaping until the issue is solved, the leaper only has 8 minutes to try\nand solve the problem. Jake Gyllenhaal stars and while I usually don't\ncare for him much, he was excellent here. I have a feeling this\ncharacter may have been written specifically for him, because he's got\na strange style and seems to not fit many of his roles. Source Code is\nanother film in a genre of endless possibilities, it tries really hard\nto stand out and be special, but sadly it's pretty predictable, while\nplaying off other established material, such as Quantum Leap and The\nMatrix. It is an enjoyable film and one of Gyllenhaal's best\nperformances that i've seen, but if you're into Science Fiction, the\nway that I am, you're not gonna have much trouble figuring this one\nout.\n"
"\nI'll try and keep this spoiler free so people who are thinking of\nwatching this can get a good idea about it.<br><br>But, this review is simple. It's been done before! If anyone has\nwatched star trek or most any other television sci-fi, you will guess\nthis plot in the first 5 minutes as I did. You probably won't be able\nto predict the ending as there is a decent twist. However, the ending\ntwist I'd say kind of ruins the \"moving\" aspect of the movie as well\nand just makes it even more kind of bland. But, now that I say that if\nthe movie had ended in another way I probably would have thought it\njust even more typical and over done.<br><br>It's enjoyable, but only if you have something better to see or haven't\nwatched a lot of sci fi before and don't get the plot in the first 5\nminutes.\n"
"\nThis film could had been great. I think the story is decent, the plot\nwell crafted (just don't think about it too much :)) and it relies more\non acting and human interaction, than mindless action. It has it's\nflaws, but they are not as nearly irritating as the \"war on terrorism\"\nand Afghanistan war hero BS. It feels like the government and it's\nagencies own Hollywood. You know what? If you are a true American\nsoldier, you will serve your country after you die... If you block this\npart out of your mind, you may enjoy this film. If they were conducting\nthe source code experiment at a university and they used a man, who\nlet's say offered his body for scientific purposes, I would give this\nfilm a 7. But I can't overlook the annoying propaganda, so it's a 5.\n"
"\nFirst of us i have to say this is a brilliant stuff! Hollywood people\nhave mastered the art of concept based movies. This one is a great\ntestimony to their skills. This is easily the best movie of 2011 so far\nand a real thriller after inception.<br><br>The protagonist is the captain who is killed in a mission in\nAfghanistan but his body is recovered and it is used to accomplish a\nmission through the help of program loop called source code.<br><br>Some concepts used are programming, afterlife, quantum physics,\npsychology. But all are brilliantly combined to give a surreal\nexperience. It is a fast paced flick so there is no chance of getting\nbored at any stage. This is a good one. Definitely worth of your time!\n"
"\nMaybe it's just because I was tired, cranky and my date cancelled\n(bummer), but I thought Source Code was nowhere near as good as Moon,\nDuncan Jones' debut. Sure, it's an interesting premise, and Jake\nGyllenhaal finally proves he can stand his ground as a lead in an\naction feature, but it had to deal with a bit of a credibility problem.\nAlso, as I have a bit of a 'celeb crush' on her, I think Vera Farmiga's\ncharacter came across slightly underdeveloped; you just didn't get to\nknow anything about her. But yeah, great visuals, good camera work. Not\na bad sophomore effort, but it did have some big shoes to fill. I'll\nrewatch it in a better mood.\n"
"\nInitially I thought this film was your typical action movie, but I\nheard some really great things about it so I went and watched it\nanyway... Little did I know, film reviewers sometimes tend to have\nquite bad taste. Let me clarify - it wasn't a HORRIBLE movie. It just\nwasn't great. Jake Gyllenhall and Vera Farmiga are good in this movie,\nbut their performances didn't exactly blow me away. (Pun definitely not\nintended) The film was almost comically patriotic and extremely\nclichéd. Also, there are some pretty major plot holes - assuming that\nI've understood the whole premise correctly. Like why he can leave the\ntrain for example? I think my problem was that I had high expectations\nfor Source Code and it just didn't quite live up to them. As a sci-fi /\naction film with it's pretty good.\n"
"\nI have watched this movie now because I'm scheduling a thematic\nchannel.<br><br>Does science have no feelings? Love conquers all?<br><br>Jake Gyllenhaal is in his best. And... what can I say... I love\nMichelle (her welsh surname too).<br><br>I love films where reality is not what it seems. And it seems a fast\npaced thriller but I think that this falls under the genre of Hard\nScience-Fiction. The best is that it forces you to think, as\nInterestellar.<br><br>The only 'But...' is that certain times of the script are slaughtered\nto the thriller tension. However the end result is powerful and moving.\nHighly recommended.\n"
"\nSource Code is a science-fiction mystery film set in modern day Chicago\nand a government facility in an unknown place. This is one of those\nmovies that will make you think hard trying to figure out what is\nreality and what isn't. Unless you pay close attention to what's\nhappening, you can easily get confused and lost. It is thus somewhat\ncomparable to The Matrix and Inception. As you might expect, the sci-fi\naspect of this film was totally ridiculous, unrealistic and\nunscientific. The mystery or whodunit aspect could've been more\nsuspenseful and could've used some twists and turns to keep you\nguessing. If you watch carefully, it is fairly obvious near the\nbeginning of the movie who the bomber was. Overall, this is an above\naverage sci-fi film that is worth watching.\n"
"\nDuring the first 45 mins of the movie I remember uttering the words\n\"This movie is annoying.\" The constant going back to the scene of the\ntrain was just getting very repetitive and reminded me of another awful\nmovie called \"Vantage Point.\" Also, nothing more annoying than the\nflirting in the middle of the mission. I think once he was able to find\nthe bomber, the rest of the movie became bearable and actually\nexciting. I just don't get the end though. So do the people in the\ntrain survive? Isn't that against the quantum physics parabolic\ncalculus thingy? And if he does get to survive, does he live the rest\nof his life as that other character. Quite frankly this movie is not\nworth any of my brain cells contemplating on the ending. I think a 6\nout of ten rating is just due.\n"
"\nA guy wakes up from slumber on a train. Startled to the bone - as he\nwasn't on the train in his previous memory - he quickly attempts to\nmake sense of what is happening. Failing miserably at that he ends up\nin the biggest surprise of his life.<br><br>Films like this work best when there's little to no knowledge of what\nis going on before seeing them so I'm not going to say anything more\nabout the story. Suffice it to say that it's a thriller in most senses\nand that it puts together the tag lines of various other films - in all\nthe best ways. It's also biased towards science fiction - without the\naliens - and again done in a good way.<br><br>It's no work of art and doesn't leave a mark on the mind, but it's a\nfun way of spending an hour and a half and well worth the cinema time -\nhigh speed, captivating story and nicely acted.<br><br>7 out of 10 odd events getting odder by the minute\n"
"\none of the best sci fi movies I've seen in recent years,i may be a bit\nlate to watch it but its totally worth the 2 hours.<br><br>duncan jones is known for his past critically acclaimed movie moon.<br><br>cool concept with pretty cool story and casting..every one gave their\nbest performance even though its not necessary in a film like\nthis.music is good.this film does not lack in any aspect.<br><br>ending of the movie steals the show.this movie deals with emotion in a\ndifferent way.each and every characterization is designed in a\napp-laudable manner.<br><br>if you like sci fi movies like edge of tomorrow,minority report etc\nthen this movie is ur best choice.\n"
"\nJake Gyllenhaal fleshes out the characters he portrays, and rightfully\nmakes it his own. Whether it's Donnie Darko or Zodiac, he ups the ante.\nThis is absolutely the case in Source Code. Think Groundhog Day meets\nthe best sci-fi you can think of. Gyllenhaal is Colter Stevens, a\nsoldier who's forced to use the Source Code: repeating a real-life\ntrain journey to Chicago, and its eventual explosion and the death of\neveryone on board. His mission is to find the bomb and its detonator.\nThe investigation's only half the hoot. On the train opposite Stevens\n(who's in someone else's body on the train) is Christina (Michelle\nMonaghan), a beautiful, down-to-earth woman that knows the person\nStevens has 'taken over'. Colter's subconscious actions bring them\ncloser together, but is it a relationship destined to fail the moment\nhe enters the Source Code? Only 8 minutes of time will tell, as\ndirector Duncan Jones successfully balances romance (or not\ntime-travelling) with heart-stopping action.\n"
"\nLet me start by saying, I didn't mean to see \"Source Code\". It was one\nof those films I red about and thought I might see them one day, but it\nwas sheer accident I ended up seeing it. And despite some plot holes I\nenjoyed it. The acting is first class, Gyllenhaal is repeating his\nPrince of Persia role, so much so I could call the earlier movie a\nspoiler for this one, but that's all I'm going to say on the subject.\nProblem is this film is almost impossible to speak about without adding\nspoilers. I can say the pacing was perfect, I can say it's an action\nsci-fi (many scientist will debate this) in which most of the action is\npsychological. I could add a special commendation for Vera Farmiga\nwhose role is much harder than most of the others on the film and she\nstill performs superbly, but truth is that's all I can say without\nadding a spoiler.<br><br>So here is the bottom line, despite the mentioned plot holes, the movie\nworks and that's what matters.\n"
"\nI was told about Source Code by a friend of mine who was psyched about\nit. So I decided to give it a try. I was expecting a usual action\npacked thriller with not much of a storyline. But, what I saw was a\nvery well scripted, intellectually challenging movie with not too much\naction. I actually had to watch it again to get the full gist of it.\nThe story revolves around a soldier played by Jake Gyllenhaal who did\nfull justice to his role. This might be his best performance after\nDonnie Darko and Brokeback Mountain.<br><br>Source Code, being a science-fiction, had some non-explainable facets\nto it. But, the writer did his best to keep things clear and not make\nit too complicated. It may probably not win an Oscar next year,\nnevertheless, it is the best thriller this year and deserves to be\nwatched at least once.\n"
"\nIs source code cloud computing?.<br><br>Movie uses 1)processing power of colter, 2)8 minutes memory of a victim\nand 3)a software to run these \" the source code\". I think the director\ncould have got more memory instead of opting for free 8 minutes trial\nversion. May be he wasn't sure if it would sell Instead of Jake, the\nprocessing power could also be outsourced to an Indian company. That\nwould be a cost saver and definitely better performer. Instead of SW\nsource code they could run \" April fool\" but it is already may. Also\nthere has been quiet a bit of illogical stuff happening here and there.\nFor example, the hero is in the memory of someone who is dead. But how\ncan he do stuff which the dead hasn't done. I guess like in i ROBOT\nthere is a limit of a dead mind. You can access the stored information\nbut not create something new saying parallel universe. If I can imagine\nsomething, that does not create a parallel universe. If u alter an\nevent in past or future only then a parallel one is created\n"
"\nThis film was possibly the most confusing and contradictory I ever saw.<br><br>I was confused from the start and it did not get much clearer as the\nfilm continued.<br><br>Cpt Colter Stevens awakes with a shudder on a train which explodes\nseconds later and he has to keep going back to the last eight minutes\nto discover the identity of the bomber.<br><br>But the bomber has to be able to see both trains at once and as he gets\noff the train earlier up the line, the baddie could n't possibly see\nboth trains at once. It does not make sense at all. And the mobile\nphones are also confused.<br><br>Vera Famiga and Michelle Monighan are very good. But the ending is\nsilly. The teacher should be in the final scene with Christine, not\nColter.<br><br>Silly, badly thought through and a politically correct Afghanistan sub\nplot and message.<br><br>Avoid .....\n"
"\nI don't know if you're watching the same movie as me (reviewers with\nvote 8,9,10) , but i can review this movie only one word --&gt; boring.<br><br>I can't agree with that kind rating 8,9,10 of this movie.<br><br>Although the director did a great job and the publishers also.<br><br>Special effects are 10/10.<br><br>Sound &amp; Music is 10/10.<br><br>The plot is interesting for 15 min. than it becoming monotonous and the\nend is a mind manslaughter of innocent history teacher for \"better\"\negoist cause. <br><br>No , this movie doesn't appeal to me.\n"
"\nFirst: As an IT Professional, the title \"Source Code\" is a misnomer.<br><br>Second: To anyone who was a fan of \"Quantum Leap\" - like I was - this\nmovie comes dangerously close to that .. minus the 8 minute criteria.<br><br>Third: The technology explained in the movie was a total white-wash of\nwhat is remotely feasible. The concept of retaining the soul\npost-mortem and basically drafting it into military service doesn't add\nup.<br><br>Fourth: We the people are tired of seeing good ol' WASPie Americans,\nthe kind that are least likely to be racially profiled, now becoming\nthe poster children for anti-US, domestic terrorism in the name of\n\"Patriotism\".<br><br>Last: The movie yields more questions than it entertains - a bad thing!\nIt ends up painting itself into a time paradox (where if he goes back\nin time to fix 1 thing, what effect did that fix have in the future? is\nit the same future or an alternate? .. and so on) - a worse thing!\nOverall 2/10. Good actors, weak plot, terrible storyline\n"
"\nI watched this movie hoping for a nice thriller with a few sci-fi\nelements. <br><br>I worked out who the bomber was (my girlfriends first guess!) in the\nfirst few minutes. <br><br>I worked out the lead role was already dead within the first 15\nminutes. <br><br>It was obvious that the woman opposite him on the train was the love\ninterest from the first scene she was in.<br><br>It was obvious the bomb was in the toilet air vent.<br><br>The explanation (when it finally arrived) was incoherent and made no\nsense, even if what they were saying was possible. <br><br>So I spent an enjoyable half hour doing the crossword and waited for\nthis poorly crafted, badly executed boring movie to end. <br><br>It carried on. <br><br>It went on for a lot longer. <br><br>It got to the twist.... oh wait I already figured that out at the\nbeginning. <br><br>It ended. <br><br>I was happy then. <br><br>Please Hollywood, if you can't be bothered with the science, just stick\nto the fiction.\n"
"\nI can't quite understand why this movie is getting some rave reviews -\nit is absolutely terrible. Very predictable and an ending that is so\nridiculous that my 4 year old daughter could have thought up something\nmore interesting. Very average acting and found myself dozing off to\nsleep after ten minutes of watching this utter garbage. If only it were\ntrue and the source code were to be applied to my own life - then I\ncould go back in time and choose another movie to watch. Worst movie\nthis year by far - and to think that it scores so highly in Rotten\nTomatoes!<br><br>Don't waste your time or money :(\n"
"\nI am such a big fan of this guy's movies. When was the last time I\nwatched a movie that Jake featured and wasn't good? I cannot remember.\nAlthough \"Source Code\" is not my favorite, i found it to be really\nentertaining. In this film, Jake Gyllenhaal is a soldier that wakes up\nin someone else's body and through an experiment by the government, he\nhas got 8 minutes to find the bomber in a train. When the bomb goes off\nand Stevens finds himself in the pod again. He is sent back another\ntime, yet still cannot find out anything. This sequence is repeated\nover and over again, until he is able to complete the mission, cause if\nhe does, he is in in fact, changing the reality of today. A little bit\nlike what happens in back to the future 2. The movie has tension,\ndrama, and has an uncertain ending. All of it make for a movie that may\nnot have you on the edge of your seat, but that is intense enough to\nmake you alert until the end.\n"
"\nI started watching this film without knowing anything about it except\nthat it was in the sci-fi genre. I'm glad of that because having seen\nit I feel that's the best way to approach this film, although I know\nfrom experience that most people like to know a little more than just\nthe genre.<br><br>This is the first time I've rated any film a 10, so that speaks for\nitself.<br><br>All I can say is, if you're looking for NEW ideas and like intelligent\nsci-fi, then take a look at Source Code.<br><br>Cheers and happy viewing.\n"
"\nSource Code i did enjoy and it's also worth of time to watch this movie\nas a fan of sci-fi this is movie however little similar to tom cruise\nmovie Edge of Tomorrow but i like this one much in movie you can see\nhow there is a science stuff who is sending back to a caption to\nexplore the person who did bomb explode in train he got 8 min to find\nthat when he failed he sent back again well with a view angle of\nscience maybe it's possible to force someone to think about it's past\nvery deeply with some science machine i understand when it's go behind\ntime not really just with his brain amazing movie at all when men\nchange the future and stop to being explosion however it is not\npossible but it's give very amazing end like Happy end but i don't know\nthey did change some science that is not possible but it gives movie a\ngood end and well it's all about entertainment so it's Good to give end\nlike this nice movie at all\n"
"\nColleen Goodwin (Vera Farmiga) and Dr. Rutledge (Jeffrey Wright)\noperate an experimental program where they insert Colter Stevens (Jake\nGyllenhaal) into the last 8 minutes of somebody's life to investigate\nthe cause of a train explosion. He searches for the bomber's identity\nand falls in love with one of the passengers, Christina Warren\n(Michelle Monaghan).<br><br>There is a Groundhog Day feel to this, but it works quite well. They\nall feel a little bit differently. As for logic or believability of the\npremise, it's best not to dwell on it. The more you dwell, the more\nproblems you'll find. It's better to let the thriller take over. The\nother good thing is Jake Gyllenhaal and Michelle Monaghan. They have\ngood chemistry. This is a solid thriller.\n"
"\nFor its second feature, Duncan Jones chose to remain faithful to a\ngenre he seems particularly fond of : science fiction. And what's great\nabout the English director is that he doesn't rely on a pompous,\nmuddled science fiction, piling up information, it's always relatively\neasy to understand and that's one of his strength.<br><br>He proves it once again with Source Code, which plot is clear and\ninteresting, very well executed, dynamic and directed in a very sober\nand efficient way. Jake Gyllenhaal, probably one of the best actors of\nhis generation, is impeccable, accurate from start to finish, even\nthough his character didn't seem to allow him to give his best.<br><br>Although the movie is overall good, the happy ending (imposed by the\nstudio ?) is a bit of a letdown, it feels too contrived, especially\ncompared to the frozen instant in the train that would have perfectly\nconcluded the story.\n"
"\nNot a bad film, not going to be a long review because it's quite simple\nHollywood stuff with a little extra hot sauce<br><br>It was OK, the action was good, the story was interesting enough, It\nplays with alternative realities, the cinematography in parts (like the\nexplosions) was good The acting was OK but there's nothing really\nstandout about the film.<br><br>The only real problem with it was that they tried to make it have a\nhappy ending, but that ending happened in a parallel universe, so\nwasn't really real, but I suppose that's better than no happy ending<br><br>meh, actually it was better than meh, but only a bit\n"
"\nSpoiler alert: this movie isn't about actual source code. That being\nsaid, it's an interesting take on the time-travel idea. It's not that\nbig on the 'thriller' aspects, but it makes up for that with a great\ncast. Seriously, Gyllenhaal and Farmiga work perfectly, and Monaghan is\nalso a great female lead (though this movie doesn't pass the Bechdel\nTest). I wasn't a big fan of Jeffery Wright, and I felt he could have\nbeen cast better.<br><br>My favorite shot in the film is towards the end and consists of a slow\npan through the train while everyone is frozen in place. It's wonderful\nto watch and quite amazing to think about. One of the only downfalls of\nthe movie was how they ended with Gyllenhaal's character. It made it\nseem like he was in two realities at once, but somehow those realities\nwere the same. That bit needed fixing, but other than that it's a good\nfilm.\n"
"\nSource Code is the love child of Groundhog's Day and Mission\nImpossible. A time traveling Jake G seeks time sensitive information\nthat could save millions of American lives from a terrorist.<br><br>The best part of this story is the fact that NO attempt is made to\nexplain how this time traveling mission is happening. Short of the\nwriters confessing, \"we have no idea, just go with it...\" we get a\ngeneric time travel equation: comatose Jake G torso + life support +\ncomputers + complicated math + government = time travel mission. Like I\nsaid, \"we don't really know\" would have been fine.<br><br>Inspite of the fact that no one really knows how this is happening\nSource Code is entertaining. We get a fast moving plot, a who-dunnit\nmission, and a nice romance to keep you engaged in the story. Jake G\nand Michelle M also kiss each other a few times so that is nice.<br><br>So if you'd like to get lost in multiple realities and travel through\ntime while watching trains explode numerous times, this IS the movie\nfor you!\n"
"\nI was very fortunate to be at the World Premiere at SXSW in Austin and\nattended the Q&amp;A after with James Duncan, Vera Farmiga, Michelle\nMonaghan, Jake Gyllenhaal and Ben Ripley. The story line keeps you on\nthe edge of your seat and adds in enough humor to make it a thoroughly\nenjoyable experience. There is amazing, subtle chemistry between Jake\nand Michelle which really is the star of the film, performances by all\nthe actors are excellent. Beautiful cinematography that will make\nChicago proud. The ending brings up more questions than answers, but it\nfeels right, so that's OK with me. I am not a big sci-fi fan, but this\nfilm delivers on romance, suspense, mystery and thrills. Highly\nrecommended.\n"
"\nWith MOON, Duncan Jones created an interesting sci-fi premise based on\nsome vague, implausible science and used it to explore questions of\nidentity and free will. Here, he does the same thing, but the emphasis\nis more on the vague, implausible science and less on the\ncharacter-based struggles. So, when the science starts getting more and\nmore complicated and making less and less sense, it's a problem. I\ndidn't really care how Jake Gyllenhaal was doing these things or what\nthe scientific implications are, except that the movie kept trying to\nmake me care about them. I liked the suspense and action of the first\nhour, and the more emotional route the film takes in the last part. But\nall this silly science kept getting in the way, leading to an\nunsatisfying ending that has little to do with the humanity of the\nstory. I should also note that even though MOON was derivative in a lot\nof ways, this felt less original to me. It is a mildly enjoyable\nentertainment, well-crafted and refreshingly brief. But none of it\nreally lingers with me, and the cast is entirely lackluster.\n"
"\nTo break this movie down, it takes elements of Ground Hog Day and\ncombines them with Avatar. In order to spoil it a bit, there is a\nsecret project called Source Code where a disabled nearly dead\nserviceman can be put into a capsule. Then their mind can be used to\nkeep going back to a tragic event and figure out how it happened. Then\nthey can go back one more time and stop it and change history.<br><br>While this stuff has been done before, the production, the cast Stars:<br><br>Jake Gyllenhaal, Michelle Monaghan and Vera Farmiga and a nice twisting\nending make it a nice diversion from reality for 94 minutes. Ben\nRipley's script does a nice job on this with Moon's Director Duncan\nJones pacing the story just right.<br><br>It is not a great film, but it is more entertaining than many. The\nsource code is kind of a DNA of life that can rewrite history. Nicely\ndone...\n"
"\nI dug Source Code. For one thing, it was a sort of funky take on the\nquestion of Free Will; that there's a discernible \"afterimage\" to\nevents, of which the crux can be derived as a kind of source code; and\nthat the compiling and running of that source code can produce multiple\npossible specific outcomes. As with Groundhog Day, Colter is very much\nthe Random Factor in that program. The one truly free man! I enjoyed it\nvery much. The surprising thing was that, \"gimmicky\" though it might\nbe, it develops the storyline around the gimmick with aplomb and even a\nkind of verve; the writing is excellent.<br><br>The backstory; of an ultra high-tech anti-terrorist program; at first\nsort of put me off. But I came to realize this movie was not a peon to\nrarefied, big-ticket technologies designed to save America from a\ncomeuppance. It seems to transcend that, and so redeems itself on this\npoint.<br><br>Anyway, watch and enjoy!\n"
"\nThis film was really good I thought the acting is there and so is the\nscript both well done. The only criticism of the script I would say is\nthe theme it has been done before with 'minority reports' with Tom\nCruise and 'Dejavu'with Denzel Washington that's why I only gave it\n7/10, but still definitely worth watching. Duncan Jones pulls an\nexcellent script together- top producer and Jake Gyllenhaal and\nMichelle Monaghan are both good actors and play their parts well in the\nfilm. The ending is really good as you don't expect Jake to review back\nto the team an 'addition' to what the source code can achieve I thought\nit was a good turn. I would imagine there will be a 2nd source code\nbeing produced soon I think it will work as the ending was left un-\nanswered and open.\n"
"\nWOW, just wow. This is probably the best film I've watched in the last\ndecade. I love this film, I love it more than Avatar, I love it more\nthan Dodgeball and I love it more than Hot fuzz. It was a gripping,\nintense and a epic thrill ride throughout.<br><br>The characters were lovable, and you could feel for them, the acting\nwas brilliant from start to finish, when they stop the train from\nexploding everyone in the cinema cheered, and a few where crying,\nincluding me!<br><br>I have NEVER connecting with characters as much as I did in source code\nbecause (almost) every 8 minutes all of them died, over and over and\nover!<br><br>I gave this film a ten because I can't find any faults with it!<br><br>(I watched Source code in the cinema without 3D or IMAX)\n"
"\nIt's rare to see such a fast paced, compact, and beautifully woven\nmovie these days. While the plot device is out there (it is sci-fi,\nafter all), the movie offers just enough explanation to satisfy the\nhard core techies without bogging the whole movie down. I was on the\nedge of my seat the entire time, wondering what will happen in the next\n8-minute loop to the main character. Jake Gyllenhaal and the rest of\nthe cast did a great job here humanizing the characters and making this\na movie more about the people than the background or the mission.<br><br>This movie would have been a 10/10 if only the ending were a bit\nbetter. As it stands, it is a feel good ending, but if it ended 5\nminutes earlier at that crucial scene on the train (for those of you\nwho have seen it, you know exactly the moment I'm taking about), I\nthink this would have been a perfect film.\n"
"\nI'll be honest - I only really went to see this film because of Jake\nGyllenhaal. I knew a bit about the film but if it wasn't for him I\nprobably would not have went the cinema to see it. However, I am so\nglad that I did!! <br><br>This film is amazing and completely worth watching. It is a bit\nconfusing at first but it all makes sense once it goes along. Some\npeople may get a bit bored of it I think but those are people who are\ntoo impatient to really understand what a real, decent film is.<br><br>I would highly recommend that anyone who is deciding whether or not to\ngo and see it does; you will most likely love it. I can't wait for it\nto come out on DVD so I can buy it and watch it again. Best movie I\nhave seen in a while!!\n"
"\nIt's an amazing well planned movie with a good twist. Keeps you at the\nedge of your sit every minute. I've really enjoyed it and frankly and I\ndon't understand what's the guys problem below me is, stop nitpicking\nat every detail, god.<br><br>The plot feels fine and balanced, the characters have good world\nsubmission and it feels as if you're on the train as well, experiencing\nit. The only thing that bugged me is that there was too much dialog, I\nalready knew what was happening or what the character/s were talking\nabout. Overall a very well balanced sci-fi thriller.<br><br>I recommend you to see this movie as soon as possible, it will give you\na nice ride to the limits of your imagination!\n"
"\n'Source Code' is a enjoyable sci-fi adventure about time travel. The\nfilm just has a few characters and two locations, but it has a good\nrhythm and the actors do a good work.<br><br>However, the film has some important flaws. First at all, it remembers\nto much to 'Groundhog Day' (1993) in some parts. When the main\ncharacter tries to do everything perfect at the end, it's impossible\nnot to thing in the Bill Murray's character.<br><br>Second, the happy end doesn't work. This film is a good thriller and a\ninteresting sci-fi story, but the end is just a fairy tale.<br><br>Finally, all the story is about how the hero survives his own dead. But\nthe main character is usurping some else body! He is 'killing' somebody\nand stealing his life to survive. And he falls in love with a girl who\nreally doesn't know. Actually, she is not in love with him - is in love\nwith the man whose body is possessed by the main character. She is\ntricked to love him! In conclusion, it's an entertaining film but with\nsome important flaws.\n"
"\nI was looking forward to watching this after seeing another Jake\nGyllenhaal movie but I have to admit I was disappointed. Gyllenhaal\nputs in a good performance as the hero of this Sci-Fi mystery but the\nfilm itself didn't live up to expectations.<br><br>The premise of the plot is perfectly good - a man is sent back in time\nto the scene of a train-crash to work out whodunnit. The problem is a)\nyou never feel like Gyllenhaal's character is put in any real danger\n(this is not an edge-of-the-seat number) and b) the mystery proves\nremarkably easy to resolve when he actually puts his mind to it. There\nis so much more they could have done with the plot to make things more\ninteresting.<br><br>The movie is partially redeemed by a sub-plot in which Gyllenhaal tries\nto uncover the truth behind the motives of the people he is working for\n- this adds a bit of interest. But the fact is that without\nGyllenhaal's performance, Source Code would be seriously mediocre. As\nit is, it's OK.\n"
"\nWell acted, well directed, good character development. Although\nrepeating the train journey several times, it was not repetitive, as\neach time, the movie explored more of the mystery/puzzle surrounding\nthe circumstances of the main character and the reason for the train\njourney.<br><br>The plot revolves around the idea of being able to reconstruct from the\nmemories of the deceased, the last 8 minutes of what they experienced -\nand injecting this into someone else's brain, so that they experience\nan 'interactive' environment. While improbable, when this sort of thing\nturns up in a movie, its called science fiction.<br><br>The only problem is the ending. Ihe main character is terminated at the\nend of a train journey sequence, and he then goes on living in an\nalternative time line. While this is a nice ending, it is not\nexplained, even within the bounds of science fiction, leaving a\ndissatisfied taste at the end. 7/10\n"
"\nThe dialog is a bit too cheesy at most parts. It is cringe-worthy, very\npoor screen writing, but overall the story is fascinating,\nunpredictable and original. Like with Moon, director Duncan Jones\nbrings up very interesting food for thought. There are some REAL heavy\nethical points here, but the film never dives into any depth with them.\nI felt there was so much more to explore with source code, and it would\nhave been very rewarding if the the film was about 30- 40 minutes\nlonger and ventured into some of the issues that the film only\nscratched the surface of. I felt the film barely had time to handle the\nfast-paced surface aspect of the story. The acting and action of the\nfilm was spot-on, though I wish the film would have had a different\nending. Overall, Source Code is a great film, but had the potential to\nbe something absolutely amazing like Moon was.\n"
"\nThis movie seemed to tell a story about stimulation, but contained so\nmany faults that watching it was like watching the director and the\nwriter slapping their own faces. And if they failed to cover up their\nlie, then it's not audiences' job to invent explanations for them.<br><br>Plus, parallel worlds wouldn't explain this story well either. I mean,\nif we copy exact the same world from yesterday, what are the odds that\nit grows into what we have today? Let alone pointing out the murder.<br><br>Put aside these logical faults, let's take a look at the end of the\nstory. If it ended right at when they kissed and and the whole world\nfroze, then I would think this movie as some fairy tale and forgive it\nfor trying to insult my intelligence. But nooooooo, it continued to\ntorture me, and I'm really glad when it finally ended.\n"
"\nThis is a film that defies genre labels. It's not a time travel film,\nbut it does seem to be able to change the recent past. It's a unique\nblend of science fiction and thriller, with a little bit of romance\nthrown in. For me the connection between Colter and Christina really\nclicked and made me want more of these two characters. I've seen some\nreviews that panned the ending as being unnecessary, but after the\nstunning revelation a little more than midway through, they had to\nprovide more of a kick in the pants for the end. Definitely worked for\nme. Towards the end, it seemed it would end with Colter dying in a\nvirtual reality fairy tale, and Goodwin throwing her career away to\nmake it happen. But we then get left with a completely altered reality\nthat actually works. I enjoyed this immensely.\n"
"\nI enjoyed this Sci-Fi based movie, it was a great idea and an\nentertaining, gripping watch.<br><br>Source Code is about a military used piece of software, that takes a\nperson and patches into their brain and ability to allow the\nre-entering into any 8 minutes of the past. The US government is using\nthis as part of their ant-terrorist program, using a soldier to execute\na mission to find who bombed a Chicago train.<br><br>I am not a Gylenhall fan but he is great in this, leading extremely\nwell with a pleasing ensemble support cast. It is very Bond/Bourne like\nin its action momentum and pacing and delivers all it should. It does\nwell to portray the frustrations, emotion and high level concept. It\nreminded me of a less impressive Deja Vu and the excellent Butterfly\nEffect. <br><br>The film is solid, impressive and will leave mixed reactions to the\nending but all in all a top ten movie of 2011.\n"
"\nAn enjoyable movie to watch, thoroughly enjoyed it, excellent concept,\nreally captures the imagination, actively engaged me emotionally with\nthe main character. Other characters lacked depth though. <br><br>A few little \"niggly\" things that just didn't make sense, could have\nbeen better tied up with more attention to detail. <br><br>For example, when he returned to the loop the scene was shown of the\nducks on the lake next to the train going past, he would never have\nseen it from that angle, nor would anyone on the train.. didn't make\nsense to me.<br><br>There were a few things scientifically that my mind was hooked \"how?\"\nbut these questions weren't adequately answered. <br><br>Nonetheless, a good movie. <br><br>And this is probably not so much a review, but more a critical analysis\nof what could be improved.<br><br>Feels like it could be adapted to be the first in a series, but that\nmight be better suited to TV..\n"
"\nThis movie had a lot going for it; excellent performance from Jake\nGyllenhaal, at times superb pacing and most of all it truly works with\nwhat it got. That being said i think the character development for a\nmovie with a premise such as this is borderline insanely well executed.\nI really liked writing right up to the end.<br><br>So why the \"low\" rating? It's all down to the fact that the ending is\nridiculous is any intellectual sense of the word. I know a lot of\npeople praised the ending as \"asking fundamental questions deep enough\nto rival inception.\" the ending is insulting to our intelligence and\nthough it claims \"quantom physics\" to it's favor, it never feels\nthought through or even logical in that premise. Long sentence there...<br><br>So, bottom line, I felt cheated after seeing this one. The worst part\nwas that it felt doomed half way through, I knew they where going to\nmake a cheap \"happy ending\" to a dark tragic plot line. Ah well, I\nstill enjoyed it and I recommend it if only for Gyllenhaal's great\nperformance. <br><br>6 out of 10, solid but not rock solid\n"
"\nI would have to say that this movie was on everyone's to do list when\nthey saw the previews for it! It looked amazing! It was gonna be the\nmovie of the summer, then... What happened?<br><br>This movie had no action. It showed allot on the preview, and we now\nknow it only showed 1 of 3 action scenes in the preview, and also a\nmisleading one as well! The movie was very dry and you had to be into\nthis type of movie to want to see it out to the end because it was that\ndry. The more you watched, the more you just wanted the movie to\nexplain the last tidbit of info so you can say, \"OK!\", but there are\nstill some parts that I don't get... Loop holes to me, but maybe\nsomeone can explain them...<br><br>If you miss this one, its OK, your not missing anything really\n"
"\nWah..!! The Movie was Exceptional and no doubt it will make you to pay\nyour 100% concentration towards it. The Story by Ben Ripley and\nDirection by Dunkan Jones was really amazing.Jake Gyllenhaal acting is\nfantabulous and all the cast and crew were apt for their characters.<br><br>The Story and Concept of looping back to past with variations is\nexcellent and Overall the movie is a scientific Thriller and worth\nWatching.<br><br>The narration of the story from the title till end will make you locked\nto it and sure that you will have a feeling that you watched a\nwonderful movie\n"
"\nIt's not a high sci-fi, it's not a thriller, more of a drama, actually. <br><br>Like most people, I liked Jake Gyllenhaal from Donnie Darko and I've\nbeen following his career (as well as his talented sister's) since.\nWell, it's definitely way better than Prince of Persia blockbuster, I'd\ntell you.<br><br>The thing is, that despite quite predictable twists and turns of the\nplot and some pieces of bad acting (Michelle Monaghan was plain dull),\nthere's a good camera work with carefully selected angles and lighting,\nJG and, of course, Vera Farmiga do their best and create great\ncharacters, music is OK and... all in all, it just leaves the right\naftertaste.<br><br>Good flick, most probably because it is not grim. It was easy to go\neither to heroic stupidity of most Tom Cruise' movies or dark thriller\nlike Pandorum. 'Source Code' stayed on the edge, balancing - and it was\nvery good.<br><br>And no, don't you dare to spoil it with a sequel.\n"
"\nThis movie was so intense and mind blowing that I had to register on\nthis site (IMDb) to write this review! Great movie, was slow and\nconfusing at first but ultimately kept you on the edge of your seat.\nYeah some parts kept repeating but it was so unique how this movie was\nput but in the end it left me satisfied and mind blown.<br><br>I was interrupted a few times during this intense movie but to tell you\nthe legit truth about my experience is this. One time I was interrupted\nafter an intense scene. I had to pause the movie and I was angry and\nupset that I was interrupted but I needed to drop my sister off to work\nso when I was backing up I was feeling so careless and upset because of\nall the interruptions. As I was backing up I felt like my mind was in\nthe concepts of the movie. I felt like if I made a mistake and I died\nin a car crash, I could wake up and retry. You will see if you haven't\nseen the movie what I meant. It left me mind blown.\n"
"\nWell i was sceptical when I first watched the trailer, after a weird\nstart and some focusing. I realized, whoa this is genius. Good actors,\ngood scenes, good story. I simply love this movie for it's creativity.\nI don't want to spoil anything in the review. But if you liked\nInception and other similar films you will love this one.It is deep,it\nwill make you think you should not fall asleeep during this one. Only\nnegative, it was too short in my opinion. This one could have so much\npotential.<br><br>I just wanted to put out the word, if you have not seen this movie.<br><br>I recommend you to watch it as soon as possible!\n"
"\nTrailer is better than the film unfortunately. Horribly predictable,\nbelow-average editing, average script, good acting, light\nentertainment. Plot twist at the end but my bum was nowhere near the\nfront of my seat.<br><br>To be fair though it is intellectually interesting rather than\nHollywood's typical \"bang boom gargle explosion boobies!\"\nsci-thrill-fi.<br><br>I think I was just annoyed because the villain in the story is\ndelivered to you (at least I got it) in the very first scene. Like\nseriously editors/director/producers - how hard is it to stick to the\nmodern movie making principle of keep your friends close and enemies\ncloser? By not having the main character focusing in on the villain it\nbecome bleedingly obvious who it is. I'm sure that if you watched it\nthough and well, didn't pick up on who it is then the film would have a\nlot more going for it. 1.75/5 stars\n"
"\nwatching source code may remind you of many previous movies in which\nthe leading character would try to change the inevitable. \"DejaVu\";\n\"Next\" and many others. Moreover its again a Train movie it reminds me\nof UNSTOPPABLE also/ ----- \"Colter Stevens\" (Jake Gyllenhaal) is a\nsoldier who tries to change the past (at least in his mind) to save 52\npeople in the train; especially this girl \"Christina Warren\" (Michelle\nMonaghan).<br><br>The medium of traveling to and from source code and the fact of being\nsome one else in side SC and later upset body condition once you come\nback from SC; reminds me totally of \"The Matrix\" trilogy.<br><br>There is nothing new in the Plot of the movie however story-wise the\nmovie is good! again it has been tried to show in the movie that with\npersonal touch any soldier can go extra mile. The role of \"Colleen\nGoodwin\" Actress (Vera Farmiga) was very very good and important.<br><br>I would rate this movie 7/10 and will be able to watch it at least one\nmore time!!!\n"
"\nHi there, in reviewing this movie I mean its so difficult to explain,\nits not one of those movies that you can really keep up with your eyes\nclose, you have to be alert at all times. I honestly didn't really\nenjoy it, the only reason I went to see it is because I think Jake\nGyllenhaal is hot!!! thats about it. and I like Michelle Monagan on the\nmovie that she did with patrick Dempsey Made of Honor..... If you are\nan action buff this might be your style. I honestly rather see movies\nLike Limitless, or the Lincoln Lawyer, Scream 4 that I might go far,\nthis its on a genre completely on its own. You have to keep following\neverything over and over and over, at times I just wanted to walk out\nof the theatre because I was getting bored ,I am sorry it was not\nentertaining enough for me. I was counting the seconds so I can leave,\nso in my opinion, pass it up, or wait til it comes out on DVD (blu ray\nor whatever)........ not for me. I guess Jake was great, Michelle stay\nIn romantic comedies. thats it.\n"
"\nI give this movie a seven because I must admit it kept my attention and\nwas well acted/edited. However, although I realize this is just\nescapist lore, I think the \"science\" behind the time loop could have\nbeen better explained. One thing I noticed that, although he is\ncascading from one parallel universe to another, with each one being\nslightly different, the identity of the villain never changes. Also,\nhow does the controller know that the returning controllee is the same\nentity that originally went on the mission? Nevertheless, as pure\nentertainment, and if one allows oneself to release everything learned\nin Physics 101, it's worth seeing.\n"
"\n\"Source Code\" deals with interesting issues and themes for which if i\nreveal them then it could be seen as a spoiler alert, so i guess you'll\nhave to see it for yourself to see if you can highlight them, but what\ni can say is that with an exceptional cast and a clever plot which is\neasy to follow, \"Source Code\" keeps you watching to see if you can see\nwhere the twists and turns will be coming from. Jake Gyllenhaal brings\nsubstance to his character and the film and is a great actor in this\nfilm. His co-star Michelle who played in \"Eagle Eye\" (2008) plays a\nsimilar role for which she does really well and both of them together\nhave a great chemistry. There's not much more to say except that it has\na great cast, cool and original plot with cool twists and turns coming\nyour way!\n"
"\nThis is what a true sci-fi should be. It's fun, easy to watch, but\nthought-provoking and intelligent. I loved \"Moon\" and now, with \"Source\nCode\", Duncan Jones became just the guy to follow, in my book.<br><br>There are movies that use the sci-fi genre only to justify all those\nshiny SFX fireworks we all like so much. But once in a while another\nkind of sci-fi emerges. If you're a fan of BSG or B5 amongst others,\nyou know the kind. The one that is about people first, and flashy\nexploding photo-realistic spaceships second. It can be tough to sell\nsuch a complex film to an unprepared audience, but Source Code does it\nbrilliantly with emotion, romance, humor and top-notch performances.\n"
"\nThis movie speaks about the ability to obtain informations from the\npast. As said in the movie, \"it is not time travel\", it is something\nelse. This \"something else\" is well engaged since the beginning. I was\nin the entire time, and it is not easy for me in that kind of movies\nbecause I analyzed everything. It is not too hard-science (like Primer\nfor instance) nor too stupid (like Transcendance). It is more like Edge\nof Tomorrow where the weight of action/science/love/thriller is well\nbalanced.<br><br>I recommend to see the movie if you like \"little\" mind-f***. I liked\nthe end, even if I don't think it can be realistic, but it is\nunexpected and appropriated in a sense...<br><br>So go watch it.\n"
"\nWow. Having just watched Source Code I must say that this is a great\nmovie. The storyline is filled with twists and turns. The movie is\nsmartly built and wonderfully acted. Jake Gyllenhaal acts with\nemotional depth and gives us a look into the life of someone thrown\ninto such a strange and unsettling circumstances. The movie makes you\nfeel very smart for understanding each twist and turn. Every single\nsecond is well thought out and has the rest of the movie in mind. The\nmovie is clever. Of course the movie does toy around with some very\nprofound ideas, especially in the last few minutes, and sometimes they\ndon't always work. However most of the time the movie leaves you\nguessing and feeling sad for the loss and pain of the characters,\nescpically the main character. The sheer complexity makes it mind\nbending. But at the same time it's very straightforward to understand.\nAll in all its a great film with a few missteps are outdone by the\nbrilliance of the film. Thank you for reading. Goodbye.\n"
"\nSource code is one of the best entertaining sci-fi thrillers i have\nseen so far.It's concept is kinda innovative and impressive also.Loved\nthe film.Though the main idea behind this technology may be confusing\nbut it's welcome all the way. After all we all love new technology and\nnew concepts in movie making.Lead actors of this movie play as per the\nrole demanded.Direction is also great.The shooting places are\ngorgeous.The most important thing is,this movie never gets slowed down\nanywhere.It keeps it's pace throughout.It would have been better if the\nconfusing technology which was shown here was explained more\nclearly.But it won't be a problem to enjoy this masterpiece at all.It's\nthat kind of movie which you will like to watch again and again and\nstill the beauty of this flick remains the same.Giving it 10 out of 10.\n"
"\nThe story is kind of predictable for this type of movie. The groundhog\nday element gets old fast. Read the good reviews and expected more. It\nis just adequate - no more no less. Could have predicted the outcome\nfrom the premise of the story. It's just not very interesting and the\nwhole thing feels repetitive and limited in scope.<br><br>Michelle Monaghan isn't pretty enough to carry this kind of show. She\nlooks a bit pig like - a younger Marcia Gay Harden and is more of a\ncharacter actress. Jake does an adequate job but anyone could have done\nit. Like seeing Vera Farmiga but don't know why she has to do the\nbehind the scenes kind of HQ woman - she is young enough for a more\ncentral role.\n"
"\nI've just finished watching it and it really brought me to a different\nreality,I couldn't see anything else until it was over, it was that\nkind of a movie. great job to the actors &amp; to the one who wrote that\nscript! I would love to see more movies like this one, and I love the\nidea of parallel worlds where anything can happen, it makes you\nwonder.. The concept of the movie is quite new, never seen it in movies\nbefore and I think that's exactly what people are looking for - it\nenriches our imagination. To think beyond the limits and to believe\nthat death is not the end - these are two of most important ideas from\nthis movie (please excuse my English, still learning).\n"
"\nDon't have much to say. This movie is the best sci-fi after Matrix i've\never seen. Amazing movie. From the very beginning, till the end it's\nreally interesting. I don't want to put even a slightest clue about\nwhat this movie is all about. I believe you should watch it yourself.\nThis movie really makes you think about things you would like to do.\nWhat if life gives you a second change to correct things. Thing you\nwould like to do before you die. Think about things you really wished\nfor.<br><br>About the movie, this movie has got very few instances where profanity\nhas been used, which is something I like. It's not like other movies\nfor 200 and above f words which makes it irritating sometimes.<br><br>Very mild violence is shown, few kissing scene which is OK.\n"
"\nSource Code is the first and only film I've seen on the big screen this\nyear, mainly since I've been waiting until the summer to indulge.<br><br>Jake Gyllenhaal and Michelle Monaghan team-up to give a performance you\nwouldn't believe.<br><br>The show is well-written, futuristic, and nearly flawless. If you're a\nfan of either actors mentioned above, you'll simply love this film, and\nif you aren't, you soon will be.<br><br>Source Code didn't focus on profit, it focused on quality and the\naudience, something that seems to be uncommon practice even this very\nday.<br><br>Give this film a chance, you'll be beyond thankful you did.\n"
"\nThis has got to be the best Sci-Fi/Love Story plot I've ever watched\nsince The Lakehouse. I definitely recommend this movie for anyone who\nhas got a knack of dealing with mind-boggling scenarios while enjoying\nthe melodramatic mood. This of course has some violent scenes typical\nfor its own stretched-out plot of a time bomb set on a train and\nafterward the possibility a citywide holocaust. Jake's acting has been\ndriving and very involving. Michelle Monaghan is cute. She did it well\nand much relaxed. Though the mystery is easy off since the crime\nperpetrator can be guessed off pretty in the early minutes of the\nmovie, the winning part of the movie is by how every piece of evidence\nis stitched into one whole revelation and the realization that this has\ngo to be a love story. The ending surprisingly is most rewarding and\nwould bring you to several what- if's and how-come's. Definitely worth\nwatching and a genre mainstay until another far-fetched killer\nbrainchild comes across the big screen.\n"
"\nThis movie is as predictable as the trailer leads it to be. Whatever\nyou think will happen does. I didn't want to see this movie but did\nbecause my friends were going and had nothing else to do. Waste of time\nand money, and I'm surprised the 2 actors that are recognizable agreed\nto sign on. I would compare this movie to Unstoppable, not only because\nit is on a train but because I could have told you the ending without\never seeing it. The acting is OK but unworthy of these 2 actors and the\nunderlining story is undermined by the superfulous \"action\". The\n\"villain\" in this movie is left with questions unanswered (cane) and\nthe overall purpose of the program is not layed out.\n"
"\nThis movie has a spiritual meaning which you can only understand if you\nread and educate yourself about quantum psychics before hand. The\nscript is not a brainer and it is very simple. You will guess the next\nscene without any doubt. If you are looking to watch a cleverly made,\nMatrix like science fiction, do not bother to watch this movie. You\nwill find it not an exciting and loaded with virtual effects.<br><br>However if you are practicing quantum psychics and you want to grow\nwith the message embedded within the movie, go for it. This movie is\nnot for everyone. This is definitely not a film which can win Oscars.\nacting is not an extraordinary as the script does not require actors to\npush themselves more. I gave 7 because it was predictable.\n"
"\nWhen this movie was released, i heard a lot of people talking about how\ngood this movie is and all that... But i was not that up to see it\nafter watching the trailers and promos videos...<br><br>But i am so glad that i watched this movie, and true, it is a great\nmovie with amazing cast and great style of directing... when i first\nwatched the film, i did not really understand some parts but after\nwatching it for a second time, i finally understood the movie and wow,\nwhat a great movie...<br><br>Jake G is super-amazing... The story line is also very strong...<br><br>A must-watch movie of 2011... go see it... :)...<br><br>My Review: 8/10\n"
"\nDuncan Jones directed 'Source Code' is amongst the most entertaining\nfilms I have seen in recent times. It's Gripping, Confounding &amp;\nIntelligent. Also, Jake Gyllenhaal is absolutely superb in here.<br><br>'Source Code' is a sci-fi action-packed thriller, centered on a soldier\nwho wakes up in the body of an unknown man and discovers he's part of a\nmission to find the bomber of a Chicago commuter train.<br><br>An interesting premise, 'Source Code' succeeds by holding your\nattention from start to end. It keeps you hooked on to it completely.\nBen Ripley's Writing is Razor-Sharp, and Duncan Jones directs this\nflick with style. Cinematography is stunning. Editing is perfect.<br><br>Performance-Wise: Jake Gyllenhaal, as mentioned, is absolutely superb\nin the central part. This performance easily ranks amongst his finest\nworks. Michelle Monaghan is satisfactory. Vera Farmiga is expressive,\nas always. Jeffrey Wright leaves a mark.<br><br>On the whole, 'Source Code' is Super-Entertainment. An Ideal Pop-Corn\nFlick, that is Worth Your Time and Money. Two Thumbs Up!\n"
"\nDuncan Jones, the son of David Bowie and director of 2009's critically\nacclaimed Moon, returns with his second feature length film Source\nCode.<br><br>It stars Jake Gyllenhaal playing his usual charming hero self as\nCaptain Colter Stevens, whom is connected to a program named the source\ncode which allows a person to take over someone else's body in the last\neight minutes of their life. Captain Stevens is connected to the\nprogram in order to find out who blew up a train outside of Chicago in\norder to stop a second attack.<br><br>Cleverly written and brilliantly directed with obvious Hitchcockian\ninfluence, the film in fact is such a thrilling ride that the\nsentimental ending that takes it a little off track wont bother you in\nthe slightest. I'd be surprised if there is another film out this year\nas thrilling as this.<br><br>Go to www.thecinemapass.blogspot.com for more reviews like this\n"
"\nI am sure I am in the minority, but I can't help but look beyond the\nsurface to determine if there are any plot-holes. And there are. Now, I\naccept the movie's main premise (hey, that is what sci-fi's are about)\nbut beyond that premise there are paradoxes.<br><br>One thing I DID like about the movie was that it really was not an\naction movie. It had about 5 minutes of action and the rest was\ndialogue. I think 'action' is incorrectly describing this movie.<br><br>The acting is good. If you like sci-fi, like your imagination to run a\nlittle wild, and don't mind plot-holes, this movie is for you.<br><br>If plot-holes (i.e., inexplicable parts while allowing the main\npremises) bother you, then you might leave disappointed.\n"
"\nThe movie was good for a pop corn night, or to kill your time if you\nhave nothing better to do. According to my expectations it was kinda\nwhat I suspected, although I am sure I will not remember much of it\ntomorrow. Sadly, it is a reproduction of many movies like 12 monkeys,\nDeja Vu, Butterfly Effect etc etc etc etc. So it delivers nothing new,\nbut at least the acting is good. The story is a bit boring too and it\nis obvious from the beginning that the guy is not where he thinks he\nis. But overall, I did not feel sorry for watching it, but I am not\nthrilled either. So I guess that makes it an OK movie. I would suggest\nDVD rental.\n"
"\nThis is your typical generic sci fi movie with twist movie that you\nhave seen before.<br><br>However, the \"who did it?\" on the train is ruined by the fact the movie\nis so short (90 minutes), the fact that after every time Colter dies he\nhas to go back to the command center to chat for 5 minutes, and there\nis little suspense/action on the train to find out who did it.<br><br>Initially there was little suspense/action on the train, but suddenly\nmid way through the movie they tell us was the bomber. That is pretty\nlame.<br><br>Overall lame movie and pretty boring too.\n"
"\nI usually like foreign and independent movies, so I don't need to be\nentertained by a bunch of explosions. But this movie was incredibly\ndull and nonsensical. Dry, and the longer the movie goes on, the more\nyou start to realize that you've wasted your time and can never get\nthose minutes of your life back. A plot line of Jake Gyllenhaal's\ncharacter trying to go back in time to stop a tragic accident devolves\ninto an unnecessary \"conspiracy\" type story with characters you\ncouldn't care less about. And I now hate Michelle Monaghan, because if\nI ever hear the words \"I took your advice...\" again (it's repeated as a\nloop throughout the movie), I might punch someone. This is the poor\nman's Memento.\n"
"\nNice science fiction thriller with good performances by the actors,\nworthwhile to see this in the theater.<br><br>Jake Gyllenhaal seems to have hit his stride lately, picking good roles\nthat suit him with the last couple of movies he has starred in. He does\nwell here, as a reluctant hero who starts to piece together what is\nreally going on in a mission to discover the details of a terror plot\nand identity of the terrorist in Chicago.<br><br>The film is shot in an intelligent style, giving brief but significant\nsnippets of various characters on board a commuter train and red\nherrings tossed in liberally to keep you guessing.<br><br>It's not that original or groundbreaking, but made with high standards\nand care to give the movie-goer good value for their dollar and a\npleasant entertainment that delivers on expectations. Its refreshing to\nsee a movie made with these principles in mind.\n"
"\nFirst, the pilot dies but he can still talk sensibly to the doctor, who\nput's his consciousness into the mind of a dead victim, by means of a\ncomputer who conveniently remember's the last eight minutes of the\ncrash. Furthermore, the pilot is then able to replay this eight minutes\nin any way he chooses, which is absolute crap.. It doesn't make sense,\nand I can't see why anybody would like this film, everything is\nrubbish.. a programmer apparently, knows exactly what everyone is\ndoing, thinking, saying where in fact they are all blown up already and\nis totally burnt... and the ending where decided by the audience score\ncard. If he is already dead, and he is inside a computer(???) how come\nthat he is still standing there, where in reality they already ended up\nthe program by pushing the button..( it really doesn't make sense..none\nof it make sense..)<br><br>Leaving everybody in the audience, wishing they could use the computer\nto go back and regain the TWO hours they lost watching this CRAP!!!\n"
"\nEveryone loves Donnie, and he's a brilliant actor for sure. But one\ncan't be betting on just that producing a movie that will get on\nanyone's nerves when things aren't explained in a manor that caters to\nsome respect for reality.<br><br>There is nothing about quantum physics that allows for computer\nsoftware to correctly guess what would take a molecule by molecule\nscanning and recording of an event in real time. There is also nothing\nabout it, that would create parallel universes when the code is\nexecuted. And even if the latter would somehow be the case, we now have\nlike, what, 15 freshly created universes in which 13 times people are\ndying due to a train bomb, shooting the ending in its own foot.<br><br>There is nothing wrong with making a movie build on the popular\nassumptions of quantum theory, but if it doesn't even hold water in a\nNewtonian world, please rewrite the story or simply forgo the effort..<br><br>1/10\n"
"\nSource Code is a very good Sci-Fi movie which has come up in the recent\nyears. The only thing which I feel could've rated this movie down is\nits ending part, where the hero sends a text message to the lady in\ncharge in reality from inside simulation of a code to the real world.\nThus, it gives a sense of feeling to the audience that its actually a\ntime travel. In a particular scene in the movie, Source Code is\ndescribed as a time displacement. Its not a time travel. But the last\nscene of the movie confuses the audience totally. Rest apart, all parts\nof the movie are really thrilling and exciting. Worth watching and\nyou'll enjoy this movie like anything.\n"
"\nWhen decorated soldier Captain Colter Stevens (Jake Gyllenhaal) wakes\nup in the body of an unknown man, he discovers he's part of a mission\nto find the bomber of a Chicago commuter train. In an assignment unlike\nany he's ever known, he learns he's part of a government experiment\ncalled the Source Code, a program that enables him to cross over into\nanother man's identity in the last 8 minutes of his life. With a\nsecond, much larger target threatening to kill millions in downtown\nChicago, Colter re-lives the incident over and over again, gathering\nclues each time, until he can solve the mystery of who is behind the\nbombs and prevent the next attack..finally he complete the mission..the\nclimax was superb ...thats a suspense u will love it when u see it so\nwatch this movie....\n"
"\nSource Code is a fantastic movie with an extremely well thought out\nstory line and an inspired cast.The whole plot to the movie was a very\nclever idea,and not at all a cliché story line that anyone could come\nup with.This is my first time seeing Jake Gyllenhaal in a movie\nbefore,and my first impression of him is good,I always thought he\nseemed like an average actor,but after seeing him in this I can see he\nis actually a really good and talented actor.The movie is very\nshort,but it manages to fit in a much action as it possibly can in that\nshort time.Definitely a movie that both sci-fi and action fans will\nenjoy.<br><br>An soldier wakes up,for unknown reasons,in another mans body,and\ndiscovers he is part of a mission to stop a bomb that has been put on a\ntrain to Chicago.\n"
"\nAfter sitting down and watching this supposedly 'good' film I became\nindulged by the plot of the film, of how anyone could think of and\ncreate such a complex and manage to pull it off, this film was well\nacted and with large actors such as Jake Gyllenhaal I expected none the\nless. Although this film is not the greatest and it may not be the best\ndirected, but I throughout enjoyed the idea of the film. The reason I\nhave rated this film so high is due to the acting and the great film\nplot. With such a complex idea and film plot I am surprised that the\ndirector managed to pull it together so nicely. Although the film could\nof done with a few more sets other than the source code and the train\nstation it was very good and I would happily recommend it.\n"
"\nThis is a very well made film with lots of attention to detail,\neverything fits and everything works pretty well. There are overtones\nof Groundhog Day (1993), in that a time period is repeated, but I found\nthis one very different. Although not as good as 'Moon', IMO, I really\nliked this film and I'm glad I gave it a second look. It's nicely\npaced, there's a pretty good soundtrack, although it's quite subdued\nand at ninety three minutes, it's not too long. Over all, it's a well\nwritten, nicely paced piece of science fiction with quite a nice twist\nat the end. Comparisons have been made with 'Inception' but I'm not\neven going to go there, they are totally different. I didn't score it\nquite as highly as first time around because I felt it didn't have\nquite the impact it did on the big screen. Still a very enjoyable watch\nthough.<br><br>SteelMonster's verdict: RECOMMENDED <br><br>My score: 8.2/10.<br><br>You can find an expanded version of this review on my blog: Thoughts of\na SteelMonster.\n"
"\nDirector: Duncan Jones <br><br>Stars: Jake Gyllenhaal, Michelle Monaghan<br><br>Duration: 93 minutes <br><br>Plot: An Afghanistan soldier's (Gylenhaal) mind is transferred into the\nbody of a victim during a train bombing. His duty is to save the\npassengers aboard by finding the bomb and bomber to prevent them from\ndying. <br><br>Verdict: A great performance from Jake Gyllenhaal and a great\nachievement from director Duncan Jones (son of pop star David Bowie).\nMichelle Monaghan shows her role's innocence. Vera Farmiga is obviously\ngood in here. Jeffery Wright is the best person to portray this kind of\nrole.Chris Bacon's music score sounds phenomenal. The effects are\nreally great and The script is very well done. <br><br>Genre: Mystery, Thriller, Suspense <br><br>Rating: owenomahony21 gives this a 9 3/4 /10\n"
"\nGreat movie to watch. I never expected the story line. I appreciate the\nway directer presented the movie and the way he choose the characters.\nWhen the movie started and first 8 minutes gone, i thought that this\nwill be some terrorist related bomb finder movie. yes it is, but in a\ndifferent way. though the same 8 minutes is repeated throughout the\nmovie, the directer and actors managed us to travel throughout the\nmovie interestingly. All the actors acted really good. Music is too\ngood. Creation of whole new world with only time difference is a new\nconcept i never ever come across in Hollywood movies. I lost my sleep\nat the night i saw the movie, thinking about the story. As a whole\ngreat movie for Sci-Fri lovers....\n"
"\nThe plot of this movie was far different from the others and the ending\nwas very impressive.This movie can be considered as one of the best\nmovies in 2010s because of it's plot and you can take 2 or 3 great\nmessages that will help you in your personal life.The main actors and\nactresses played their roles in the best way possible.The most\nconsiderable negative point about the movie was that there were some\nredundant scenes.Actually the scenes are a bit similar but due to it's\nplot this movie has to have such thing.Overall,I recommend this movie\nto you, and you should feel obliged to see movies which are different\nfrom even the ones that are the best in the world. Thanks\nLegend.Of.Persia\n"
"\nI stumbled across this film more by accident than design but decided to\ngive it a try. I have always liked Jake Gs work. The plot has been\noutlined in other reviews so I won't go there but I have to say I was\nvery quickly intrigued by the strange concept which I hoped would not\nbecome another Inception inspired mess.<br><br>But the story holds it course even if it is a little uneven and\nobviously far fetched. The principal actors do a very good job and you\nare kept guessing until the very end, which I think leaves the way open\nfor a sequel.<br><br>After some of the dross that has been pumped out as science fiction in\nrecent times (such as Avatar and Prometheus) this is miles ahead of\nInception and close to the original Matrix.<br><br>Recommended if for no other reason than for the gorgeous Michelle\nMonaghan.\n"
