"\nWorst film i have seen in many many years. The producer wants me to\nlike the \"good guys\" but they are tattooed criminal thugs and murderers\nruining their own life on earth.<br><br>It seems highly leftist ideological crappy movie where all darker skin\npeople are left to their destiny on earth, while white people (and one\nIndian woman) moved to this gigantic space station called Elysium. And\nnow the its so sorry for the dark skin people that they needs to invade\nthe evil \"white\" space station to get cured from various diseases.<br><br>After the invasion is complete suddenly everyone is happy, and we can\nall rejoice.<br><br>Well this movie is the worst movie i have seen in at least 20 years.\nIts really remarkable that people actually like this garbage movie.\n"
"\n'Elysium' starring Matt Damon is the perfect summer popcorn movie. It\nhas everything you would want in a movie; a great cast that serves\ntheir purpose and visceral special effects that might even land the\nteam an Oscar. Everything including all the fight scenes were executed\nflawlessly. Coming out of this movie I had close to no complaints. The\nwriting was a bit dodgy in some areas, but the great acting and effects\nquickly draw you back into the story. Neil Blomkamp, who dazzled\naudiences with district nine 4 years prior, does a fantastic job once\nagain with this flick. His vision made the story very real to movie\ngoers everywhere. Overall 'Elysium' is worth every penny to watch in\ntheater.\n"
"\nNevermind the stupid premise, nevermind the rushed and paper thin plot,\nnevermind the numerous and constant missed opportunities at being\nclever with the script, nevermind the nauseating use of hand held\nshots, the flaws of Elysium are so fundamental and appear so often it's\ndamn near a wonder why it was made in the first place.<br><br>The lapses in common sense and logic in this film compound on each\nother so fast it's hard for me to even keep up with my notes and it\ngoes way beyond just being haphazard writing or questionable\ndirectorial decisions, the mistakes present in this film are of the\nkind that would make you fail film school.\n"
"\nAnother of those films heavy on social commentary and lacking original\nideas.<br><br>If they have changed the name of Elysium to Sherwood, and of Max da\nCosta to Robin Hood, we would have a story that has been told many\ntimes before.<br><br>The problem with Elysium and films like it is that they always side\nwith the masses that procreate like rats instead of offering a better\nalternative to procreation without responsibility.<br><br>The world's problems are not caused only by greed but also stupidity of\nthe masses that insist on behaving on the same way as always.<br><br>The only thing missing in the film is a hero that is also\nfundamentalist Muslim, to make it politically correct.<br><br>A stupid film with some nice special effects...\n"
"\nThere are a few things that make this movie a bad movie. Very\nunconvincing acting by very talented (Damon, Foster) and untalented\n(Braga) actors for instance. Or a very thin, rushed and boring plot\nsold to you as 'THE' science fiction movie. Or perhaps the fighting\nscenes for the lovers of action. Not even those are made interesting.\nAnd what about the plainness and shallowness of the story? One could\nguess every step of this mess until it was at last finished.<br><br>But if there was something that really did bother me was the arrogance\nand hypocrisy of the film makers to present this piece of trash as a\nsocial allegory, a moral message, something very wise and profound that\ncould help us all became better human beings and turn this horrid world\ninto a better place. Let us open the frontiers, let us all share our\nwealth and smile kindly at our brothers they say. But as always, the\nfinal message of this stupid blockbuster was to make wealthier those\nwho are already wealthy. Pathetic!\n"
"\nI laughed at the box that says \"Spoiler Alert\" you couldn't spoil this\nit it that bad. Plenty of action but that is only camouflage to\ndisguise the very predictable plots, all used in previous films over\nthe years.. and as for the acting I can't describe how bad it was.\nThere's a line in it where the Elysium Secretary Of State (Jodie\nFoster) says \" I'm afraid I can't Act\".... I fell off the chair\nlaughing. 106 minutes of your life that you'll never get back.I'd\nrather be in the dentist's chair for that long. I'll bet it didn't take\nthat long to write. How did Matt Damon agree to do this. I give it\n1/10... my previous low score was 6/10... and that was dreadful. And as\nfor the false accents.. reminded me of a cross between Mad Max and Mary\nPoppins.\n"
"\nUnimaginative crack at how capitalism tends toward tyranny. So you get\ngang-bangers v billionaires.<br><br>Almost every scene raises the question, \"But how come ...?\"<br><br>Why human workers when there are robots? If there's enough energy\nsupply for a giant space station, why isn't there wealth on earth,\nwhere the supply comes from? Maybe it's like Saudi Arabia. Why don't\nthe billionaires all have the defensive force-field the mercenary have?\nWhy that Sid Ifrikin iksint?<br><br>I'm sympathetic to the message, because we have a version of this story\ndeveloping now with the adolescent politics of right-libertarianism: I\ncan do it on my own and I don't need anyone else - because I'm worth it\n(especially when I rig the political and monetary system in my favour).<br><br>There are much better ways of telling the story.<br><br>And Jodie Foster's take on Christine Lagarde is not magnifique.\n"
"\nCould this movie be anymore obvious? We get it! America is Elysium and\nwe should let everyone on the planet in and give them free everything,\nbecause apparently, America has enough resources for everyone. If you\nare a minority, you are poor creatures in need of help from white or\nIndian fascists that also speak French. It was so over the top with the\nillogical premise, that they should have offered pain pills beforehand.\nLogic and common sense cried through this whole thing. Don't waste your\ntime. Just watch CNN to understand how horrible an idea it is for a\nnation to have laws. Open the flood gates and let everyone in! No laws,\nyou mean, uncaring people! Those poor Asians, Blacks and Hispanics are\nobviously not smart enough to have made it there. Indians and white\npeople only. I felt like I was being hit over the head with a liberal\nmallet.\n"
"\nSince my movie theatre-working friend was off today, and this was the\nonly movie I hadn't seen that was still playing that I wanted to see,\nthis was what we chose. We both thought it was better than expected\nwith plenty of great action scenes, a good Sci-Fi story, and many fine\nemotional moments concerning a lady friend of Matt Damon and her\ndaughter that he ends up helping in a big way. Oh, and Jodie Foster as\none of the villains was also quite compelling to watch. Things move\nalong at quite a fast pace but not too much so that you couldn't\nunderstand what's going on if you pay close attention to the quite\ndescriptive dialogue. So on that note, I highly recommend Elysium.\n"
"\nIt does have something to be questioned about. But then again... It's\nSCFI... \"Pacific Rim\"... kind of basic. I don't thing we need more\napplause. What we do need is to be asked. And at least \"Elysium\" does\nthat. Are you guys willing to be pupped? Are you actually in need to be\nreaffirmed? That's not my problem, and, then, it does make it your\nproblem, not mine... Ten lines, great. Let's go for it. Although I am\nBrazilian, it is not about region, it is about an idea. I would\nquestion \"Elysium\", but I will not. In the end, the love you take is\nequal to the love you make. \"Elysium\" is a winner in this quest! If you\nare to watch \"Pacific Rim\", go for \"Elysium\". For us, SCFI's orphan's,\nis far better enough.\n"
"\nIm hooked on good SiFi and this was Good. i don't think those who gave\nbad reviews really understood the story but if you are a SiFi\nenthusiast you will understand and enjoy it. The Special effects were\ngood, acting was up to Matt Damon's normal high standard and the plot\nrolled along well. The lead lady could have been a bit more in Matt\nDamon's class but not too bad. I would also have like to have seen more\nmade of the equipment he was fitted with after all the pain he went\nthrough having it put on/in him. More explanation about the space\nstation would also have helped - the concept was well up to scratch and\nvery believable.\n"
"\nThe film is really good if you are looking for a good science fiction\nfilm. It will definitely not let you down. I think this film has a\ntaste very similar to \"In Time\" and perhaps a little bit \"Soylent\nGreen\". <br><br>The only problem with this film is that they could make the scenario\nmore passionate more stronger. I think scenario lacks a little bit of\npassion though. I had a couple of scenes where I just felt like the\nscenario tastes a little bland. It lacks emotions in some important\nscenes making you feel like it needs a little bit more drama.<br><br>It would be a much better film I think if the film had focused on Jodie\nFoster much more. <br><br>The film is also pregnant to many good social messages, but it rushes\nit messages and as a result it fails to deliver them completely.\n"
"\nThis director is on fire! Every movie he does is pure gold and totally\nblows my mind. All the rich details are truly amazing and the action\nscenes are spot on, not at all corny and literally put me at the edge\nof my seat. He would have done a kick ass Star Wars, but he turned down\nthe offer. Maybe a smart move on his part. I'm expecting another dud\nStar Wars anyway, because Disney has hired George Lucas as an \"adviser\"\nfor the entire project, which is the worst mistake ever in the history\nof film making, in my humble opinion. Lucas should have been put out to\npasture a long time ago, in a galaxy far far away. Please oh please\nmake a District 10 and Elysium squeal and keep hope alive and give me a\nblueprint for the future. I will be forever grateful.\n"
"\nI liked Neill Blomkamp's District 9 and I was sure I would not be\ndisappointed with Elysium as well - as for thrillers, I prefer movies\nwhen evil is cognizant (even if aliens or mutant warriors, not abstract\nsuch as animals, natural phenomena or even zombies. Well, the script\ncontains some unreal scenes for the sake of excitement and action, but\nthey are not long and do not become annoying, fights/chases and human\ncontacts are balanced, and many actual serious topics are approached\n(e.g. immigration limits, overpopulation and poverty, health care and\nwealth). Actors like Matt Damon, Judie Foster or William Fichtner are\nalways high-level (Damon has become a really versatile actor, his role\nin Behind the Candelabra is totally different). However, the movie has\nno even good-bad contradiction, as Sharito Copley is not equal in value\nwith Damon. The ending is only partially expected, and the general mood\ndiffers from most Hollywood movies. <br><br>All in all, if you like action sci-fi thrillers without numb actors and\npointless violence, then you will enjoy Elysium.\n"
"\nElysium had some refreshing ideas about how the future could look like\nand I am positively surprised about the background story of the life on\nearth in contradiction to the life on Elysium. It is a parallel to\ntoday's life and makes you think about how the life could be if it\ndevelops further in that direction. The visuals and the sci-fi elements\nare good. Some technological inventions are ingenious like the chips\nthat are attached to a human brain where the data could be\nup/downloaded via a USB cable :D It has some great action elements,\nwhich are sometimes easily predictable. Also I wasn't very stunned by\nthe acting performances. The development of the love story is somewhat\nboring and lacks emotion, it is unfinished and undeveloped. All in all\nit is worth watching for everybody who likes sci-fi movies.\n"
"\nIts an enjoyable film, plenty happening, easy to follow, good case,\nthought provoking material but it doesn't feel original. The market\nseems saturated with 'earths a mess and people live in space' type\nfilms i.e. Oblivion, Total Recall etc. Saying that this is the best one\nof these and does give you a more realistic sense of what could happen\nin the future has a layer of gritty reality to it that seems to give is\nmore credibility. There are random elements to it, why is a South\nAfrican commando's (or whatever they were) stationed in Los Angeles,\njust felt like that Blomkamp wants something to do with South Africa in\nthere even if its irrelevant or compromises the plausibility of the\nfilm. Its a good watch mind so don't be put off and enough in it to\nkeep most film fans entertained.\n"
"\nWell, as a die hard Matt Damon fans, I'm just so gonna watch this movie\nand I did. Yeap and I will always said his acting just won't fail me\nand let me down. <br><br>Lets talk about the movie shall we ? Firstly BRILLIANT GRAPHICS, thanks\nto modern technology, CG looks real enough, hardly notice that it had\nbeen polished by after effects. Visually Enjoyed watching the movie.\nActually I see shadow of District 9 throughout the show, is it maybe\ncoz of Sharlto Copley ? Well, you judge that yourself. <br><br>Talking about casting, I would say all the Actor/Actress were put to\nthe right place, the acting was real, professional, I am so into the\nmovie and I am so enjoyed of the performances of they. <br><br>Everything is best and sets, at least for me. Just a little bit\ndisappointed of the story line, it's just so predictable and simple, I\nwas hoping to get a little bit more from this Movie. But overall still\na nice show to watch. <br><br>So I am voting a 7 out of 10 rating. <br><br>You definitely going to watch this, whether you're a die hard fans of\nMatt Damon or not.\n"
"\nThe movie is about 2/3 of Matt Damon crawling or sweating in agony\nmeant to evoke sympathy or compassion, but all that's earned is eye-\nrolling weariness at how dumb his character must be to have such bad\nluck.<br><br>Another aspect that will make you want to dunk your head in popcorn\nbutter and keep it there for 90 minutes is the MOST ANNOYING VILLAIN\nyou'll probably ever see. He tries to act harrowing and beastly but it\njust doesn't work when you can only understand every 5th word he\nspeaks.<br><br>I place this movie on par with \"In The Name of The King\" and was\nsurprised it wasn't directed by Uwe Boll.\n"
"\nMatt Damon did a fine performance as always but I felt the direction\nand writing of the film fell short and even then it was constantly\nmasked by scene-after-scene of action which made it somewhat confusing\nto follow the importance of what was going on. <br><br>Dues Ex? Check. Over-the-top bad guy? Check. Outrageously violent\naction scenes? check. <br><br>So the film hits the list on action cliché's but what made it lose a\nlot of potential in my book was the fact I felt like I was watching an\naction flick where the director constantly wanted me to notice that\nonly bad guys have money, drive Bugatti's--in this case fly--and always\nare found in the corporate scene. What happened to better ulterior\nmotive than a coup d'etat? Seriously. This lacked the imagination I\nthought it would bring. <br><br>Regardless of my complaints, the film did at least provide\nentertainment value for a Friday night.\n"
"\nIt's Johnny Mnemonic the way Repo Men with Jude Law was Logan's Run.\nStephen Baxter does a really good job in The Flood, and then again\ndeeper still in The Ark, showing how the government would have to\ndevelop cold heartless Technics for dealing with the rising flood of\npeople when land becomes scarce. The special effects are great, and\nJodie Foster just gives an amazingly believable heartless bureaucrat\nperformance. I found that I Enjoyed the movie as a decent sci-fi/action\nmovie, a great choice for Friday, or Saturday night with your favourite\nsnacks. The production team have really put together a believable world\nthat you can see has evolved from our present day. The Bounty hunter\nwill end up being one of your favourite characters even though you will\nhate him.\n"
"\nI was drawn to this movie because of the cast &amp; writer/director; &amp;\nhadn't paid much mind to the actually base storyline... perhaps its my\nown personal frustration at a particular scenario that has a logical\nreasonable outcome that is not forthcoming borne out of greed but I\nsuppose that's the point; regardless I rate movies on would I watch\nthem again and I would this; was I left wanting more &amp; would it sit as\na favourite on top of my DVD player in readiness to be watched time &amp;\ntime again ...no. From an action &amp; sci-fi point of view I'd give it a\n9/10; brought a new imagination level &amp; believability that can\nsometimes overshadow a movies Decalogue and momentum. As an avid movie\ngoer this movie was well rounded and basically pretty cool.\n"
"\n*** POSSIBLE SPOILER ALERT *** <br><br>Visually, this movie came off as almost believable. The CGI was not too\nover-the-top. The story was not bad either, though many aspects of it\nlooked like other movies (i.e. District 9).<br><br>It really feel apart for me in the last 30 minutes or so. Max gets into\nthe lab, albeit by force. Then he escapes. For the next half an hour,\nhe is running through hallways, rooms, corridors, elevators, etc. Not\none single person any where, except for the mercenaries. Really? Was\nthe fair in town and everyone was at the cotton candy vendor?<br><br>Then, this facility has incredibly high tech equipment, yet Spider's\nship lands and no one notices? No cops, guards, droids? Oh yeah, I\nforgot, everyone was at the fair. (Kidding, there wasn't really a fair,\nat least none was ever mentioned). *LOL*.<br><br>I went into this hoping for a strong sci-fi with all the usual bells\nand whistles. Sadly, to me, it came off the rails.\n"
"\nThe premise of the story was very interesting and although Sci-Fi it\nwas, the idea that is, was believable. I thought, \"If Foster is in the\nmovie it can't be bad\".........wrong. Foster gives her usual stunning\nperformance but the whole movie is ruined by way, way too much violent\naction. Glad I have a FF button. Seem most movies follow the same genre\nof guns and chases etc. that are really old and lame. Hollywood is\npolitically against guns but they love them in their movies. What\nHippocrits. Damon is insipid in his role. So predictable. Then, insight\ncame into my head, the movie is really about Hollywood's pie in the sky\nattitude toward life. The refugees wanting to escape earth are clearly\nrepresenting Mexicans and the space station current day U.S.A. Only the\nrich get the best medical treatment and the immigrants get nothing.\nSound Familiar? Wake up Hollywood, event the die hard liberals are sick\nof the same old same old.\n"
"\nNot much to say about Elysium. If you watch the trailer, you'll be\nexpecting a decent and entertaining sci-fi movie, and Elysium is just\nthat. Nothing new in terms of story,(although the first 30-40 min let\nyou think you're in for something more), good special effects, good\nacting(considering the genre), overall good movie. I would like to\npraise Sharlto Copley on his performance on this one, a very pleasant\nsurprise portraying the villain. To sum up, Elysium isn't a mind\nblowing movie, but its very entertaining, you will get your money's\nworth on this one if you go to the movies to be entertained, if not,\nElysium is still preety decent, but don't expect big twists and turns,\nits all very predictable. Still, a solid 7/10.\n"
"\nI saw many previews for this that I found quite dull, and did not do it\njustice. The special effects were second to none, the film quality\ndivine, and the acting crazy crazy good. <br><br>The story begins on a future earth in the land of rubble and trash. The\nrich people of the universe live in a huge satellite that has it's own\natmosphere. As the people left on earth die each day in a world of sin\nand poverty, crews of criminals send people up to try and get healed on\nmedical machines of perfection. It sets up the characters well, making\nyou feel for them quite nicely. The action is decent, but not, in my\nmind, the focus of the movie. As a big fan of sci-fi I absolutely love\nthis movie. I completely give this a 9/10 and will be buying on\nBluRay/DVD.\n"
"\nA nauseating politically correct sci-fi shoot em up thriller. I enjoyed\nthe first hour or so for the special effects.<br><br>I just ignored the stupid story it wasn't worth thinking about. My\nblood pressure is too high as it is.<br><br>I watched in on Amazon prime do not pay $15 to see this Hollywood\nsci-fi socially correct thing. <br><br>A pile of you know what.<br><br>AVOID\n"
"\nPossible Spoilers, take with some salt.<br><br>Okay I get it that the rich population moved to Elysium, all on a\nsudden Max comes out of nowhere. Then someone says he got caught\nstealing again. And you know nothing who Max is, how he came here, why\nhe wanted to visit Elysium. Then nothing on him and someone says he was\na thief legend. Oh come on! There should've been a little background on\nhim! <br><br>The again, plot twists, characters lack the depth they should've got.\nYou watch the whole movie wondering who was that ? Why here and just\nwhen you start figuring out things - another character turns in and you\nstart all over again. <br><br>It seems like squeezing too many things in a single movie. You want to\nshow some capitalism, fine show it at least in a way that people get\nit. Then you show militia, mob etc etc, at least do some background on\nthem, or give the viewer some hint about them.\n"
"\nIf it weren't for Matt Damon, this movie would probably be a lot less\npopular. The action is entertaining for most of the movie, but at times\nit is laughable. Some things are so outrageous that it feels like they\nbelong in Monty Python. Matt Damon does a good job acting, but his\ncharacter just isn't written very well. The overall idea of the movie\nis much more interesting than the movie itself.<br><br>Another thing that makes this movie less enjoyable is the strange\naccents that many of the characters have, especially Jodie Foster. She\nsounds like she is really struggling to speak throughout the entire\nmovie. And it also doesn't make sense that Matt Damon's character is\nthe only white person in the village he lives in. The writers\ndefinitely did not do very well on this project, but the movie is still\nenjoyable enough. To sum it up, if you watch it you will at least be\nentertained. If you don't watch it then don't be too upset because you\nare not missing anything fantastic.\n"
"\nElysium's pretty simplistic. The ruling elite have built themselves a\nperfect environment on Elysium, a space station orbiting Earth, &amp; left\nthe rest of mankind to their polluted overpopulated fate. Fatally\nirradiated in an industrial accident, Matt Damon joins a band plotting\nto invade Elysium, where advanced technology can cure any ailment short\nof death itself. Eventually concluding that mankind's needs take\nprecedence over his personal salvation tho, he sacrifices his life to\nupload a program that makes all citizens of earth eligible for the same\nprerogatives as the elite citizens of Elysium.<br><br>All very soul-satisfying, the filthy rich get a well-deserved screwing\n&amp; equality for all is suddenly attained at the flip of a switch. Nice\nsentiment, but ah.... How does eliminating death by disease or injury\nso everybody can live pretty much forever help a population that's\nalready destroying its own planet thru sheer weight of numbers?\n"
"\nThis director is very much the descendant of Rod Serling. He takes\npeople and dumps them in a wild situation and has them continue to act\nmore or less normally. Some people knock on this movie that the\ncharacters are under stated, but people are understated, and this makes\nthe movie better, especially in how little chemistry there is between\nthe main characters which may be a spoiler.<br><br>Like Serling, he always works in some maudlin content, but in this one\nit is so tied in to current events that it isn't as saccharine as the\npathos in District 9 or Chappie. I did think the criticism that no\nsociety would get like this was pretty funny, considering how far down\nthis road we already are. Unlike Chappie, the plot line is so simple\nthat it doesn't bite off more than it can chew. The humor is humorous,\nthe story line relevant and the explosions are beautiful. We watched\nthis because we liked Chappie and District 9 so much, but I think this\nis actually the best of the three.\n"
"\nThis movie is literally one of the best movies I have ever watched.\nAfter Niell's District 9, I wasn't expecting much (really didn't like\nDistrict 9). But was absolutely blown away by this film. Although the\nspecial effects were great, the story line is what really grabbed me.\nIn a society where inequality grows daily, it isn't very difficult for\nsomeone like me to connect the dots and see a future state where the\nelite are even more isolated from the masses they rely on exploiting\nfor their wealth. We see the same trends in every country on Earth. If\nyou haven't got an entitled disposition and have had to work for an\nhonest wage, you'll really enjoy this film. However, if you're more\nlike the citizens of Elysium, you're bound to hate it.\n"
"\nWell i saw Gravity last day. that was so boring and full with CGI. And\ndon't have any kind of sense. That movie is incredibly hyped. today i\nsee Elysium, Well this movie has some plot holes but they don't ruin\nthe movie at all. it kept me steady in my seat. The story was so good.\nand the VFX are good too.<br><br>well this movie is not that underrated, but there are bunch of stupid\nmovies like MAN OF STEEL which make no sense at all. and despite that\nit is hyped with dumb phanboys. ugh.<br><br>Well i recommend this movie bcoz of its good story and the realistic. <br><br>Action: 5/10 Acting: 8/10 VFX: 8/10 Story: 6/10 <br><br>so this movie deserve 6.7/10 Perfect rating :P<br><br>rounding off 7/10 ;)<br><br>Happy Watching :)\n"
"\nThe glorious, innocent, hard working people of Mexico live in squalor\nwhile providing everything for the rich, racist, evil Americans.<br><br>This is a Hollyweird imagining of the illegal immigrant situation. Just\nto make sure you get it, a few extra touches are added.<br><br>- The ships the women and children use to try to get to Elysium for\nmedical attention are called \"undocumented vessels\".<br><br>- The women and children who get to Elysium for medical attention are\ncalled \"illegals\".<br><br>- There's an odd twist on reality. In the real world, criminals,\nincluding rapists and murderers, enter America illegally. But in the\nmovie, the evil, racist Elysium people employ rapists and murderers to\nkill the women and children who try to cross into America, er Elysium.<br><br>It's more progressive fantasy from Hollyweird.\n"
"\nA great idea--wealthy humans have abandoned a demolished Earth for a\nluxury space station, leaving behind the poor and disenfranchised while\ncontrolling them from afar--is ignored in this run-of-the-mill sci-fi\naction flick. It should have a lot of provocative things going for it,\nwhat with its socially conscious topic, but the bulk of the film is\nconsumed with lead Matt Damon getting from point A to point B, facing\nobstacles all the while. By focusing on the surfeit of action, so\nlittle is made of its original conceit that it feels like a wasted\neffort. There are absolutely no surprises in writer/director Neill\nBlomkamp's Hollywood-101 storytelling (there's even a race to save a\nlittle girl dying of leukemia) and no depth to any of the characters.\nDamon is given little to do while Jodie Foster plays the villain--this\nmight have been fun to watch, if only to see her overact and play\nagainst type, but, like everything else that might have mattered,\nBlomkamp could care less.\n"

I fear that many more such\nquestions may occur to you: they did to me.<br><br>The ear-assaulting bombastic Dark Knight music is more unwelcome.\n"
"\nAfter i watched the trailer for this movie, i knew that i had to watch\nit.<br><br>After watching the movie itself, i realized how dumb people are... and\nreviewers also, if you're mind isn't made to understand the movie, than\ndon't watch these, go watch some hunger games or something...<br><br>The movie exceeds on so many levels, the story alone is amazing, the\nacting is fantastic, specially by Sharlto Copley who pulls an amazing\nand believable character.<br><br>The CGI... was the best i have ever seen, there were moments where i\nwas lost, doubting if it's a green screen or real life! They did an\namazing job creating Elysium.<br><br>This movie also had me doubting... what if this really happen? Because\nthey did an amazing job at creating the future, where you start to\nwonder if it really happens.<br><br>The only thing i didn't like was the length, i felt this movie deserved\nmore, 2 hours would've been enough, because the story is very good, and\nit can be that long.<br><br>The action scenes was outstanding! Great sword fighting, and future\nweapons. <br><br>9.5/10\n"
"\nThere is only so much you can say about an movie but this is NOT just\nan movie.

The result is\nan original and well made ​​up a formidable refined edition that keeps\nthe emotions thread a well stylized cinematography among other things.\nThere are science fiction movies we explain a scientific theory, but at\nthe same time there are other science fiction films whose purpose is to\nentertain, Elysium is the second case and makes it the best way. His\ngreat accomplishment cgi used only in times of need. Matt Damon is an\nactor who has good control of their careers by maintaining a balance in\nthe roles you select. Elysium Fields definitely is one of the best\nfilms of the year.\n"
"\nWith all the good looking CGI movies and video games, a movie just with\ngood CGI doesn't make it special anymore.<br><br>As many other reviewers pointed out, there were plots that didn't make\nsense, the story was lacking, and the characters were one-dimensional.<br><br>CGI should be an accessory to a movie and not the main focus.<br><br>I think they spent too much money on CGI and putting every single bolts\nand nuts to the robot body and forgot about the most fundamentals about\na movie: storytelling. It is cool to see very detailed gears,\nspaceships, or robots, but are they really necessary to tell a story? <br><br>In short, if it's a bad story, then it'll be a bad movie. And if\nthere's no story, then there will be no movie at all.\n"
"\nOne of the worst \"sci-fi\" flicks I have ever seen. Give me Transformers\n4 anytime. Not only it's childishly silly in its politics, but the plot\nhas more holes in it than a Swiss cheese (which tastes better). Things\nhappen just because, to please the poor scriptwriter (who's also the\nmovie's director - apparently he couldn't find anyone else to shoot the\nthing). In a \"fascist\" universe people come and go as they please.\nThere's a whole underground society with the highest technology\navailable. One wonders why they don't use it to cure these poor\nchildren. The ships going from Earth to Elysium get shot down or get\nin, whatever the story needs. A highly trained, clever technician gets\nhurt in a way a 10 years old child wouldn't. And then we have these\nheartrending memories of childhood in slo-mo, loads of them, with\nmusic, of course. BTW : the score is laughable. And I have never seen\nJodie Foster that bad. She's a great actress, but if she can pretend to\nbe that bad, it means genius.\n"
"\nTypical left wing propaganda against anyone who is wealthy or\nprosperous. It promotes immigration and socialism. Matt Damon yet again\nshows his ignorance. If all the people on Earth were placed on Elysium\nit would be a desolate waste land in a matter of hours. Don't waste\nyour time or money. This will be the last time I watch a Matt Damon\nmovie. Time to stop supporting liberal Hollywood filth. The rest of\nthis post is to fill up ten lines of text so I can post to this website\nand give my opinion due to the fact I'm sick of reading most others. If\nyour tired of these type of left wing liberal movies please post a\nreview saying so and boycott anything to due with the actors in them\nand directors who work on them.\n"
"\nEvery thing has been said before, except the completely nonsensical\ncomputer that could heal all illnesses and injuries in a couple of\nminutes, even Kruger's face being blown off! Grenade fragments would\nhave entered his brain for a start so he could not have escaped brain\ndamage. Plus where were the fragments which would have been removed?\nThe girl as far as I noted had three completely different illnesses.\nFirst when on crutches she was diagnosed with multiple broken bones,\neven with crutches she could not have been walking, then later as\nhaving seizures and also leukemia A similar computer was seen in the\nmovie Prometheus one year before so maybe they borrowed the idea from\nthere. Jodie Foster was wasted in the movie as she had basically a walk\non part, though projected pure psychopathy in the brief time she was on\nscreen.\n"
"\nSomewhat uninspired, with Sci-Fi as background scenery.<br><br>Uh, well ... Set in the future, where the fiction does not make too\nmuch sense (the rich part of humanity migrated into earth orbit into a\nkind of pepped up ISS) our hero, again Matt Damon, fights his way\nthrough the obstacles. For a just and moral cause, of course. And with\nsome upgrades, compared to the Bourne Saga, a skilled, athletic fighter\nin now semi-mechanized improvements. In essence a classical action\nflick, even the fighting slow-motions are present. The thin story line\nlacks of inspiration, the tale is quite limited. Sci-Fi IMO is just a\nbackground setting without one original idea added that would justify\nthe label Sci-Fi. But in that regard, CGI and settings are well done.\nNot really bad, but I doubt i will watch it again.\n"
"\nI won't say too much about this movie, because it's not worth it. I\njust saw a wasted concept being flushed down the drain. This movie\nstarts with the potential of being a great franchise, but ends up being\nthe most predictable and depressing mess I've seen in ages. Maybe I\nshould give it three or a two grade because of the great intro, but the\nfact that they spoiled this opportunity only makes it worse. This movie\ncould have generated a real and credible critique of the human\ncondition in a society who blindly is moving towards science fiction\ncynicism. No wonder Donald Trump became president when you see how\nHollywood prioritize potential. It's so sad to see the whole movie\nindustry of Hollywood flush itself down the toilet with one movie worse\nthan the other, and trust me, this is one of the worse.\n"
"\nA movie with a profound message, a message that holds for the future of\nwho we are and what will be of us, the human kind. Division, racism,\nunable to find complete cure for the sick and those that die for the\nlack of food and resources. Are crucial examples of what is our modern\nworld, our modern society, but what really scares me the most is that,\nthat is the future that awaits us. Thanks to our mentality. But there\nis hope that everything could change and be better, that's why Elysium\nis a great movie and example. That color is not taken into\nconsideration but integrity and affection was. That humans are able to\nmake the world better, banishing terrorism and hate towards another.\nThat ethnicity and religion should be a personal belief and not\nsomething that should be discriminated. An equal and safer place could\nmean the creation of a more trustworthy future where technology can\nintegrate and perform, but yet facilitate our lives and life more\npeacefully.\n"
"\nThis is a great movie. Okay there are lot of mistakes or questions...\nlike why and how and when? but this is a sci-fi movie :D not everything\nhas to realistic or logic. The end though or the movie is not\npredictable and that makes it special! I just would like to see more of\nElysium! But the movie was really great. I enjoyed it. Bbut of course\ni've seen better. What I also missed is connecting with the actors.\nMost of the time I get emotional with movies ending like this but now I\njust watched and thought huh? that's all? So I'd like to ignore all the\nhate about this movie. If you have time just watch this and judge\nyourself\n"
"\nIf you loved district 9 and looked forward to this then be prepared for\na major disappointment. Could have been such a good movie with a fab\nbasis for the story line and excellent special effects. Really fell\ndown after about an hour and I almost switched it off (bored)after 1.45\nhours. So pleased I did not buy this and waited for it to appear on\nterrestrial TV. The only connection with the brilliant district 9 is\nthat the baddie has a south African accent. Jodie Foster (who I love as\nan actor) is one of the leads but she has just a bit part as a dictator\nwho has a couple of sidekick heavies to look after her whole planet...\nMatt Damon must be embarrassed to have starred in this.\n"
"\nI was expecting more and better than what I got with 2013's Elysium.\nThe cast wasn't bad, in fact, I think Foster and Damon gave good\nperformances and had pretty good on screen chemistry together. The\nissue I took with Elysium, was the poor writing and sorta weak plot\nsummary. The plot summary and execution of it was pretty run of the\nmill, and formulaic. I would've appreciated a little more creativity\nand or originality. This movie was all around a pretty boring\nexperience, it just simply did not entertain me. Jodie Foster was good,\nshe looked stunning in her wardrobe and is impressively good for her\nage. Matt Damon was alright I guess, he was tough in the action\nsequences, which is nice, but he lacked some when he wasn't blowing up\ns**t. The rest of the cast is OK, nothing too bad. Elysium could've and\nshould've been better than it is. 5/10 for Elysium.\n"
"\nThis Sci-Fi drama is about a classic clash of the ridge and the poor\nwhich takes place in the far future. Earth is overpopulated and ruined\nto say the least. To live a healthy life you have to be ridge enough to\nget yourself at a space station made for the very wealthy. <br><br>A film without much chemistry. Too bad because I really like the cast.\nMatt Damon had absolutely no chemistry with Alice Braga unfortunately.\nAnd after seeing Jodie Foster's performance I would almost agree with\nwhat some people say about her that she is the most overrated actress,\nbut she still is one of my favorite actresses.<br><br>The graphics was very good to impressive.\n"
"\nI enjoyed the basic premise, however, if we could colonize space, then\ncould we not also save the earth, it is much harder to build a space\ncolony; and they already had the means to save all the people of earth,\nwith their technology, and they just don't use it; those medical ships\nwere only utilized at the end, it could have been a fifteen minute\nmovie if they sent them in the first place! Also those missiles must\nhave some super propellant to escape the earth for the size that they\nare. And who would go into a radiation chamber, that is primed to\nclose? Is there a police force on the colony? If the robots are\nprogrammed to not arrest citizens, how could humans control crime if\nthe robots interfere with the human officers because by their logic a\ncitizen cannot be arrested, how could these robots even preform their\nprimary function? Ultimately it was a good film, but lacked in some\nareas for me.\n"
"\nTo say that this movie was a disappointment would be to give it more\ncredit than it deserves. Granted, I wasn't expecting to find myself\nwatching Citizen Kane, but Pigs in Space would have given this\npretentious load of drivel a run for its money. Rich people = bad, and\nso they set up camp in a luxurious space station, far, far above. Poor\npeople = the downtrodden, and so they're made to stay on Earth looking\nenviously at the rich people above their heads. This movie probably has\nsome pseudo-political message going on in the background, but sorry, if\nthat is indeed the case, the millions spent on getting it out there\nwent totally over my downtrodden head. And what I wouldn't have given\nto have seen Alan Rickman arriving on the space station just as things\nwere heating up, and as he looked at the carnage around him, he'd shake\nhis head before telling all who would listen: I'm off to the pub.\n"
"\nI've been a fan of Sci-fi and fantasy for as long as I can remember.\nI've seen the bad, I've seen the good, and I've seen life changing.\nElysium is not life changing by any means but it is very good for what\nit was trying to accomplish. Very simply Elysium is a class struggle\nbetween the super elite (on the space station Elysium) and the\nincredibly poor (everyone on Earth). During the story both sides do\nabsolutely horrible things to each other and yet at it's darkest\nmoments it does show a glimmer of what the human race is capable of\nwhen those selfish attitudes that led to such a huge class division are\ninstead replaced by cooperation and determination. I give Elysium a 9\nbecause it isn't a perfect movie by any stretch of the imagination but\nit does lead to some profound philosophical questions and that to me is\nfar more important than any visual effect or Oscar worthy story. Any\nmovie that can introduce philosophical and moral dilemmas (The Matrix,\n1984, V for Vendetta, Blade Runner, etc.) is worth a look at. Watch the\nmovie and make your own judgments.\n"
"\nBut, the ending sequence of this movie makes itself perfect. Brilliant\nplot and inspiring artwork. Still one of my most favorite\nscience-fiction movies.<br><br>If you want to have some sense what is wrong these days. Watch this\nmovie and look closely at its plot story. And then watch The Martian if\nyou want to see a little bigger hint on the our ideal course. Matt\nDamon and the makers of this movie do great work.<br><br>I read somewhere that 50% of all NASA personnel were inspired by\nwatching Star Trek. Star Trek has a story with perspective and has\nsights of an Utopia. The ultimate goal is to explore the universe. It\nseems a lot of homo sapiens need more time to figure that out. Until\nthen I hope to get movies like this to be good teasers.\n"
"\nThis film is one that Neil Blomkamp can be proud of in the visual\nsense, it has great visual effects, great CGI and is in many places\nvery spectacular. He have also made a film that Sci-fi and action wise\nis a great movie, it really delivers both in a great combo. But writing\nis not Mr. Blomkamps strong suit I guess, the story is alright, but it\ndoesn't really capture you and in some ways it is very... lets save the\nworld, and all will be better if we just ...well it gets a bit to much.<br><br>I liked the film in total, I thought it was very entertaining and had\naction, fights, gun battles etc. just as I had hoped for this Sci-fi\nuniverse, it was a good movie, but the end took it down a notch.<br><br>Spoiler alert... I can say that I disliked the ending, why why why do\nwe have to have a happy ending and everyone gets saved and so on and so\nforth. Stop after the line he is a citizen and cut all the crap about\nsending hospital vessels that are ready and standing by to earth and\nall that bullshit.\n"
"\nMy points are for the CGI alone, the rest of the film is too long and\ntoo confusing. <br><br>I have lots of issues with this movie, but I will not go on and on\nabout them, I will just mention my main issue again, why is it so long?\nThis film could have been done and dusted in 80 minutes, but no, it\njust goes on and on, which resulted in me getting bored and wondering\nwhy I bothered going to watch it.<br><br>Oblivion, which is kind of similar, is a masterpiece compared to this\nyawn fest. I see that in the reviews, people are 50/50 in their\nappreciation or condemnation of this film, I am in the latter camp. <br><br>It could have been so good, but I'm afraid the director spent to much\ntime picking scenes where CGI could be incorporated. This detracts from\nwhat isn't a bad premise. Don't get me wrong, the CGI is excellent, its\njust that its over applied in many scenes.\n"
"\nAfter viewing this movie I had a twofold opinion. From one side I\nthought Neill Blomkamp was trying to show in this movie revolution,\ninequality, how dirty is our plant became with all sordid details. From\nanother side I was full of this cliché after watching it. I don't know\nwhy but I had a feeling during watching this movie that Neill Blomkamp\nused same decorations that he used in the \"District 9\" (2009). Just\ninvited Jodie Foster, Matt Damon, Alice Braga, William Fichtner and\nFaran Tahir. Sharlto Copley only changed his costume and personality of\nthe character. That's all. The only reason why I liked this movie is\naesthetics of the Elysium where wealthiest citizens belong and live.\n"
"\n\"Elysium\" puts forth a future in which the rich have taken to outer\nspace to live in disease-free comfort while society's dregs wallow in\nEarth's hellish remains. The protagonist is sick and needs one of those\ncure-all med bays that only service the upper-crust (MacGuffin for the\nwin!). Does Blomkamp do anything with this? No, he just wants to blow\nstuff up and shoot big gins. I wouldn't even call this liberal\npropaganda because it's all there so Matt Damon can go Bourne on\neveryone and kick some ass. And even when he does change the system,\nit's a hollow victory. Any world-building is all in service to the\nrun-and-gun latter half. The bad guys here (heartless CEO Fichtner,\nevil politician Foster with that absurd accent, low-rent sociopath\nCopley) are awful, not at all fleshed out. This is an eyesore with\nnoise standing in for excitement.<br><br>5/10\n"
"\nWhen i've heard that Neill Blomkamp would direct a movie with Matt\nDamon set in a dystopian future, it was a must see. However, after\nwatching it, i understood once again that there is much mot to film\nthan meets the eye. As if the producers took the concept of District 9\nand set it into a favela and dumbed down the concept of a bad-bad-bad\ncorporatocracy providing good life to the happy few and misery to the\npoor majority has been considerably dumbed down.<br><br>Elysium is not a bad movie in itself, rather it hasn't fulfilled it's\npotential. On the positive note you'll see a lot of good non-US actors:\nSharlto Copley, Alice Braga, Diego Luna and (my favorite in this cast)\nWagner Moura.<br><br>Overall, this is a fun movie to watch, but don't expect too much.\n"
"\nUpon hearing my libertarian sister complain that Elysium's\nwealth-inequality theme was \"a bit heavy-handed,\" I knew I would have\nto see it. I watched the trailer several times over - each time wowed\nby the special effects, the visual disparity between Elysium's absolute\ngrace and Earth's poverty and chaos, and Jodie Foster's bizarre accent.\nI had high hopes.<br><br>Not only was the movie itself a completely run-of-the-mill Hollywood\naction film with terrible writing -- the full length film had hardly\nany more narrative than the trailer. Completely unidimensional\ncharacters with no development. No nuance in the plot. And the wealth-\ninequality theme wasn't just heavy-handed, it was entirely a gimmick\nwith no depth.<br><br>I give Elysium 3/10 only for the special effects team, and give 0/10 to\nNeill Blonkamp for his god-awful script.\n"
"\nI'm writing this after only watching once so don't expect much detail\nor correct names of the characters. I'm a massive sci fi film buff and\nlooked forward to this one as Matt Damon is a good watch. The start of\nthis film set a great picture of the intended plot and laid a base of\nwhat could be a great film. But not long in I was thinking ahead and I\nforesaw the end pretty much at the start. The film felt like it started\nat a good pace in order to build to a climactic finale but soon became\nrushed and I felt the acting was hurried and too much happened in the\nmiddle of the film. The attempt of an emotional end was too reminiscent\nof blood diamond . There were hardly any real memorable scenes and\nthere wasn't enough footage of what it is actually like living in\nElysium, no twists and a pretty poor storyline and the end left me\nthinking is this the end or the beginning. On a positive, the special\neffects were great. Too much crammed into one film and left me thinking\nhow Tom cruises 'oblivion' had no competition for the modern sci-fi. I\nfeel a bit let down.\n"
"\nA promising opening quickly turns to disappointment as it becomes clear\nthat Elysium is all show and no substance. I was hoping for more of a\nsci-fi story but this is just a glorified action movie which quickly\nturns pretty tedious. This is a shame as there was plenty of potential\nto explore. <br><br>Elysium is wonderfully realised but there just isn't enough time spent\nhere or learning anything of its inhabitants. Instead the bulk of the\nplot follows Matt Damon as he tries to get there. The story just isn't\nstrong enough to hold your attention. <br><br>Matt Damon is a good actor and he is fine in this as is Jodie Foster\nbut they just aren't given a good enough script to make this the movie\nit should have been. <br><br>Whilst it does have it's moments I found this a desperately\ndisappointing film and it's not one I'd sit through again.\n"
"\nDo not read these reviews , make your own judgment. This movie is not\nabout Elysium or Earth , this movie is about Max (Matt Damon) . People\nhad unreal expectations. I was blown away by District 9 and this movie\nwas no disappointment. In the way things are moving in todays world ,\nthe future envisioned by Neill Blomkamp seems quite accurate. Sharlto\nCopley plays the character of an Elisium marine (mind-fuc*ed by war or\nsomething) extremely well. It is a movie about people and their\ncharacters rather than the world they live in , if you want mindless\njunk then go check out avengers or spider-man. Of course there are plot\nholes, which sci-fi movie doesn't ?<br><br>My only complaint about this movie is the initial 10 minutes about\nMax's past which was too cliché<br><br>Sorry English is not my first language.\n"
"\nI had high hopes for this film because of the director's previous film\nand the star power associated with it. But it ended up feeling so\npredictable and uninteresting in the second half that I left the\nviewing disappointed. The action was OK but I just didn't feel any\nvested interest in the characters. Jodie Foster's character was\nseverely underused in this film that I feel she could have been played\nby any other actor without affecting the film. Matt Damon did a good\njob, as he often does, but his motivation for getting to Elysium felt a\nbit weak. The main standout, as others have said, was Kruger (Sharlto\nCopley). He disappeared into his role and was so different from his\nprevious roles that you could forget it was an actor when watching the\nmovie.\n"
"\n\"Elysium\" is a movie that has to do with a mission that could bring\nequality to the polarized worlds and exactly between the earth where\npoor people live and Elysium where rich people live. The person who is\nresponsible to accomplish this mission is Matt Damon and the bad in\nthis story is Jodie Foster who plays as Defense Minister of Elysium.<br><br>I liked this movie because of the plot and because of the good special\neffects. The things that I did not like I was disappointed were the\ninterpretations of Matt Damon and Jodie Foster. I believe that both of\nthem did not do the best that they could do.<br><br>Finally I want to tell you that if you want to see a simple space movie\nwith nice plot then see this movie, but if you want to see it because\nof the cast then do not see it, you will be let down.\n"
"\nIt's always a problem when first time directors are making a hit or a\nclassic and are asked to make a big budget flick. Let M. Night\nShyamalan be a perfect example. Here we have Neill Blomkamp who after\ndirecting a few Stargate episodes made a big break-through with\nDistrict 9 (2009). He was the next big thing and here we stand with his\nSF big budget Elysium.<br><br>You still can spot some District elements but Elysium will never become\na classic because it does not add anything to the genre. It's just the\nvillain becomes hero story. Don't get me wrong, it's still worth seeing\nand the acting is superb but it's a bit weak on the storyline. <br><br>Not that it is a bad flick, it do jumps out of all the summer releases\nof 2013 and it do has suspense and excellent effects but I just had a\nbitter feeling when it was over. <br><br>Gore 0/5 Nudity 0/5 Effects 5/5 Story 3/5 Comedy 0/5\n"
"\nWhen I first saw this movie I was stuck with the idea that I was not\ngoing to like it. I'm sorry but I don't like Matt Damon and there he\nwas though, in a futuristic science fiction movie! So, yep, I began to\nwatch the movie with low standards and no expectations... But then I\nwas surprised by the simple but somehow efficient story, by the fact\nthat Matt Damon was good in his role and by the amazing way the special\neffects were implanted in the real environment. I really really enjoyed\nthe special effects which were worked at a perfectionist level. Not in\na \"Prometheus way\" but in a realistic way. The special effects we\n\"don't see\" in a movie are for me the best. This movie is a pretty good\nexample of what special effects should be... The story wasn't really\nsurprising though but sufficient. As I said earlier I was only\nsurprised by the fact that I gently entered into the scenario without\nfinding it boring or totally uninteresting. It could have been better\nbut I thought it could have been worst! Then, it was not that bad and\nin fact, a good surprise!\n"
"\ni did not care for district 9 one bit, when i saw this trailer for the\nfirst time i said \"people who love district 9 will hate this movie\".\nand for the most part (with in the people i know) it is true. i loved\nthis movie and i despised district 9. this movie was great, it had\neverything, action, thrills, laughs and the holy S*** moments. the\nstory of the movie was well paced and did not feel like things were\nunnecessary. even my parents who do not like Sci-Fi movies liked this.\nit has a good story. it is a very good movie way better than district\n9, after that movie i asked for a refund, after this movie i felt\nsatisfied.\n"
"\nWhat to say. Effects were nice, background was beautiful, music fit\nright in to their scenes. And above all, The momentum was great when it\nstarted. That's what i want from an action movie.<br><br>The story felt like those other revolution settings everywhere else\nthough. (you can easily guess the ending)<br><br>following lines contain spoilers about ending: The Elysium was made to\nescape the overpopulation in the first place. Now, what happens when\nyou register the whole earth population as citizens of Elysium? That\nwould be complicated story i want to watch next but I know I'll never\nget that chance.\n"
"\nThe movie trailer was superb but when I actually watched the movie I\ngot the idea how much time people actually spend in getting good CGI\ncreating the artificial world and not focusing on actual script.<br><br>The content was so dull and boring that half of the movie was just\nfocusing on the built up of the story. This will actually create\nnegative impression on the viewer. The structure of the story telling\nwas not at all able to keep me engrossed. I was like literally\nforwarding few of the boring scenes.<br><br>But after watching it for 150 minutes I thought I would not have\nrepented if I missed the movie.\n"
"\nObviously a story that has been told before, about rich people getting\nwhat they need while others suffer in poverty and are controlled by\nrobots. But it was still great. Damon was awesome in it and I thought\nthe story line was convincing and enjoyable. I loved the videography,\nthe special effects and the action. It kept me engaged and watching. It\nmade me feel anger and moved me to want to help. I was moved by the\nsocial aspect of it. Jodie Foster has such a limited role, Damon\noutshone her because of it. I would have liked to see her character\ndeveloped a little more. Maybe there is more to the story about\nElysium, it made me want more. I love good Sci-fi and this move is\nworth watching for its moral lesson. The end left me in tears.\n"
"\nThis is your pretty standard good folk versus bad folk piece.\n***Spoilers Alert**** (will try not to though) The age old story of\ncorrupt and unethical elites ruling over the masses, enjoying life\nwhile others are in despair. Pretty straight forward story of a blue\neyed boy dreaming of a better life and ending up giving to others what\nhe didn't get in life. There are a few misses though like how security\nseems to be missing entirely near the end whereas they're beating the\ncrap out of everyone in the beginning but other then that it keeps you\nattached to the flow. A real cinema piece if you get the chance however\nthis is a pretty standard flick don't think the story is gonna leave\nyou in a shock and awe! A late night watch!\n"
"\nAs per the review from \"lornloxor\". I totally will agree with that as\nmuch as Matt Damon has raised the bar over the years with his\nunforgettable movies this was in the end a cold and non attaching\nmovie. It could have been much more intense story wise and the\ncharacters could have been more passionate but that depended on the\nstory line. <br><br>In the end I would just say that it was an overall entertainment just\none time may 2 at the most if one is really willing to but other than\nthat we expect way more from Matt Damon as after the Bourne series his\nbar is in top of the charts and we would love to see something like\nthat in his coming movies. The rest best of luck with your future\nmovies Matt hope to see you in the same or more intense characters as\nyour Bourne movies.<br><br>Peace\n"
"\nVisually full of references to the amazing video game 'Vanquish':\nConcept, droid 'enemy' soldiers, enhanced armor or exo-skeleton,\nweapons, but mostly, the view over the Elysium (a city created on\nspace, but still quite near planet earth where people live a good life,\noppositely to those who live still on the planet. Story is simple but\n'eatable', acting is quite good, with a few surprises, like Jodie\nFoster's role (mean woman), a proper south-African actor (Sharlto\nCopley, good acting) speaking with the right accent, words and tone,\nAlice Braga again showing good acting. Good performance by William\nFichtner, and a couple of great actor not so know from south America: -\nDiego Luna - Mexico - Wagner Moura - Brazil<br><br>Matt Damon had a good performance, but something was missing (the way I\nsee it) that showed at 'Bourne's several movies, and I thought I would\nfind in this character. Globally it's a OK movie, but I believe quite\nbetter one could be re- made with a few more attention on details and a\nbit more 'emotion'. Overall 7 rate\n"
"\nThis was a film I had been looking forward to seeing since I saw\ndistrict 9 and it didn't disappoint me in the sense of excitement, a\nwhole host of great action scenes and inventive weaponry all got two\nthumbs up. This film is an all in all good movie, the only problem is,\nit never becomes more than that, it doesn't have the originality of\ndistrict nine in it's style or story. In a nut shell it was a robin\nhood story in a sci-fi flick, but that aside the film was very well put\ntogether with a good action hero from main man Matt Damon but it was\nSharlto Copley's bad guy that stole the whole show. A miss-casted Jodie\nFoster might take away from some but she has little screen time so\ndon't let that put you off. Overall a great slice of entertainment.\n"
"\nMatt Damon is great in this movie! It is a great movie where the plot\nand action is enough to keep you engaged throughout the whole film.\nVery clever way to look at the dystopian genre, which is one of my\nfavourite genres of media. The acting on all of the characters is well\ndone and the casting is well thought out. In just a few scenes they are\nable to get you attached to a girl dying of leukemia and make you feel\nconnected to her when her and her single mom are kidnapped just for\nknowing the main character, who is being tracked down by a secret group\nwithin the government. Plans to over through the current presidency are\nclever, but a very common plot theme, so that wasn't too good in my\nbooks. Overall it's a very good movie that I would recommend to anyone\nwho loves action and maybe Matt Damon!\n"
"\nClassic rich people get everything and can live forever. Poor are\ndoomed to death and living in slums (guess what same situation is in\npresence :). Story takes part in near future. It wasn't so good, but it\nwas as expected, poor invade the rich part of the world. But it has lot\nof action, so you don't get bored at all. Nice effects, nice fight\nscenes. Some unreal healing power of machines, but all in all good\nmovie. It was fairly rated with 7, I'll give the same. There were some\nparts that could be covered and explained more. Like putting\nexoskeleton on human like it is normal thing done every day. And story\nshould be more dynamic, but it is OK movie. If you wanna action movie\nwithout much thinking you should watch it.\n"
"\nI see so many reviews around here saying this movie is a waste and its\njust bad. I still insist on watching the film on theater though, what\namazes me is how the film delivered its uplifting story we tend to\nmislead our standards with this film because it is not just an action\npack adventure sci-fi theme it have its lesson to tell and not just\nthat it needs to rebuild our thinking of whats with the future ahead.<br><br>I am deeply amaze that today we can now conceptualize our future which\nholds a machine that cures every disease. The movie expresses its role\nto uplift and motivate each one of us that we have a purpose to fulfill\nand in-order to make it happen we should not forget what inspires us.\nMany movies contain an eye opening message about our future but this is\none of those which is kinda realistic for me, because as our resources\nreach its scarcity our world will tend to die itself, even sustaining a\nhealthy life. So we seek ways in order to live better.\n"
"\nAlthough, initially, the film bored me, it became more entertaining\nmid- movie. <br><br>I think the screenplay was below par, as the plot felt a little rushed\nto begin with (like a quick back story to get us up to date), purely to\nset up for the more exciting climax of the film. However, once that was\nover, the storyline suddenly peaked my interest. <br><br>The motivation behind Max's actions were clear, and although in the end\nit becomes a bog standard boy-meets-girl subplot, the whole idea of the\nstory is a redeeming factor. The villains were convincing enough, but I\nfelt the motivation behind Delacourt's actions (other than the standard\n'she was evil') were a tad foggy. <br><br>Overall, the film was not my favourite, but the whole idea of the story\nwas a good one. The acting was good, the fight scenes okay, but the\nscreenplay could have been improved.\n"
"\nReviewed by: Dare Devil Kid (DDK) Rating: 3.5/5 stars<br><br>Is it as good as \"District 9″? No. But it's still a gripping sci-fi\neffort from director Neill Blomkamp. Anyways, \"District 9″ was a\nmasterpiece that's probably hard to replicate, and it's simply unfair\nto judge a Director's subsequent works to his best films. Comparison\nare inevitable and understandable, but a film should ultimately be\njudged on its own merits, and with that note, \"Elysium is a thoroughly\nenjoyable futuristic vision, that's only gets derailed at certain\nremotely sporadic junctures, due to a degree of over indulgence in plot\ncontrivances.<br><br>The film is still worth the price of an admission ticket, because of\nits scope, taut narration, and Jodie Foster's deviously sinister act\n(seriously, the lady can effortlessly just breeze through any role).\nMatt Damon and Sharlto Copley are as reliable as ever.\n"
"\nA real popcorn movie, it's there to entertain and not intellectually\nchallenging. I liked it.<br><br>The only negative thing to be said is that being a South African\nmyself, and Neil Blomkamp being a South African... why would he get\nSouth Africans to fake a South African accent? That was the worse and\nat times so funny (when it wasn't supposed to be) that the whole South\nAfrican audience would end up giggling at the stupidity of it.<br><br>Overall, I still liked the movie though. The storyline was easy to\nfollow and interesting. The acting not too bad, Matt Damon was great as\nusual.\n"
"\nThe film was well put together, and yes, I enjoyed it... But if you are\ngoing to rip off Battle Angel Alita then why not just make a Battle\nAngel Alita movie (or Gunnm for the purists). Change Elysium to\nTiphares, Mat Damon to a female android (Gally) and lack of medical\ncare to illegal organ harvesting, and... oh look!!! its the Battle\nAngel Alita story..... As I said earlier, I did enjoy it and the film\nwas well put together, Mr Damon was well suited to this role, the bad\nguys were suitably twisted and power hungry, the damsel in distress\nwas, well, insipid and boring as hell actually! But there was plenty of\nflying body parts, explosions and all round action to make up for that.\nNot a film I would go out and buy on DVD but worth a look see at least\nonce.\n"
"\nI like dystopian films where there is a hero in the midst taking on a\ndangerous regime, and in this case it is literally a segregationist\nregime (like apartheid South Africa) where the rich are in Elysium, and\nthe poor are relegated to the planet where they have little access to\nfood, health care or even basic hygiene.<br><br>I personally found this a very fitting metaphor for the kind of thing\nthat income inequality leads to and is spot on when it comes to the\nkind of world we can be living in when people just don't care anymore.\nIt's a libertarian paradise! I <br><br>I enjoyed this film and would highly recommend it\n"
"\nElysium.. In a world where people can use an advanced memory stick to\nplug in to people's brains to download information stored, there's an\noption to protect the information, with \"paralyse\" or \"lethal\" options.<br><br>The CEO of the company chooses the lethal option.. and via the link,\nour main guy Matt Damon has the same fate. But what the movie fails to\nexplain is, why would anyone choose the lethal option when once it\nkills you, they can still download the information &amp; save everyone? So\nreally the protection is completely bloody useless other than creating\na dramatic ending.<br><br>While the movie isn't the worst dystopia movie I've watched, I found it\nvery hard to have any form of bond or connection with the characters,\nand multiple plot holes made it hard to really enjoy it.\n"
"\nThis is another movie about a futuristic Earth and it's in shambles.\nBut the rich are living on a space satellite known as Elysium. Matt\nDamon plays Max, a guy that suffers radiation and is going to die. So\nhe's willing to risk everything for a shot at Elysium. He steals data\nfrom some corporate guy that can reboot Elysium and make all its\ncitizens and can be healed.<br><br>Jodie Foster is the defense secretary whom wants to take over and uses\ncovert killer, Kruger, to accomplish her goals but he turns the table.\nNow, the biggest question of the film is what accent was Foster using.\nIt was crazy, what was she thinking.<br><br>Anyways can Max save the day and especially the daughter of his\nchildhood friend.<br><br>FINAL VERDICT: Poor script and the action scenes weren't even that\ngood. Skip it.\n"
"\nI was super disappointed with this movie. I expected a lot more. The\nvoice over work in this movie killed it for me. The lips didn't go with\nthe voice over throughout the movie and Jodi Foster's accent was very\ndistracting. I love movies and being an actor myself I tend to be a bit\ncritical of the simple things that should be corrected. One is the\nvoice over. That's a simple fix that needs to be corrected before the\nfilm hits theaters. I was fixated on the mistakes and lost site of the\nstoryline. Matt Damon is an incredible actor but again the mistakes\ntake away from his performance. Jodi Foster is also an incredible actor\nbut again the little things were overlooked.\n"
"\nElysium is a great film with some outstanding special effects. But how\nthe story was told was not okay. I didn't feel passion of most\ncharacters and the end was cheesy.when I watched the movie it was just\nboring, I was literally disappointed, the action parts was eh... This\nfilm was a total great comedown for director Neill. The should of added\nmore drama scenes and I mean seven stars sometimes in a Negative way.\nThe film has global conditions such as trash humanism health care and\nsome other stuff I found in Wikipedia. It's one of those films of a\ndirty trashy future dramas. Like wall-e except wall-e was way better in\nso many ways like for real. The point is Elysium disappointed me I was\nwaiting like two whole months, it's just the story it isn't as exciting\nas you think it is.\n"
"\nIt's odd but half of the cast felt out of place in this movie. I\nstarted warming to Matt Damon after a while but he just doesn't look\nthe part and his acting is too polished. The mob boss had a similar\nvibe.<br><br>Sharlto Copley was great. I hated him. What a good villain.<br><br>The filming locations are great. It's an unfamiliar wasteland similar\nto District 9.<br><br>It sort of gets dull as soon as they get up to Elysium. Elysium seems\ndull compared to earth. When they finally get up there.. *shrugs* I'm a\nlittle sick of seeing long fight scenes in movies nowadays. After the\ngrenade blew the villains head off, he should have stayed dead.\n"
"\nSince my mom easily fell asleep when she watches slow movie, I rented\nthis one for her and I wasn't disappointed. The movie is well-made and\nentertaining as an action film and you can keep on watching till the\nend. I like the way they set up prop, characters, music, and the quick\npace of the story. However, there is nothing you can learn from it. No\nsignificant theme, just the plain \"the poor will one day fight, if the\nrich beat them down too much.\" and \"you are born for something\" but the\nlatter wasn't well supported by the movie although it tried. I didn't\nfeel touched or moved by the connection between the main character's\nchildhood, his relationship with his childhood sweetheart and his\ncarer, and his triumph at the ending. The script is not that good. And\nthere is much violence in the film as well, sometimes unnecessary, in\nmy opinion. (but which actions movies don't have much violence these\ndays, very rare (sigh!)) In conclusion, watch it if you want to enjoy a\nfun ride. But expect nothing precious or thoughtful.\n"
"\nWell now, what to say, it is bad, I expected worse, so I was pleasantly\nsurprised. Don't get me wrong I'm not saying I was happy with the\nmovie. For the med bed we would have to be much further into the\nfuture, it does an analysis on you, restructures your body on the\nsub-atomic level to repair damages. Really, why then would the earth be\nin the shape it is? With that type of technology the future should be\nmore akin to \"Star Trek\" with it's replicators and transporters and the\nearth in excellent condition. There would be no need for the space\nstation world. Also, the station never tried to stop the shuttle, with\nDamon, yet no codes were given, they were not even told it was coming,\nwhy didn't the defense grid catch that. Clearly a hole is blown in the\nhead of the undercover asset and yet his brain is still functioning and\nthey bring him back, please that was such a bad plot move, 2 other\npeople bleed to death from wounds and yet this guy doesn't, not even\nclose to believable. I could go on but why, wait for it to come to TV.\n"
"\nOnce again, as with all modern day Sci Fi flicks, its all effects, weak\nplot, no message. My biggest bitch, who would build Elysium with no\ndefense? Employ Hans Solo to keep out those pesky Earthlings. Maybe\nJack Reacher can help? WallE is tougher than the citizens of Elysium. <br><br>Come on script writers, quit insulting me, Water World had a better\nscript.<br><br>Elysium, your all flash and no substance.<br><br>Star Wars/Silent Running/The Andromeda Strain/Logan's Run/Blade\nRunner/Etc. Now that's how one does Sci Fi.<br><br>10 lines, BS, I'm not Rodger and Ebert, hell are you happy now IMDb?\n"
"\nTo start, I was a big fan of the originality of District 9 and thought\nthat Elysium would be another cool original Sci Fi movie. After\nwatching it, I couldn't help but think of the countless plot holes and\nnonsensical aspects. Off the top of my head: the robots are hit with\nradiation for no reason, Elysium doesn't have a defence system other\nthan a person firing RPGs from Earth, the robocop guards of one of the\nrichest men in the world have none of the cool weapons we see in the\narmory later. Also, the whole idea of providing medpods to masses\ndoesn't solve problems of overpopulation and crime that still would\nplague Earth.<br><br>The only reason I gave this movie a passing grade is the wonderful\nperformance by Sharlto Copley. I would describe it as an almost\npsychotic T-1000. Absolutely loved his South African accent and slang\n(Boykie!).\n"
"\nAs an ordinary film fan I was really looking forward to this movie -\nthe idea of the story about an Earth that was cactus and an orbiting\nutopia seemed really appealing, and that's largely where it stayed.<br><br>Jodie Foster's character was ill-conceived and her accent (whatever it\nwas supposed to be) was very detracting from her performance. Surely\nsomeone must of realized in the first few scenes that it was a shocker\nand would have been better just to have canned it.<br><br>Overall I found the movie to be quite disjointed with story-lines\neither glossed over, thrown in, or dumped completely. Maybe if the\nmovie had been longer than a lot of the story could have been fleshed\nout some more. The CGI was impressive and there were a couple of\nhumorous scenes in the movie. <br><br>This movie is one worth watching when there is nothing else to do, but\nits unlikely that you'll watch it again.\n"
"\nAfter District 9, I was really excited to see what this director would\ndo next. More gritty dystopia? Damon and Foster are on board? Something\nabout a bone saw? Count me in!<br><br>However, Elysium was a major, *major* disappointment. The plot is\nformulaic, often non-sequitur, and riddled with plot-holes. There are\nno characters, only caricatures. The script is terribly unimaginative,\nthough I'm sure the actors did the best they could with the material\nthey were given (except maybe Copley - I thought he was out of his\nleague). And don't get me started on the editing.<br><br>Such squandered potential. Maybe there would be hope in an extended\ndirector's cut.\n"
"\nAlthough I had been waiting to watch this movie ever since a friend\nshowed me the trailer, after we had watched District 9, I felt that it\nwas not exactly what I had hoped it to be. There are some plot holes,\nand the whole \"leaving Earth and arriving in space within a matter of\nminutes\" was -to my eyes- tackled a bit naively. All this is not\ndisturbing in watching the film, the effects are great throughout, but\nthe characters are somewhat poorly developed. Seemingly bad guys\nturning into likable characters within seconds of an unconvincing\ndialogue. Jodie Foster gives a good performance, albeit not her best,\nMatt Damon is who he is, the bad guys are very bad, and the good are\ntoo good. In a nutshell, I would recommend watching this film, because\nit is a good idea, but do not expect stuff you have not seen before. If\nI had to compare it to District 9, well... I just can't.\n"
"\nWhen I watched district 9,last year, I just became impressed. I thought\nthis director was a genius! He made a social critic in a sci-fi movie.\nHow have he done that?<br><br>I was so much anxious to see Elysium , especially because I've seen the\ntrailer and the plot seemed to be similar to D9 : a far-fetched\nreality, where the wealthy live in an isolated place, without diseases\nor suffering, at the same time that the majority of human race still\nlives in Earth in extreme poverty, with miserable lives. It sounds very\ninteresting don't you think?<br><br>But the fact is that Elysium is completely frustrating, the plot is\nterrible and the end is so predictable that after watching 20 minutes\nof the movie , I could already say what would happen in the end!\n"
"\nI had been waiting for Blomkamp's new film since District 9, and I was\nnot disappointed. Amazing FX throughout, the shots of the station are\ntruly beautiful, and so is the rest of the photography. But one of the\nmost entertaining things are the designs of machinery, vehicles, and\nsuch. (what could you expect, really, if Weta is involved, obviously,\nit's going to be great...) Sharlto Copley's acting is spot on for his\ncharacter, bringing to life one of the most brutally likable villains I\nhave seen in a long time. It's definitely a popcorn movie, do not watch\nexpecting some life changing revelation, but if spending a couple of\nhours truly entertained is what you want, then this is surely a great\nfilm.\n"
"\nif you are a rich person who has a heal it all machine ¿woudn't you\nrent it? ¿to make more money perhaps? ¿why go to space? ¿whoudnt it be\neasier to build an habitat on earth? ¿whou feeds the billions on earth?\nit's clear that the writer/director has all the guilt fantasies of rich\npeople who have never known a poor person not all poor people are\nMexican gangster, most of them are hard working, decent, clean and good\npeople. 4, just because of the CGI, awesome, the rest, included Jodie\nFoster's performance (she only lacks the mustache to be a matinée\nvillain)horrible. not to forget....you have the entire code for the\nsurvival of your habitat in only one place, and with no-one guarding\nit?\n"
"\nI was not expecting much from this movie at all, I conceded to go\nbecause my husband really wanted to watch it. Whereas I am very\npessimistic when it comes to new movies as usually they are unoriginal\nand unexciting and I hadn't seen a good science fiction in a long\nwhile. Though Elysium has a lot of action scenes it is still very much\na science fiction film. The vision of the future was very realistic and\nthe grit of the film gave me the feeling that what was happening could\nreally happen. Elysium is a brilliant film, sometimes hard to watch but\nthe fact that it could make me feel so emotional I think is the mark of\na well made movie. If you like science fiction or action this is a\nfantastic movie and I highly recommend it.\n"
"\nElysium is one time watch movie.The concept of the movie is new but\nplot is same as we are watching sci-fi movies.Story has not that much\npower that force to catch you in every scene.Pace of the movie is\ntotally slow.The Elysium that has been shown in the movie is speechless\nand stunning.In action everybody has done a brilliant job.Movie's flow\nis not constant that engage you till the end.Climax is superb and full\nof action.Middle part is boring.Movie's length is 1:44 hrs still you\nget bored in so many scenes.Go and watch it one time just to relax and\nto see another world.If there will be more sequences on Elysium than\nearth then it would be marvelous.Pace should be fast.Just like audience\nenjoy climax whole story must be that engaging.Overall,one time watch\nand not recommended.\n"
"\nI am not quite sure how this movie received 7 in IMDb ratings. The plot\nis unoriginal, the ending is predictable, the heroine is not terribly\nattractive...I am usually not going to movies which are under 7 per\nIMDb and I feel like I should now raise it to 8 to avoid stuff like\nthis. I love Matt Damon but he could not do anything to save this\nmovie. This is a movie about which you want to forget after you watched\nit, like if you had a bucket of terribly unhealthy poutine french fries\nand you don't want to admit to yourself that you fell that low.<br><br>The movie generally was not funny at all. The only part that did strike\nme as funny was that while the initial problem with Earth was its over\npopulation, in the end the Earth received a lot of medical help that\nwas supposed to cure all diseases. That would hopefully make all Earth\ncitizens healthy enough to fight for food and kill each other.\n"
"\nNeil Bloomkamp presents Elysium, or should it be District 9 Part 2? The\npremise is pretty simple: in the future, the Earth gets overpopulated\nso the rich travel to a space station called Elysium where they live a\nluxurious life. In Elysium, director Bloomkamp once again chooses the\nway of the social message, masking it with a very entertaining and\nvisually impressive action drama. Nothing to blame there. The directing\nis fine, we have many great actors, a thrilling plot, a true\nblockbuster. The thing is that in terms of model, this is exactly the\nsame movie as District 9, sharing most of its ideas, only adding a\nbigger budget and a better cast, losing like that all the originality\neffect that District 9 was so praised about, even if it was a bit\noverrated at times. Like that, Elysium is just a competent blockbuster,\none of 2013s best but certainly not the masterpiece many were\nexpecting. Visit thefadingcam blog for more!\n"
"\nOkay I understand that this is supposed to be a \"summer blockbuster.\" I\nalso get that it's an original story from a director who did a good job\nwith District 9. That being said, I didn't like this movie because\nalthough Matt Damon did a good job, all the other actors did horrible.\nIt was a stupid plot first of all. Secondly, if all Matt Damon has to\ndo is turn himself into a robot or whatever why doesn't everyone else\njust make something similar? <br><br>The whole movie dragged on to a point where I fell asleep on my couch\nwatching. That is enough to get a poor rating itself. <br><br>S.J\n"
"\nI truly appreciate what the film-makers are trying to tell in this\nJesus Christ-inspired tale, however, it goes over the top with\ngratuitous violence, and lurid maiming. Know that this kind of movie\ncould have been made without violence, swearing, profanity etc. I\nappreciate the visual details and enjoy the thought of someone \"saving\"\nhumanity, however, this can be done in a non-violent manner. Know that\nChrist is all, and that Christ forgives, so that this movie and all\nmovies that contain falsity are rendered safe to see. I would urge\nparents not to take their children to see this movie as it contains too\nmuch violence, profanity, and adult situations. Enjoy the thought of\nChrist in your heart, and know that you are Forgiven. Know that this\ntype of film goes too far in the wrong direction toward losing its way,\nwhen it had an interesting \"premise\" about a \"man\" saving humanity from\ndisease, hardship, and suffering. I urge \"Hollywood\" to stop including\nso much violence into these movies, and let the story lead the way.\n"
"\nI give this 3/5 stars. It was entertaining. Not the best, not the\nworst. I wouldn't say WOW or anything, but it was a fun night out. The\nplot was good but predictable. The acting was decent. The special\neffects were so so. Matt Damon was, well, Matt Damon. The standard\nperformance from a 'Bourne' type movie. Action scenes were good and the\nbad guy was pretty tough. It really was not that believable of a movie\nbut if you can use your imagination you can get into it. My advice...\nif you really want to see it, rent it on DVD. You can do better. If\nyou're really into sci-fi, check out the new Star Trek: Into Darkness!\nOverall, I give it a 7 out of 10 or B- grade.\n"
"\nElysium tried too hard to duplicate the originality of District 9,\nwhich caused it to fall short. Matt Damon, disappointingly made little\nconnection to his character, becoming a glorified Robocop instead of a\nredemptive and memorable vigilante (like Jodie Foster in The Brave One;\n2007). Writer/director Neill Blomkamp hit a home-run with his first\nendeavor into the Sci-Fi realm and made quite a smart move when casting\nnot-so well-known Sharlto Copley as the lead in District 9. However,\nplacing Copley as the renounced, uncivilized foe to Damon in Elysium,\nmade him seem comical; like watching Road Runner string the Coyote\nalong through a series of useless gags.<br><br>http://themovie-geist.blogspot.com/\n"
"\nYep, this was a bit of a let down.<br><br>If you haven't seen Oblivion yet, do so.<br><br>Oblivion is the calibre of film I'd expect, given that it's got Matt\nDamon.<br><br>Story is weak and predictable.<br><br>Also, seems like this is a Hollywood version of District 9. Only not as\ngood.<br><br>I actually went to see this in the cinema, but now I wished I waited\nfor DVD/Bluray.<br><br>In summary, story: poor, acting: not much need for it given poor story,\nbut passable. effects: good<br><br>Given Mr Damon's Bourne trilogy, this is several levels below that.\n"
