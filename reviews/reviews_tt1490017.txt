"\nThe Lego Movie is a winner on several levels. There is a good amount of\nclever gags and I was constantly bursting with laughter. I was\nsurprised by how it contained so many memorable cameos, pop icons and\nfilm references, providing a strong nostalgia factor to older viewers.\nThe playful approach towards movie clich√©s made it a really enjoyable\nand refreshing watch. The animation is absolutely stunning and the\nblend of CGI with stop motion worked brilliantly. Everything can be\nattachable, making the vibe of each scenario feel very unique and\nunlike anything you've ever seen. The Lego Movie has plenty of heart\ntoo by the end of the journey and it's going to be really tough for\nanother animated film to surpass its inventiveness and charm.\n"
"\nThis is my first review. I never wrote a review because I felt other\nIMDb member had captured what I felt like saying. You may think it's a\nmistake to see this movie because it's just a \"toy\" movie. But that's\nwhat makes it so brilliant. There are so many well known characters\nthroughout the film, and it's rare to see such great character\ndevelopment.<br><br>Even though there are so many it's really the charming Emmet (Chris\nPratt) who steals the show. <br><br>It really was a LOT better than the previews made it seem. Charming\nfrom beginning to end, with a few surprises you won't expect. The less\nsaid, the better.\n"
"\nIf you watch the trailer and you think its just gonna be a fun\nstop-motion animated Lego movie, you were wrong. The Lego Movie is\nbeyond fun. its creative and it brings back a lot childhood memories.\nThe story was amazing, the jokes were hilarious, and they have great\nintention in details.<br><br>But, the most important thing, the movie remind us to be creative.\nBecause sometimes, As we grow up, in someway, we stop being creative\nand just follow the rules and instruction. For adults, this movie will\nbring back your childhood memories and how you used to play randomly\nwith those Lego. And for a kids, you'll just love this movie, and\ndefinitely makes you want to play with your own Lego.<br><br>totally worth watching movie! even your grandparents will enjoy this\nmovie! 9/10\n"
"\nWent to see it with my brother. With the age difference between us we\nboth loved the movie for different reasons. For me it was superb. It's\namazing to see how lego people in a world made by lego, live and\ninteract with each other. There were some funny moments for kids and\neven some moments for adults too. Overall it is a very enjoyable movie\nand it is sure to remind you of your childhood. I recommend it to\nanyone who has ever played with any form of lego whatsoever. You'd be\nsurprised to see how relevant this movie will feel. <br><br>I think all people from all ages can find something in this movie that\nwill warm their heart. A timeless classic for sure.\n"
"\nThis film has great animation and a great story, it has an all star\nvoice cast example Morgan freeman and will Ferrell. This film will be\nup on the shelve as one of the greatest films ever animated, ever\nthought about and ever written. When I was a kid playing with Lego I\nnever thought to my self that they will make a film on it now that they\nhave all my Christmases have come at once. Cant wait for the special\nfeatures on blue ray. This movie will be up there with toy story 1 2\nand 3 , the lion king , frozen and wreck it Ralph. The power of good\nfilms are in Lego hands people are genius congrats to all the Oscars\nfor the road ahead\n"
"\nI usually enjoy children's films more than my children (Shrek and Toy\nStory being two examples). This one didn't quite hit the mark with me.\nThere's enough to keep the children amused throughout and the graphics\nare what you would expect from today's CGI standards. However, the\nhumour doesn't sparkle like the titles I mentioned above, and the whole\nfilm had a claustrophobic feel to it, a bit like Tron Legacy. The\nending, though charming, was a little lame, I felt. I went to see it\nbased on the score given by previous viewers, but won't be bothered if\nI don't see it again. One other gripe - the continual playing of the\n'Everything Is Awesome' song became very irritating- even the children\ncommented on this.\n"
"\nI go to see this movie with other four people, and neither of us like\nit. I was so disappointed, because the trailers make the movie seems\nlike a really funny, unexpected and unique adventure. So, when I came\nhome and know that have a 8.9 in IMDb is just make me feel worst.<br><br>In my case, the humor is not funny, is like they try so hard, the\naction scenes are to fast to really enjoy them and I found the plot no\ninteresting at all. And the worst was the characters, which aside of\nBatman, were too plastic, predictable and just boring for my taste.<br><br>To me, this is just a huge commercial from Lego, but that's just me.<br><br>People really like this movie, and that's great! I'm happy that people\ncan see thing in stuff that I don't, but personally, I found this movie\nalready very overrated.\n"
"\nOne of many done in good crop of animations that cinema is providing\nincreasingly more often. A definitive example of smart and edgy script,\nwhich can enjoy brilliantly the legacy of one of the most popular toys\nof all time. <br><br>A universe that seems to come from a psychedelic hallucination in\nbreakneck pace, is narrated the journey of Emmet, the most common Lego\ncharacter, that quiet life amidst the building blocks, will become a\ntrue hero. <br><br>Masterfully using the resources of dystopian fiction plus lots of\nhumor, and a visual that never fails to impress, \"The LEGO Movie\" is\ntailor- made for generations accustomed to the pace of video games,\nthat with quite a collection of characters charismatic , a ton of\ncolors and creativity, will deliciously take you until the surprising\nand affectionate outcome that celebrates the power of childish\nimagination.\n"
"\nStarted watching without any expectations at all. <br><br>What an incredible experience it was. The whole film balances really\nwell between drama, action movie and a hilarious laugh-out-loud comedy.\nEnding had an unusual twist and added depth to the storyline. More\nover, this is a story from which almost everyone could learn something\nnew. <br><br>I really loved the way the heroes were chosen - it was like a bubbling\nmixture of superheroes, magicians and well-known cartoon heroes in\ngeneral. <br><br>Again this is a reminder that we can be much more than society tells us\nto be. This movie should be definitely watched on big screen because of\nmany little details. Definite must see!\n"
"\nCute movie. That's about it. A few, funny references and jokes. It's\nnot at all an 8/10. I rented it from Redbox for $1.20 and it was well\nworth that price. I will write more lines because IMDb insists on a\nminimum content. Not sure why. My opinions about the movie were easily\nexpressed in the first, two sentences. I will simply fill in wasted\nwords and a waste of my time because this site has become so full of\nitself. Used to be a genuine place to investigate and review movies.\nNow, we have to log in, verify ourselves as ourselves and type\nencrypted words to be \"accepted\". Seems to me that Hollywood doesn't\nreally want \"every man's\" opinions. They are happy to stay within their\nown world.\n"
"\nMy son has been raving about this film for months including singing\nTHAT song.<br><br>When I initially got around to watch it I dozed off, granted I was\ntired. I decided to re-watch it later when I was more refreshed. Looked\nat a different perspective the film was better and less annoying.<br><br>I could never fathom how they made an animated film about Lego. The\nwhole idea sounds bizarre on paper. Its actually lo-fi CGI with added\ninventiveness. So a clone worker is suddenly mixing it up with Batman,\nGandalf and Han Solo (all legoised) as well as fighting the evil Lord\nBusiness.<br><br>The film then switches track with its underlying message that kids just\nwant to have fun with toys and play with them rather than dad having a\nprized collection, all neat and tidy. Something I might be guilty of\nmyself according to my offspring!\n"
"\nAn ordinary Lego construction worker (Chris Pratt), thought to be the\nprophesied 'Special', is recruited to join a quest to stop an evil\ntyrant (Will Farrell) from gluing the Lego universe into eternal\nstasis.<br><br>As much as I dislike posting reviews with spoilers, this will have to\nbe one in order to justify my lower rating. For the most part, until\n66% or maybe even 75% of the movie, I really thought this was one of\nthe best animated features I had ever seen. It looks great, the story\nis good (even if the message is a bit lame and blunt), and there are\nsome genuinely funny moments with old characters in new situations\n(Lando and Batman, for example).<br><br>But here is where they lost me: the introduction of human, live action\ncharacters. When the already obvious message of being against\nconformity and growing up suddenly gets even more obvious by showing\nthe interaction of father and son, it loses me. Why do we have to go\nthere? And why do we have to have the Lego universe exist in a kid's\nimagination and not some real place?\n"
"\n*** WARNING! SPOILER ***<br><br>The movie overall was great! Really funny beginning and a interesting\nmiddle, but the end.... Disappointing! If they kept it animation all\nthe way through, it would have been a fantastic movie! (8 Stars).<br><br>The beginning was great! Absolutely Fantastic! The song was very\ncatchy; I had it in my head for hours! The suspense was good, very\nunpredictable!<br><br>The ending when they turned it into real-life felt like Phil Lord or\nChristopher Miller (writers) couldn't figure out a better way of ending\na nice movie!<br><br>Conclusion: Nice film but be prepared to be disappointed.\n"
"\nJust watched The Lego Movie last night...wow...I haven't laughed this\nhard OUT LOUD at a movie in so long! As a Lego fan growing up, I was\neager to see it after the great reviews, and it surely didn't\ndisappoint. All the characters are alive and downright hilarious...from\nBatman to Green Lantern and Kitty and Abe Lincoln. I can't give away\nthe plot, but it is clear the producers and directors also have an\naffinity with Legos. The underlying message comes across as fresh; a\nmessage everyone can relate to. I enjoyed the ending, although when it\ncame I was exhausted from laughing and giggling for an hour and a half.\nThis movie earns the high marks due to the attention to detail, the\nhumor, and the funny story. A definite 10.\n"
"\nDid I miss something, 'cause I don't know WHY they made \"The Lego Movie\n, except , possibly to sell more Legos. This is a giant piece of\nadvertising for the ubiquitous Lego toys , that goes on for two hours,\nand seems to be designed for children under the age of 6, because I\ncan't even think of what it was like to sit in a movie theatre watching\nthis giant toy fest! To think that adults are raving about this\nextended Saturday morning toy commercial is kind of shocking , unless\nthese adults are completely afflicted with a strong dose of ADD &amp; ADHD!\nI have a hard time watching a lot of digitally designed animated\ncartoons , but to watch a bunch of Lego toys move around , dance and\nsing like they were real things , and to have people respond to it like\nit's great entertainment , is very strange , and a little disturbing.\nOK , I get it , it's a commentary on how conformity is a bad thing ,\nand how we are all individuals , but the fact that people responded to\nthe way they did, just shows to me that people love conformity.\n"
"\nThis movie was so so SO overrated. The jokes were terrible and Emmett\nwas insanely annoying! I mean the first line was, \"He's coming. Cover\nyou butt.\" The moment I heard that line, I knew the movie was gonna go\ndownhill from there. And I was right! The jokes flew by so fast, they\nwent right over my head. But the ones I did get... weren't funny at\nall. Now I will admit I enjoyed the character Unikitty (I know, a\ncat/unicorn. Stay with me). She was pretty funny with the whole\nhappiness thing and she kept saying no about the negative stuff (it's\ncalled irony). Plus the ending got boring. Around the time the people\nappeared on screen, the line cues got slower and slower (and more\nboring). Most people have been saying that the ending sucked (it did),\nbut I like it because the movie finally ended. Anyway, this movie is\nbad! The only reason why I'm giving it a generous 5 is because the\nanimation actually was awesome. That was one of the few good things\nabout this movie. So unless you only pay attention to the animation and\nnot the story line, this is not for you.\n"
"\nI absolutely hated this movie. Having paid for my family around ¬£10\neach to watch what is basically an advert for Lego, I just feel\ncheated. I didn't find the cheeky nods and winks to other classic films\nfunny, I didn't find the script funny. It was too loud, too slow, too\n... rubbish for me to watch. I'm not sure if this is a spoiler or not\nbut I have no idea what the ending was about, the whole Will Ferrell\nthing with it's preachy lesson of adults forgetting the value of being\nable to be creative - complete tosh. My family felt the same by the\nway. No amount of reading the rave reviews with explanations can hide\nthe fact that this film simply does not live up to the hype.\n"
"\nWhat happens when you mix parody and product placement for a toy brand\ninto one film? you get yourself The Lego Movie, one of the greatest\nanimations of the 2010's. Plus there is also the great voice acting\nspecially from Liam Neeson who plays bad cop/good cop. The film follows\nthe history of Emmet (voiced by Chris Pratt), an ordinary and generic\nlego construction worker who found the Piece of Resistance and is\nprophesied to be the \"Special One\", the hero who will save the universe\nfrom lord Business (voiced by Will Farrel). As I said this movie is a\nparody of chosen one histories where Emmet is \"the most interesting,\nimportant and talented person of the world\" but when he is just a\ngeneric lego toy. The irony about this film is that it somewhat\ncriticizes capitalism (the monopoly of big companies , being alienated\nby these companies, etc.) but it's one of the biggest product placement\nof all time to be presented in a movie.\n"
"\nThe movie was very enjoyable, well-acted, well-written, and visually\nbeautiful. Unfortunately, I can't give this a 10 because the first 20\nminutes or so drag a bit.<br><br>However, the not-so-good beginning part lasts for only about 20-30\nminutes or so, and it gets better later on. The second half really\npicks up, with lots of emotional resonance and excitement.<br><br>Also, I wasn't a fan of Lego toys to begin with in the first place. I\nnever really got into them when I played them as a 5-year-old.\nNevertheless, I still managed to enjoy this movie for what it was.<br><br>+ Fun<br><br>+ Well-voiced<br><br>+ Visually beautiful<br><br>+ Good script<br><br>- Drags in the beginning<br><br>Score: 9.\n"
"\nContent is over the head of children of age to be playing with Legos.<br><br>Yes, some of the humor is funny reference for adults and the graphics\nare excellent...but that's about it.<br><br>The story line/plot could be any of 90% of movies, animated or not. I\nhave no idea how people review this as top notch with a straight face.<br><br>It's an ad they got you to pay for or, at least spend over an hour and\na half to watch.<br><br>I have to write at least 10 lines of text for some bizarre reason here\non IMDb. Some reviews simply don't need that much.<br><br>Seriously\n"
"\nThis is a film that I contemplated seeing for a long time. It appeared\nto be another one of those young kid movies with cool explosions and\nsome boring clich√©s. While yes, the movie certainly contains those,\nthere an underlying message in this film that is undeniably\nheartbreaking for all ages. The strict Lord Business, the boring\nEmmett, the fun and rebellious Wildstyle; it all comes together with\nsuch grace and entertainment and is surely one of the best animated\nfilms of all time. Show your kids, show your parents. This film will\nremind you what its like to be a kid and also remind you that sometimes\nit's necessary to break a few rules.\n"
"\nIt's a nice movie but I wouldn't say it was awesome. Concept was good\nbut nothing revolutionary and it was a little bit clunky in its\nexecution. I did actually enjoy the Lego format though. It brought back\nmemories of when I was little and I used to love building with Lego...I\nmean who didn't. I still can't help myself if I have a pile in front of\nme. All the old references were classic and what made it fun.<br><br>While the characters were a little one-dimensional they were lovable. I\ncared about them enough to keep me engaged in the movie, especially\nEmmet. The cameos and different Lego lands were also cool and turned it\ninto a proper motion picture instead of a TV movie. So not my favourite\nmovie of all time but it was a good movie.\n"
"\nFor me, watching The Lego Movie was more about remembering my childhood\nmore than the actual story.<br><br>Visually it was extremely impressive how everything in the movie world\nrepresented a Lego set with all the foreign objects that also got lost\nin the Lego rubble. It made me want to search out my old Lego and just\nbuild everything again.<br><br>Jokes wise it has caters for everyone, with jokes about pop culture to\nobvious slap stick for the kids seeing though it is primarily a movie\nfor kids.<br><br>In a strange way the most impressive aspect of the film was how it\nstayed true to the Lego franchise. The story while borrowing plots from\nothers still seemed original and the voice overs were clearly top notch\nwith the star studded cast.<br><br>Parents should definitely not fear buying this for their kids and they\nmight even catch you watching it by yourself.\n"
"\nThe voice talent (read acting talent) that is here, is amazing. The\nmovie itself is very creative to say the least, something you might\nhave done when you were a kid too. Going places letting your mind fly,\nnot setting up barriers. At least that's how it feels to me. And the\nmovie makes a point of it.<br><br>While the movie is going on there is one big twist that will either\nshock you entirely (like myself) or you have read about it and it won't\nbe as shocking as it could be. It doesn't make the movie less good. Try\nto watch it as open minded as you can and enjoy the jokes (some taken\nfrom movies) and feel your inner kid enjoying himself again ... no\nmatter your age\n"
"\nI'm not sure whether it is good or bad, but there were no kids at all\nin the theater when I watched the Lego movie - It was the last\nscreening of the day and there weren't too many adults around either. I\nsaw the 2d version of the film, but suspect the visuals may have been\neven more impressive in 3d. <br><br>The Lego movie tells the story of Emmet who is a very ordinary lego\nfigure mistaken for the chosen one who will save lego. He has to escape\nthe attentions of the evil Lord Business who wants to end the universe\nand the good cop/bad cop who is tasked with finding him by Lord\nBusiness. He is helped along the way by Wyldstyle who recognises that\nhe is the chosen one. <br><br>The movie is fast paced with loads of action and cameos by numerous\nfaces from popular culture. I will not spoil the surprise by listing\nthese, but the film is great fun from start to finish. I suspect the\nhumour will appeal more to adults than children, but don;t have\nanything to back up this gut feel. Good fun!!\n"
"\nWhen I was a kid I used to love building with legos. I suppose back\nthen I might have liked this movie a bit better, but today I really\nthink it's lousy. A movie about legos is a great idea, but much of the\nfilm is rather awkward and confusing. It's hard to keep track of what's\nwhat. For a little while I was actually having a hard time staying\nawake. What makes it especially weird is how it eventually starts\ntransitioning from the fantasy animated world to the real world. I can\nsee why some people may like this, but I find it to be basically just a\nweird interruption. If the movie had started out in the real world\nbefore going into the main story, it would've made a little more sense.\n"
"\nI'm an old fart as far as this Lego thing is concerned. I remember them\nfrom when I was a kid, of course, but that was before they started\ndoing all the stuff with them that they do now. In my day you could\njust build buildings with them. Not really special buildings either,\njust ordinary stuff. We also used to tie onions on our belts because\nthat was the style at the time, but I'll leave that story for Grampa\nSimpson to tell. Anyway, the voicework is great. I especially liked\nMorgan Freeman as Vitruvius. The story is surprisingly pretty good. I\nwas expecting something kind of dumb but it's actually a fun movie and\nsmarter than I thought it would be. It's something both kids and adults\ncan enjoy. Oh, and I thought the double decker couch was a good idea.\nSue me.\n"
"\nWow, just wow! Having grown up with Lego through the 70's &amp; 80's and\nliking nerdy things (Star Wars, Super Heroes and fantasy/Dundeons &amp;\nDragons), this movie was just pure awesomeness . Along with the\nnerd-fest, the CGI (computer graphics) actually looks more like old\nschool stop-start motion animation. To be honest, I have grown to hate\nCGI. It is over used and has a certain cheap look to it. The animation\nbased company that did the animations in this film have achieved\nperfection here by making the movie look like stop-start motion\nanimation and creating a sense that the Lego is real. A big thumbs up\nto the Australian CGI company that was hired for this job. Oh yeah, the\nStar Wars scene was awesome.\n"
"\nThe Lego Movie was a spectacular movie for my wife and kids, they\nenjoyed it thoroughly. The voice talent was also comedic and not over\nthe top type of comedy. Emit and Wildstyle were the most lovable\ncharacters by far. We only wished the film was a bit longer because my\nthree kids couldn't get enough of it but I suppose that was for the\nbetter as it leaves room for more in the future. The Lego Movie is a\nbit reminiscent of a childhood cartoon I used to watch called \"GoBots\"\nwhere my favorite character or hero was sort of the weak link of the\nbunch. In all, Lego Movie was fun for ages 5 to 80 and the marketing\nhas been off the wall! I give this movie a 9 out of 10 simply because\nthe \"Awesome\" song was sung in the car all the way home.\n"
"\nLego Movie is almost in a genre of its own, appealing to kids but I\nsuspect adults will like it more. It's entertaining, with many\ngenuinely hilarious moments, so with respect to shelling out 20+\ndollars for a 3D ticket - YES it's worth it. As a film it feels a\nlittle more uneven, but the proceedings are so creative that they kinda\ndefy criticism<br><br>I was really taken by the opening sections, the introduction into the\nworld with the ecstatically happy music and utopian Lego urban\nlandscape I thought was brilliant. But overall I felt there the mocking\ntone overtook the sincere areas and it ultimately makes the surprise\nending hard to take seriously, or to feel moved by. <br><br>It's crazy fun though - especially in 3D.\n"
"\nThe Lego Movie was not exactly what I expected it to be. It was much,\nmuch better!<br><br>I thought going in to see this with my date that I was being dragged\ninto something that would just be a glorified and over hyped commercial\nfor Lego products and toys. What I got instead was a fantastic movie\nthat was really enjoyable for both children and also adults, with some\nreally great jokes.<br><br>The voice acting was top notch and the story was pretty good,\nespecially for a kids movie. Although it wasn't perfect the Lego movie\nis definitely worth seeing!\n"
"\nThis film is probably one of the best films I've ever seen. I'm amazed\nwith how everything is made of Lego. Not just do children love it but\nso do adults. If you ever get the chance to choose a film to go out to\nwatch choose the Lego movie. The reason I've given it ten stars is\nbecause it's funny, inspiring and awesome! when I went to see it almost\nevery one was laughing. There are no dull bits or boring bits in it at\nall. i think it's epic how they put in Lego city, Lego star wars and\nloads more! This film I'd recommend it to absolutely anyone. I was\nlaughing the whole way through the movie! it's the most creative film\nI've ever seen. Whatever you do GET BUYING TICKETS!!! By Archie, aged 8\n"
"\nMy son &amp; I had a blast watching the Lego Movie. Very funny for adults\nand children. I loled at some parts , great sound track . Very good\nstory made me remember what fun it was to play as a kid and how much I\nmiss that. Had a lot of action too. I would totally see this again. I\ngot that Awesome song stuck in my head. This movie made me way happier\nthan I should be. Even hours later while writing this I am still\nfeeling happy. That is weird right? I mean I am normally not unhappy\nbut I am just not happy either I mean I am just normal feeling but I\nchecked..... Yep Still feeling happy ..... weird but not \"WEIRD\" weird\n, just good weird I guess?. You ever notice that weird is kinda weird\nwhen you spell it it just looks weird ... like kinda wrong but ya know\nyou spelled it right. That is weird ... I think I am tired but I still\nfeel happy. I just wish I could get the Awesome song out of my brain .\nUUUUGGGGHHH !! stupid ear worms any ways go see the movie and be happy\n"
"\nI will say that when I saw the preview for this movie I wasn't too\nexcited about it. I was never a fan of Lego's even as a kid and never\nreally played with them. Only through the great reviews and word of\nmouth did I decide why not give this a shot and I'm glad I did.<br><br>I didn't see it in 3D and it might have made it more entertaining with\nthe way the special effects were used. It was a clever piece of work\nwith the way they portrayed water, fire, smoke, and a whole bunch of\ndifferent things.<br><br>Even though most kids will want to see this, its the adults that will\nprobably be heard most in the theater laughing. The jokes are more for\nthe adults but because its Lego's the kids will have a fun time too.\nThere is a bit of a twist at the end that I didn't see coming.<br><br>Overall, its simply just a fun time at the movies that both the kids\nand adults will equally enjoy.\n"
"\nMy new favorite movie, defiantly the best one I've seen in 2014 so far!\nAs the title suggests, this film has it all:<br><br>- A great story - hilariously memorable funny moments - A wide range of\njust about every theme (though some of my personal ones are missing,\nbut there is always the sequel) - Very much feels and looks like a Lego\nmovie would! - Good music - Great writing at making something feel very\nfresh and unique, when this concept (i.e. Roger Rabbit &amp; Wreck It\nRalph) has been done countless times b4 - An unexpected twist that in\nhindsight makes sense with the theme of the movie - An excellent moral\nabout being your own special stuff and just being natural, that has\nbeen previously portrayed, but in this execution it stays with you as\nyou remain entertained simultaneously - And of course, as per the title\nof this review, the new song that will be trapped in your head:<br><br>EVERYTHING IS Awesome! <br><br>9/10!\n"
"\nHere we go again, Another copy up movie 1st of all, The movie is\nactually alike to Chicken little Here's the reason why, The plot's Is\nalike from Disney.<br><br>The total mayhem is alike, Same thing! They did War of worlds, With\nrobots?! Same Same thing! The movie was Not bad, But its not worse.<br><br>The city is also alike! :NOTE Well I guess it was terrible after all,\nAfter 60 minutes, They started to do a War of the worlds, AGAIN! The\nplots again! The animation again, the City again, But everything else\nbesides the Characters, Including the movie,\nTERRIBLE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n"
"\nWish it could have had more substance, but from the opening moments of\nthe film, The Lego Movie fires an endless array of jokes at its\naudience from seemingly every angle. Writers Phil Lord and Christopher\nMiller (who also directed the film) have an expert grasp of the absurd,\nand they use it to great effect, ensuring that every scene is stuffed\nto the gills with laughs. Many of the film's best moments are derived\nfrom the fact that the characters, vehicles, and environments are\ncreated from Lego pieces: one of the rules established by the\nfilmmakers was that everything appearing on screen must be possible to\nconstruct in the real world. It's a good mix of humor, heart, and\ncreativity, and provides a great foundation to build on.\n"
"\nI was super excited to see this movie when I first saw the commericials\nfor it. I never got a chance to see it in the theater so a few days\nafter it was released on DVD I went to a friends house and we ended up\nwatching it. So the first 45 minutes made me laugh a few times, but\nafter they met unikitty I started loosing interest. I really didn't\nlike how they made it that humans were controlling the legos the whole\ntime. Once emmet got to the human world I really got confused with what\nwas happening. I was confused if Emmet turned out really being \"the\nspecial\" or if that whole thing was a confusion or something, and what\nended up happening to bad cop/ good cops parents?!? Overall this was an\nOK movie, but it should' ve been much clearer considering im a kid and\nI got confused with what was happening in a kids movie.\n"
"\nOne of the first must watch movies of 2014.<br><br>Way better than I though it could be. A lot of funny scenes that will\nkeep all ages entertained. Although a couple of scenes felt longer,\nthat is simple due to how fast and funny the other scenes are.<br><br>The animation and voice work are both brilliant. Will Arnett is great\nas Batman, and Liam Neeson as BadCop/GoodCop was just epic. Also\nCharlie Day as Benny was brilliant and is the star of one of my\nfavourite scenes in the movie (you'll know it when you see it). The\nrest of the cast are fantastic as well.<br><br>Lots of awesome cameos, including some unexpected (but still as\nawesome) ones.<br><br>The plot is simple, but that doesn't mean the movie is any less\nentertaining.<br><br>One of my favourite movies of all time and is still enjoyable on\nmultiple viewings.\n"
"\nIf you have not yet seen this movie, here are two heads ups: one, it's\nextremely fast paced so brace yourself, two, if you have seen a lot of\nmovies the plot may get predictable.<br><br>Traffic was slow on this day so I barely made it to the theatre in time\n(about halfway through the previews). So I was a bit stressed when I\nsat down. The fact that the opening of the movie was very fast paced\nand there were so much happening at once did not help my mood. However,\nthe humour kicked in quickly and each one made me at least chuckle. The\nstory eventually slowed down (a little) and I was finally able to fully\nenjoy this movie.<br><br>It's indeed worthy of its praise: the pop-culture references are of\ngood taste, the humour is excellent, the visuals (though hard to keep\ntrack of) are amazing. Even if the movie is fast paced, this is LEGO\nafter all. Having the characters build something slowly than what you\nsee in the commercials would not be LEGO. It's not my favourite movie\nbut I am glad I saw it, and will definitely see it again. Beware: the\ntheme song is very catchy.\n"
"\nAt first glance this movie does not look like it should be appealing.\nIt looks like an advertisement for some toys, or to reboot a franchise.\nHowever, it turns out to be possibly the best animated movie of all\ntime. After seeing this movie, my siblings would not stop reenacting\nthe movie with toys, playing the video games, etc. The film is\nextremely funny and charming and jokes are timed so well that it looks\nlike a beautiful piece of art. The characters are so separate and\nunique that their \"gang\" looks like the new toy story gang. The movie\nstarts off a bit slow, to edge you into the movie, and sooner or later\nyou'll be in love with all the surprises and events you didn't know\ncould possibly happen in a Lego based movie. Overall, The Lego Movie is\nlike the perfect animated movie to me.\n"
"\nNot even words can describe how terrible this movie is. It is so\nunfunny, so horribly written, and so terribly developed. For starters,\nthe characters are one-dimensional and bland. Most of them are just\ncheap references to LEGO that fail miserably.<br><br>And then there comes the writing. It is one of the worst writing for an\nanimated film I have ever seen. The jokes are SO desperate to get a\ngood laugh out of the audience and the action scenes are SO\nover-the-top and generic.<br><br>Now, there are some good things about this movie. Like some of the\nreferences to LEGO are pretty noticeable, the animation is pretty\nimpressive, and the ending is very good.<br><br>But most of the movie is just full of crap. If your a fan of this\nstuff, you might enjoy this movie, but this movie isn't for me.<br><br>(UPDATE 3/14/16: This review is awful.)\n"
"\nThis movie was OK, but not great. Not too keen on Will Ferrel or Morgan\nFreemam. The move was doing pretty good until they added the human part\nto it near the end which made it go from a very good movie to just an\nOK movie. The human part basically explained what was going on in the\nmovie, a spoiled brat that didn't like being told what to do or\nrespecting the privacy of others. Even with the stop action filming it\nwas pretty good but would have been much better with computer animation\nlike the other Lego movies. I suggest that the next time a Lego movie\nis made that it be kept purely Lego without adding the human elements\nto the movie like they did this one. Also don't portray the trouble\nmaker(s) as the good guy(s).\n"
"\nI do not understand the fascination with this movie. We took my 10 year\nold daughter and 4 of her friends to see this and my husband and I were\nbored to tears. Nearly took a snooze. When we asked the girls how they\nliked it (god forbid we be allowed to sit with them during the movie),\nthey all said \"ehhh\" with a shoulder shrug. Understanding which\ncelebrities provided the voices made it more interesting for \"the\nadults\" and the animation was spectacular. After conferring with my\nhusband, we agree that it's a standard, well animated kids movie much\nlike the million others we've been subjected to in the past 10 years.\nCute but definitely not a must see.\n"
"\nOriginally, I was expecting this movie to suck, because of the Lego TV\nshows on Cartoon Network, or maybe it's also because of the straight to\nvideo Lego movies, but it didn't suck. It was an absolutely hilarious\nand awesome movie. They actually poke fun at the clich√©s, and it works\nperfectly. It has now also became of my favorite franchises ever. I\nhave always liked the character Emmet after watching this movie,\nbecause he's pretty much just like me. I wasn't very creative when it\ncomes to building Legos, and was always following the instructions.\nBatman was awesome in this movie as well. I have even seen the Lego\nBatman Movie recently last month, and it too was awesome. I hope the\nsame thing will happen to the Lego Ninjago Movie six more months later.\nNow, THIS movie feels like if it was influenced by Yellow Submarine. I\nknow this movie was actually inspired by stop-motion Lego brickfilms,\nbut this movie also feels like Yellow Submarine. And yes, Legos are\nmade to move like stop-motion, unless in video games, maybe. But either\nway, I love the Lego Movie.\n"
"\nThe LEGO Movie, on the surface, seems like a product placement for one\nof the world's biggest toy-brands; the truth about the movie is that it\ncapitalizes on its heritage and satires the basic premise of capitalism\nthrough its character Emit. And The LEGO Movie has a loose but flexible\nplot that never gets too self-restrained: only when the script says so.<br><br>This film is a charming, colourful and memorable treat in animated\ncinema, and the computer-animation is used to emulate stop-motion and I\nliked how the animation didn't TRY to look like it was done on\ncomputers. While it is noticeable that it is CGI, it is done so with\nmemorable style that hardly gets in the way of enjoying what you're\nwatching.<br><br>The LEGO Movie is an advert for promoting not only toys, but\nimagination and thinking outside the 'instructions'.<br><br>Also, Batman is in this movie. So there's that.\n"
"\nI wasn't expecting much out of this movie, after all, it is just about\nlego mini figures, how good could it be?<br><br>Surprisingly, it was pretty damn good. The jokes were clever and they\nall fitted in to either contemporary culture or were related to lego,\nthe storyline was pretty much as expected but still executed in a way\nthat left me thoroughly enjoying it and the effects were better than\nsome Hollywood blockbusters.<br><br>Overall, a totally enjoyable 90 minutes with enough in there for adults\nand children alike.<br><br>Now, where is my lego set????\n"
"\nThe Lego Movie is a different and fun animation , see lego that many\nchildren playing in childhood into a movie is something very nostalgic,\nthe film's plot is simple and nothing innovative , the soundtrack is\ncool, and the characters may be the most positive pointer the film, the\nprotagonist is funny is charismatic , the animation has participation\nof comic heroes, Star Wars character , etc., Batman is featured in this\nmovie and it's really fun , Superman also makes an appearance , the\nvillain is to cool, more nothing different from other villains in\nanimated films , the end is very good, and the pace is great , the\nanimation flies , the film's duration also helps , the Lego movie is a\nvery fun animation with the participation of many well-known characters\n, besides having funny moments . Note 7.9\n"
"\nI went into this film thinking that it was going to be another soulless\nkid film filled to the brim with pop culture references that would be\noutdated in a year. I'm glad to say that Lego Movie isn't that at all.\nThis film starts off with a really catchy song that you'll never be\nable to get out of your head and a main character who is actually\nrelatable. The characters in this film who are licensed works like\nBatman and Superman are actually made into funny characters with their\nown personalities. The ending of this film, I won't say here, is sort\nof a twist but it's a twist that brings this film a strong sense of\ndepth and astuteness that I totally wasn't expecting at all. I highly\nrecommend this movie to kids and adults alike.\n"
"\nI really enjoyed watching this movie. It is one of the most\nentertaining film i have seen to date. At first, i was a bit unsure if\nthe movie was really as great as they say it was. From the trailer, it\njust looked like talking blocks with some lame animations. That all\nchanged after i saw the movie. I loved it! It contained so many funny\nmoments as well as cross-overs from many heroes and villains (lego-\nfied, of course). The animations and special effects of this movie were\namazing! I couldn't ask for anything better. It also contained parts\nwhere it will warm you heart and make you full of joy.I don't think you\ncan ask for a better movie. I recommend this movie to people of all\nages because I don't think there are going to be many movies that will\nbeat the Lego Movie's funny and entertaining story line.\n"
"\nI probably would have loved this movie even if it was merely a largely\nnonsensical romp through Lego lore with groundbreaking visuals and\ncatchy songs. As it turned out, the story had a lot more depth than I\nanticipated. Best movie I saw in 2014.<br><br>The usage of the licensed characters who appear in the movie was a lot\nof fun as well. Lego Batman is pretty much how every 8-year-old boy\nimagines Batman these days.<br><br>One thing I appreciated about the visual effects is that the Lego\nblocks have a definite tangible quality, making them look like the real\nthings as opposed to simple CGI renderings.\n"
"\nThe world in this movie is amazing. It feels limitless and imaginative\n- which exactly has always been the strength of the Legos. I love how\nthey didn't just make a dumb funny movie, but actually captivated the\npower the toys have always had. Another amazing thing about the world\nis how it plays with many levels of reality. Of course there are the\nmany different worlds in the Lego worlds, but that isn't all, as you\ncan guess by the 'Man from upstairs'. <br><br>The plot is good. It is of course simple, but what do you expect from a\nmovie that suits for the whole family.<br><br>The humour is amazing - it has many different types of humour, since\nit's meant for people of all ages to enjoy. <br><br>And the animation! I loved it, it looks so much fun compared to the\ntypical Disney Pixar -type of animation. <br><br>Definitely a good movie. It should have won the Academy Award for best\nanimation, simply because it's so much fun and it feels like there are\nso many different philosophical themes one could talk of.\n"
"\nThe nice thing about Legos is that they can be anything. They have the\nplastic malleability to become structures, characters, villains; you\nname it. Of course, just about every movie for kids is about saving the\nearth or the universe. This is a non-stop fountain of the primary\ncolors that keeps going. The strength isn't so much in the plot but in\nthe multiple way the Legos can be used to show emotions and true\n\"humanity.\" There is some romance and some brinkmanship, but ultimately\nit gets down to true creativity. The universe is truly the Lego board\nand if you or your kids have ever played together, you know the\noverwhelming possibilities. There are some pretty good songs in here\nbut, I must admit, they have become pretty tiresome.\n"
"\nThe Lego Movie is a phenomenal film which encompasses all the traits\nthat make a great animation film. The animation style is the real trade\nmark of the film as it is shot to appear as if it were a stop motion\nfilm. This works perfectly in the film with its utilization of Lego\nblocks and allows the film to do certain things very effectively which\nthe traditional animation features could not.The movie also composes of\na stellar voice ensemble such as Nick Pratt, Will Ferrell, Will Arnett,\nMorgan Freeman, Elizabeth Banks and numerous other comedic stars which\nperfectly fit their characters and add flair to the film. The film\nboasts many laughs and a general fun experience to all ages with its\nintriguing direction, relatable story and comedic voice cast. After\nwatching The Lego Movie I am excited to see where LEGO goes from her. <br><br>9/10\n"
"\nFar more fun than the concept really had any right to be, braving new\nhorizons while still remaining loyal to the beating heart of the\nproduct and its passionate generations of fans. Simply enough, this is\na perfect encapsulation of the kind of imagination, enthusiasm,\nadaptation and sheer randomness that runs like lifeblood through the\nspirit of a happy childhood. It jabs in delightfully unexpected\ndirections. It bends physics without an explanation (nor a need for\none). It casually hops from one licensed fantasy to another, mashing\nGreen Lantern with Gandalf, and doesn't even slow down to consider the\nrepercussions. At the best of times, I felt like I was a kid again\nmyself, lost in nostalgia and the infinite potential locked away within\nevery new block. And while the last act overreaches in an effort to\nreally hammer the morals home, otherwise this is pretty much a direct\nhit. Crafty, funny writing, a dazzling array of vocal talent and a\nplayful, distinct visual style - this is the kind of family film I can\nalways make room for.\n"
"\nIf you have noticed putting live action segments into a cartoon is as\ntrend these days.<br><br>Anyway, I was raised near Billund where Legoland opened in the 1960's.<br><br>Many rides and shows had went and go.<br><br>From the vanished 3D shows to shows with dolls.<br><br>Loads of LEGO movies and shows was made for DVD and VHS.<br><br>Rows of LEGO games came out like LEGO LOCO.<br><br>Finally in 2014 the LEGO movie was released in the cinemas.<br><br>We follow a LEGO man that lives his ordinary life.<br><br>But later on he must save the World.<br><br>It all ends in a Live Action dimension.<br><br>The climax ends abrupt, and leaves place for the upcoming second LEGO\nmovie.<br><br>Watch the movie over and over again, as there are an explosion of\ndetails.<br><br>Set the volume to max too.<br><br>The LEGO maniacs will have their field day here.<br><br>10/10\n"
"\nThis is very funny for both old and young, especially the younger crowd\nwill see all the wonders that you can create with Lego :) and the grown\nups just get the childhood back and it is riveting.<br><br>I grew up with LEGO, being from Denmark it was a big part of what was\nthe thing to play with, we even visited Lego Land in Jutland several\ntimes when I was a kid. This film really brings back happy times.<br><br>But the film itself is also very well made and really has humor, great\ntiming, a good story and much much more. There are small things\neverywhere, in the big scenes and in the dialogs and the characters not\nall is for the younger crowd, but it is enjoyable for all ages and\nthere is never a dull moment.\n"
"\nIf you have kids, be sure to watch this movie. As its funny and\nsometimes sad. But in one word the animation is well done. Its a must\nto see, and you will love it again and again because each time you see\nnew things that you haven't seen before.<br><br>And yes according to me it is suitable for young children also, so sit\nback relax and get ready to enjoy.<br><br>Be sure to watch the other lego movies also.<br><br>I find it amazing how they can make such a movie with lego blocks, it\nmust have been a lot of work.<br><br>Just go and see it and i know you will like it, even if you did not\nlike to play lego when you were a kid. Relax they do not want you to\nbuild something.\n"
"\nhe Lego Movie (stylized as The LEGO Movie)[6][7] is a 2014 computer\nanimated adventure comedy film directed and co-written by Phil Lord and\nChristopher Miller, distributed by Warner Bros. Pictures, and featuring\nthe voices of Chris Pratt, Will Ferrell, Elizabeth Banks, Will Arnett,\nNick Offerman, Alison Brie, Charlie Day, Liam Neeson, and Morgan\nFreeman.<br><br>Emmet (Chris Pratt), an ordinary LEGO figurine who always follows the\nrules, is mistakenly identified as the Special -- an extraordinary\nbeing and the key to saving the world. He finds himself drafted into a\nfellowship of strangers who are on a mission to stop an evil tyrant's\n(Will Ferrell) plans to conquer the world. Unfortunately for Emmet, he\nis hopelessly -- and hilariously -- unprepared for such a task, but\nhe'll give it his all nonetheless.\n"
"\nNovel graphics, good fun.<br><br>I had low expectations for this movie, thinking it was simply a kids\nmovie. Turns out it is suitable for all ages. Interesting, though not\nthat original, plot. Very funny, snappy, dialogue. Generally, a good\naction-comedy.<br><br>Obviously, the thing that stands out most is the use of Lego for\neverything. Incredibly original in that regard.<br><br>Great casting for the voices: Chris Pratt, Will Ferrell, Elizabeth\nBanks, Liam Neeson, Will Arnett, Jonah Hill, among others. Best of the\nlot, in my view, is Will Arnett as Batman. Very funny.<br><br>Not perfect though. Plot gets quite random, almost silly, towards the\nend. The novelty of the graphics wears off too. Plus there are scenes\nwhere the Lego graphics don't do the movie any favours - you sometimes\nstruggle to figure out what you're seeing.<br><br>Overall: good entertainment.\n"
"\nThe Lego Movie has been cult well among many fans, as a great visual\nexperience, and the film can be seen as living to its expectations. It\nmight seem like a reach to base a film essentially on a series of\nplastic blocks, but this 3D animated comedy has some visual inspiration\nbehind it, even if the big laughs aren't quite plentiful enough to\ncarry a feature-length production. The story essentially follows the\nmisadventures of Emmet (voiced by Chris Pratt), an ordinary Lego\nconstruction worker who stumbles on to a diabolical attempt at world\ndomination by President Business (Will Ferrell) and his henchmen led by\na two-faced cop (Liam Neeson). So Emmet turns from social outcast to\nunlikely hero as he teams with Batman's girlfriend (Elizabeth Banks)\nand a blind man (Morgan Freeman) who dispenses pearls of wisdom in an\neffort to save the day. Overall, a very well made film which has been\nin production for several years back.\n"
"\nYou might not expect this to hold together the attention of an older\naudience, but this movie is all right angles where it counts and\nmachined to a fine tolerance. It's actually a brilliant deconstruction\nof the interchangeable pieces of the tropes of adventure stories, as\nalways centered on a substitutable everyman who just want to fit in.\nHis instincts are not heroic, if anything he is actually quite yellow.\nBut the movie builds a magnificent plot out of seemingly disparate yet\ninterlocking components making for a veritable play-set of a universe.\nIn all this it's a film that is much more than the sum of its parts ;)\nDuplo.\n"
"\nI love(d) Lego... they are among my fondest childhood memories. Even as\nan adult i consider Lego to be one if not the best children's \"toys\".<br><br>It is exactly that which is addressed in the movie. - the way children\nuse Lego and the way an adult might use Lego - and the movie does a\ngreat job displaying it.<br><br>I have read plenty reviews that speak of the antagonist as being \"evil\"\n- but personally i did not think of him that way. He was using Lego\nfrom a different point of view for a different purpose - but of course\nthat prohibited the child to make use of Lego his way. There is a\nmorality about creativity and joy in the movie of course - but most and\nforemost there is the very basic joy to create.<br><br>Style and artistic creativity is well done, the mixture between CGI and\nstop motion is for the most part seamless.<br><br>An easy 8/10 - i had a lot of fun watching that movie.\n"
"\nOne of the best movies I've ever seen in my life! Mostly in story line.\nThis animation was talking about Capitalism, Socialism, parallel worlds\ntheory, self confidence and .... simultaneously. Which it was\ninteresting for children and adult audiences! The writers were have\nbeen geniuses! By sure it should be nominated for Oscar this year. It\nmakes you think about the creation system of world, \"The Man Upstairs\"\nand Fin where two different persons. The Lego's didn't know this at\nall! The ordinary Lego construction worker, saw their creator, however\nthe wise man didn't see it at all! Besides, Fin,who created and was\nrunning the story , had another Lord who was ruling him, \"The Man\nUpstairs\"! It was philosophical!\n"
"\nI remember playing with brick toys in childhood days. We make different\nshapes with it, starting from a toy-bird to a building or an airplane.\nAll the animated characters in the movie are based on these brick toys\nmade by the company. The imagination level of this movie-maker is way\nup high and I couldn't resist humor in some scenes. There are number of\nmemorable characters such as good-cop/bad-cop, wild-style, Vitruvius,\nUnikitty and 'special'. The batman, superman, Gandalf, Green lantern\nand Dumberldore were cool too. No wonder the movie got award for best\ninnovative advertising for its cool. The movie features very mild crude\njokes that may just require PG. <br><br>The coolest thing about the movie is the message ¬ñ Having free will.\n"
"\nCreativity and ingenuity may be in short supply in live-action\nHollywood films these days, but that's certainly not the case in\nanimation, as 'The Lego Movie' proves. With wit, charm, humor and\nadventure to spare, it manages that rarest of feats; truly being fun\nfor all ages.<br><br>The animation here is just incredible. It really is like your Legos\ncome to life. And with the aid of its top-notch voice cast and clever\nscript, you soon forget that you're watching a film about little\nplastic bricks.<br><br>If you want a film with the fun built in, look no further than 'The\nLego movie'.\n"
"\nThis 90 minute infomercial for the iconic children's toy presents about\n20 minutes of clever but plodding world-building. At about that mark,\nthe filmmakers find this whole other hyperactive gear and the jokes\ncome faster than Vin Diesel in a street race. Enough Batman and Star\nWars references fly at the audience to give a geek study group fodder\nfor several nights. The movie runs through genres as often as Lego\nworlds (\"Middle Zealand\" being a personal favorite) while teeing up\nclich√©- bursting one-liners as rapidly as audience members can laugh at\nthem. Just at the point of exhaustion, they trout out Will Farrell to\nplay a weirdly-obsessed dad outside the fourth wall. That the writers\ncan take all the plot points, the subplots and the meta-plot and wrap\nit up into what actually turns out to be a warm and somehow affecting\nending speaks to the level of prowess missing from the \"Lost\" TV show.\nIn short, one of the few movies actually worth buying as well as best\ncommercial ever.\n"
"\nI won't repeat what everyone has said. Their positive criticisms I\nagree with. What I would like to add is that there is another layer to\nthis film that hardly gets mentioned. The Lego world is like ours, Mr.\nBusiness is the government, and we are getting distracted by crap that\ngets put on television. In the Lego world, the masses are getting\nsubdued into normal life by making them all watch \"where is my pants?\"\nand making them listen to generic music like \"Everything is awesome\".\nMedia is influencing people into continuing to live their normal and\nstructured lives, and this is also evident in our world, especially\nwith the Miley Cyrus garbage and reality TV shows, that softens the\nmasses while wars and killings happen overseas, and poverty ravages\nthird world countries. But just like the Lego world, we are influenced\ninto just living our lives and turning a blind eye to what is really\nhappening in our world.\n"
"\nThe Lego Movie<br><br>The worst thing about a Lego movie is that you are eventually going to\nstep on it in your bare feet one day.<br><br>Fortunately, this animated adventure comes in a digital format.<br><br>Dimwitted construction worker Emmet (Chris Pratt) is bonded with an\nitem that can prevent Lord Business (Will Ferrell) from freezing the\nfolks of Bricksburg in place.<br><br>Aiding him is a wizard (Morgan Freeman), a master-builder (Elizabeth\nBanks), Batman (Will Arnett) and other trademarked characters (Jonah\nHill, Channing Tatum, Alison Brie, Charlie Day, Nick Offerman).<br><br>In order to beat Lord Business though, Emmet must tap into his\nunderutilized imagination.<br><br>Lampooning the very building blocks that inspired it - and the pop\nculture licenses it's parent company holds - The Lego Movie is unlike\nany other: it's uproarious irreverence is equaled only by its\nnarrative's relevance.<br><br>And in the end, Lego all goes to the same place: inside the couch. <br><br>Green Light<br><br>vidiotreviews.blogspot.ca\n"
"\nA fun, entertaining and surprisingly clever film, The Lego Movie\ncombines an amusing script with a terrific cast of characters, while\nalso containing a profound and thoughtful message underneath. The\nexceptionally well-designed and colorful animation creates a visually\nvery impressive film, however perhaps its best feature is the\nintelligent and creative writing that produces a touching story, with a\nplethora of comedic inputs along the way. For the most part the film\nrelies heavily on its humorous aspect, offering numerous pop culture\nreferences and a satirical view of different genres and various notable\nfilm characters. Yet, The Lego Movie ultimately uses its imaginative\napproach to communicate to its audience many deep and highly\nsignificant ideas, inspiring creativity and individualism in its\nviewers. Overall, it is a delightful comedy adventure with a\nstimulating story in its core, thus making it a film well-worth\nwatching.\n"
"\nFaster then a speeding bullet fly the jokes in this delightful movie\nsure to entertain the current crop of attention deficit kids. The\nall-star voice cast is spot on, the animation is bright and colourful\nand the surprises are plenty. Standouts in the voice cast include Liam\nNeeson's multiple personality cop and Cris Pratt's Emmett though there\nare really no weaknesses here. Maybe most amazing for a movie based off\nof a successful line of toys, the story is competently told. It moves\nat an engaging pace and is interesting enough to keep even the adults\nwatching. Nothing at all wrong here except a side quibble about the\nmarketing for the movie. A lot of the movies best jokes were already\ndivulged in the trailers for the film.\n"
"\nI went in without expecting much, just taking my 6 year old for a fun\nweekday treat. This movie was absolutely fantastic! I do not know if it\nwas real stop motion, all computer, or the more likely combination of\nthe 2 but the look is pure real lego all the way through. It is silly\nand fun and very well written with a great voice cast and some good\nself aware humor thrown in for the adults. This works both as a kid\nmovie and an adult movie. If you like stop motion animation then this\nwill probably be a no brainer choice to go see but for those on the\nfence I highly recommend it. A rare breed of lighthearted kids oriented\ncomedy that doesn't talk down to the audience. Very well done and if\nyou get a chance go see it in 3D, some very good use of it here. I\npredict this will have cult status in a few years.\n"
"\nDad's the bad guy. Maybe not every dad is exactly like Will Ferrell\ntoward the end of THE LEGO MOVIE, with a hoard of 7.5 million plastic\nbricks Krazy glued together into 82 skyscrapers and scores of other\nobjects filling the basement, surrounded by 36 \"Do Not Touch\" signs\nmeant for Mom and their kids. But very few dads fail to spend huge\nchunks of their family's budgets on their metaphorical Own Private Lego\nLands (whether it's collectible beer cans, trout fishing flies, vinyl\nrecords, comic books &amp; action figures in their original shrink-wrapped\nboxes, etc.). The average dad cordons off large swaths or entire rooms\nof family living space for their time- and money-consuming \"hobbies,\"\nwhile tattooing \"Do Not Touch\" signs on the hearts of the rest of their\nfamily members. Well, it's time for Moms to lead a Rebellion! Take your\nlittle ones to see THE LEGO MOVIE; then storm Dad's citadel, touching\neverything! Touch touch touch touch touch touch touch!! (Only, DON'T DO\nTHIS if Dad collects guns!!)\n"
"\nWell, first of all, when you hear about a Lego Movie you think to\nyourself \"this will be fun\"! In the end, it was not. Nicely done for\nsmall children I guess, although sometimes the humor was more \"adult\". <br><br>I enjoyed only a handful of scenes that were nicely done but nothing\nmore than that. The script was nice but needless to say that I just\nwatched one hour and then switched the TV off. Nice messages and\napproach for the society we live in, but in some way it just was not\ngood enough. <br><br>Don't waste your time on it. I am really baffled by the really high\nscore of the movie. I don't know, maybe I missed something that all the\nothers see (apart from the end of the movie!).\n"
"\nFrom watching the trailer from this movie, I thought it was going to be\na action-only lego war-ish movie that had no story. I was incredibly\nwrong. This was such a funny and creative movie. <br><br>*SPOILERS*<br><br>The movie is about a normal LEGO construction worker named Emmet who\nlives in the city of Bricksburg. The citizens there follow instructions\non how to live life made by \"President\" Business. When Emmet meets a\nmaster builder named Wyldstyle who claims he is the \"special\", the one\nwho is the most interesting, extraordinary, amazing person in the\nuniverse, and tells him about \"Tako Tuesday\", a day where \"Lord\nBusiness\" (President Businesses other title) has plans to unleash a\nsuper weapon called the Kraggle (which is actually glue) on all worlds\nin the universe. So it is up to Emmet to put the \"peace of resistance\"\n(which is the Kraggle's cap) on the Kraggle to save the universe.<br><br>*SPOILERS OVER*<br><br>This movie was very creative and funny, enjoyable for all ages. I loved\nthis movie!\n"
"\nSummary says it all. This is, without a doubt, the best movie I've ever\nseen.

"\nThe Lego Movie is an odd blend of energy and color wrapped around a\npaper thin narrative. Most of the film is an unhinged series of very\nbusy visuals with lots and lots of noise - stimulation overkill. I\ncould imagine the psychotic effects this would have on a child watching\nbefore bedtime, possibly something along the lines of the child\ningesting Strychnine and a bottle of No-Doze. The Lego Movie can be an\nexhausting film to watch, but more often than not, the film is charming\nenough without pandering to children. It does transcend its corporate\nshackles, in what could have easily been a feature length toy\ncommercial in lesser hands, but Phil Lord and Christopher Miller give\nenough soul to this material. The film is a lot easier to enjoy on a\nvisceral level, as these silly lego characters don't really engage and\nthe voice work is well cast and deliver their readings with enough wit.\nWhile not exactly deep subversive satire, The Lego Movie does have just\nenough substance beneath all the noise.\n"
"\nThe film is very beautiful film in terms of humor, which carried the\nstory and that her body representatives brilliantly Add visual effects,\nbeautiful addition to the end of the film the most wonderful the\nbeginning and before that never simple cash that we are loved thank all\nthe workers on the production of the film for their fun of us, in fact\nwe enjoyed and we see this wonderful family film ... But after Be that\nthe output level of the desired Valvkahh and shooting angles were very\nJamali in addition to the movements and the way the characters talk and\nfashion either Amatherat sound and image was not too bad as the\ndirector excelled in making.\n"
"\nThe Lego Movie is in the same vein as a Pixar production, this animated\nmovie will therefore appeal to the younger audience as well as the\nolder viewers thanks to the richness of the references and the\ncharacters density, its offbeat humour and cynicism. The cinematography\nand animations are beautiful but since it was made via CGCIs it's a bit\nhard to understand why they would want to make it look like it's\nstop-motion. As for the scenario, the story is well thought-out but\ngoes maybe a bit all over the place ¬ó especially at the end ¬ó, you\nbarely could have handled even 15 minutes more. All in all, great\nsuccess for this first opus about the Lego world.\n"
"\nI have to admit when I saw the posters for this movie I wasn't\ninterested, then watched the trailer and thought it could be fun.<br><br>Well having seen the movies it's one of the best I've watched in a long\ntime. Plenty of laughs throughout and special effects that fit in well\nto the whole lego universe.<br><br>There's plenty for kids and adults.<br><br>The ending is quite heart warming too. Nothing like I was expecting,\nbut certainly worked well.<br><br>Do your self a favour and grab some friends or take the family and see\nThe Lego movie. It'll be worth your effort and you'll have a blast for\n90 minutes.\n"
"\nA pretty AWESOME!!! movie, except for one major (character) problem.<br><br>Let me see, what's the annoying character's name.... AnnoyStyle, um,\nIThinkI'LlcChangeMyAppearence AtTheBeginning OfTheMovie JustTo Be\nAnnoyingStyle.... uh, right! WyldStyle is who I'm thinking of.<br><br>Quote of the movie: WarmGoodRob(me): Wear your hood! WyldStyle: NEVER!\nFighting each other<br><br>And now a message from WarmGoodRob2: (BTW the beginning is referencing\nTalking (Tom and Ben) news) Yrgfhryfhrgryr. urtur b. Wyldstyle. Is.\nNoooooooo¬ú. Noooooooooooooooooooo -WarmGoodRob2 and Wyldstyle fighting\n!\n"
"\nGreat movie! There are so many aspects of this movie that make it\ngreat. The first is that 'everything is awesome' about it. I just love\nthe way they combined stop-motion animation with CGI to make the film\nhave a 'classic stop-motion' feel to it, but also a more modern and\nsmooth feel to it at the same time. Also, it's hilarious! The\ncharacters, the lines, the voices and the relationships between the\ncharacters just make the film so creative and funny. In all honesty,\nit's probably one of the best films I've ever seen in my life, and I\nwish there was an 11-star option for the ratings it's that good.\nOverall, its an epic, funny and overall awesome film. If you haven't\nalready seen it, go out and see it!\n"
"\nThis is a fun film for kids and adults alike. Had gone to the film with\nhigh expectations and wasn't disappointed . The movie is about a\nordinary builder and how he was chosen to save the world and the events\nresulting in this .Will Arnett voice adds another dimension to this\nmovie .This movie has comedy, action and well as a tiny bit of romance\ninto it . visuals and 3D effects are appealing. its soundtrack is\npretty good to with my favorite \"its so awesome:Its isn't a fresh story\nbut well its makes up with the direction and the dialog's. Hope there\nill be a sequel to this movie .well as the film says this film is very\nawesome.This is a must watch film for all and hopefully we will get to\nsee a sequel. this is my favorite animated film till now.\n"
"\nThe animation was excellent meaning the directors and animators did a\ngreat job making it look like actual Lego bricks. The inclusion of\nbatman gave it a wonderful storyline with clever jokes. SPOILER ALERT!\nLoved the live action part having will Ferrell as the father resembling\nlord business. Its a film for all ages to enjoy and inspire kids to buy\nthe mini figures. THE casting was a great choice by having Morgan\nfreeman and will arnett. My only criticism was that the other\nsuperheroes like superman and wonder woman weren't really involved in\nthe main story. However, Batman's role was great and added the main\ncomedy to the film alongside Emmett's clumsiness. Couldn't have asked\nmore from the film and the message of the film was great as well.\n"
"\nBest animated movie of all time, for many reasons. Chiefly, no cursing,\nwhich means that anyone can watch it. Seriously, I was in the theater\nwith both tiny kids and elderly people alike. Second, it has a\nwonderful message: that imagination and individuality are much better\nthan strict rigidity, yet it does so without being childish or overly\nmature either, it hits the sweet spot. It looks amazing, too. The\ncharacters looks like they are stop-motion animated and the colors are\nvivid and lovely. And it's amazingly funny, it never takes itself too\nseriously and the theme song is the catchiest ever!! There's a scene\nwhere the characters are singing it and then there's a title card that\nreads \"Five hours later\", it's completely accurate. You'll come out of\nthe movie feeling so happy and singing the song at the top of your\nlungs. It's so good. Everything about this movie is amazing. An\nabsolute must-see.\n"
"\nthis is a must see! its so good, its funny, smart and has a few\nelements of childishness such as the cats meowing or the bruuuummm when\nthe ship goes off but its hilarious! it brings back memories of fun\nwith Lego and how colorful and amazing it was. the song of \"everything\nis awesome\" is so catchy, and funny. in my opinion, the use of things\nin the film such as lord business's artifacts was so clever, and the\nending was so clever as well( not gonna give too much away). it pulls\neverything off so smart and i personally think everything thats Lego is\nhilarious such as the Lego games. this is quite a brief kind of insight\nfrom me but i would recommend to everyone!\n"
"\nWritten by Caiden (age 6)<br><br>Do you like Legos? Do you like movies? Then the Lego Movie is the place\nto go! And meet the Legos!<br><br>You should see the Lego Movie because there's action, jet-packs and\nexplosions! The main characters are Lego action toys. Their names are\nEmmet, Batman, Cop and Unikitty. They stop the bad guys from destroying\nthe City.<br><br>I give it 10 stars. If you like Legos and movies, go see THE LEGO\nMOVIE! Go see all the characters I mentioned and more!<br><br>I really enjoyed this movie!\n"
"\nAlright, so i'm an adult and i've seen just about every single rated R\ncomedy that has come out within the last 5 years and i'd have to say\nthat i laughed more in this movie than all of those movies combined.\nThis is good genuine comedy and that's definitely hard to come by these\ndays. Especially with legos being in my childhood, this was a killer\ncombo of nostalgia and good laughs. I was constantly being amazed with\nthe fantastic animation and production that this film possessed. Also\nwhat a wonderful cast of voices for the characters! It seemed like they\nall had a blast playing their roles. And what a fantastic job by the\nwriters too. The story line was very much reflective of the society we\nlive in, in America. It's a well-rounded and enlightening story for\nkids to hear. The writers really did their homework on this one. I\nhonestly just made an account on IMDb cause i was so stoked to write\nthis review. Great job Lego movie, i'd definitely watch again.\n"
"\nI took my 8 year old daughter to watch this at the weekend. Didn't\nreally expect much from it for me, but she really wanted to see it. <br><br>I feel compelled to write this review to express my admiration for\neveryone involved in creating what was quite simply the best kids film\nI have seen since.... well, possibly ever, at least as far as I can\nremember. <br><br>It is original, funny, moving and will hit a spot with anyone who has\never played with the timeless toy (has anyone on the planet not played\nwith Lego?).<br><br>Just go and watch it, even if you don't have kids...you really won't\nregret it. I will be ordering the Blu-ray as soon as I can, and a DVD\ncopy for my daughter lol.<br><br>10/10\n"
"\nA fun animated film with a simple title The Lego Movie. Makes you feel\nlike you playing Lego's also, for adults who loved Lego's, it will make\nthem feel like a kid again. The actors voices are perfect, I had a feel\nthat they all had a blast working on this. The plot for the most part\nis like a parody of those Matrix films, but they use a lot of famous\ncharacters from other stuff also. It's not a total parody, there are\nmoments that are pretty tender.<br><br>So don't go in this movie expecting a lot, just go in and relax and\nhave a wonderful time, at this awesome animated film. That will\nprobably win an award for best animation or not. But still just have\nfun.\n"
"\nWhen I first heard of this, I thought it would be stupid. I thought so,\nbecause of all the \"toy movie\" adaptations, like My pet monster, Or\ncare bears, whatever.<br><br>But I was surprised, and I highly recommend it. The plot seems kind of\nstupid, however we are not let down. There is humor, Great stop motion,\nand also, some surprising actor cameos, this film, is all great.<br><br>I recommend it, however, you Must ignore all reviews, and see it\nyourself, it's your own opinion. Most people do enjoy it, but some\npeople did not.<br><br>That is all I can say without spoiling this film.\n"
"\nLegos is one great international company that has redefined itself so\nsuccessfully in the American marketplace. I guess I can't join what\nlooks to be the large majority of IMDb members in saluting their\nventure into the movie industry. Sorry, I just didn't get this one. We\nhave this sort of ordinary fungible dweeb in corporate world who\nbecomes the chosen one to save all the fungible dweebs in corporate\nworld from the evil corporate overlord who has his own bizarre plot to\nfreeze all the dweebs for unclear reasons. Along the way we see\nfamiliar characters from other fantasy movies, in their own Lego\nfashion, along with some unique to this movie. The world they present\nis hardly new (see Cloudy II) and really very unpleasant for kids and\ndads alike. There are moments of sort of odd and goofy humor and the\ntwist towards the end is sort of interesting but again it doesn't\nreally fit with the rest of the movie. I'm glad for all of the people\nwho enjoyed this, but me and my 8 year old don't share their opinion.\n"
"\nLots of good visuals and plot in this film, but the idea that\nmediocrity is greatness and that the world can be magically changed\njust by wishing it were so is just so inaccurate and inane. This film\ntries to manufacture emotional depth without actually having any - kind\nof an example of the main problem, which is that just by wishing they\nmade a movie with real meaning it could be so. Toy Story and Up and so\nmany other movies actually HAVE emotional depth and real feeling, and\nthe contrast highlights that this facsimile is using pure manipulation.\nAnd kids know the difference - my ten year old daughter left shaking\nher head at the end and wondering what had gone wrong and why we didn't\njust go see Frozen again, which would have been a better idea.\n"
"\nThis movie is honestly terrible, I don't know how it got good reviews.\nMe and my sister got bored of this movie after 30 minutes when we saw\nit in theaters so we left. But I decided to give it a second chance\ntoday, and I thought it was terrible. The movie is very clich√©. The\nvillain didn't feel threatening at all, and it was a clich√© villain.\nThe jokes were repetitive.I had absolutely no feelings for the\ncharacters. I found them all annoying and trying to be funny but\nfailed. And the ending was horrible.I would recommend not seeing this\nmovie unless you have a kid that would want to see it. since this movie\nis for kids and only kids will laugh at it. Most grown adults will find\nit boring. All my friends found it boring. <br><br>If you want to see a good animated adult like movie, watch how to train\nyour dragon\n"
"\nI can't believe this movie has an 8/10. That score, properly earned,\nwould place it in the annals of movie history, alongside flawless\nclassics such as Alien, Terminator or The Wrath of Khan. The reality\nis, The Lego Movie is a Pixar-like cookie cutter plot, coupled to\nnausea-inducing stop-motion animation. The jokes are tedious,\npredictable and seemingly unending, and the action is mind-numbingly\nfrenetic. Sprinkle in some torture-like Will Ferrell live action, and\nwhat you're left with might possibly be the most abrasive film ever\nmade. The Lego Movie makes Toy Story look like fine art, and is a\nperfect example of cinematic shovelware.\n"
"\nEverything is awesome!, yes many thing are awesome but not this movie.\nThis movie is strange and leaves me confused. This movie encouraged to\nmonitor the time instead of pay attention. Animated movies are not that\nhard to make and there were many animated movies that were amazing. For\nexample Finding Nemo. A great movie that I have many times. This move\nis not Finding Nemo. Watch Finding Nemo.\n"
"\nThe Lego Movie can be considered an instant classic of animation. The\nstory takes something as simple as a Lego, and turns it into a fun and\nimaginative story.<br><br>The characters are extremely likable and all the actors fit their roles\nextremely well. Some of the best characters include Bad Cop/Good Cop\n(Played by Liam Neeson), Batman (Played by Will Arnet), and President\nBusiness (Played by Will Ferrell) However, Chris Prat and Morgan\nFreeman also excel really well in the leading roles. Even the\nsupporting characters of Green Lantern (Played by Jonah Hill) and\nSuperman (Played by Channing Tatum) had great moments in the film as\nwell.<br><br>The movie's script is also a strong suit of the film. The script is fun\nand imaginative, and captures the imagination of playing with Legos.\nThe script is also a great satire about conformity. The writers show\nthat anyone can be special if you just be yourself. Along the way the\nscript also pokes fun at Green Latern and Batman as well.<br><br>Overall The Lego Movie will be remembered as one of the greatest\nanimated films of all time.\n"
"\nI think most people had the same reaction when they first saw the\ntrailer for this movie. I can imagine it was a simultaneous sigh, with\neveryone muttering the words \"really? A Lego Movie?\" But please, if you\nhaven't watched it yet, you are seriously missing out.<br><br>Like many people, I expected this to be full of child humour with no\nreal storyline or substance, but I am 19 years old and I found myself\nchuckling throughout this film, along with my parents. The humour is\naimed at all ages and it really does tickle you in places.<br><br>The main thing that impresses me about this film however, is the\ncleverness and creativity behind it. The idea of the characters\nbuilding things out of Lego, and Lego pieces flying everywhere when\nthere's an explosion or a car crash or something. It is really cleverly\ndone and really entertaining.<br><br>It isn't a perfect movie, as some of the jokes are a bit silly, but in\nall honesty, it is 10x better than I ever thought it would be. A very,\nvery good film.\n"
"\nThis original creative animation is fantastic and fun for all the\nfamily Chris Pratt who plays Emmett is a builder like everybody else at\nleast that's what he thinks. Emmett is just an ordinary guy in an\nextraordinary city and really turns out that he copies everything that\neveryone else does. He meets a woman named Lucy/Wildstyle (Elizabeth\nBanks) and she trusts him to find his skill to be a megabuilder. They\ngo on this great adventure which along the way they meet some\nextraordinary characters and they all fight together to save the world\nmy favourite part is when Good Cop/Bad Cop is played Liam Neeson and\nalso when they go into the real world with Will Ferrell playing the\nlittle lad's father and they get along so well at the end. Fantastic\nfun for all the family. 10/10.\n"
"\nThis movie is hysterical! It's SO funny and everyone involved with this\nmovie should be proud! Its one of those perfect combinations of comedy\nthat reaches both adults and kids! You'll fall in love with the\ncharacters and they'll make you smile long after the credits. Criticism\ncould come as soon as you hear the title and immediately believe it'll\njust be an advertisement used to promote sales; but nope, this movie is\nmore than that! It's heartfelt, entertaining, and fun to watch! If you\nmissed it in theaters you should defiantly check it out on OnDemand,\nNetflix, or D.V.D., because it's simply a must-see! I hope I'm not\nraising your expectations too high, but even if you don't love it's\nundeniably good! I've heard things about a sequel and am very excited\nand anxious to see where these rumors lead! I hope you enjoy it as much\nas I do.\n"
"\nPersonally, i remember the great times I had playing with my toys when\nI was a child. Lego, Playmobil and action figures gave me thousands of\nhours of fun because I was able to create these really insane worlds\nwhere all these toys would interact. The stories I imagined were all\nmore preposterous than the other but in my mind they were all as epic\nas Star Wars or Lord Of The Rings. And here we have a film that\nencapsulates all of that imagination in one story. The story is not\nimportant, it's bad against good but it's a fun unique out of the many\nstory with twists and turns you would expect. The story has many action\nmovie tropes such as a prophecy, a meeting of heroes, a \"heist\" and\nbattles. This movie definitely was made for children in mind but adults\nwill enjoy this film nonetheless with the many pop culture references\nand nostalgia linked with these imaginative toys. I still wish I had\nthis sort of imagination and watching this film was having it back for\nan hour and a half.\n"
