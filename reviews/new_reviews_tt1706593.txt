this is the worst film i have seen in ages
the premise looked promising but the film they made was just so unbelievably bad
if you think youd like nearly 2 hours of extrashaky handcam footage spectacularly annoying idiots yelling at each other and repetitive special effects with lots of stuff breaking then this is the film for you
the three main characters are dumb beyond belief and its impossible to sympathize with any of them
there is no explanation as to how the super powers came about and the characters dont spend one moment thinking about how they could change their lives or anyone elses lives for the better
they just do a bunch of dumb things and then they do a bunch of even dumber things
do yourself a favour and watch anything else
i cannot believe how high the ratings are for this piece of garbage
found footage is now a business model exclusively and this horrible thing makes it extremely obvious
whole plot devices are crafted merely as an alibi for cameras being around in the most implausible situations to accidentally set up a perfect ots shot
being limited in telling a story when everything needs to fit into a situation with some kind of camera around the directors elegant solution of course is to convert 85 of the unimaginative dialog into exposition spoonfeeding you the two dimensional infantile melodrama leaving 10 to explain the camera presence in some way and adding 5 of irritating bull crap that i guess the writers thought modern teenagers would say when behaving naturally
they wouldnt
for action there is no time
as a lot of the other reviewers i went into this movie with mediocre expectations and not only did the movie meet them but exceeded them very high
this is one of the best movies i have seen in awhile
the first 40 minutes makes it out to be a teenbuddy movie then in the second half it does a complete 180 that you do not see coming at all
i was on the edge of my seat throughout the second half
special effects were very impressive as a lot of it looks very real
also very strong performances by some new fresh face actors especially the ones that played matt and andrew
i see them having a bright future in hollyweird
overall i recommend to see in theater
810
matt is a regular popular guy
steve is a regular guy
andrew is a regular nerd
their friendship is a little weird to understand in the beginning since theyre not that similar to each other
one night theyre heading to a party and one of them falls in a hole
the other two fellas go down together and in that hole something gives them strong powers which allow them to do anything they feel like doing
as the film goes andrew starts abusing of his power and hurting people for no reason
matt and steve try to calm him down but they never succeed
acting is very good from the three main actors with no exception
the whole story is very entertaining and interesting probably helped by a strong directing and a beautiful photography directing
the only thing that doesnt let me give this a higher rating is the saturated use of domestic camera not that i find this a bad choice but too many movies used this tactics recently
what if some normal american guys get superpowers
will they be heroes
well according to chronicle not necessarily
this cloverfield style movie is very entertaining and it raises some questions about our times
and one sort of understands the guy who goes mad instead of using his powers for good
bullying abusive father a sick medical system that does not grant his sick mother the help she needs because of money issues
something to think about behind all the noise and entertainment
the actors were great and talented and that made chronicle in any case fun to watch
good work
even if it is not always logical
this has to be one of the most stunning science fiction films ive watched in a while not since donnie darko and one of the best commentaries regarding pacifism and the abuse of power that has surely been made
the abuse of the vulnerable is not always handled very sympathetically but in this case the total transformation it causes is seamless and one finds oneself egging them on for vengeance in the first instance and saying oh no dont do that in the next
there is plenty left unexplained and to think about afterward which is often the downfall of some stories
the references to previous science fiction films are endless but handled in a completely unique way and the special effects dont ever get in the way
nice one josh
how is a movie made to be
is it the pure density of action or fear
or the purity of the movie itself
ive come to find myself in the position where there is not much to say about a movie once you watch it
you saw it great
but there are the ones that come in to play that all you want to do is hit the play button over and over again
chronicle was a very unusual type of film listing on not what people usually find in a movie
but the purity of a movie comes from the very feeling the soul content of a movie the pure influence
chronicle was a very strange movie in which along with the views of the camera as shown the boy was filming in the movie
but it really did show the view point of it all
the teen the people everyone else
overall chronicle is a rare treasure to find in a movie and i am hoping very much for more
i was lucky enough to go to an advanced showing of chronicle last week and i didnt even have to pay
the movie follows the lives of andrew dane dahaan his cousin matt alex russell and their friend steve michael b
jordan after they obtain telekinesis
its a found film so the camera work is a little shaky in the beginning but the plot more than makes up for that
the acting was also much better than expected especially considering the fact that these three are relatively unknown
its pretty easy to feel for the characters so its possible to see why theyespecially andrewdo what they do throughout the movie
the special effects werent the greatest
some things definitely looked like they were hanging on a string but others were better
all in all it was an excellent film
i would definitely see it again and id even pay this time
this is a superhero movie done right
film comes out of nowhere and will definitely end up being one of the best of 2012
great performances
the actor that plays andrew is one to watch
extremely relatable kid and if youre gone thru the same thing the very raw scenes with his abusive father will hit close to home
the cgi is fantastic for a 15m production
a very interesting twist on the superhero genre that is fun for the first half and then becomes very dark with a third act that is so absolutely bonkers it would katsuhiro otomo akira proud
for a 80 minute movie they couldve took their time and fleshed out some characters a bit more but thats irrelevant
without question one of the most innovative entertaining films ive seen in years
go see it
k special effects seamless filming terrible dialog terrible its like the blair witch project without the flair not that it had any dont waste your time watching movies like this you want to watch a film of your friends doing stupid stuff go outside and film it yourself it will turn out better than this movie
the plot about the abused high school kid who decides to film everything is not bad if it were a serious movie about bullying shown in schools this seems like another attempt to make a really cheap movie and steal as much cash from people as possible although some special effects are ok the whole flight scene was a waste of timeand yes the special effects would have cost a penny or two it still seems like any first year film student could have thrown it together
for me herkyjerky firstperson camerawork is unwatchable
i recall seeing it before but i do not understand why any movie would feature it
maybe for a few minutes
handheld cameras have been around for decades so it is not new technology
maybe it is fun to watch if the viewer is doing lots of drugs
the ability for practically anyone to film stuff is somewhat new but i do not understand why that would make it a good tool for a movie
and then there are periodic short skips in the movie
perhaps it is expressive in some way like how to be annoying as possible while making a movie
too weird imo
im normally not a big fan of the handycam filming technique
in the beginning it was all new and okay but personally i think they should stop that technique
it doesnt do movies any good
not that chronicle is a bad movie though
its definitely something else then the usual superhero movies that we see so much lately
here three kids get telekinetic super powers after discovering a strange thing underground
what starts as a bit of fun quickly escalates in catastrophes
the story is easy to follow
its different then the usual action heroes that use their powers to fight evil
the actors are all quite young and are not bad
thinking about what they do with their powers makes me realize that i would probably try the same things
but its all fiction
so all in all its an entertaining movie to watch
it was a supernatural movie
it was also a selffilmed movie by a group of teenagers
i liked the whole idea of the movie
it gave us lessons of humanity and how we should deal with our desires toward things
often time people get overdesiring of what they want using any ways
i think its definitely fine to follow your dreams and to challenge yourself but not when the method you use is against morals
i dont agree their way of using the power but it was a good lesson
if there are somewhere we can all become powerful i wouldnt do it
because it is really a risk of relationships and lives
i didnt like the choices they made but the fact that it was a well set up movie
so many movies consist of a band of unlikely people who are brought together by something intense  its also common nowadays for films to be about teenagers acquiring powers
however chronicle is a new twist on the clicha
the way of filming is already the first obvious twist as it is shot in found footage style
the added fact that the camera is supposedly moved by the boys mind is even more interesting
not only did the cinematography bring a fresh take on such a common basic story the actual plot in its entirety really added a boost of something new
i cant say too much as i dont want to spoil the movie but i would highly recommend this movie to somebody whos interested in found footage style of films and films that defy the clichas
using just a video camera high school outcast andrew documents the events surrounding a recent discovery
in the woods he and his friends discovered something unexplainable something that gives them supernatural powers
what i loved about this film is unlike many many others these kids didnt take these powers and become superheroes instead they did what any real life teenager would do and use them for pranks popularity and various other things
also unlike similar camcorder films it wasnt jumpy or choppy and it was quite easy to follow
the first hour of this film was amazing unfortunately it did go downhill at the end
the whole film was done in a realistic fashion making science fiction seem possible until the end when all hell breaks loose and it honestly just destroyed the whole thing for me
it was such a strong start but such an awful ending
most of the cast were newcomers and were very good the story was also very solid but this film needs a much better ending if it wants to be considered a classic
chronicle 8
910 advertised as just another lost footage flick chronicle proves to be anything but
with a surprisingly deep story of three teens who are granted telekinesis powers one starts to lose control with his dying mother abusive father and harsh school life beginning to break him down to his last nerve
the director created interesting ways of filming the footage such as moving the cameras with their powers using the bystanders footage and even footage from security cameras in buildings putting a whole new twist on the growing genre
the story itself is also great as the boys harness their powers after coming into contact with an alienlike object buried beneath the earth
the biggest aspect of this film is that it feels real unlike paranormal activity and apollo 18 which can seem just silly at parts
but chronicles cast of characters show superb acting skills and i found myself feeling for every one of them
altogether these elements craft a tremendous movie that seems to take a giant step in the right direction for the genre
chronicle directed by josh trunk runs a brisk 90some minutes and it feels pretty quick too
spoilersthe filmmakers in this movie have succeeded in growing a palpable feeling of foreboding
there is definitely ominous signs thrown in all over the place  probably too much foreshadowing actually
anyway pretty much from the getgo you can guess that things are not going to be nice and cheery to end the film
however i greatly underestimated the magnitude of the explosion of aggression and violence that lit up the climax of this movie  quite jolting
it was pretty well done technically and the young men who starred dane dehann alex russell and michael jordan all did solid jobs for the movie
i especially liked russell as the peacemaker bigbrother
definitely worth a watch and one of the better movies lately in early 2012
at first when i heard about chronicle it sounded good until i heard about the whole film being footage from a camera
as soon as it came on dvd i thought i would buy it just to see what it was like
at the start of the movie i thought it wasnt going to be that good but once they started using there powers i started to really like the film
the ending was brilliant and so was the camera footage that they use throughout the film
i would recommend this movie to anyone who likes super hero movies and to anyone who likes thrillers because it feels like a thriller
plus the effects are amazing especially the flight seqeunces in which they are in the air
this is an entertaining and engaging movie
do not let the shaky cam or handheld cam discourage you from watching this movie because it is only like that for the very beginning
it does not detract from this movie at all
anyways the characters are young adults who happen to stumble upon super powers
the movie does a good job of keeping pace with the boys as they learn to use their newly acquired abilities
my favorite character was the main character because he is a socially awkward boy with a poor relationship with his family and friends
he grows and changes as the story progresses and thats where things become really interesting
i feel like i can relate to the main protagonist because he begins to feel resentful towards people once he becomes more powerful
while this movie succeeds in many places football scene in the sky and the car crushing scene the ending was a bit unfortunate and lacked closure
nevertheless it was an excellent film and deserves your attention
this is a great movie
it shows the truth behind power and how it can effect certain people
now a days movies and stories that have super heroes show two sides to gaining power becoming a good superhero or a bad supervillan
they dont show the actual struggle of fighting a power that is stronger than the human who gained it
this movie does show that
they dont put on a mask and start fighting crime they do what anyone their age would do
use it for pranks and messing with people
they use the powers in a more realistic way its probably the same way i would react
then the film turns and shows how the power affects andrew
he turns into a crazy power house killing anyone because he can
someone with his background would end up the same way
he could not handle all that power and he let it overtake him
this film tells the story perfectly
the acting was great and so was the effects
the scene where they fly through the clouds took my breath away it looked so real
this is a good movie for any scifi fan or superhero fan
i strongly recommend it
the reason why this movie is one of my favorite is because its the same style with district 9
it is not easy to express the sf super power movie the way like that but this one made it
a young directors creative idea had became well made movie
but of course it is not well made than district 9 chronicle is hes first movie ever made
i gave 910 but actually 810 is enough
the reason why i gave 1 more score is because it was hes first movie but he had made so good
cg was so great and story was 910 i guess
a normal teenagers gets a super power is simple story but all the detail of life super power how they think is really good
also the movie has a feel that it is a normal teenagers home video
i like this movie and yes it is well made to me i guess
i didnt got bored when i was watch this film
so i strongly recommend this movie chronicle
saw the trailer and went to see this with my daughter
i really enjoyed it as it made the hairs on the back of my neck stand up
its pure fantasy and you have to be able to watch without judging the fact that a lot of what you are seeing is a bit ridiculous take it for what it is a fantasy film
it has so many emotions in it and the scenario is excellent
really made me think
it has guilt hatred sadness fun confusion and a lot more
one minute i was smiling and laughing and literally the next i felt a tear in my eye
my only reason for not giving it a ten is that i thought it was too short
especially the last 30 minutes seem to be rushed and i left the cinema wanting more
if you are able to let your imagination run wild dont miss this
i generally enjoyed the overall story in which teens get powers and we get to see how they use them and how it changes them
not amazing but interesting and many good scenes especially in the last 15 minutes
however the movie loses a rating point or two by the contrived found camera gimmick
it really makes no sense no one would video tape their lives like they show in the film
by trying to squeeze the movie into this structure i think the movie lost out on what could have been better character development and frankly better cinematography
sometimes the movie was a bit hard to watch or simply awkward because they had to fit everything into this gimmick
it made more sense in movies like blair witch and paranormal
i give this 6
5 to 7
0 stars which means cleanly above average but certainly not an elite movie which would merit an 8
0
with normal storytelling and a bit more character development which would also mean a move more than 130 hours this could have been great
when i first saw the trailer for this movie it looked sweet but i didnt think they would be able to make an entire film about it
however i was pleasantly surprised when i got out of this movie
normally i dont like found footage films because i never really buy the fact that they are video taping everything
in this film it gave a back story as to why there was a camera at some points the characters even remarked about why the camera was there
as im sure everyone knows the story is about 3 teenage boys who get superpowers and one of them seems to be a little more mischievous than the others
andrew has a pretty messed up home life and that leads to him abusing his powers
the characters could have been developed a little better but not much to complain about
the plot was very interesting and got me pretty emotionally invested
overall i was very surprised at how entertaining it was and i would definitely recommend this movie to anyone who is looking to have a good time
perfect movie to go see with your friends on a friday or saturday night
810 solid movie
i would say this is the worst movie ive ever seen but unfortunately ive seen paranormal activity or at least half of it before running out of the room puking
yes it is a good documentary movie in the sense that the camholder at least knows what a camera actually is thats a first
but other than that the plot was horrible the ever clichad story line of the unpopular nerd getting unfathomable super powers and wreaking havoc or simply a total rip off of carriethe characters did not have any unique personality that you would want to root for and the story did not follow any specified pattern or focused on one characterbut just drifted from one character to the next like my mood throughout the movie
so yeah
a pretty bad movie
the 2 i gave it was for the good acting in a terrible plot and for the somewhat moving ending
this one was supposed to be a sleeper hitbut has it achieved the desired effect
honestly im not sure
the opening is that of a typical american teen movie and will definitely appeal to audiences in this age group
before you know it youre lost in the crazy action of cameras and boys exploring their childhood fantasy of flying
i enjoyed the modest amount of action this movie providedespecially andrew a depressed and unpredictable character
in factchronicle could have out performed most big budget films if the camera was used more smartly to capture some of the shots that we didnt get to see
watch it yourself to see what i mean
overall not a bad one beside i went to see it
the whole film is shot using the same camera technique as cloverfield intentionally amateurish disjointed with annoying camera shake during the action scenes
initially the dialogue is fast paced but the characters are 2 dimensional so i found little to care about in any of them
they do acquire some depth eventually but the pace of the plot is so slow that for the first 30 minutes i didnt feel any buyin to the story which is too long in my opinion
eventually the special effects are well executed and the film kind of redeems itself but then its over and i was left feeling a little cheated
shame as the trailers are great and i was expecting a great film however i would say its mediocre at best
i dont see how any body can give this movie anything below an 8 for the simple fact the special effects were awesome
the script was realistic and im tired of seeing the haters bashing the movie and calling it cheap
its one of the best movies of the year hands down
people are complaining about the nose bleeds significance
they said their power is like a muscle you can break it if you stretch it too far past the limit youve strengthened it
the black guy moved the car early in the movie and he bled profusely as punishment comparing his face to a period
andrew became strong as hell because throughout the movie he was working the muscle just by having the camera above his head 247 even when he slept
so think about the movie before you give it a 5 because the script of a teenager
andrew recorded it its supposed to be like that
i felt that the trailer was very misleading
i thought it was going to focus on the guy they made crash into the water
the movie was so slow and pointless
and the part at the end where his friend makes the spear go through him give me a break the police had every opportunity to shoot him
the socalled special effects were weak and looked stupid
i cant believe the good reviews this movie is getting
i dont get it it was stupid and weak and i couldnt wait for it to be over so i could go home
lol
i agree with all the other bad reviews
i should have went to see the movie with the rock it couldnt have been worse
wow ok i cant post until i write ten lines on how awful this movie was
i enjoyed this movie
the concept of three teenagers getting powers could go in a lot of different directions so i thought it might be hard to explore all the possibilities in the length of one movie
by the end i was satisfied
three high school boys find a cave with glowing crystals and the next day they begin developing powers
for a while they just play around and pull pranks
however one of the boys is picked on by classmates and abused by an alcoholic dad and eventually turns his anger outward
he eventually becomes so dangerous the other kid with powers has to turn on him to stop the rampage
it was a pretty epic finale
the found footage aspect of the film was its weakest part
i think that was because it was inconsistent
i enjoy the handheld cam effect most of the time usually because the films that employ them are well written enough that they would be good however they were done
in this movie the effect distracts from the story
especially since the scenes sometime look handheld and sometimes look traditionally filmed
a fun watch
the twentysomething teens seemed authentic  they actually acted like teenagers  a rarity
the use of the camcorder  sort of a candid chronicle of whats happening  went over very well
the emergence of their superpowers and their mastery of it fit into the teenage reactions you would expect
i think it was an intelligent film  it made you think and it seemed real
when one of the teens who had a traumatic home life begins to unravel everything accelerates into a tragedy
it was genuinely scary because it seemed so natural
every single one of the characters seemed authentic and i believe this film achieved groundbreaking realism in that regard
its one of those movies that holds your interest and makes you cringe
it drags you into it
when everything spins out of control it retains its edge
its genuinely terrifying
im usually divided by superpower movies
ive never read comic books but i like the idea of being different from society
chronicle rides this line with excellent finesse and skill
i loved the lack of a traditional exposition with the movie instead diving straight into the main trio learning how to use their powers
dane dehaans family dynamic was fantastic michael b
jordans personable characteristics were muchneeded and alex russells overall resolve really brought the movie full circle
really the only complaint i have is that it was on the short side
i would watch the 2
5 hour directors cut if there was one
chronicle was a nice ride of superheroalien and the the story of three kids who possessed it
some really cool and dark concept presented by the young moviemaker
chronicle not just a 12 million doller indie movie but it has every thing to wow about
stunning visual videotaping style of movie like paranormal activity and jackass but still better and so much better special effect then what we seeing nowadays so called blockbuster movie
it has the nice taste of next new thing of movie making
story and screenplay is really topnotch
i am recommending everyone to watch this movie just to get a different taste in movie
from a certain perspective this is just another super hero movie where the hero and the villain start as friends and become enemies
for me this had a lot more levels than that
i enjoyed the first person mode of filming because it made the characters seems more real to me rather than being actors
it helped me to really identify with each of them instead of classifying any of them as either good or bad
andrew and matts relationship is a truly interesting one where andrew is truly the more likable of the two but as they begin to progress more and react to the power they get from their new abilities matt is the one who is more level headed and andrew begins to go off the deep end
i think for me what really made this film entertaining was the lack of superhero tights or nicknames or even alteregos
just a bunch of misfit teenagers who end up losing control of themselves
before seeing this film id never seen a foundfootage type of movie
i thought that type of film would be terrible but ended up becoming a great film
without revealing any spoilers the film is a very good achievement by newcoming director josh trank
although the acting in this film may not be an oscar worthing the characters do pull off a good job as their own characters
after seeing this film back in february i had already heard of josh trank be interested in directing the fantasic four reboot
if he werent interested in directing the reboot i would have hoped at the time he would also be interested in making a sequel to this film without doing foundfootage type of filming
over all a very well done film by a new coming director
overall 810
ok the reviews looked great
the previews looked great
i never looked hard enough to notice it was a found footage as they are calling it film which if i had i would never have rented it
thankfully i did not have the money to go see this in the theater or i would have been demanding my money back early on and would have been right
there was nothing worth watching until about 23 of the way into the movie
by then your so drunk from the shaky camera which by the way some times you think oh the camera is gone now its a real movie and then oh crap the jerk got the camera again
at times you wish someone would break it and they do try but not well enough there was no real plot there was no sympathy for any of the actors
there was nothing
i feel asleep and missed like 20 minutes of the movie and i am thankful
i did not miss anything really it was all crap
super hero
there were no super heros in this movie only super villains and super greed
super heroes would not let their girl friend go with them to fight someone that they know was capable of killing everyone
i thought the concept was really cool
a couple of regular kids find themselves with super human powers and have to come to terms with this new amazing scare reality like only teenagers know how through experimentation  the good the bad the ugly
the plot i felt didnt know where it wanted to go
i think whoever wrote the script knew heshe had a great concept but just couldnt take it to where it needed to go like 23 of the way through a big chuck of cryptonite fell onto the writers lap
also the handheld camera action
it had credibility for about three scenes
then the reasons for having to constantly film lost all credibility
all up had huge potential but a few obvious and major flaws turned it into a bit of a tomato
i loved this movie
great overall movie
there was comedy drama action thriller and everything
i love how the first half was funny and friendly
the second half was when you sat on the edge of your seat
it was intense and dark
see this movie everybody
i saw this thinking it was going to be awesome
but i was wrong
it was 10 times better than i expected
my new favorite movie
see this movie with some friends and this will be the perfect movie night
you get to laugh through this movie and you get to be worried wondering what will happen next
i always thought levitation was awesome enough but after this movie i have a whole other thought
chronicle happened to actually be an awesome movie for such a low budget film
it has taken back the dignity of the found film sub genre back from the blair witch project
the story is basically about a group of 3 teens who develop telekinetic powers from an unknown energy source
andrew decides to film their daily lives with having these new powers
while there are really no prominent actors in the movie the main role andrew played by dane dehaan was so great that i can see him having a very successful future down the road
the supporting actors which are his best friends matt and steve also provide some much needed comic relief throughout the movie
the scene with them flying is just absolutely awesome and stuck out as one of my favorite parts of the movie
the last 30 minutes of the movie are just absolutely epic with the different changing camera angles throughout the city like cop car footage mall security footage and various other news reporter cameras
that is really what got me hooked on this movie and why ive been recommending it to everyone i see
chronicle a catch it b foundfootage is the new thing captured hollywood amp audience by storm
the foundfootage movies are good but sometimes irritating
nonetheless it defiantly makes simple story more real and fascinating e
g paranormal activity
chronicle is story of three boys getting into a magic hole and getting power of telekinesis
its defiantly sounds cheesy but the foundfootage thing makes this cheesy story line lot more appealing
the credit goes to josh trank and max landis because its out and out their imagination and clever direction and story respectively which keeps us hooked to the chair
casting is completely fresh so we dont have any pre conceived notions about the actors
dane dehaan is brilliant as misfit kid
alex russell is a charmer i saw him in aussie wasted on young before
michael b
jordan is alright there is nothing much a black dude does in thrillers except getting hit first
ashley hinshaw is pretty
overall chronicle is intriguing engaging and entertaining
im defiantly down for sequel
the movie is about three boys gaining superpowers after entering a cave
they soon realize that power changes their life drastically
let me start with the good parts
it is actually nice to see the birth of a superhero the initial struggle with the power and the way power changes someones life
what made me disappointed was the script and the way they did the filming
the found footage style of movie making frustrates me more than superbad acting since i am not paying to see a shaking camera
i hated it since the beginning and i dont see why people insist shooting a whole movie with hand held cameras
anyways the script was weak as well
there was nothing you wouldnt expect
to make the long story short if i had seen this movie on tv i wouldnt watch it
this movie makes me excited for josh tranks future projects because his work is unique and surprisingly redeemable
dane dehaan delivered a stellar performance which was much needed because of the distractingly poor cgi
i was not bothered by the found footage aspect at all and believed that it helped me learn more about andrews character as i could see the world from his perspective
the filmaking style also enhanced the suspensehorror aspect of the movie
apart from a rushed conclusion chronicle was a nice surprise that is definitely worth checking out especially if you are a fan of scifi and superhero movies
this awkward blend of several trendy genres has something to say but cant quite work out the right way to say it
as the meeting point between superhero origin pictures found footage compilations and moody comingofage stories it arrives preloaded with all manner of tripmines and potholes so numerous that it cant hope to avoid them all
it feels hokey and gimmicky particularly when the action grows intense and the plot bends over backwards for an excuse to introduce more handheld cameras
the cast interactions feel rushed and shallow hurrying past crucial bits of character development to reach the precious prize of a shiny effects shot
and even those presumably the films sizzle unanimously feel weak and clunky
chronicle has a point and the ruminations it embraces about the underbellies of each genre have loads of potential
its just so poorly executed nearly across the board that its tough to focus on whats going on beneath the hood
excellent as a rough sketch or a proof of concept flat as a finished product
i give this movie a 10 because i have never in the last 9 years watched a better movie than this one
there are only 2 movies i absolutely loved and they are the exorcism of emily and insidious
and now this one
i totally loved it
you will not regret watching it trust me
chronicle held my attention all of 1 hour and 23 minutes it lasted
i am really pleasantly surprised by this movie
as soon as i saw it on the internet it cought my attention and i bought it  and i do not regret the money that i gave to purchase this movie
i am fascinated
i suggest for you to watching i guarantee you much entertainment and fun
you could even learn something from it
entertaining nice but it could be better there is idea that no matter what what you do make or what do you have still the opinion of parents will effect you the most  its very nice movie worth the time but i wish it ends in better way using the camera on the way documentary films was beautiful and smart making this project a more enjoyable time was an important factor was not long and boring but unfortunately i still have a big issue with the ending it could be better  and in this movie you dont need to bay a blueray version in the end its not batman or the iron man but for me its more enjoyable then ironman if you have time and nothing to watch  watch it
great movie with great actors
i felt as if i was back in high school again and i shared the coming out story of the jock meeting the nerds and having a great time
i certainly hope there will be a follow up movie
i hate films with the shaky found footage effect but this was done in an unabusive method
the only part i didnt quite understand was with them doing these wondrous feats in public and no one saying anything as they fly away from the supermarket
i enjoyed the way the story was told and the villain emerging from true pain of death and embarrassment
i was hoping for a longer story and ending was cool but a bit brief
this movie is a great change from the usual super hero story because it wasnt
it was more of a coming of age story about three boys with special abilities
i can see a sequel coming with the same actors coming back
great movie to see and own
the best i can give this film is a meh
chronicle is another in a long line of super power origin stories that has been done to death using the not so clever idea of found footage that is plague upon modern cinema
it doesnt help that during the scenes when people are flying you can almost see the crane and harness they are using
similarly forcing the film to stick with its found footage format really hinders the suspension of disbelief aspect of the film
its almost like the director cant wait to have andrew gain some powers so he can have him use telekinesis to have a camera float above the character for the rest of the film
if that is going to be the case why not just shoot this without the found footage technique

a very nice science fiction film that emerges as something different and not just the same show of powers with unnecessary fighting
the film will take you through a way which shows as to what a person will do if they get power
you will feel at all times that a i would have done this or that
the only thing which i never like is the found footage filming
it makes me shout unnecessarily
the situations were nicely framed and do gives you a very nice experience
the story properly builds all the characters and in particular the lead character who turns evil as time passed
this film is not like the idea that when you get power you have to save the world and anything that we saw in green lanternawful
it makes you feel what actually would happen when you too will get power
i liked the ending also
for his first feature film josh trank impressed the hell out of me
the storyline from this site adequately covers the plot without spoiling too much and if you watch the trailerpreview you will want to see i can tell you now that trailer is not misleading
the fact that the cast does not include well known names did not stop the movie from making a mark and the numbers back that up
if you can get passed the hand held camera work that was compulsory but thankfully not throughout given one main character is chronicling video journal style a period in his life you will discover a good movie
it has a take on characters with super powers that youve not seen before and that novel perspective makes a difference
the characters are well developed the actors hold their own and are quite believable there are plenty of good special effects and you will not be bored thats for sure
the pace does not let up the intrigue builds and it keeps getting better steadily to the end
i sure was impressed and recommend it for all these reasons
this was quite different for me in that three quarters of the film was the build up with all the action been cramped into 20 minutes
the story line in general was good however there where many scenes where i would have liked to have seen a different outcome
my first criticism with regards to this movie is the lack of much expected action adding to the fact that all the action was crammed into a short space of time
the second criticism would be the ending
there are many unanswered questions
although there was no indication for a following sequel these questions must be answered leading me to believe there may be a sequel at some point probably with a completely different story line to the original but some how linked
