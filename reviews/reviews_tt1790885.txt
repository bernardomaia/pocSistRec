"\nI was honestly expecting a lot more, given the multiple nominations for\nawards. I really thought this movie was overdone and could have been\npared down by at least 45 minutes. In the end, it was just a glorified\n\"we killed bin laden\" pseudo-documentary. The character relationships\nnever developed and seemed empty. And I didn't really find the main\nactress very believable or that great. Scenes of shooting dead bodies\nalso were probably a bit too much -- overall this movie seemed overly\nnationalistic and simplistic without delivering much in the way of\ncontent. I thought Hurt Locker was a significantly better movie. Again,\nI am somewhat surprised at the number of award nominations this movie\nreceived.\n"
"\nPoor screenplay, poor dialogs, extremely bad actors and some strange\nand disturbing way of directing for a two hour and a half movie. The\nfilm is boring, the plot is childish and Maya it seems to be a little\nbit psychotic. Kathryn Bigelow tried the Hurt Locker recipe once again\nbut this time her way to shoot just couldn't make anything\nunderstandable and bearable. Sometimes steady, most of time shaky, the\ncamera is so confusing, especially in small spaces that you don't know\nwhat the director want to say anymore....<br><br>And the script is as shallow as a B series movie...<br><br>Please don't loose your time. You'd better watch Tinke Taylor Soldier\nSpy or even Looper, at least you'll get entertain. Or if you want\nsomething European (because Bigelow it seem to me that she wants to\ncopy some of the European ways to shoot images) take a look at Beyond\nthe Hills. ;)\n"
"\nI was a crewchief assigned to the Group that lifted the SEALS to\nAbbatobad. I will not make claims I am associated with the mission,\nbecause I wasn't. Nonetheless, this movie disappointed me to the point\nI fell asleep at the 1 hour mark. Without going into a rant, I would\nhope everyone understands the actual events. \"Maya\" didn't sacrifice\nanything; she did find UBL, but was well compensated financially the\nentire time she was looking. The basis of this movie is her work\nfinding UBL, which makes my stomach turn. It's so easy to sit behind a\nkeyboard and act like you are changing the world. Her line in the movie\nto \"kill Bin Laden for me\" will resonate until my death. I can promise\nyou, UBL wasn't killed for Maya and it is pretty obvious that once he\nwas found, the true heroes were summoned. Her remarks in the movie\nabout \"you guys showing up with your facial hair and dip\" is so\ndisullionist, it should be edited. She is a coward and her\nglorification in this movie sickens me.\n"
"\nWASTED time. A LOT of wasted time.\"Cold war style propaganda\", that I\nthought was supposed to end decades ago. Overrated \"movie\" by overrated\ndirector. There was absolutely nothing of the story I could catch in\nfirst hour, maybe hour and half, if not the whole two! I don't really\nunderstand why this was created. Maybe if the main actress was Dennis\nRodman. Maybe if there was Chuck Norris in the SEAL team. Maybe if\nthere was at least 1/5 of the facts accurate (and Im talking about\nfacts that are just known about this manhunt). Maybe if there was a\nteam of transformers or comic cartoon heroes supporting this action.\nMaybe if somewhere in Pakistan, Charlie Chaplin fell into sewer because\nof some banana . Then maybe it would have 2 stars from me.\n"
"\nThis should have been good, I really wanted it to be good. At the very\nleast it should have been interesting. Unfortunately, it took 2.5 hours\nto tell 45 minute's worth of story... This film needed some serious\nediting- too many scenes seemed forced, out of place or just thrown in\nwith little explanation or necessity... For example- why include the\nscene asking Maya about being recruited to the CIA right after high\nschool, then drop the topic saying she can't explain why- it didn't do\nanything to move the story along- and left me wondering \"what was that\nabout???\" I mean- would the answer to why she was recruited make her\nmotives and obsessions more understandable? What was the viewer\nsupposed to take away from that conversation? Skip watching this one in\nthe theater- if you must watch it out of curiosity, wait until it comes\nout on DVD or cable- then at least you're only losing your time and not\na handful of hard earned cash.\n"
"\nI've seen all the reasons viewers (and some critics) dislike this film,\nbut in my opinion it is infinitely superior to ARGO in its authenticity\nand dramatic quality. The final scenes, when the SEAL team, goes into\nBen Laden's house, are brilliantly rendered. The idea of doing it\nmostly in the dark with flashes of illumination by \"night vision\" green\nis a brilliant touch, which most directors would never have attempted. <br><br>The performances by Jessica Chastain, of course, Jason Clark and\nJennifer Ehle are top drawer and the torture scenes, while brutal, are\nnecessary--because that's the way it happened. Congratulations to\nKathryn Bigelow and Mark Boal for getting it right.<br><br>I don't want to put the knock on Argo, because I found it entertaining.\nBut it's artificiality provides a distinct contrast with Zero Dark\nThirity's authenticity, and authenticity wins.\n"
"\nLike many other people who gave this movie a bad review, we expected\nmuch more. I have not found a bad review that I did not agree with.\nJust read them all, lump them together and you have my opinion of this\nOscar nominated overly long load of crap. Bad editing. Bad acting. The\nmumbling dialogue at the beginning should have given me the clue that\nthis was going to be bad from the start. Spoiler: I found it insulting\nto my intelligence in the scene when the soldiers put their fingers to\ntheir lips and just say \"Shush\" to the children who have just witnessed\ntheir parents being shot to death. I guess they want us to think that\nMoslems treat the death of their parents much as the equivalent of one\nof their favorite toys being broken. My wife called it \"Violence Porn\".\nI don't find the depiction of violence for no good reason exciting and\nworthy of praise. I am aware that there are many others who do. Maybe\nthat is where the good reviews come from?\n"
"\nSuperb espionage/military-drama from Kathryn Bigelow (who directed the\neven more impressive The Hurt Locker). Details the search for and\nelimination of Osama Bin Laden.<br><br>Tight, intriguing plot. Excellent direction from Bigelow - the tension\nis built, and even though you know how it ends, it stays incredibly\nengrossing throughout. You hardly realise that the movie is over 2 1/2\nhours long, the high level of engagement is so constant and the pace of\nthe movie so perfect. <br><br>Great performance from Jessica Chastain in the lead role. Good support\nfrom Jason Clarke, Kyle Chandler, Mark Strong and Jennifer Ehle. Minor\nparts for Joel Edgerton and James Gandolfini.\n"
"\nOne need patience to watch this. To see the country who bring us the\nmodern democracy using the KGB \"tools\" - and all of this for nothing -\nmake me sick. Same parts of this \"movie\" remember me the\nblack-and-withe Nazi propaganda documentaries. Shooting female civilian\nin the back its not a heroic act. Not even in a war. Never was. I have\nsome doubts about what real happened on that night in Pakistan. Why the\nmost wanted was not taken alive. Submitted to a Court. Show him to the\nworld and let the American people to judge him. Interrogate him. Using\nthe law to make justice. Nothing of this was answered. All the movie\nits like a very bad documentary about assassination and torture . <br><br>I finish this with only a sad sentence: on a scale from 1 to 10 I give\na big 0 (zero).\n"
"\nI have come to this film pretty late and am a bit surprised at the\npolarised views <br><br>I enjoyed the Hurt Locker and given that the outcome is obviously known\nI still found it tense, dramatic etc and I put this down to Katherine\nBigelow's skill as a director <br><br>As others as commented this is far from propaganda as it is a pretty\nuncomfortable ride in the early part of the film as torture is used <br><br>I didn't see this as an 'ends justifies the means' positioning, however\nbut steps along the journey <br><br>if you haven't seen it certainly don't be put off by the low mark\nreviews, they are just silly <br><br>There is so much directorial skill here <br><br>Certainly If you enjoyed the Hurt locker then see this\n"
"\nDo not watch this, it was a complete waste of time, if your looking for\nsomething better I suggest watching the Seal Team 6 movie, which is\nbased on the same concept of this movie. This movie is long boring and\nsuch a waste of time, I never write reviews but this movie was so bad I\nhad to let everyone know not to watch it. Terrible just Terrible. The\nplot is so slow, the acting isn't good at all. The characters portrayed\nin this doesn't seem as accurate as they should be, as the characters\nmake senseless decisions. If I was a CIA operative I'm sure I would be\nmuch more intelligent than the people portrayed in this movie. I was\nactually happy when one of the operatives got blown up because this\nmovie was just terrible.\n"
"\nI think this movie has shown the reality of USA. They not even try to\nfool the people but they also show that they are innocent and are doing\nright thing while they themselves are evil inside. I saw this whole\noperation from my home. There were lots of gun fires and blasts for\nlike 5-10 minutes. The bird didn't crash by itself. It was shot down. I\nwent there and even saw the ashes few days later. The place is called\nAbbott-Abad and its not 45 minutes drive from Islamabad. I Have a 1500\nCC Honda civic and it takes me at least 2 hours. We speak Urdu not\nArabic. As about this operation, I think its only a drama to show the\npeople that USA has done it finally. Foolish Americans can believe\ntheir government if they want to otherwise they should seek out for the\ntruth on their own. Because thats all I can say to you, nothing that\nlooks right, is actually right. It is twisted world esp since Zionists\nhave gotten power over USA. This movie could have hit a lot of audience\nand they might be praising it but Oscar? puff.... no way. I can make a\nbetter movie if I have money.\n"
"\nGiven the probable false-flag nature of 9-11 as a justification for new\npredatory imperialism in the Middle East and subversion of the\nConstitution at home, it is likely that Osama Bin Laden did not exist.\nThus, the film is at best propaganda and possibly pure falsehood -\ncertainly not art. If he existed as a spokesperson, he is easily\nreplaced. If he was an actual person wielding power, there is an\nendless line of thugs to replace him. My guess is that he was a\nfictional character played by an actor. If the government were\nforthright, they would have provided reasonably believable proof that\nthe dead man - if there was one - at least looked like the actor in the\nvideos.\n"
"\nEverything has been said probably in the comments. The movie by far\ndoes not deserve the negativity it gets in the reviews here. The\nproblem of the story of \"the hunt for Bin Laden\" is really that it was\nsuch a long road. I'd say a TV-series will come of this sooner or\nlater. There's so much to tell in this decade long hunt.<br><br>Anyways, indeed the plot of the movie was not its strongest part. The\ninclusion of the London bombings wasn't necessary to make the point, we\nall know that anyways. The Madrid ones were left out, so it makes it\nhard to understand some of the plot choices. Leaving out some\nunnecessary details might have given some screen time to develop more\ncharacter-depth/background. <br><br>But all in all I rate the movie 8 out of 10, despite some of its\nidentified weaknesses. It has suspense, action and drama, and the\nacting was good. The closing scenes were amazing.\n"
"\nThis movie is awesome. After seeing this movie and sadly having to\nwatch Django, I do not, for any reason see the logic in how the\ndirector did not get an Oscar nod. Tarantino get's one for the waste of\nthree hours of a human's life. I know there is a code of honor that was\nbroken by the SEAL team member who wrote the book that this movie is\nbased on but I think that telling the story gave the American people a\ntrue insight into the take down on how the countries most wanted person\ncame to justice! The ONLY thing I would have liked to have seen was\nPresident Obama's formal address to the United States Citizens that Bin\nLaden had been killed. That would have been AWESOME!!!!\n"
"\n(I have added a spoiler alert for those who have yet to see the film\nand do not know anything about what happened from the news at the\ntime!) Well I have finally seen this on DVD and was a little\ndisappointed actually! The story lead in and characters were too\nsketchy; it clearly wasn't a drama documentary but seemed unwilling to\ncommit at the human interest level either. The bizarre handling of the\nDoctor assassin seems to reinforce the impression of the contemporary\nnews coverage - what were they doing re security????? And the stupidity\nof the chap driving around in the same distinctive white car and using\nthe same mobile 'phone ditto. What would be really interesting is an\nanalysis of whether it ought to have taken them that long to locate him\n- and did the CIA really lose interest and leave it to one keen agent\nand a few henchmen? The actual raid was well done though - in fact the\nSEALS developed their characters far more in the last 30mins than the\nothers had in the previous couple of hours... Oh and John Barrowman's\nbrief appearance was a bit distracting!\n"
"\nbeing very truthful, i have watched another worst movie,totally wrongly\ndepicted Pakistan. In fact, i can prove, that this movie has been shot\nin India, instead of Pakistan. Producer even didn't do a very basic\nhomework for this movie for the culture of Pakistan. We don't speak\nArabic, not all the men wear a big turbine, not all the women wear a\nshuttle-cock Burqa. Urdu is our national language. and last but not the\nleast, our sign boards on the roads are in Urdu or English, not in\nHindi. Please stop showing this worst picture of our country. Everyone\nknows, who is behind the anarchy and chaos in Pakistan. and we have the\nbest intelligence and army, we don't need foreign forces to carry on\noperations in our country. really a worst production ever.\n"
"\nThe only question I have in me is: Is this movie done to shock and ask\nwhy America is spiting on human rights? or is it to justify it?\nTechnically the movie is fine and the actors good as it succeeded to\nmake me dislike them. It is a pity that the message is so unclear. Ah\nno yes ... message is torture helped us to fight evil...<br><br>Shocking... leaving a lot of questions to me. Disgusting display and\npseudo \"justification\" of human rights violation... poor world. IF this\nfilm depicts reality these people should be prosecuted in Nuremberg...\nI was used to movies without scenario. But this has a scenario and it\nfollows real event I am afraid. <br><br>As a conclusion, as showing usage of torture getting result without\nhighlighting the immorality and illegality of torture, I unfortunately\nimagine this film will \"justify\" torture in the eyes of younger\naudience. I have read very hard and justified reviews here. <br><br>This film will not help to make a better world. No...\n"
"\nJessica Chastain, a recent CIA agent, begins as a rather mousy, quiet\nwoman who squirms during the torture scenes of terrorist operatives in\nthis 2012 film.<br><br>It isn't until some of her colleagues are killed in an ill- fated\nmeeting that the Chastain character seems to take charge. She shows\nthat she has a mouth and can curse with the best of the boys.<br><br>Chastain gave a rather interesting compelling performance as the woman\nwho discovered bin Laden's hiding place and was very sure of herself in\nrelation to her male counter parts.<br><br>Let us also give tremendous credit to the Navy Seals who so bravely\nentered the compound in Pakistan to take down the terror-master mind.\n"
"\nI understand why this movie was made and I also understand why many\npeople wanted to love this movie but unfortunately it proves to be a\ndisappointment. Everything up until the moment they actually capture\nBin Laden is extremely dull and not really necessary. When you really\nthink about it, it took 10 years to track him down and real life is not\nalways as interesting as the movies. I imagine tracking down Bin Laden\nwould have been boring with time delays, dead ends, misinformation and\njust generally painful and that's what shows in Zero Dark Thirty.<br><br>Do civilians really have the right or need to know what goes on when\nthe government does their job to bring down terrorist scum. Maybe not.\nA television special probably would have been sufficient to inform the\nworld of the circumstances following the take down of Bin Laden not a\n2hr, 40min movie. If you can't handle the full movie fast forward to\nwhen they infiltrate the compound he was hiding in. You won't miss\nanything and you will still get the satisfaction of seeing how\neverything played out.\n"
"\nHoly cow! I thought The Hurt Locker was bad, but this is even worse!\nSince we all know what happened to UBL, I would rather see a\ndocumentary on the subject. This is Hollywood tripe, creating\nfictitious characters that are totally unbelievable. OK...I will accept\nthat since it's a fictitious movie based on a real event. But my god,\nit is dang boring and slow and not entertaining at all! During the\n\"climatic\" scene, all I saw was a dark screen for 20 minutes with\nglimpses of light! I suffered through 2 hours of dreariness to end up\nwatching darkness. Like ARGO, this was a very much over-rated movie.\nARGO was also based on a real event with a known outcome, but it at\nleast had a bit of suspense at its climatic scene for entertainment\nvalue. I don't know what the point of this movie is except to waste 2.5\nhours of your time.\n"
"\nZero Dark Thirty. Not sure why it is titled that but anyway it is the\nchronicle of the decade-long hunt for al-Qaeda terrorist leader Osama\nbin Laden after the 9/11 attacks in 2001, and his death at the hands of\nthe American military in May 2011. From the word go, the movie takes\nyou to the hunt, importance and desperation of it. Here the lead\ncharacter Maya played by terrific Jessica Chastain fights fire with ice\nbut in few scenes her outburst gives you the goosebumps in this\nthrilling chase. In last hour or so where they believe that they have\nlocated their man, movie converts into the one of the most thrilling\nand realistic missions showcased on celluloid. On the flip side, I kept\nwaiting for some back story of Maya to know why she is like that. Even\nthough I felt that they just got lucky in finding Osama Bin Laden and\nsome sequences were over simplified, there is no denying because of\nthis movie I was able to experience the most important man-hunt of\nrecent times. Don't miss it!!\n"
"\nI am probably barking up the wrong tree here, but what kind of ultimate\ncrap is this? Five minutes in and I was angry already. Is this movie\nsupposed to justify the torture under Bush and Obama's command? That\ndude with the curls was a total douche bag, a psychopath. Torture a man\none day, offer him a cigarette the next. That's not 'work', that's\npsychopathy and it should not be justified in a lame *ss movie.<br><br>Oh right, yeah, Pakistanis don't speak Arab.<br><br>The makers of these movie never did any proper research. They just\nasked the government, made notes, and went from there. Excellent\nresearch, right. First hand accounts, right! The worst part is that\npeople believe this cow dung. So I guess Pakistan is next on the\ninvasion list? Or is it Syria after all? Or maybe Iran? Hmmm!!! Last\nbut not least, what are Mercutio and that Cool Guy With the Eye Brows\ndoing in this crap movie?\n"
"\nIf you like watching movies that are slow paced, boring, full of bad\nacting, over produced, overly long, and give you no sympathy for the\ncharacters, then this is the film for you!<br><br>From the whole controversy about this films torture scenes to the fact\nit was nominated for a load of awards, i was expecting something with a\nlot more punch. The whole way through, i just kept thinking 'Ok its\ngoing to pick up the pace soon' but...it never did. Boring, bad acting,\ntotally overrated, and the torture scenes were nowhere near as bad as\nhow they were made out to be. Characters were unconvincing, i felt\nnothing for them, there was never any relationship between anyone. Its\na shame this film was so bad, as i expected a lot more from the\ndirector of one of my favorite movies (The Hurt Locker). Overall, not\none I would watch again. And 157 minutes? Seriously? It could have been\ndone in 30. Might have enjoyed it more if it was.\n"
"\nAgree with the other reviews, cant understand why the academy award and\nnominations. Waste of time. Now I have add lines and all I can say more\nof the same, was excited to see available on pay per view. Is in screen\nright now so must be awful for me to sign up and review while the movie\nis still playing. Now will copy and paste above so meet the criteria to\ntell you this is useless waste of time and has no depth what so ever.\nOh the movie ended as useless as it begins, CIA operative getting on a\nplane and crying. I am crying too as I spent the money to watch this\nuseless movie and was so looking forward to it. Well one more line and\nI get to complete my review and hope this helps someone save 2 hours of\nwatching a disjointed boring movie about how the seal team got bin\nladen. Ciao\n"
"\nWhen I watch a movie, the last thing I would judge it on is Politics.<br><br>Also, it amazes me how personal people on here can become.<br><br>I thought it was a good movie.<br><br>The actors came across as credible.<br><br>It showed some of the ugly sides of war.<br><br>The story kept me alert.<br><br>It kept me awake.<br><br>It isn't perfect, however, which movie is? And at the end I felt\nfulfilled.<br><br>At the end, I guess you see what you want to see...\n"
"\nOne of the worst pieces of propaganda I have ever seen. Torture does\nnot work and lowers the US (and by association, my country, Canada) to\nthe level of the Taliban. It's not news that the so-called \"enhanced\ninterrogation techniques\" employed by the US did not and do not work.\nWe knew this before 9/11 and that is why the US didn't employ torture.\nThe US Senate report confirms this past week that the CIA lied about\ntorture and what was gleaned from detainees. We know now, as a matter\nof record, that torture did not lead to Bin Laden. We also know that\nwhatever info they did get on Bin Laden was obtained before torture was\nemployed. We also know that when field operatives in the CIA said a\ndetainee had no more to give, Langley told them to keep torturing them.\nThis movie should be boycotted. As a movie, this film was long and\npainfully boring. It felt fictitious, but not in any fun drama or\naction movie kind of way. I had to watch it in three different sitting\nas the bile that I would taste in my mouth from watching this\npropaganda piece was almost too much to stomach.\n"
"\nI am a big fan of several Kathryn Bigelow-directed movies including The\nHurt Locker and Blue Steel. Zero Dark Thirty was a let-down. Clearly\nthe Hollywood Hype Machine strikes again. After watching this movie I\ncannot for the life of me fathom how it could be considered for movie\nof the year. There is very little suspense and the characters were very\none dimensional. Alternatively, The Hurt Locker literally had me on the\nedge of my seat but Zero Dark Thirty seemed unnecessarily long and slow\nto develop. Seeing Lincoln and Zero Dark Thirty in the same week I have\nto say that Lincoln was a far superior movie and is definitely worthy\nof movie of the year. Zero Dark Thirty is not a bad movie but it is no\nThe Hurt Locker and it is far from Oscar-worthy.\n"
"\nDeeply disappointed.<br><br>Plot is so black and white, that you are really surprised and you will\nstart thinking that movie is made for average joe American, who still\nthinks that terrorism is evil, and USA is pure goodness. Of course,\nterrorism should not be tolerated in any way, but still is appropriate\nto ask ourselves about roots of such acting.<br><br>Characters in the movie don't seem real. I did expect more. Especially\nbecause everyone is talking about this movie.<br><br>Still, even considering that movie is unrealistic and one-sided, I\nwould at least expect some excitement and entertainment. But it's\nreally boring. I almost fell asleep during movie. You constantly have a\nfeeling that you saw such type of movies at least thousand times.<br><br>So my advice is, skip this movie unless you are big patriot who\nbelieves in fairy tales produced everyday by governments.\n"
"\nAfter seeing the OBL movie that National Geographic hyped (and was\nextremely poor) I had hoped this would be much better. I was wrong.\nYes, more money was spent on this movie, with better actors, director,\nscript (?), editing, etc.; however, the movie is nowhere near as\nfactual as claimed. Wrong equipment, adding characters, fattening the\nstory with trivial embellishment, creating situations that never\nhappened, changing the story to what they want it to be, just ruined\nthis movie. OBL was taken to a carrier in the Arabian Sea, proved to be\nOBL, then he was buried in the Arabian Sea. There is more inventive\npeople and scenes in this movie; however, over time, it has proved to\nbe more accurate than the other movie. Yes, it is better.\n"
"\nI hate to be so contrary to the hype we are hearing and the Oscar tap,\nbut I was not impressed nor even that entertained... in fact I had just\ncommented to my companion movie goer that the lead character had not\nbeen very impressive when she finally had some acting to perform... the\nscene where she gave the station chief an ultimatum... the rest of the\nstory was choppy and not cohesive and as much as I was pumped when the\nactual take down occurred, I was not pumped at all in the movie's take\ndown... at any rate as much as some seem to appreciate this movie, I on\nthe other hand would not recommend spending the money to see it... Argo\nwas much better.\n"
"\nAll the technical aspects were on point, dialogue, tension, pace,\ndirecting, editing etc. But do you really EXPECT an audience to believe\nthat for twelve years the hunt for Bin Laden was successful SOLELY\nbecause an angry, obsessive-compulsive, bitter, sexless patriot, who\ngulps down with reckless abandon the moronic, empty rhetoric justifying\nthis crusade through sheer determination, faith, inner strength,\nbelief, outlasted, outclassed, out focused, harangued, harassed,\ndisrespected her superior's in the version of a 'one (Wo)man army\ntriumphs against good and evil'? Purlease. Every person around her was\nincompetent? lazy? disinterested? This woman had no relatable qualities\nat all, perhaps except for her queasy stomach early on in the presence\nof torture. (at least Bigelow left that part in). Apart from that she\njust scowled, yelled and threw fits. But that's OK. In the pursuit to\nshow strong female protagonist's, it doesn't matter about the content,\nbecause you'll get token kudos anyway.\n"
"\nThe hunt for Osama Bin Laden. Quit a thrill.. an Homeland extended\nexperience. But to be honest only Patrick (Joel Edgerton), Maya\n(Jessica Chastian) and foremost the excellent sound engineering kept me\nwatching.. I do not see why Kathryn Bigelow (director) stretched out\nsome scenes to the limit of boredom and why the Abottabad landing and\nthe action to find Osama with so many 'impossible' dark shots.. This\nmovie (2.37) could have been at least an hour shorter. This momentum in\nUSA/Al Qaida history would have been far better served by a filmmaker\nlike Clint Eastwood... 5 out of 10 for the movie but a 2 for Bigelow.\n"
"\nWhy in Pakistan they talked by Arabic in movie they should talking by\nUrdo. I thought it's silly mistake and goofs audiences!! Okay Osama is\nSaudi's and talking Arabic, Urdo and English but there's no\nconversation with him all conversations in movie with Pakistanis people\nby Arabic and they're not talking Arabic!!<br><br>However, also when they Killed Osama his beard was gray and when they\nput him in dead bags his beard become black!<br><br>There are so many mistake in movie and it's waisting time to watch\nmovie for more than two hours without any special events it's not fare\nto rated this movie seven of ten I can rated only four out of ten.<br><br>Moreover, there are so many movie you can enjoy when you watch it but\nthis movie only waisting your time!!\n"
"\nZero Dark Thirty is good movie , I expected a little more , so that\nalso yes it is a good film, direction Kathryn Bigelow , Oscar winner\nfor best actress , here she is well , can make an excellent performance\nof Jessica Chastain, the cast is very good, Jason Clarke , Joel\nEdgerton , Jennifer Ehle , Mark Strong , Edgar Ramirez , Kyle Chandler\n, Chris Pratt , much of this good, I found the long film, what it is\nnot bad , plus the script in my opinion was well dragged the picture is\ngood , the film has a good pace , even if at times it is a little slow\n, I think just 2 hours enough series film, Zero Dark Thirty is a good\nmovie , not enough to be the best film 2012, more is advisable ,\nespecially for the great performance of Jessica Chastain . Note 7.8\n"
"\nDisappointing directing from Kathryn Bigelow.<br><br>she could've done more with a story like that .<br><br>I think she thought that the story is good enough and she should stick\nto story telling, and she went Steve McQueen on it but not Steve\nMcQueen enough.<br><br>And yeah Steve McQueen is a verb now any how time idea and scenes\nmanagement was not good The defining events and moments in the story\n(in my opinion) was just blended in and didn't get the right amount of\nfocus.<br><br>....\n"
"\nZero Dark Thirty \"teaches\" three things: <br><br>First, both military/secret service personnel and terrorists are just\nas boring and miserable as any other average person in the street. <br><br>Second, it is possible and and in principle \"alright\" to torture people\nif this is what you job demands. It won't make you less human or\nextraordinarily evil. Things will go on normally just as before.<br><br>Third, despite the fact that American military and secret services\npossess almost unlimited financial and technological resources, it\nstill isn't that easy to catch and kill a smart and careful terrorist,\nso they still deserve a credit for achieving that.\n"
"\nKudos to Kathryn Bigelow and the entire crew of ZDT for making such a\nsticky and sensitive film. Though I happen to watch the movie only\nrecently. And I watched it several times because it gave so many visual\ndepiction of incidents which we have only heard so far.<br><br>Sticky, because it has depicted a fragment of different operations\nconducted by US intelligentsia (read CIA) for over a decade. Sensitive,\nbecause, as the so called closest ally of US to fight against\nterrorism, Pakistan have double-crossed all along.<br><br>Cinematically, I found the movie lived up to the expectation. I have\nread several adverse and annoyed comments against the film. I was\namused to read those.<br><br>Few of the reasons for their comments are; 1. those who diabolically\nhate US, 2. those who belong to the same 'Ummah' of OBL, 3. those who\ndo not know anything about the religion of this sect, 4, and lastly,\nthose who do not know how the act of terrorism came in to being since\nearly 7th century AD. And still people wonder, why Maya weeped in the\nend!\n"
"\n6.5/10 In sum: first 3/4 boring, final quarter is interesting; not\nworth it, but has good production effects<br><br>I thought the Hurt Locker was boring, so I figured this might be along\nthe same lines. It took me 3 weeks of the BluRay sitting by the player\nto actually force myself to sit down and watch it. So possibly I went\ninto it and it became a self fulfilling prophecy with it being boring.<br><br>TBH I feel like the movie did a disservice to the story and it made it\nall so painfully boring. If you're going to watch this movie, skip to\nthe 2 hr in mark. That's when everything is finally interesting.<br><br>I get the slowness of the movie in illustrating Actress Jessica\nChastain's character's difficulty in sleuthing and convincing. But the\nHurt Locker is so similar in direction and feel, that I feel this is\nmore Director Kathryn Bigelow's fault than anything else.<br><br>Yet another Oscar hyped movie that isn't worthwhile\n"
"\nHow should Hollywood approach real world stories about black ops,\ngeopolitical espionage and covert vested interests, around which whirl\nclouds of doubt and conspiracy? According to Zero Dark Thirty, you tell\nsomething close to the official story and let it stand or fall on its\nown merits.<br><br>Events seem, at least initially, to be barely evaluated and leave much\ninterpretation up to the viewer. But then, what to include and what not\nto include? While being taken to task for suggesting that information\ngained via torture was effective in revealing Bin Laden's whereabouts,\nall Zero Dark Thirty really does is show that it occurred behind the\nUSA's delusions of moral ascendancy, regardless of the intelligence\noutcomes.<br><br>The potential for a heroic narrative is allowed to unravel somewhat.\nThe film's authors lend a hand by portraying the hunt for Bin Laden as\na bitter obsession that hollowed out the life of its female protagonist\n(in truth a melange of several female agents who drove the long quest\nfor retribution and closure).<br><br>More at moviedump.org\n"

"\nOn the edge of my seat the first 45mins but lost interest after. I\nthink this movie is more about Maya's (Jessica Chastain) role coming to\nterms with her own femininity and sexuality than what the original\nstory was planned or wanted us to think. Is this really a film about\ntracking down Bin Laden or more about let's make a movie with a strong\nfemale lead? Maybe just poor character development and an overlong\nstretched out story line made me just turn it off. This one is not what\nI expected. It could have been done better with an emphasizes on plot\nand others too in the movie and less on Maya. Does she take on a strong\nfemale lead? I think that was intended but poor acting and no character\ndevelopment on this one. Another one of those cookie cutter movies that\njust goes nowhere but tries to sell itself on the 9/11 tragedy.\n"
"\nI believed that it was a terrible idea to make this film and, even\nafter having watched and thoroughly enjoyed it, still believe (albeit,\nto a lesser degree) it might not have been the best idea. Certain\nthings don't need to be publicized. However, the movie itself is\nterrific. It doesn't matter that all the details may not have been\ncompletely accurate. The point was to make a movie about how Bin Laden\nwas captured and they managed to do it well. Every element is well\nexecuted and Chastain really made a name for herself (and definitely a\nfan) with her performance. I really felt like I was part of all the\noperations taking place. And the level of pride and patriotism evoked\nis an achievement in itself. Not only that, my heart was pumping\nthroughout and especially towards the end. I would highly recommend\nthis to anyone and would gladly watch it a second and even a third\ntime. Watched 04/05-04/06/2013, written 08/08/2013.\n"
"\nIf you a looking for a hardcore action movie about killing Osama Bin\nLaden you came to the WRONG place this movie has action scenes and\nbombings, and also the ending (killing Oasma Bin Laden which lasts\nabout 30 min) but most of it is other things but I don't want to give\nto much away...... Even when there's not action it's not bad though,\nand when there is action it's great too. So either way it's great. The\nending was the best part of the movie to me getting to see Oasma Bin\nLaden get shot in the head twice well....... Was awesome and it was a\ngreat scene. Overall it was an amazing movie and should be seen. But\nthe torturing scene is a bit gruesome so...... Not everyone needs to\nsee this\n"
"\nThis was a pretty good film. While everyone liked the raid in\nAbbottabad, I found the buildup, the chase, to be very entertaining.\nKudos to Jessica Chastain, with whom I was unfamiliar. There is a lot\nof comment about the portrayal of \"torture\" leading to leads on bin\nLaden, and terrorist attacks in general. I use the scare quotes to\ndifferentiate the techniques that the CIA used from real torture, such\nas that practiced by, say, Arab despots, or American Indian tribes in\nthe 18th and 19th centuries. People say that torture will not get you\nreal information, but they do not come to it cold. They extract\ninformation that can be checked, or that they already know, in order to\njudge the veracity of the terrorist in question. As it happened, most\nof the detainees had a mindset that they must resist up to a point, but\nbeyond that, they generally sang. As for the moral aspect, this was\nstrictly done to gain information, and was not punitive in nature.\nAnyway, the film is worth seeing.\n"
"\nIn its category it is amongst the best even though it is difficult to\nwatch and has no shortage of violence, abuse and neglect. As another\nreviewer stated, Zero Dark Thirty is the type of film that needs good\nwriting to work, because it's about a long process mainly done by\npeople sitting at desks. Many scenes do not feel believable. But great\nperformances help to enhance this amazing story. This is one of those\nmovies that the cast isn't only in for the paycheck. All the characters\nstruggle against a system that has perpetuated falsehoods, and there\nare verbal fisticuffs back and forth. There are slow spots, but to me\nthe movie is too good to dismiss based on them.\n"
"\nIt's been a while since I had seen the movie, but from what I remember\nis that it had too much profanity. The characters use cuss words so\nmany times, and mostly when they're unnecessary. They do it in such a\nway that they not only look immature, but the dialogue throughout most\nof the movie seems too contrived. The character who tortures a\nterrorist always smokes and spits on the ground and speaks vulgar words\nso many times that it feels like the writers are trying too hard to\ngive us the impression that he's in the military. It seems too\nunrealistic. A lot of movies that depict war have a bad habit of\nportraying soldiers and generals as \"macho\". Enough of the stereotypes!<br><br>And regarding the end of the movie, (spoilers) the scene was too dark,\nand you couldn't tell what was going on. By the time they got Bin\nLaden, I didn't even realize it happened. It was very anti-climactic.<br><br>I also don't get how every time something war related happens, a year\nlater, the film industry wants to make a movie about it. I think it's\ntoo soon.<br><br>Not a good movie at all.\n"
"\nI don't know, why I watched it, had a high rate, that's all.<br><br>It's about war and manhunt. I don't really care about the conspiracy\ntheories, oil, and the who's doing it for what purposes. Still war\nwithout meaning. The popular war movies aren't about the war itself,\nbut some interesting drama or story created by it, the characters\nchanging because of that. Here, there's just nothing else. Needlessly\nlong scenes on the plot dilemma, just the usual things; and of course,\nthe president denies all the methods, they show. No twists, or real\naccidents. All the events shown are expectable and the movie is just\nsoooo slow, that I could release a sigh when it happened at last. Fun\nfactor almost zero (maybe 2 funny scenes). The only drama is, people\nget tired and retire from the hard work of manhunt, and a few\nteardrops.<br><br>I was thinking a lot, but I didn't find Any value in the picture and\nI'm still thinking what was the goal. Propaganda? Really?\n"
"\nFirst off this is a Hollywood movie and not something you should count\nas a history lesson. Folks are thinking that it is true because there\nwas some \"discontent\" with our government over some scenes--but those\nwere the scenes that were showing the CIA torturing suspects. In this\nliberal society, God forbid Americans know that you have to become dark\nto fight evil. To the movie: it is extremely long and boring. This\nmovie is as dull as K-19. It lacks the tension and suspense that a\nmovie of this \"supposed\" quality needed. Compare it to Argo and you\nwill see a third rate movie when shown side-by-side with Ben Affleck's\nfilm. The direction is slow and \"yawn\" as much as it was with her\nprevious films. The acting is decent, but there is not one single\nperformance that would be an Oscar nominated performance. I still\nremember the article that questioned how this movie was given an Oscar\nnomination when it was still in the editing process--but like it's\nfalse claims to \"real\" it purchased its \"false\" claim to an Oscar.\n"
"\nI was amazed by the film critics score of 95, and thought that it\nshould be a really good movie to get such high marks from the critics.<br><br>After seeing the movie, I feel the rating is undeserved. The movie is\nepisodic and at the end it comes across as pure dumb luck that that\nthey got a lead on UBL. It seems a cross between a documentary and an\naction movie which nevertheless is not satisfactory at either level.<br><br>Some events in the movie are surprisingly action movie like basically\nyou have to check out your brains to believe them, like a car being\nattacked right at the exit of a compound With a guard. At the end you\nare left wondering where the facts end and fiction begins.\n"
"\nIf your after a high action 'edge of your seat' War drama this isn't\nfor you!<br><br>90% of this film I personally found it to be slow and boring with a few\nexplosions to wake you up now and again during predictable situations,\nlead cast were dull and uninteresting and do not add anything to the\nfilm but on a positive note, I would say the last hour did get\ninteresting when infiltrating Bin Laden's home with good camera shots\nand tense atmosphere, so start the film 2 hours ahead and you'll be\nfine!<br><br>For an award nominated film i was expecting better and rate it as a\nGlorified Bin Laden documentary.\n"
"\nMovie, Zero Dark Thirty was a real eye catcher but that is it. Movie\nhad very less to offer and it's plots were stretched. Nothing\naggressive, nothing new. Movie got its fame in an obvious manner, but\nno special execution on director's part was seen. The script lacked\nnearly in every aspect. There were only some touches of thriller. Even\nexecution of drama was a bit narcissistic. Actors on the other hand\nwere equally terrible, maybe because the whole production of the movie\nwas a confusion between a partial documentary or of something more.\nMovie rolled just because of some life in the script and due to its\ncircumstantial fame. Could and should have been a lot better.\n"
"\nZero Dark Thirty (2012) Jessica Chastain. The story of the 10 year\npursuit of Osama Ben Laden and the woman who was obsessed with finding\nand bringing him down. Naval special warfare development group\n(DEVGRU), or SEAL Team 6, and the operation to go in and get him is the\nmost emotional part of the film. The matter-of-fact way the men get\nready and load up and go in and find and kill the terrorist, made me\nsob. Can't help it - they were so young and so well trained. No heroics\n- just another job to do. Bigelow, the director, has done another\nmarvelous job showing our men in action. We may not agree with the\npolitics, but the guys doing the job are great. Me? I'm glad they got\nthe SOB. The torture scenes are made to seem like just another day at\nthe office. Which is probably about what it is like after the decision\nwas made to do it. Age-old question - does the end justify the means?\n8/10\n"
"\nSlow and uninteresting.<br><br>There is no engagement with characters and the plot seems to take an\nage to finally get going. Even the only, eagerly anticipated action\nscene is poor and difficult to watch as it is filmed almost in complete\nblackness. It is incredibly hard to follow what is going on and frankly\nunnecessary especially when the people involved in portraying the\naction are all wearing night vision goggles. The scene would have been\nmuch better filmed from the first person through said goggles. <br><br>The film is far too long with a storyline we all know from the media, I\nwas expecting to find things out that I didn't already know or perhaps\nsome jucy conspiracy theories instead the film merely gave a run\nthrough of the facts surrounding the \"U-B-L\" hunt and killing.<br><br>I do not see why this film is so well regarded. <br><br>Use the 2hr36min wisely and watch something else\n"
"\nThis film might be shot at Chandigarh, India, but don't the makers have\ncommonsense to know that Indian made vehicle are not available in\nPakistan, especially 'Maruti 800' (a product of Maruti Suzuki with GOI\nas share holder)...

As all ppl\nwho have nothing else in life but work she throws herself into that\ntask while harassing everyone else on the way.

"\nJust sat through 2 1/2 hours of sheer boredom watching Zero Dark\nThirty.<br><br>Had heard it was awful but still watched. Ugh!!

"\nI couldn't follow this any better than I could the Hurt Locker. It was\nway too slow and long and the conversations/meetings were too hard to\nunderstand who and what they were talking about.(I even had subtitles\nturned on) Wish it had made more sense, but unfortunately, it didn't.\nWhat is zero dark thirty supposed to represent? Anyway, I am sure there\nare plenty of fans of this movie out there. But I am not one of them\nand this movie wasn't for me. Hoping for a better offering from Kathryn\nBigelow in the future after not understanding her last two films. Would\nlike to see something that's more to the point and adrenaline pumping\nlike an 80's movie like Point Break, which had a simple story.\n"
"\nThere is little sympathy for the characters, not EVEN the \"good guys!\"\nPoorly constructed film and rather disjointed! In order to accept that\nthere is some merit in torture to get information to protect our\ncountry, one must be able to get into the heads of the characters and\n\"understand\" why they do what they do. In Zero Dark Thirty, the\ncharacters are muddy, often vague, and lacking any social redeemable\nqualities. They are not likable, interesting or sympathetic--How can we\npossible like them or EVEN understand them and their motivation?? In\naddition to the poorly defined characters the movie is choppy and\npoorly edited. It is often confusing and spotty! Needless to say, while\nI watched the full film, I wish I had spent my time with another!!\n"
"\nI am seriously disappointed to say the least. Aside from average acting\nand unrealistic situations, the story has no continuity and is mildly\nboring at times. From the fact that 9/11 (as much as we don't want to\nbelieve it) is an inside job, plus including the background of a long\nhunt, (the longer - the better) Americans had a long enough time and\nunder \"terrorist\" danger, enough money, to build several bases all over\nthe Middle East and that was the real plan. OBL was a real person but\naside from that the entire \"dangerous man alive\" is a fairytale. I see\na movie as just one more unconvincing try to fabricate the truth. At\nthe end, it is a very forgettable make believe propaganda. It could be\nseen as a fact for someone who was not alive at the time and didn't see\nwhat happen on that day in 2001.\n"
"\nVirtually speechless after this movie, and for all the wrong reasons. I\nwas expecting it to be good, if not great.<br><br>How do you have take one of the most emotionally charged subjects of\nthe past century and suck all the emotion and suspense out of it? This\nis about the hunt for bin laden - the man behind 9/11 - for crying out\nloud! This really happened, and we've lived through it. If you can't\ncreate a compelling movie with that, then you shouldn't be making\nmovies.<br><br>No context. No character development. No suspense. One of the worst\npieces of storytelling I've ever seen.\n"
"\nAfter Muslims have been integrating well with all societies around the\nworld and the previous effect of the anti-Islam propaganda has been\nfading out.<br><br>\"Zero Dark Thirty\" decided to focus on what justifies the US world war\nagainst \"terrorism\".<br><br>Brain washing and trying to plant that Islam hate in order to get\nsupport in more world terror.<br><br>Nevertheless, never is the focus on how BinLadin was generation of US\nintelligence. This might be surprising for many, however look into it\nyour self and approach with a holistic mindset. Thanks for reading!\n"
"\nIm not sure what is worse - the film - which is really really boring or\nthe the portrayal of the CIA - as a bunch of complete amateurs. For\nexample when they have a possible source come to see them in a CIA\ncompound in Afghanistan - they let the car drive through the security\ngates without checking it - turns out it was a suicide bomber and 7 CIA\nagents are killed. Amazing really. They should have made me head of CIA\noperations - I'm sure I or just about anybody else with half a brain\ncould have done better. If the US really had a college girl leading the\nhunt for Bin Laden - no wonder it took them so long to find him. God\nHelp the US if that is what the real CIA is like. The film is just so\nBoring it hurts. Want to see a great film dealing with terrorist\ninterrogation then see \"Unthinkable\".<br><br>Also IMDb - why the .... can't I use caps - its not shouting as you\nclaim its highlighting.

"\nKathryn Bigelow's direction for this film missed out on an Oscar\nnomination and I can just about see why. I much preferred Ben Affleck's\nintricately filmed Argo or more appropriately Paul Greengras' thrilling\nGreen Zone. That is not to say her direction is lacking here, it is\ninteresting and unique and more importantly does not dwell on one\naspect, particularly in scenes following troops in action.<br><br>Jessica Chastain leads the acting performances alongside a brilliant\nJason Clarke. There are also very enjoyable cameos from Stephen Dillane\nand James Gandolfini. Overall the support cast is of the highest order,\nand for me both Mark Strong and Kyle Chandler play traditionally\nawkward, dull government roles very artistically indeed.<br><br>Highly thrilling, intelligent and at times emotional, Zero Dark Thirty\nconfirms film's very healthy engagement with post 9/11 related war\nmaterial.\n"
"\nAt the top of the film it makes a false claim for truth. What we get is\na well constructed but highly clichéd account of one maverick woman\nagainst the might of the establishment CIA to bring down Osama Bin\nLaden(OBL). (in other words a Fiction)<br><br>It's amazing how a simply linear narrative can mislead. THe film is a\npoor attempt to make a positive case for torture. All those tortured\nled inevitably to the capture of OBL, with one exception: a man planted\nby Al Queda to mislead and blow up CIA (in a CIA base): not only\nridiculous in itself, but simply another devise to paint the CIA as\nvictims as they torture a string of people to Victory: the summary\nmurder of OBL without a legal trial.<br><br>What does it not bother to mention? The 100,000 killed and millions\ndisplaced by the US invasion of Iraq, in the same period. And the\nthousand or so unconnected persons that were also tortured for no\nreason or illegally incarcerated without justification or due legal\nprocess.\n"
"\nOK. It's not her, The actress has to do what the script has for her.\nBut .. Is she representing the intelligence of America? Is she\nrepresenting the cry and rage of all the people who wanted OBL dead? Is\nshe also representing the supposed American feelings: sensitive,\ndisturbed by human pain, but cold and disrespectful every time?<br><br>OK. It's not the woman, it's the character, the director, the script.\nPoorly made, and poorly deployed. So, OBL was there because of a hunch,\nbecause she believes so.... It makes me remember the awful scientist\ngirl from Prometheus: she did not have real proof of anything, she\n\"chooses to believe\" (Matrix ?). I can accept as always that in intel\nwork, the odds and calculus and luck come in handy, but things never\nwork if she frowns and uses hard language in front of the CIA big boss\nto make her presence notorious... that scene made me sick: so, in order\nto impress the big boss you have to break respect and protocol? So, we\nhave to sing: girl, you are rude, you have balls,... the job is\nyours...We believe in you. .... duh.\n"
"\nThis movie is sold as a \"true story\" to the ignorant masses. it is\nanything but, it is simply pure fantasy designed to sexualise torture\nand make a case as to why torture should be legal. It is a movie\nentirely funded by the military industrial complex who, no doubt, have\nused hundreds of shills to give this movie a far higher rating than it\ndeserves.<br><br>Osama was NOT found thanks to intelligence gained from torture, this is\na complete fabrication designed to brainwash you into thinking how the\nmilitary industrial complex would like you to think.<br><br>Its makers should be charged like the pro Nazi propagandists were after\nthe second world war.\n"
"\nThis is what happens when you encourage bad effort. The team of Bigelow\nand Boal was showered with praise for the horrible \"The Hurt Locker.\"\nNow the inept team is back with an effort that's equally bad if not\nworse. Told in a documentary style, this is basically the story of\ninvestigative journalism, which can be riveting if done right, as in\n\"All the President's Men.\" Boal's script, however, is so excruciatingly\nboring that this one is painful to sit through. Bigelow does not help\nmatters with her drab direction. The film is nothing more than a series\nof meetings, interviews, and torture scenes. Even the finale, where the\nforce makes its way through Bin Laden's compound, fails to be\ncompelling.\n"
"\nI have not seen a worse movie in a long time. This is a unique\ncombination of boredom as it is 2 and half hours long, with poor pace\nand cut. Bad movie-making, full of clichés and bad rip-offs, there is\nnot a single good actor to find in the whole long film, and I mean\nreally not a single one. The leading lady is absolutely unable to play\nand the lesser roles are packed with second grade TV series actors who\nlook laughable in a \"serious\" movie. But what disturbed me most was the\nlack of any taste, morality or at least an opinion. The first part of\nthe movie is packed with pretty graphical examples of torture by CIA\nand US Army, mostly on kidnapped people in black prison sites all\naround the world. In the movie it goes without even mentioning if this\nis OK, legal, or even productive as the suspects even in this movie\ntend to lie even more under duress. So the question that remained\nunanswered for me after seeing this movie is: in what sense is the US\nactually \"better\" than Al-Kaida when they are both using the same\nmethods to \"win a war\"?\n"
"\nI ignored this film when it came out because the hype seemed artificial\nbut watched it just now (2017)<br><br>Was it part of a US government program to justify the insane techniques\nthat were used by the CIA and other agencies to (unsuccessfully) find\nOsama Bin Laden?<br><br>Now we know how he was really found this film stands as one of the\nworst pieces of sadistic totalitarian propaganda ever produced.<br><br>It's also boring, pointless and jingoistic, you might as well skip the\nfirst 90 minutes because it doesn't make any difference.<br><br>...hang on....it was nominated for \"Best Picture\"?<br><br>I guess 2012 was a bad year for film.\n"
"\ni thing tis movies is just to show us that osama bin laden had been\nkilled but in reality he is not killed and he was supposed to be the\nCIA agent and made by America and they just captured him as they do not\nwant to kill him as he must be the alone to have a large information\nand and had become the serious threat for the us government and this\nall has been done with the help of rothschild i.e. all on the script of\nthe rothschild not by the us government as they want all the banks to\nbe work under the rothschild and now only 3 countries have been left\nand they are north Korea,cuba and Iran .US also have started to get\nthem under the rothschild central bank\n"
"\nOne of my relatives raved on about Zero Dark Thirty so I thought it\nwould be a 9/11 movie worth watching.

Okay, the movie had a decade to cover before the\nassassination of bin Laden in Pakistan (near a West Point-type military\nbase believe it or not), but maybe the movie needed Jason Bourne or\nBrad Cooper to move things along to the denouement.<br><br>One thing Zero Dark Thirty glossed over was the bigotry and prejudice\nunleashed after 9/11...the racial/religious profiling at airports for\none thing, flight attendants getting all edgy and alert just because\nthey see a passenger (who looks different if you know what I mean)\nreading a book about Syria. Unfortunately it continues to this day, the\nIndian Ambassador to the USA being given special screening treatment by\nthe geniuses the TSA employ to keep our airports \"safe\".\n"

"\nKathryn Bigelow is certainly one of the most meticulous filmmakers in\nhistory ... and she does not take sides, but leaves judgment to the\nviewer ... this movies depicts that the CIA and Al Khaida in essence\nshare exactly the same moral values - that is to say none at all\nJessica Chastain is absolutely superb as the truly despicable fanatic\nCIA Agent desperate for success ... I find violence against women lower\nthan low, but this Maya could actually make me change my mind ... the\nrest of the cast is on par as well .... the movie has some flaws as to\nthe accuracy of the country settings, but all in all is certainly very\nrecommendable\n"
"\nI read that the original script was written about the decade long\nsearch and failed manhunt of Osama Bin Laden but was completely re-\nwritten months before filming began once American forces had found and\nkilled him. In hindsight, this is really lucky because I felt the film\nreally picked up pace once the Pakistan fortress was introduced and\nespecially during the half hour long night raid. Jessica Chastain gives\nanother great performance as the strong and smart CIA operative who's\nten year work was the backbone of finally hunting down the worlds most\nwanted man. Other roles are played well enough but it really rests on\nChastain's shoulders. The movie was released at the perfect time\nfollowing the true events that took place. I'm glad that they didn't\nrelease this a year earlier or I feel it would have felt unfinished ala\nZodiac.\n"
"\nJust saw the DVD again tonight after a year. Remarkably well-made and\nfrom what I've read, surprisingly close to the truth, unlike anything\nmade by, say, Oliver Stone.<br><br>The critics seem to be of two camps. One just thinks the USA is evil\nand therefore dumps on this successful campaign.<br><br>The others seem to think the characters \"need more development,\" as\nthough this would have been better had they left out some of the dust\nand added a romantic liaison and the flash of a boob or two. Better\nyet, a lesbian situation! Wow! Wouldn't that have been cool!<br><br>In other words, many critics wanted a Hollywood movie with Hollywood\nsensibilities and Hollywood politics. I am profoundly glad this movie\nescaped that treatment. If you want a Hollywood movie that got the\nofficial White House imprimatur (complete with Obama in a voice-over at\nthe end!), there's another movie for that. Lots of inaccuracies in that\none, but with some folks that's okay as long as it preaches the proper\nmessage.\n"
"\nI see many people outside of the USA, giving the movie low marks. From\nthe reasons most give they are not rating the film, just their\nattitudes about the subject matter. This film was about the long\nintense search for Bin Laden, the frustration in finding him and then\nfinally the mission to get him. To portray it any other way would of\nbeen Hollywood nonsense. <br><br>The actors all gave intense portrayals of their characters, especially\nJessica. Her character represented the long emotional endurance of the\nentire undertaking. It was well filmed,,well acted, and well directed.\nWas well deserving of Oscar considerations.\n"
"\nOne of 4 movies, when I saw it I wanted to kill all Americans. The\nworst thing that most of all stuff was true. In real life it was worse\nthan in movie. I just think they allowed whemselves way too much. I\ndonate anybody who show them that they are not centre of the world. You\ncan't say anybody - live like that, live like that. If people in east\nwant to live different so OK. And not Bin Laden started the war.\nAmerica all the time was dictating the rules for Pakistan, afganistan.\nBin laden just strong leader who sayed ''NO'' and he have my respect.\nOne person who said ''NO'' for all U.S.A. after that U.S started\ninvasion, killing everybody bla bla bla and so on. But for me winner is\nBin Laden. Need more strong persons like him.\n"
"\nI think the movie has a very good composition. It starts with 7/11 and\nends 10 years later where Osama bin-laden gets killed. I like how they\nshowed us everything in the movie, every way they tortured the\nterrorists, and how they used their technology to catch all the high\nranks Al Qaeda members. Its a very good movie, that has a good acting,\ninstead of just making a documentary. Its very exciting, because of its\ncomposition, and how they act exactly like how it happened in real\nlife. The movie makes you feel all kind of angry feelings and sad\nfeelings, because its a very good acting. If you didn't know anything\nabout Al Qaeda and terrorism, this would have been just like a very\nexciting movie, thats how i like it. You get a lot of knowledge, and\nyou actually like to watch this movie.\n"
"\nThe Zero Dark Thirty is a good movie, because it sets everything in a\ndifferent kind of view. The movie definitely raise a lot of ethical\nquestions, like, is it okay that CIA torture terrorists or friends of\nterrorists to get information out of them? Maybe even information\nthat's not really relevant when they first figure them out. It make us\nsee the terrorists view of the whole thing and instead of a sad movie\nlike movies about the twin towers, it's a harsh movie that take it in\nthe roots. We've given the movie 9 out of 10 stars, because it's a\ngreat movie and make you think of a lot of different things and force\nyou to actually have an opinion.\n"
"\nWhen this movie released, there was so much hype about it and all\nthat..Then with all the nominations for the Oscars made me really wanna\nwatch this and when I finally got around to watch, I was disappointed.\nThe acting was so artificial at times... the scenes that were meant to\nget your heart pumping faster were not doing there jobs... I was just\ngoing through the motions.. some scenes were so clichéd.. the dialogues\nso banal and trite. Overall, I felt that it was a let down. I don't\nknow if it was the hype or over expectations...But this movie was a let\ndown in every way, I went in expecting to see a fast paced thriller\nabout one the greatest events of our generation and came out\ndisappointed.\n"
"\nIt is amazingly well done. But it is not entertaining and not\nparticularly gripping because we already know the ending. There is\nalmost Zero Human Element in this movie and without that, I am not\ninterested. I think the movie that comes closest to this in concept is\nBridge on the River Kwai. Now that was involving and entertaining.\nBigelow? Who cares, it's all technical. I wasn't really bored but I was\nlooking at my watch a lot. Does Jessica Chastain really have much to do\nas an actor here? It must be great to get in an important movie but\nthere is really little character to establish. The hype for this one is\nover, but if anyone ever asks me in the future if I would recommend it?\nNot on your life.\n"
"\none would expect to see on the Discovery or History channel. I just\ndidn't think this story made a great movie, it seemed more appropriate\nfor cable TV. The film tells the story of a made up character, Maya,\nwhom guesses right on intelligence as to the location of Osama Bin\nLadan. Problem is we know how it ends; so the ending with the special\narms forces leading a raid at night was not suspenseful. There was\nnothing to hold your attention since you already know what they found\nin the compound. Then you have the made up ending of Maya looking over\nthe body and then getting to go home, just cheesy.<br><br>And I don't see why Jessica Chastain got such recognition for the role.\nI didn't think her character was anything special and neither was her\nacting.<br><br>FINAL VERDICT: Nothing special about this. Should have premiered on the\nhistory channel.\n"
"\nI was really looking forward to this movie after seeing the previews\nand reading some of the nominations it was receiving. However, the\nmovie itself was dull for the first 3/4 of the film. The story revolved\naround a single person working on finding OBL which made it very\nboring. It's funny because I've also seen the movie \"Seal Team Six: The\nRaid on Osama Bin Laden\" which is a lower budget film than this one yet\nhad much more explanation as to how they found Osama and how they knew\nit was him. Not to mention, a better side story and more action.\nDespite being the bigger box office film, I would suggest watching the\nSeal Team Six film over this one anyday.\n"
"\nI'm very surprised by all the horrible reviews (1 star?!), as I thought\nit was well made, interesting and entertaining. It's certainly no Hurt\nLocker, but it's far from bad in my opinion. One of the few things that\nreally bugged me were the horrible American accents. I kept trying to\nfigure out whether the character of Dan was supposed to be from the US\nor not. Seemed weird for him not to be, but he sure didn't sound like\nhe was. And the National Security head (Stephen Dillane) didn't even\ntry to sound American. Can someone in that post be British?! A\nstrangely big and distracting detail for Bigelow to miss. But I thought\nall else was good to very good, especially Chastain.\n"
"\nNo disrespect to the 'actual' participants in the real story, but I\nfound it hard to believe that, at the end of the film, the same amount\nof Navy Seals---unshaven &amp; long haired(?), that were in two helicopters\nwere picked up, (with much 'contraband,' AND a body) by one helicopter;\nin addition, was 'Maya' really 'returned' to the US by an Air Force C5\nGalaxy ALONE? Lastly, was the 'f bomb' really needed as much as it was\nused? Let's remember; 'poetic license' has its limits! Lastly, the\nextreme darkness-no pun intended-made it very hard to view the\n'invasion' of the Bin Laden compound. I think the lighting director\ncould have done better so the viewer would be able to comprehend the\naction. I think the 'Hurt Locker' was a much better film\n"
"\nA typical Hollywood film. In the first 20 minutes of the film you will\nsee an American dude who tortures a detainee. Yes only torture for 20\nminutes. I watched 37 minutes of this film, and I am happy to stop it\nnow. <br><br>A stereotypical Hollywood film. In the first 20 minutes of the film you\nwill see an American dude who tortures a detainee. Yes only torture for\n20 minutes. I watched 37 minutes of this film, and I am happy to stop\nit now.<br><br>A stereotypical Hollywood film.

"\nThis is an extremely well crafted film that manages to take events that\nmoved very slowly and present them in a way that never feels slow. The\nperformances are solid (though not spectacular). The way KB builds the\ntension is nothing short of amazing. One of the best action/thrillers I\nhave ever seen.<br><br>I get that some reviewers may not like the politics as they are\npresented, especially the somewhat derisive attitude the operatives\nhave towards the new administration and the new \"rules\" they feel\ninterferes with their mission. However, none of that detracts from the\nreally beautiful job KB does in the film. I'm tempted to give it 9\nstars, but I'll stick with 8 just because 9 or 10 should be reserved\nfor very very few films.\n"
"\nThe first hour is excessively heavy because the viewer is swamped by a\nmass of informations, not frankly interesting, such as names or events\nhard to put in order and organize logically.<br><br>In fact, the movie really \"starts\" when the team begins to track Abu\nAhmed, about an 1h15 in. And still, it is far from an unbearable\ntension of a good thriller. Even the 30 minute final assault,\nsupposedly the climax of the movie, turns out to be a bit\ndisappointing, the outcome being known by everyone.<br><br>It is hard then to get enthusiastic about such an uneven and overlong\nmovie. The script is weak because of a plot that is too linear, and\nrather shallow and bland characters. One could also question the level\nof faithfulness of the story to reality, some twists seeming a little\neasy.<br><br>After a rather enjoyable Hurt Locker, Bigelow missed the target with\nthis Zero Dark Thirty, which will ultimately be soon forgotten.\n"
"\nFor non-Americans, this is one brain washing movie. really, really\npoor. and amount of the violence, way the characters are build is\nupsetting. And, about their propaganda that there's a question at the\nend of movie, or that there's a story that covers both sides, well,\nthere isn't. American propaganda movie. Just like Argo... I mean, I\ndon't understand how these Americans works. They introduce the all\nthing as it is, as it should be introduced, but then at the end of\nmovie, you end up wondering: OK, whose crazy here? They came to this\ncountries, invaded them, stole their resources and stuff, and then act\nlike what the hell is going on? why these people hate us, attack us\netc. And I say, these is one of that kind of movies. and I'm very\nfrustrated that I watched this movie. this is all politics, and it is\nlame.\n"
"\nThe film is very intense. I had high hopes for this film as it fits my\npreferred genre. The film reminds me of a murder mystery rather than a\nman-hunt and isn't right for you if you are looking for an action\npacked war film. Towards the end when the investigation comes together,\nyou heart begins to pump with the characters as they approach the\ncompound.<br><br>I found parts of the film quite disturbing when the characters are\ninterrogating suspected members of al-qaeda, however towards the end,\nyou begin to realised that the interrogation just adds to the effect\nand makes the man-hunt far more intense.<br><br>I would recommend this film to people, however don't be expecting a\naction packed thriller unless you start watching from about three\nquarters of the way in.\n"
"\n. . . to be falling by the wayside, after all the ruckus in the press\nabout the so-called torture scenes. I saw a movie a couple of years ago\nwith Samuel L. Jackson or Laurence Fishburne, in which they pretend to\nbe a terrorist torturer, but actually are in this CIA sound stage in\nNew Jersey. They cut off at least four fingers from this terrorist\nsympathizer before whacking him. To get Bin Laden, you would think that\njust four fingers would a child's play compared to what the detainees\nactually would be willing to give up before they spilled the beans. But\nin ZERO DARK THIRTY, all the HELP lady needs to do is have one of her\nbuddies pour a little water into this guy's mouth, and he's blabbing\naway like a brook! Golly, this is a desert, for crying out loud! Guys\nwould be saying \"thank you\" for a little extra water in real life. So\njust what was all the hullabaloo about? If evil folks are going to go\naround blowing up skyscrapers and jets full of people, they should feel\nthey're getting off easy if the price of being captured is anything\nless than four fingers!\n"
"\nThis was an interesting film! Let's face it, we've all lived through\nthe decade this film depicts! It pulled no punches. Let's face it, it\nshowed the supposed good guys torturing people! Yet the people they\nwere torturing were the scum of the Earth and would want to kill every\none of us! I'd want to beat up some of those torture victims myself and\nI'm generally not a violent person. <br><br>I have no idea how accurate it was in depicting Pakistani life and if\nit was off-base then I'm sorry for the Pakistani guy who commented\nearlier. <br><br>This film is gritty and it is ugly. Yes there were some moral issues it\ndidn't touch on. Speaking as a Westerner there are some ugly actions of\nmy government that I refuse to take responsibility for. By and large\nthough, I am prepared to believe most of what was in this film! I\nwasn't always that impressed with Maya but I tried not to see it as a\ncharacter piece. <br><br>This film isn't a classic but it is worth watching!\n"
"\nAfter hearing the Oscar nominations I thought to myself, at last, some\ndecent films have been nominated for a change. I loved Silver Linings\nand Beasts of the Southern Wild. I was really excited to see this film\ntoo. <br><br>Then I watched it, and wow, I must say, this is up there with one of\nthe most boring, poorly acted films I've ever seen. There's no depth to\nany of the characters, the script is weak with more holes than a tea\nbag, it might as well been an episode of Scooby Doo!!<br><br>It's so bad I can't even be bothered to write a proper review.<br><br>I loved the Hurt Locker but this film is just lazy on so many levels.\nIncluding the Oscar nomination, this film only got one because of the\nsubject matter<br><br>This had the potential to be a superb film full of intrigue and\nsuspense, instead we got Scrappy Doo goes to Pakistan.<br><br>Avoid at all costs.\n"
"\n... the film itself was so boring to me. And the people in it always do\nso evil things. And they still do. People are getting Nobel price, just\nfor killing innocent people. Rage is always wrong and so, is this film.\nWhat do You think, a good movie makes? Say is was all alike. And what\nis cool? Just to say it is all because of a good reason. It is so sad.\nI do not understand why this film has such a positive feedback in the\nUS. Without a judge, they are killing men. There is nothing OK about\nit. ... it is like a documentation, that makes it even worse. So for\nme, as a German guy. I hate what I have seen in this film. And I hate\nwhat I hear at the radio and on the TV. At this time, Americans are\nflying over foreign country's and killing people the do not even know.\nThe are killing children and other people which are not in warfare.\nwhat is it?\n"
"\nIn this era where Hollywood is considered to be the penultimate\nplatform for making a movie that is considered to be a subtle and\nprofound art, the film WAAR has astounded me to a great extent. I'm a\nbig fan of Hollywood movies, but when a below average movie like Zero\nDark thirty gets critically acclaimed all over the world,gets an Oscar\nand on the contrary top 1k voters vote WAAR an average of 2.4, it\nliterally confuses me! WAAR depicts the most enduring problem of that\ncountry: Terrorism. Script is immaculately written, fighting mechanics\nand physics are impressive and the acting is astoundingly very good\nthat puts the viewer into the very heart of the plot. WAAR should\ndeserve much more than an applaud! I would recommend everyone to watch\nthis movie with an unbiased opinion. Way to go Pakistani Cinema!\n"
"\nI'll give this 2/10, for according to others, the film was fairly well\nmade. But it's balony. There's absolutely ZERO proof that Osama/Usamah\nbin Laden was even alive in 2011, much less killed by US forces that\nyear. There's also ZERO proof that he had anything to do with the\nattacks of 9/11 and some Washington people even say that he was\ninvolved with the 1993 WTC bombing, which he had nothing to do with,\nthough the FBI most certainly did and even the NYT reported this. This\nfilm clearly has been intended to give a boost to propaganda;\npropaganda of deception/deceit. It's only suitable for the fan boys and\ngirls who like to believe and/or promote lies about the real world.\nHave your feast, dining on a bed of lies.\n"
"\nIt's one thing to be conservative revisionist/apologist propaganda...\n(which this most certainly is) but it's another to be a BAD movie.<br><br>I could hardly believe that this was from the same director that\nbrought us Hurt Locker. To call the directing of Ms. Chastain\n\"ham-fisted\" would be a compliment. No subtleties here.<br><br>We are hammered over the head with the \"Maya against the world\" message\nso frequently, you'd expect the movie to be subtitled \"Zero Dark\nThirty: How Girl Power Saved the World.\" <br><br>Oh, and did I mention that there's no tension? Except for the 30\nminutes of torture porn that opens the film and the compound raid at\nthe end (which I'm sure most of the movie-going public sat through the\nmovie for) the action is a badly done procedural featuring Maya's\nrepeated bumping against the CIA's glass ceiling.<br><br>The tears she sheds in the closing shot might well be for her empty\nlife or they could be in relief at finally achieving her myopic goal.\nBut my bet is that the actress' true motivation was that this nightmare\nof a movie was finally over.\n"
"\nOnly recently watched this DVD as I never got around to seeing it at\nthe cinema. There was anticipation following the reviews and Oscars,\nplus it was the next film following the brilliant Hurt Locker.<br><br>So I have to say, that I am glad I didn't go the cinema. It is very\nmuch a disappointing movie which doesn't deserve the hype and certainty\ndoesn't stand alongside the directors other movies. The subject matter\nI have always found interesting and it should have made for a good\nmovie, but it is disjointed, jumping from year to year, and your never\nfeel or bond with the characters. I personally couldn't stand Jessica\nChastain's character and this is despite it being abundantally obvious\nthat you should because of the politics and time passing whilst\nawaiting a decision. More character development would have aided this\nmovie no doubt. The best thing about this is the wonderful score by\nAlexandre Desplat, which is suitably haunting, enduring and tense. Just\nlike the movie should have been.\n"
"\nSorry, but this is a documentary. <br><br>Not a movie. I am tired of movies like Argo, Cyriana, Hurt Locker etc.<br><br>And poor acting. And the whole compound scene was boring and too long.<br><br>And for a movie, the clue to finding the courier was too lame. Maybe in\nreal life, they took a chance and got it right. But for a movie, it\nsucked. Needed more juice.<br><br>I could have been watching the History channel or 60 minutes instead.<br><br>The background score was OK ( although it seemed close to an Indian\nmovie score from the 80s ).<br><br>Photography was OK.<br><br>The initial interrogation scenes were good.<br><br>I just couldn't believe the whole \"motherfucker\" scene as well. So\nfinally Bigelow realized - I am making a movie and not a documentary.\n"
"\nZero Dark Thirty is a film with no real substance. As almost everyone\nknows what the outcome will be, it being the biggest news story in many\nyears, some attempt could have been made to address the issues\nsurrounding what may well be a very important moment in history. Such\nas why Muslim terrorists are willing to go to such extreme lengths to\nattack western targets and why America would go to such lengths to get\none man. More importantly it was a very lopsided, one dimensional view\nof what is a very complex story. The unsubtle insinuation that torture,\nespecially water- boarding, helped capture Bin Laden and is therefore\nacceptable is disgusting. Over and above all this there is still the\nburning question of whether a nation that promulgates liberty and\njustice served these ideals in any way by shooting a man, essentially\nin cold blood and dumping his body at sea, instead of bringing him to\ntrial. Plus the fact that the the film gives the impression that Maya,\nthe lead character, was the only person really after Bin Laden makes it\na dreadful movie.\n"
