david finchers adaptation of the stieg larsson novel is an embarrassment
fincher manages to reveal all the wrong details at all the wrong moments effectively destroying any mystery or suspense to the story of the missing girl
which despite being the center of the book is merely glossed over and instead we get unnecessarily graphic rapesex scenes and a jumbled storyline
nearly the entire cast give subpar performances particularly the main character
mara rooney couldnt be less believable as salander
it was garbage
i cant believe this unoriginal piece of trash managed to get nominated for multiple oscars
what a shame
i was thrilled when i heard that this wonderful book translated from the original swedish would be made into a movie
my husband and i both were fans from the get go
i expected some omissions and can forgive the omission of blomkvists affair with cecilia but cannot forgive the change in the end of the story
another hollywood thinks they are better than the author fiasco
why oh why does this happen to all great books
why do they have to dumb it down
of course they will make another and another
how will they screw with the next two
one can only imagine
i do however recommend you see it
make sure you wear a sweater it is cold throughout most of the movie and it is winter you know
watching finchers remake was so much like deja vu that i wondered if the director had simply employed cgi artists to superimpose american and english faces over swedish ones
i also wondered how hollywood gets away with this level of grotesque artistic plagiarism
niels arden oplov must surely be outraged because this is more his film than finchers
this is a remake with absolutely no creative effort put inexcept for those appallingly unnecessary and unconvincing fauxswedish accents
why even bother
all i can think is fincher was under contract to make his film identical to oplovs but using english language
i was excited to see finches version of this fine movie
i was extremely disappointed after watching it
the acting was good
but i must say the script treatment was not as sophisticated as the original
it seemed not as smooth as the original and a bit forced in some places to get the story to flow faster
it suffers from the same sickness as most hollywood remakes of already good movies
the sacrifice details in favor of shock but such is the stuff of mcmovieland
everything about the movie was acceptable and on par with the original except for the script treatment
you remember let the right one in
hollywood remade that one too and to me it sucked compared to the original
both remakes lack the ability to emotionally connect me to the characters and their goals
a bit clinically and technically treated as though someone was in a big hurry to capitalize on the tattoo series success
shame on hollywood
if you are going to watch the girl with the dragon tattoo film watch the swedish version that came out in 2009
the swedish version is much better with a good plot development and character development
if you go for the u
s
version expect to be bombarded by cocacola and mcdonald product placement
its pathetic that u
s
audiences have to endure all this advertising
the u
s
version also seemed to add all the very violent and sexuallyexploitive scene without developing the plot
the swedish version has better suspense
also the u
s
version did a horrible job of developing the story of harriet
in the end i cant believe i paid money to see this movie again as the u
s
version was truly of lesser quality than the swedish version
also the u
s
version was a bit less gory and sexually explicit
i have read the book and was really looking forward to seeing the film
i was pondering between choosing the american or swedish version
in the end i opted for the american
i have quite liked the book unfortunately the same cannot be said about the film
the first thing which really annoyed me was the fake swedish accent
it was horrible and it made me switch on the subtitles
i know that it is impossible to have in the film everything that was in the book however some very important things were left out
as a result mikael amp lisbeth look rather shallow
they are there they do things but the viewers do not really know why
actually just like all the other characters
also some things were completely different from the book not just slightly and it did not help the film
i do not understand how this film got such good reviews
i just hope the swedish version is better
although now im not quite sure i want to watch it
the sound and music are without doubt the worst my wife and i have had to endure in any motion picture foreign or domestic
the so called suspense sounds are ridiculously ineffective
the noise so called music distract from the dialog making it impossible to hear in some instances
evidently actors no longer find it necessary to speak distinctly
surely they werent taught that in their training
it has become the norm to mumble and slur wordsparticularly when speaking softly
scenes with whispering are totally incoherent
a few years ago we attended the holiday concert of a 200  man chorus in boston
one of the pieces was totally pianissimo
you could understand every word
no excuse for lack of diction nor in the noise blotting out speech
the foreign  swedish version was infinitely better
the original men som hatar kvinnor movie was more suitable for the plot because the writer did write it in swedish not in english
from the beginning when the rumors of a english version of men som hatar kvinnor
i thought to myself is hollywood out of idea for a movie
why most they ruin a good book and a good movie
i know that i had to see this movie because i am such a huge fan of the original
the movie started by giving me a feeling like i was watching a james bond movie
all the characters places and things was in swedish of course that made the movie fake because they spoke english throughout the whole movie
this movie was a disappointment for me
i suggest that you buy or rent the swedish movie men som hatar kvinnor and watch it
i hope they dont make the second movie at all
the original version of the girl with the dragon tattoo 2009 was the best movie
noomi rapace was and still is the better actress
plus why is it that the american version of lisbeth salanderthe is so dirty and filthy
in the original film she was clean and nice
yes she had tattoos and a mohawk hair stile and body piercing but she was very clean and intelligent and nice
but the american version totally made her look like a slut prostitute
americans stereotyping people
even daniel craig should have declined this role he is not better than michael nyqvist actually michael nyqvist is better than he is
people go get the original 2009 version of the movie on dvd
that is the only one must see version
i watched the girl with the dragon tattoo last night for the first time and
well
what am i missing
long slow boring really
granted it was network tv so im guessing i watched a very edited version but still i cant see what all the fuss was about
daniel craig was his usual flat self missing what all the fuss is about him too but ill save that for another time
rooney mara did an ok job as lisbeth i suppose but i thought id be watching a much more seething angry dangerous character
disappointing is the only word i can think of to describe the film
now i have to admit i did not read the book yet but ive got it right here and did not see the original version yet
but i have to guess the cut scenes must have added a lot of impact to the movie because what i watched was a fairly bland not very interesting overly long disappointing effort
i am a big fan of david finchers movies but this onenot a winner for david fincher
roony mara  no match for nooami rapace
not to blame her as an actor but the way  the main character was portrait was disappointing
the make up and hair styling was to make fun of her
gothic look was incomplete
missed the black lipstick the eye brows could have been darker  should go with the hair color
she was too skinny not a strong personality as required for this character
if david fincher or any other director is planning to make the sequel he needs to bring a huge change in rooney maras elizebeth salanders get up
also the guardian  in the ve role was not up to the mark  that of his counter part in the original movie
hats off to daniel craige  he was flawless
you can redo something that was good and not so popular but this movie was a hit in 2009
i liked all the 3 parts
i hope hollywood doesnt waist time and money remaking the other two parts
the most important thing i can say is just see the original swedish movie
this one doesnt provide the same feeling as the original at all
everything down to the score for the film is off
they arent as clear when telling the story in this version either
rooney while learning the mannerisms and portraying lisbeth to the best of her abilities just simply doesnt have the right look at all
she looks like a soft small child playing dress up rather than a worn abused yet tough young woman that noomi rapace portrays so well
noomi has the sharp angular features that give her a tough serious look while rooney is softer and sweeter looking
i probably wont watch the other u
s
versions once they come out
the swedish version told the story right created the environment for the story and provided the feeling that made the movies so great
having seen the original trilogy this lame sunday school version is a joke
awkward acting poor storyline bad directing cutting and sound
quite honestly i could just go on and on
there was absolutely nothing i would rate highly in this tinseltown version of the true original
fake swedish accent speaking ugly and unsympathetic actors running around from a to b without any sense of continuation in the story line or script
if i hadnt seen the original first i would have been really confused
is the us audience really so different that they had to have their own disney version
i have seen dozens of european classics turned in to this kind of mush
after the story is squeezed through a one size fits all machine of the hollywood industry all the goodness and taste has been removed to leave bite size easy to digest goop with just a hint of added coloring and flavoring
first of all i much prefer the original movie version
almost everything about the original is better in my opinion
the actors the script the locations the soundtrack
the new hollywood version is typically more sexed up and thats a negative for me
the bigger hollywood budget was not apparent except of course for the higher priced actors
daniel craig was unconvincing and seemed to walk through the movie half asleep
some of his more dramatic scenes when he was shot and the basement scene he was a bit laughable in his acting
rooney mara was good
however the hollywood version downplayed lisbeths talents as a computer hacker and wiz which for me was a central theme of the story
i love love the original version
this one
i wish they had left well enough alone
a journalist teams up with a computer hacker to find a woman missing for 40 years
as larssons popular novel was made into a decent swedish film two years earlier was a hollywood remake really necessary
everything is overdone starting with the ridiculous opening credits
it is poorly paced and goes on much too long yet the plot is a bit murky at times
craig does better in the role of the journalist than nyqvist in the original film
as for the lisbeth the edge goes to rapace who wasnt particularly good in the original but mara is too robotic here
however lisbeth is such a onenote character that it would be difficult for any actress to make her anything more than a caricature
i doesnt make sense to make us version of the movie just 2 years after original was released
original was exceptional
this is a merely commercial corporate hollywood copy designed for mass entertainment and profit
the reason they did this remake is because most us viewers are too ignorant when it comes to nonus nonenglish movies and they are not capable of reading subtitles
they did similar thing with another great swedish movie called let the right one in
such an ignorant senseless and pointless attitude is a typical of multinational mainstream profitentertainment companies
i give it 3 stars as main characters performance was very well done
first the good news daniel craig is better as a swedish journalist than as james bond and christopher plummer is still an imposing character actor at age 82
now the bad news
having read and enjoyed the book and swedish movie i waited to see this film on payperview which is kind of good news considering ticket prices these days
unfortunately my familiarity with the story was of little help as i spent over two and a half hours scratching my head watching a complex mess that bore only a slight resemblance to the novel or foreign film
i felt sorry for anyone who had neither read the book nor seen the movie and sorrier for those who had
swedish names and towns with doubledigit letter length and difficult pronunciations only made following the dialog and story more difficult
i have not watched many foreign films with english subtitles so if you havent already read the book or seen the american film version i highly recommend the swedish movie
i am so glad i didnt see this garbage in the theaters
not only fincher has manage to change the important details and give away things he should not have he has completely changed the climax
he took away all the thrill and excitement from finding the realharriet vanger
who actually stays in australia
anita vanger is actually anita vanger
unbelievable
unless of course he plans to reveal it in the next film
otherwise this can be easily the worst fincher movie ever
unless you are die hard craig fan
there is no reason to watch this
so disappointed
the original is far more better
this is just well disguised and stylized trash
i wanted to like this movie i truly did but it just can not compare with the swedish film
everyone has their own opinion but to me this film was lacking and i could not stay focused as opposed to its swedish a counter part which i couldnt take my eyes off of
1st is rooney mara as lisbeth salander she gave an ok performance i believe that they were many other actress that could have done a better job
a noomi rapace the original lisbeth owned the role one of the most captivating performances i have ever seen
people say this version is closer to the book and in some aspects it is
but its a boring movie
im an american i love american cinema i dont mind read subtitles but id rather not have to
believe me when i say the swedish version has a better dialog a way better cast and is overall a much better story
im sorry for the fans of this film but there was truly no need to remake this story after the swedish people did an excellent job transform a book from their nation into film
two thumbs down for me
a movie can be made well cast amp photography and still not have a worthwhile story to tell
this is such a movie
if you enjoy brutal rape forced incest and a serial killer who tortures young women before he butchers them then you will like this movie
if instead you are in the apparently shrinking population of movie goers who wish to come out of a movie feeling better not worse about the human condition then you should avoid this movie like the plague
it has 3 not 1 not 2 separate unredeeming stories each more depressing than the one before it
what this movie is not is a mystery story
because of hollywoods inability to think beyond typecasting as soon as i saw the opening credits i knew who did it even before i learned what the crime was
if you want to see female nudity in movies i recommend porno films
at least the women in those appear to be having fun
this movie is for masochists who only enjoy inflicting pain on themselves or sadists who enjoy seeing pain inflicted on others
the swedish version was much more wellwritten orchestrated and directed
there was a sense of suspense emotion and realism to the movie that the fincher version simply lacks
lisbeths past is seldom explored and when it is its poorly placed in the movie
the emotional connection between mikael and lisbeth is forced at best and quite awkward at certain moments
there are so many interesting facets about lisbeths personality and character that couldve been explored a lot better and you simply dont leave the theatre with the same sense of wow that defined the swedish version
the more positive thing about finchers version though is rooney mara who played salander nicely
okay so all in all this is a good film unfortunately it not so good if you ave watched the original series of 3
for those of you who missed the original 3 films the girl with the dragon tattoo the girl who played with fire the girl who kicked the hornets nest this film is a good and edge of the seat whodunit
personally i think the original swedish films were better
they seemed more of an ongoing story and were less hollywood and more gritty
also the characters were better defined and more believable
but what the heck this is a movie worth watching and if you like it look for the other two swedish sequels
lets see if hollywood has the guts to do all 3
the only thing that made me go see this movie was to simply compare it with the swedish version
ok in term of special effects camera angles you know setup this movie is way better but then if you compare the thriller in this one with the original version i think that this version is way under
im not saying like ive seen here that you should definitely see this one because of daniel craigs acting or just give you the classic stereotype oldies but goldies regarding the swedish version
im just saying that if a movie is born in some culture nordic in this case you should at least let go of the american felling when you rate it
for me even the swedish accent makes it more mysterious and more thrilling than this one
but both are great and if youve seen it with daniel craig you should also try it with michael nyqvist
the original 2009 movie version of the book was gripping stylish and original
this version while adequate adds nothing to the original
hollywoods mania for remakes of everything notwithstanding it is difficult to see why this movie was remade at all
the film only differs from the original in that it offers a laughably cheesy intro filled with meaningless mtvstyle graphics and a ludicrous version of led zeppelins already overblown but great as it is immigrant song
the score by nine inch nails frontman trent reznor and partner atticus ross is better than average but this minor addition does not justify remaking a million dollar movie
please hollywood enough with the remakes of movies tv shows comic books and the like
i loved the story line
very interesting plot
but there were more than one vulgar rape scenes that were completely unnecessary
it could have eluded to the fact but instead showed lots of disgusting details
i am a fan of the director
i loved se7en and fight club is my all time favorite movie
i dont usually get offended when i see violence or sex but this was horrific
i hope no one brings a child or teen to see this
seriously the movie would be a 9 or 10 if they had skipped over the 10 minute scenes of torturing rape
daniel craig was awesome
the movie was long but i was very interested in his case he was working on lots to think about a who done it
i like mikael and lisbeth together i thought they worked well together
great film great remake
seriously both the swedish version and the american version were great and so were the books do not listen to any critics
i know good films and i know how seldom a good movie comes along among the usual garbage that is pumped out annually the story is refreshing the characters are intriguing and you end up wanting more
i believe this is a very capable franchise and since the books themselves were so great and well read it would be very easy to give us more into the world of these fascinating characters
you may need to pay close attention to understand it but it is without a doubt a classic one of the few that is put out during the yearly one hundred or so crap films
that being said to the writers and director please make more
thank you from a satisfied movie fan
the movie was simply annoying
i wanted to skip forward so badly but i didnt and now regret it
you people can talk your philosophical crap about how amazing were the actors sound or whatever youre talking about but it is what it is
the first 90 minutes are awful and boring as hell
the only interesting scenes were the rape the blowjob scene and the blackmailing one and i say interesting only cause actually something was happening the people on screen were moving and others even running
and for gods sake stop being fanboys
i dont care what book or comic this movie came from or if its a swedish or romanian remake trilogy or else
the fact of the matter is that this movie is boring
the only good thing was daniel craig and the acting and if you like a boringly annoying plot and good acting well
this movie is for you and you will enjoy it
ive waited 2 hours while watching this movie just to see a boring tv show twist at the end something like csi or else
i hope the sound editor never works again
for some reason dialogue was over driven by music
and it wasnt even good music
the first scene i struggled to figure out what they were saying
that should never happen but it happens at least three times
the acting was very good
rooney mara was an excellent lisbeth
just one problem noomi rapace was better
i feel bad comparing the two but when you remake a film you are going to have comparisons
if it wasnt for the sound i would give it a 10 just like the original
there were a few plot changes
im guessing that us audiences wouldnt get the jail time for libel
it happens in europe a lot more than the us
the ending was also different
dont know which i prefer
overall a good film
but see the original as well
as a huge fan of the books and original movie in 2009 i had high hopes for the newest addition and was in no way disappointed
the movie was in fact incredible with all the suspense and vast intelligence of the book and 2009 film this remake has easily made itself a contender for the best film of the year
the script was incredible location and shooting was beautiful and the cast was absolutely incredible
as a lover of daniel craig and stellan skarsgaard i expected great things and was not disappointed but both had to take a back seat for the lifetime performance by rooney mara
easily one of the best performances i have seen in a very long time you could see every part of her being and soul went into playing the amazing lisbeth salander noomi rapace should be proud that her amazing performance in 2009 has been carried on to the same excellence with this astounding remake
excessively long
could have been 60 minutes shorter and not lost much of the story
i liked the lighting and the costumesclothing were right on target
the acting performance of the girl with the dragon tattoo was good
however the development of her character and many other supporting roles were excessively overdeveloped
the carving was too much and added nothing as were the 4 or 5 interactions with the pig
the film was more focused setting an agenda then telling a a better story
the technology and budget were there as was a desire to include an excessive amount of purposefully pandering details that added nothing to the storyline but trying to appease small audience groups made the film too long and caused the final product to fall far short of the what it could have been
given his work on seven i expected more but will not be paying for this directors films anymore
this is my favorite movie made by my favorite director with the soundtrack made by my favorite musician starring the actress who most resembles lisbeth in my opinion with a better mikael than the first adaptation
but with a predictable martin you can realize that he is the villain even if you did not read the book
loved the movie
great cast and plot
never a dull moment
the lady was wonderful the way she handled the rapist was every womans fantasy
well worth watching especially with the rise of the trump scourge on america
i would recommend everyone that believes that the teachings of the old testament should be law
please see this movie and see the sick results
one of my biggest problems with this is when she scrawled i am a rapist on the perpetrator
its is nothing but a sharpie and extremely poorly done at that  does not not even resemble a tattoo it was a poor job at using a sharpie
i laughed out loud when i saw how poorly that was done
also for the dungeon at the end if everything needs a card to get into each door why is it then left open at the end
i did enjoy this movie but it has a lot of head scratching moments way to many to give it a better rating
i need more lines of text the movie is intriguing but the tattoo is so terribly done  its is some what disappointing sure the tattoo on rooney is fake but at least that is believable
hands down
even rumors popping up about replace the cast with a lower budget to make its way through box office im not worry anymore
this movie will stand at its own as one of the greatest and best crafted thrillers in recent memory and a masterpiece of storytelling and flow
david fincher was the ideal director to make this adaptation with a properly dark style and operatic quality
daniel craig may stand out in this role as his second best known aside 007
but rooney mara is the best stuff
shes priceless since the physical transformation to her own performance more aggressive more seductive deeper and with a better yet tragic closure
even the movie could expand its world from the source novel or close the chapter on its own as the finale shows
whatever it happens in the future this movie will be as rocksolid as hell
should surpass the 810 in this site with all my respect to the members of this community
if you havent watched it yet read this
ok i begrudgingly say this is a 7 purely because the story is good and so to be fair i cannot rate it poorly but
having watched the original which is great i felt really disappointed and empty because honestly the acting is just a hell of a lot better in the original its more raw gritty real  less hollywoodyamericany shallow action movie
it grates on me that they felt people couldnt just deal with the subtitles for the sake of it being so good  its even somewhat offensive even to the original movie when it was so good
if you are considering watching this  watch the original movies and then maybe skip the remake altogether as i kinda wish i had as now i also think of the poor job done on the remake instead of just thinking how great they were
i just dont know why they had daniel craig do it it wasnt a good fit at all and the rooney mara one really blank wasnt right at all no connection or something just wasnt right after seeing the original
i read the first book from the millennium saga recently and loved it thats the reason i decided to watch the movie
its okay but its not a brilliant adaptation i feel like david fincher could have done a much better work
it doesnt respect the chronological order of the book and misses really important information also the story seemed to wrap up too quickly
the fact that the end is completely different bothered me a lot
overall if you never read the book youll probably like it if you have dont bother watch the film
im going to give a try to the swedish version of the film and hope that it respects the book a little more
yes its a powerful movie and immensely long
however only in a prose work can you convey the mass of detail required by this complex story the magazine millennium the reasons for blomqvists fate his relationship with the married publisher his journey north his relationship with a tangled very wealthy family his investigation of its background and the fate of a teenagegirl member his discovery of satanism his relationship with lizbeth and so on
its a complex story told in hundreds of pages by its author with many hundreds more pages in the two followups before his death
the movie is a pale shadow with only a few brutal passages between lizbeth and her cruel social worker and blomqvist and the nazi
theres a couple of pretty explicit sex scenes between blomqvist and lizbeth and thats it
its a sketch of the novel even if it remains a powerful picture and worth seeing
first off the casting was perfect
i wasnt sure if daniel craig could make a believable and realistic transition from james bond to an average journalist
and the most impressive factor to this film was rooney mara who hasnt had a good deal of limelight other than playing erika albright in the social network also by david fincher
the movie was gritty realistic and very entertaining
with a plot that a mystery buff couldnt resist it captivates your attention and keeps your eyes on the screen throughout all the two and a half hours youre watching
all characters show their personal pros and cons in simple ways that only add to the depth of the story and all things related
to say it all in all the movie was tremendous and should win at least two of the oscars its been nominated for
its worth going out of your way to see because you wont be disappointed
i cant figure out why all the good reviews
the original was so satisfying i wonder why this version was made at all
does it take a lot of talent to copy another movie so exactly
another question i have is how daniel craig was picked to be the lead
my opinion of his talent is very low
his bland portrayal is maddening
i cant understand his popularity at all
it is hard to see the edgy relationship between lisbeth and him that was so important in the swedish film
daniel craig reminds me of the dull visaged channing tatum
i guess it all comes down to what makes a director copy another film
if he or she intends to bring a new interpretation to a movie from a book thats fine but if the director simply copies another film spending a few million in the process why bother
it is hard to believe that this copied film got oscar nominations
rooney mara nominated for an oscar copies noomi rapaces character step by step how can this deserve a nomination
the imdb rating for this is higher than the swedish version
what a travesty
i admire rooney maras very different portrayal but this film is otherwise a sad shade of the remarkable first installment of the swedish series
i pity the fool who thinks otherwise
plot elements resonant with meaning in the original are here passed over or utterly dissociated
ill not provide examples in this forum for fear of displaying too much information
viewers can decide for themselves
i see nothing in this movie but greed
people cant be bothered to read subtitles
i suppose with a film of this popularity we can look forward to versions in all major languages
if its released in latin i promise to go see it
is is right to rate a movie on a moral basis
fair to cry foul about a popular film promoting a lethal product
is there anything sadder than a once esteemed director whoring himself by sticking in a blatant product placement for a cigarette manufacturer
does mr
fincher have no selfrespect
for that matter does the film industry overall
remember in the bedroom which did the same thing and still received multiple academy award nominations
you can answer these questions for yourself but i just wished i had been forewarned before the people behind this film got some money out of me
if you want to see a film version of this book there is still the 2009 swedish production against which this new production is being compared
storyline completely predictable
was clear harriet is alive already after the task to explain her death was assigned
possible candidates one of the two already clear in the middle of the movie
junk movie about junk world where any man is sick
see 28 days later instead
unpredictable storyline instead and just a little hope for the mankind

the words of describing this movie is really hard to be found
its kind of controversial
its a smart story of a young woman expert in using computers who helped a journalist in his search of a missing woman for forty years
the movie has a lot of twists and turns
some scenes are very harsh
a lot of scenes reminds you of european cinematography but just remember that a swedish writer wrote the novel
the hair the make up the set decoration are just how they supposed to be to get the best outcome
daniel craig had the opportunity to give an amazing performance im not really sure that he succeeded in that your judge
although rooney mara gives a stunning performance my opinion she worth the oscar but she was competing meryl
i would definitely recommend this movie
the movie shows the reality as it is maybe with a little bit of exaggeration when it comes to the background story of the girl
cant wait to see the next movie
i never read the book and after hearing all the hype and seeing the overall bleak appearance of the trailer i was not interested in this movie
boy was i wrong
this is a thrilling detective story about a disgraced investigative reporter trying to solve a family mystery for a wealthy eccentric and his bizarre extended family
there are some squeamish parts involving the girl before she enters the investigation that could have been left out in my opinion but im sure others would say those events helped define the character
there were a number of welldeveloped red herrings to keep you guessing and actually two mysteries solved by the end neither of which were easy to figure out
i actually watched it twice over 3 days to pick up on more details and i find it worthy of repeated viewings
810
i am very satisfied at the end of this hard thriller
i like this kind of mystery movies where tricky puzzles must be solved
the landscapes of sweden were beautiful and created a good atmosphere
the performance of the detective work of daniel craig and his assistant rooney mara were very respectable
then another great plus for this film was the experience of director david fincher who delivered the other legendary thriller seven
what i didnt like therefore was the long running time of two hours and a half
as i mentioned in other earlier reviews the playtime must not exceed 2 hours
i think that a few scenes could have been cut here
but dont understand me wrong
the girl with the golden tattoo took me anyway on a real hell trip with lot of turns and twists
if you like this genre of movies you shouldnt miss the generals daughter with john travolta
final rate 710
i confess the movie was a disappointment
the book and the deepness of the characters is far superior
a book of course has far more potential when it comes to describe a large family over generations and their internal battles
the genealogy is important to understand the various relationships and i admit having had to go back to earlier passages to reposition the players
the book is magnificently constructed with far more content to the investigation and the development of lisbeths character
it also seems that the books intermediate end what did really happen to harriet did not please the director so he took a shortcut open for discussion
in conclusion people who did not read the book are likely to give the movie a higher rating
to them i strongly recommend to get the book and
enjoy it
this movie was beyond fantastic truly a well made film which lets face it may be hard to come by often these days
daniel craig who plays the main role does so in such a thrilling manner as well as rooney mara who had me convinced shed lost her marbles
from a cinematic point of view it was directed by one of the best thriller directors out there david fincher who redefined the gory twist completely with the 1995 film se7en
fincher made the audience compelled to watch to see what happens next
although a negative point would be that the film starts slowly and holds that pace for a while but if you stick with it you will no doubt be more than satisfied  because it does speed up
i can honestly say that this film is a mustsee but if blood amp gore violence  substance use andor graphic sex scenesnudity tend to bother you i would undoubtedly advise against this movie
if you feel you can take it you are in for the ride of a lifetime
i recommend this movie 110
ok i just saw this movie and it was really good
i think there are some very intense moments that made me very uncomfortable to watch
i think most people agree to that
if you read the books you know that its coming but still hard to watch it and not sure we needed to see as much as we did
but the acting was superb
i was also reading of rooneys transformation for the character all her piercing and stuff
that is very commendable that she went so far to embrace the character
im not an actor but i dont think i could go that far for one movie
impressive
i agree that it is very dialogue driven and there are a lot of moments that might have come across as slow moving
but the actors kept it so interesting i was not bored at all
they are both very talented actors
i would recommend it
but read the book first
although ive read all three of the books structurally theyre really 3 installments of one big honking novel i havent seen the swedish movies
forget about the books
forget about the other movies
on its own this adaptation does manage to capture the general tone and resonance of the novels and it does this with admirable brevity and tothebone editing
there is a bleakness in the novels that is nicely encapsulated by the exterior and interior backgrounds
snow
the sterility of martin vangers modern house on the hill
the cool patina of years on the old cottages walls furniture and stonework
the camera dwells on lizbeth salanders inexpressive face and you can almost hear her complex gears spinning away
the lighting director in this film is a genius  and so is the cinematographer  emotions are relayed in light and shadow so well and the camera angles nudge our tensions without being overt about it
its not perfect of course
no movie version of a wellplotted novel ever is
but it strives to do the story justice and manages to accomplish its task
this movie was great i have see the forgien verison and now rooney mara was perfect choice for the role lisbeth salander this movie was very well done and the storyline well done and now made me want read the rest of the book
this movie is not for children
they are some sexual things in beginning shows lisbeth salander gets rape is showing on screen and there are some very brutal violence scenes and the movie is overall disturbing but great is not for everyone and is not for kids under age 17 even at that age they might still be disturbing and shocking overall i say go see this movie great and really hope rooney mara wins at oscars and golden goble awards and the torture scene is disturbing
overall worth see at the theaters
loved the movie and i have read all three books and seen the swedish versions
as one reviewer already mentioned i wanted to clear something up this is not a remake but an adaptation of the book
people take away different thing from the book hence why the movies have slight differences
its fine to like one over the other but reasons shouldnt be its an american remake
both films took away different parts of the book which on both films can be disappointing
however the book is written so in depth that some cuts had to be made
people cannot compare or say how lisbeth is portrayed between the films without knowing her character in the book
side note i could have done without the beginning
a little too stylized for me
however the performances were brilliant
and the score was great
this movie makes me want to watch seven again
