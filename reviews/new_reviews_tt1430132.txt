are you kidding me
i mean seriously almost everything out of hollywood lately seems to fall prey to the same qualities as this movie
completely unbelievable unrealistic cgi overload cheesy and a horrible plot that absolutely insults the intelligence of its audience
if you are on drugs im sure you will like it because its obvious the writers wrote this garbage stoned
this is the first time i have ever written review for any movie on this site which should tell you how tired i am of seeing the same junkie pathetic movies of late
i dont know the gentlemen that reviewed this movie from la but i cant believe he gave this 10 stars
must have been paid handsomely
i wouldnt be surprised if this movie was written by the same writer as the lone ranger
blah
i cany start to explain how much disappointed i was after watching this movie
as many of the xmen fans i too like the wolverine the most
having said that and given how much exciting the trailer looked for this title the movie to me was a big let down
its slow moving not as much action packed as i hoped it would be
and plot to me made no sense
spoiler alert i dont know if i got it wrong but in the movie it has been portrayed that removing adamantium from wolverines body deprives him of his healing power
wtf
more so it has been depicted to give the grandpa hiswolverines healing powers
utter bullshit
wolverinelogan was known for his healing power and that was the reason striker chose him for injecting adamantium
did i miss something there
there wasnt a single scene in the movie that i wished i could watch again which is generally not true for a wolverine movie
cant believe how jackman agreed to do this movie
ive been a fair fan of the series of the whole
even the weaker installments i thoroughly enjoyed so my review is already weighed in favor of this film
i will say even from a critics point of view i thought it was really well done
its not the standard comic book fairy tale but more of an intrinsic study of the wolverine character
he shows a lot of depth and vulnerability in this outing far more than previous installments
its a risky but necessary move to see him operate on a balance challenge where he really is prone to death at any moment
the humor is matched well with the drama for an interesting viewing all the way through
all the supporting roles i found interesting as well
i really enjoyed the presence of yukio who provided invaluable aide despite wolverines incessant protests
i found it nice to see his character finally develop some closure after all the time weve get to see him in all his cinematic installments
this is a really good movie of wolverine here and definitely better then xmen origins wolverine
this movie contains wolverines own story and the main villain he has to fight is called the silver samurai
now the silver samurais main goal in this was to suck the healing factor out of wolverine and make him young again
the silver samurai in the end was defeated though and wolverine lived on
we also see charles xavier and magneto at the end of this and they warn him of the deep threat of all humans and mutants thats coming in the future and that they need his help in on it
very good movie here anyway and beats the crap out of xmen origins wolverine
this movie was excellent but in some parts i found myself craving more intense action even the fight between the silver samurai and wolverine seemed really long and boring except for when he cut off his claws
the twist in the end was surprising but a lot of people had predicted it far before the scene came
vipers presence in this movie was not only pointless but boring she couldve done more than just poison a couple of guys and walk away with a name like viper i expect a fast striking dangerous venomous character all we got was venomous
overall action junkies like me might not have enjoyed the lack of action but the movie itself is gold
this is a great movie
the first five x men movies are good this is better
this movie has a great story line
it also has great acting
it also has great special effects
x men day of further past is better
x men apocalypse is also better
but still this a great movie
see it
it is one of the best action movies from 2013
it is a must see
it has a lot of action
6
7 is a good ratting
but this is such a great movie that 6
7 is underrating it
i give it a 9
because it is a great movie
see this movie
it is a great movie
i do not no why any one would not like this movie
and if they do it is because they do not know a good action movie when they see it
im not sure why this movie has the same score as origins it was a much stronger movie imo
i didnt like iron samurai or the viper but somehow this movie worked even with weak antagonists
some character motives werent true to themselves but overall this movie was entertaining and a bit different from the rest of the superhero films
this is definitely underrated and what i call a slow burner
the worst of the bunch imo is origins x3 and apocalypse
days of future past was neither good or bad from what i remembered the worst offense lol
i really enjoyed x1 x2 first class logan the wolverine and deadpool
i am not sure if i should say that this movie is good or badit is a ok movie i am a huge fan of the xmen series and a diehard fan of wolverine i went in with a lot of expectations but i was almost disappointed there were a lot of plot holes and many parts in the movie just didnt make sense sometimes it makes you go like how dafaq did that happen but there is a solid cast and hugh jackmanss acting is topnotch the action sequences are actually a stand out and the ending is something which you wont expect some people would love to hate the climax the movie is pretty decent though i felt it has a week storyline the aftercredit scene makes you jump up the seat and wanting to wait for a sequel it isnt a bad movie i would just say to maintain your expectations this is just a movie you could watch once it ties off quickly than you could expect
if you thought xmen origins wolverine sucked prepare to be wrong cause the wolverine rocks
hugh jackman returns as logan and totally nails it i love the great sense of humor the cgi is amazing and the enemies dont need to be mutants every time you have yakuza ninjas viper and the silver samurai i also loved the little redhead chick she kicked a lot of butt
the cast did a good job and i think james mangold did a pretty cool job on directing the film he also directed sylvester stallone in copland another movie i absolutely loved
also the end credits scene picks up for the events of xmen days of future past and i also thought the soundtrack was amazing
also the wolverine picks up some years after xmen the last stand and its a sequel to xmen origins and by far my favorite xmen film
cant wait for wolverine 3
james mangold directed this sixth xmen entry though the second to focus primarily on wolverinehugh jackman which is set after the events of the last stand as wolverine now living a nomadic existence in the wilderness is located by a japanese woman who tells him that a now wealthy japanese man whose life he had saved in wwiiwhen the two atom bombs were dropped is now dying and wants to repay his life debt by offering him a chance to relinquish his immortality by transferring it to him through a new process
wolverine respectfully refuses but events spiral outofcontrol as someone wants the mans daughter and heir dead and also wants wolverines healing power which threatens his indestructibility
hugh jackman is more than capable of carrying this interesting picture alone with nice japan locations and story which will push him in a new direction andif you stay through the end credits into his next xmen adventure
it starts off exciting enough but by midway through it fizzes out and ends up just making a mess everywhere
jackman is great as wolverine and his dedication to the role is admirable
i would have liked to seen the story grounded a little more as the world this movie exists in is definitely not a real one
fight scenes are abundant and well done but a little too numerous and nonconsequential
plot annoyances arrive in the form of an unnecessary love interest and a giant ninja robot
also everyone in this film is a ninja because you know everyone from japan is
if you like ridiculous action and overly staged fight scenes then this will appeal
it feels like something a 15yr old would like and i suppose that is where the target audience would be
not a bad flick and worth the view if you are a fan of the wolverine
67 a refreshing change of pace and tone from all the other superhero movies that are relentlessly made these days that focuses as much attention on character as it does action
this is a well made leap forward over the last skip woods written wolverine picture with a lot more depth ideas and purpose with jackman fitting into the role perfectly as he always has from the beginning
the story is pretty simple yet there are complexities in there dealing with loss of loved ones and human mortality which is handled well in a movie that could have simply not bothered
overall a good solid superhero entry to go alongside the best of the bunch
hugh jackman is simply wolverine i have seen in 2 d its great story to follow on from the origins it has great character study of wolverine in his vulnerable state there is great action but doesnt distract you to much away from the story line its not distracting you just feel his pain frommissing jean grey and wanting to not be a hero of the hour i think he just want to be left alone but his past haunts him and he doesnt know how to get past it this i gave the film 7 out of 10 the film last 2hrs i doesnt fell long i think the director does a great job in keeping it all together roll on the next wolverine film the japan setting is great from a point of that it gets away from the usa theme great ninja warriors in the film
two is probably one star too many but thats for the effort hugh jackman put into a weak disjointed ludicrous plot
the camera work on the fight scenes were obviously an effort by the director to promote the efforts of a normal 3yearold
although either of my girls were better at that age than whomever they let do the filming
be nice if film makers would stop having their idiot camera men run down the street jump over objects and crawl over broken glass when they were filming action scenes
they totally suck
as for the plot everyone is trying to kill the girl wolverine decides to protect
however any one could have killed her at any time during the drug out unbelievable fights
which wolverine seems unable to win
good thing they didnt use xmen in the title
they would certainly be facing a lawsuit by every other respectable xman
the 2nd worst movie not far behind now you see me in 2013 directed by james mangold atrociously goes to the wolverine
this is a complete dud of a movie managing to be dull and full of american stereotypes of japanese and probably at its worst with cringeworthy acting from most involved save jackman
most of the fault goes to the directors and script writers
this movie is a failure on several levels
it starts out promising enough with a quick montage from wwii supposedly and then stateside but degenerates badly when the main story starts and the horrible dialog direction and acting that the japanese actors have to putin and up with
like pacific rim its more asiaphilia but without rims fun and spectacle
the action is mostly poor and weakly shot and realized
jackman obviously got pumped up again and the filmmakers overdo his shirtless scenes but i kept waiting for the movie to get more intense or infuse itself with energy but its pulseless
not even worth a rental sad to say unless your a diehard jackman fan
410
maybe i was expecting too much from the wolverine
like a plot a purpose
this was a film for the sake of a film with too many dodgy why
moments
opening scene was spectacular
and then nothing
awkward love scene was truly the lowest point of this movie
or was it the ironman type old guy
i think my 4 stars are more than generous
being a huge fan of the x men movies i knew to stick around after credits rolled
i cannot stress enough to you all to do so
the only saving grace for this sloppy crappy film
id give 10 stars to the two or so minutes of story teaser that followed
lets hope for a much bigger effort in plot and character development in the next one
logan the loner needs no more spin offs
ciao
ive been a fair fan of the series of the whole
even the weaker installments i thoroughly enjoyed so my review is already weighed in favor of this film
i will say even from a critics point of view i thought it was really well done
its not the standard comic book faire but more of an intrinsic study of the wolverine character
he shows a lot of depth and vulnerability in this outing far more than previous installments
its a risky but necessary move to see him operate on a balance challenge where he really is prone to death at any moment
the humor is matched well with the drama for an interesting viewing all the way through
all the supporting roles i found interesting as well
i really enjoyed the presence of yukio who provided invaluable aide despite wolverines incessant protests
i found it nice to see his character finally develop some closure after all the time weve get to see him in all his cinematic installments
possible spoilers included
i do not have the patience to outline all the details of why this movie was bad but ultimately it didnt make sense
so many unanswered questions and basically unbelievable scenes
since when does wolverine have to fight someone with a samuri sword for several minutes clashing blades together and not immediately cut through the blade
he fights on top of a bullet train with some yakuza thugs for several minutes slashing long gaping holes in the top of the train but no one in the train notices anything
much of the story is dependant upon wolverine actually sticking around in japan
you know what i said i wasnt going to do this so yeah the story sucks
i am a fan of wolverine however i do feel the movie is rated way beyond its caliber
the movie starts with an inner struggle brewing inside our hero
how he is taken off the worldly ways and trying to forget the past
to suppress its vulnerability as a soldier to protect the weak and stand for what is right
it takes a turn to fatality with wolverine landing in japan
and then movie starts to tumble where the yakuzathe ninjas samurais and what not are thrown in like a garnishing on a typical indian masala movie
the movie could use some more editing the storyline a little more tightening
it sometimes make you lose plot who is fighting whom and protecting whom
even if it is meant for casual viewer ship it drags at some points and go haphazard at others
its not a great moviebut hey we just want to see the wildness unleashed on the screencould be watched once if you are patient enough and an action fan
im not a big fan of the xmen franchise but this movie had be thinking im gonna like it and i did for the first half that is
the movie takes off pretty well attains cruising altitude and then suddenly drops like dead weight
they had everything going well for this movie until wolverine decides to let his balls do the thinking for him
half way through the movie they mustve remembered that sex sells and so do unnecessary explosions and stunts
from what i understood old man had alzhimers cute babe had obsessive compulsive disorder the cute doctor had pms and wolverine had a mid life crisis
by the time i got to the end i was only waiting for it to be over
because of all the hype created around the film the expectations became high for the film but sorry to say movie was bad not like super bad but was bad
after xmen first class i thought some good work would be implemented on this film but the scenario remains same as origins
i call this movie bad because of the boring pace of the film
the romance between wolverinehugh jackman and marikotao okamoto was so not required but still it was present and to test the patience was also given a large importance
we like wolverine cut through but not make love to
and the fight sequences were so exaggerated prerelease but they fall flat
without giving out much ill sum it up
watch it if your a fan of xmen series and wolverine else avoid
expecting something big from days of future past
the movie was going good and wouldve gotten 8 stars from me if its third act was consistent with rest of the movie
performances were fine
the camerawork and score was really good and the action was fun
there were some average acting at times though
it was an enjoyable affair overall and definitely worth seeing
the first wolverine film 2009 was much better than this one
it was simply more entertaining and cool
this one is quite frankly boring and forgettable
the storyline leaves something to be desired
i was not satisfied with the script
that being said the film wasnt horrible either
personally i just cannot find any concrete reasons for watching this since the entertainment factor is just not there
hugh jackman is a good casting choice for the role of wolverine and his acting is what saves this film from being a total bore
that and the female eyecandy if youre into that sort of thing
all in all i wouldnt recommend this flick to people who are not fans of the xmen universe
those 2 hours it takes to watch this are better spent watching something else
marvel has got a lot of heroes but most popular and maybe most liked is wolverine
i like wolverine too but not much as professor x
if we touch on movienot brilliant story and only good acting coming from hugh jackmanboring and similar action scenes
first hour of movie is boring and ordinary
everybody can understand haruhikos last wish not to say goodbye to wolverine
and the end of the story was terrible and viper wasnt enough to be archenemy and silver suit was very familiar
logan always see jean at his dreams and that was very upset to me but in this movie this feeling of compassion used too much and i was bored about that
to sum up movie was boring and full of ordinary action scenes but if you liked wolverine like me you can easily finish the movie
it deserve five points from me because it came to me very ordinary and boring just scenes with yukio was good and new or fresh
at least we have seen wolverine in the japan
i congratulate hugh jackman and rila fukushima
i really want to see a new wolverine movie without an ordinary story
im not going to say that the wolverine was the best xmen movie ever i probably x2 the best but i do think that it the best in a long while
fine writing very little of the corny special effects we saw in the xmen movies and origins and an interesting idea to fight wolverine
for all the people out there who say it makes no sense especially on one review saying that its stupid that his claws can be cut think before posting
if diamonds can cut diamond iron can cut iron then shouldnt it make sense that adamantium can cut adamantium
sense nothing is stronger than this fictional metal it makes sense that it can cut its self right
and then with the heart bug
all that bug was doing was suppressing logans powers not taking them away so when he destroys the bug his powers kick back in and thats how he heals
all in all the wolverine was a pretty good movie
sure it could have been could but look at the other xmen movies it did pretty good compared to them
am amazed at the current imdb rating of 6
9the wolverine fans must be on vacation
i have never read any comics or books on the marvel superheros i am from the older generation of superman and batman amp robin days pre 1970shaving said that i really enjoy a good action film with a reasonable storyline and fair quality actingi am pleased to say the wolverine delivered all that for me and a bit more especially some of the location shots which were excellent along with the fight scenes
sure some will find a flaw here and there with the productionactingcharacters but hey people its a superhero movie go watch our hero get beaten then recover and beat hell out of the bad guys and sometimes get the girl
hugh jackman delivered as usual  other standouts for me were rila fukushimathe body guardand svetlana khodchenkova viper i have a feeling some smart producerdirector will pick up these two ladies in the future
gave this 810 now go watch the wolverine to see if he gets the girl at the end
im a diehard superhero fan
i love the xmen movies and enjoyed the first wolverine very much
this movie was really enjoyable too but i expected it to be a bit better
the action was fun just like any other x men but i didnt feel a connection with any of the characters like i did in any of the other movies
some parts of the movie also seemed too predictable and a bit cheesy
i dont wanna bash on the film cause i enjoyed it and thought it was good but it could have been much better
if you like superhero movies as much as any other geek at heart watch it
it has really cool action scenes and you might even laugh a few times
just try going to the theater with low expectations or at least a lot lower than what i expected
you might enjoy it more than i did
there is a reason why xmen is not mentioned in the title and that is because the wolverine speaks for itself
after a disappointment with xmen origins wolverine hugh jackman finds redemption as this broken character that weve never seen before is thrown into the strict orthodox setting of japan
though not jackman steals the screen but also svetlana khodchenkova who brought the sexy villainous viper to life
but i was a little down on some mediocre acting especially by rila fukushima as her emotions joggled my understanding of yukio
even the ending drew me away as well the new twists and spins that came out of a backup plan jar
the wolverine is not the worst or the best of the xmen franchise so go see it and have an entertaining actionpacked ride with logan aka the wolverine
every single xmen movie that has been made in the last 10 years has been ruined by women characters too many closeups and time wasted on nonsense that doesnt have anything to do with the xmen and their powers
its like the people that make these movies have no real connection to the subject matter
just another audi commercial and shameless cash grab for the asian demographic
get rid of women and their lame dialogue
this girl power crap in hollywood needs to come to an end
overall just another xmen movie that fails to deliver
wow what a terribly executed plot
this movie is pure diarrhea
the guy that wolverine saves ends up trying to take his powers
it takes 2 hours of women rambling to get this point across
a terrible movie
the people who produced this movie had one thing in mind
that is capturing the asian demographic and sucking cash out of them simply by setting the movie in japan and including some ornamental samurai swords
i will never pay to see an xmen movie again
this is the best wolverine to date
its fast paced full of action and the story keeps flowing with a few good twists and turns
hugh jackman is back to his best with a story following his past present and future
it follows on from an event in logans past where he is given the chance to have a taste of mortality but obviously at a price
it is mostly set in japan with stunning sequences and breathtaking scenery
without making it too complicated the movie flows through the gears and gives a few flashbacks to previous movies
whereas previous versions have lacked in seriousness this movie maintains a good rhythm throughout
with a good blend of martial arts samurais mutants and robots yes thats right robots its an altogether fun action packed film with well directed fight scenes that youll enjoy immensely
there is a bonus scene for the die hard fans after the credits well worth the wait
easily watched without having seen any of the previous movies its very enjoyable
most probably better watched in 2d but ive not had a chance with the 3d yet
unfortunately the very considerably good xmen series are culminating in a series of rather disappointing and uninspired wolverine tribute wannabes
this movie leaves so much to be desired that at some point you cannot help but wonder where are they going with this
the answer only reveals itself in the last 3 minutes of the movie following the first endcredits
i wouldnt want to spoil it for everyone who has not seen the movie yet so i have this to share this is a watchable movie entertaining as far as effects go filled with plotholes leaving you with a taste of wehadtomakethismovieasstipulatedinourcontract in the mouth
i would not recommend it but i would not deter anyone from watching it
it was one of the best movies ive seen this year
it wasnt a really complex movie or a deep movie but just a cool fight film
i loved the final scene were the wolverine fight against the old man who tried to cut off his claws it wasnt a really nice shot
that moment in the bunker where wolverine defended the vietnamese was really awesome and heartbreaking
but sometimes it was the same over and over again but because of the fight scenes i forgive it
the shot where the wolverine gets tens of arrows in his back was also not a nice shot and sad but it displayed the movie good
he got shot over and over again but stood up and survived
i went souley because im a huge hugh jackman fan
but the movie i thought wasnt bad
i love hugh of course and thought that he put his all into it but i also think that all the other actors did too
i could have done without the bear scene
im not really sure i understand the point in that was but oh well
i enjoyed the action and humor in it and thought it was a well put together film
but of course my favorite part was hugh
its a movie that my little brother who doesnt like the xmen movies loved this one
its definitely a movie i would recommend to anyone wither or not youve seen the other xmen movies or wither or not you are a fan of the other movies or not
this movie is the worst movie of xmen series
there is not much of a story in this film in it there is a superherowolverine who saved a soldier in a war and then that soldier in return wants to thank him on the spot but as the time pass he grew jealous and want to have the power of his savior
wolverine having bad dreams from its past in it there is no explanation how that piece of technology is extracting the powers of wolverine while those powers are his mutation which he is born with it is a mutation of gene and now that evil grandfather has altered his gene by drilling holes into his adamantium bones
in this movie there is no good story a superhero succumb to his need of being loved and follow mariko the granddaughter of the man he saved the life of and hegrandfather wants to gift mortality to wolverine and want to be immortal
in all this is not the movie i was waiting for
total disappointment
i am certainly not an expert on xmen and the wolverine
i only wished i had read some reviews before i went to see this
i like hugh jackman but the plot and the pace of this film were too boring
it starts out interesting enough but it is downhill from there
75 of the film imho is violent
the fight scenes could have been shortened for at least 30 minutes
the film is 126 minutes long
i could have tolerated it better if it was 96 minutes long
i left it feeling i had wasted my time and i would definitely not recommend it to my friends
i am not a fan of violence coupled with a nonengaging plot
i found myself wanting it to be over long before it was
the action scene fight on the bullet train made me think of skyfall the james bond movie which had a train scene fight as well
that movie was so much better than this
the pg13 rating should be more of an r because of so much violence and adult topics
its best for the over 17 audience not the early teens
the movie is a step backward from the 2009 fox movie xmen origins wolverine
with a weak story poor adaptions of characters from the comic books and other flaws this is a waste of 11 dollars
it paled in comparison to other summer blockbusters like man of steel
this movie should have never been greenlit for production and was not worth it
the movie centers around wolverines adventures in japan and about a man who he saved from nagasaki i had no idea what was going on until a good 40 minutes into the lackluster film
overall with the poor cgi special effects and lacking story story 410 this was not worth my time or my money and i advise you not to go see it
i will not go see xmen days of the future past if this is the best fox can do
hugh jackman is fine in the role as always and some of the action sequences are good though i hated the fight on top of the bullet train  it struck me as incredibly stupid but the story is fairly clicha and theres just no flow
the story has wolverine summoned to japan to say goodbye to an old acquaintance whose life he saved in wwii hal yamanouchi
there he gets pulled into a web of intrigue and ninjas
rila fukushima provides able support as a red haired martial artist with superior sword skills
tao okamoto is pretty but dull as the love interest
svetlana khodchenkova is embarrassingly bad as a prostitute er doctor who is also not very secretly an evil mutant
she feels way out of place
marvel has done such a good job with their avengers franchise and the last xmen movie was pretty good but this is a dud
a lot of the critics who liked it liked it specifically because it separated this hero from his milieu and i think thats partly why i didnt like it much at all
big no
definitely this one is not even close what i expected from wolverine
if you read any critics review please dont listen to that
it is seriously waste of time
if i did not read any of the reviews about the movie before watching it i would have give it 5 or 6 out of 10
but going with big hope and waiting than something will happen it is better to go and watch he previous one
writing down here any more its look like waste of time i dont know why hollywood is going to asian countries for making any sequels
the best part in this movie is when the movie ends because after the credits gone there is a big surprise for every x men movie lover so if it is possible you can forward the whole movie just go in the end
with some loose action sequences and little bit twist in the end i does not understand what people see in this movie as we are getting this high rating
so dont spend your time and money in this movie
there are so many movies already lined up so a big no to wolverine
wolverine is by far my favorite xmen character
so i had high hopes for this movie
i went with some friends and my brother to this movie
we did ask ourselves why the movie wasnt in the biggest salon
after 40 minutes i knew why it wasnt in the biggest salon
im sorry but
this movie is super boring
the story isnt catchy
you dont have feelings for any of the characters they are hollow
after a while when i was trying to keep my eyes open the only taught i had was plz end this please end this even if it kills wolverine
this was a cheap movie to get some more money out of the wolverine legend
its a pity because i think the movie killed the legend
i was waiting so long to see this film
the only reason i disagreed with the negative reviewers is because some of them dont have much knowledge about the character wolverine
for example their confused of why doesnt he age because they clearly discuss this in the first xmen film when they find logan
im a huge fan of xmen and i loved xmen first class
anyways the wolverine film that was shown in cinemas wasnt that great it was missing some explanations
then i watched the extended version which had an additional 14 mins and theyve added blood to the fights
if you know the character wolverine from the comics then you will fall in love with this movie
the extended version was the best superhero movie ive seen this year
lastly without spoiling anything this version has something special after the credits showing a scene that takes place two years after the film
i give this movie a 1010 because it is pure badass
definitely waiting for the sequel
theres not much negative that can be said about the wolverine
if i had to complain about something then i guess a little more action wouldve been nice
but all in all this movie was nearly perfectly executed
hugh jackman really got in touch with making logan a real person
having him deal with the emotional consequences through out the movie instead of him just looking sad for the first 15 minutes was really a great choice
i will say that the plot was very predictable
i knew immediately who would wind up being in the samurai armor
however the movie was a lot of fun and easily one of marvels best
viper was a terrific villain and the actress playing her was great at making her menacing without going over the top
if you havent seen this movie its worth the ticket price
if you read the critics you would think that this wolverine movie was better than the last well theyre wrong
i had high hopes after reading mostly positive reviews but after actually watching the movie i have to say that it was ridiculously boring
i am so tired of superhero movies that go from one fight scene to the next without any explanation character or plot development
this movie suffered greatly from overkill with fighting
also this movie suffers from confusing female characters
mariko who we are suppose to like comes off as annoying
the viper comes off as creepy
the only good female character is yukio who steals the movie from wolverine every time they appear together
the plot was thin and any ending surprises projected themselves almost from the beginning of the movie
poor hugh jackman poor wolverine
the wolverine is a great film
the people who think that origins was better have no idea what the whole xmen universe is
this films delivers what wolverine fans always wanted to see the japan saga
sure
it cant stay true 100 to the comic but you have to adapt the story change it so that it can make sense
people dont get that comics are different from movies
for me the wolverine had great story great characters great action
its different from the other xmen movies and that is why i enjoyed it so much its fresh we get to see the character of wolverine vulnerable and at its lowest point
hugh jackman did a wonderful job
thank you hugh
people can say bad things about the movie
but the true fans will appreciate it
