"\nSaw IRON MAN 3 last night and it was superb. It was the sequel IRON MAN\n2 should have been but wasn't and the perfect extrapolation of life\nafter AVENGERS ASSEMBLE. The set pieces are suitably awesome and the\nacting performances are uniformly excellent from the leads right down\nto the tiniest bit part (there's a jewel of a cameo from a guard that\nupstages even Downey's comic timing). The script gets the balance\nbetween the epic and the personal just right and Sir Ben delivers two\nperformance for the price of one and both are genius (can't say more -\nspoilers!). Mr Downey Jr also manages to show even more of the\ncomplexity of Tony Stark. Just when you think there's no more to be\nfracked out of that particular mine, he goes deeper. The writer set out\nto deliver a fun story and that's exactly what it is. It draws you in\nfrom the first moments and doesn't let go. What more could you possibly\nwant?\n"
"\nIRON MAN THREE came as a pleasant surprise: better than the second\ninstallment, it's a perfect blend of comic book super-heroics and Big\nscreen sensibilities. Robert Downey is at his best. The writing helps.\nSo do the fx, which are 100% believable. (Even seeing the \"human chain\"\ndangling over the Cape Fear River when the movie was being shot here\ndidn't prepare me for the sequence: it's mind-boggling.) This was one\nof the few times that watching the movie was as much fun as reading the\ncomic books. Everyone involved deserves a pat on the back. The scene\nfollowing the end credits was by far the funniest (and the best) of the\n\"tag\" scenes. (And Stan Lee's cameo- as a lecherous old man watching a\nbikini contest- was great.) Hollywood finally got one right...\n"
"\nIron man 3 is not completely fresh in my mind considering I saw the\nmovie over a month a go, but it was a movie to remember.<br><br>Iron Man 3 was the first movie on my list of anticipated movies for\nsummer 13, and I thought it was a delight. Robert Downey Jr. was great\nin the suit as usual. He steals every scene, charms you, and is an\noverall funny guy. War machine ( haha) had good chemistry with stark\nand remained a relevant supporting character.<br><br>I am a big Guy Pearce fan! I loved him in movies such as: memento, hurt\nlocker, and la confidential. He was good as an actor in this film, but\nI felt they could have made him a little deeper of a villain. Which\nbrings us to the supposed downfall of this film. The Mandarin. Die hard\nfans of the Mandarin will be disappointed as ever by the mandarin in\nIron Man 3. He appears as a large threat and as a ruthless terrorist in\nthe first half of the film. Halfway through the movie you actually find\nout he is a drunken actor. In the end, no one can deny Iron Man 3,\nunless your a Mandarin purist. 9/10\n"
"\nHow do i put this? Nothings been the same same since newyork. Just saw\nIron man 3. and what do i say? Freakinglegendary.. A MARVEL-ous start\nof the Phase 2.. RDJ you were...you.. as always..we know who you are!\nEven if you take away all the tricks and toys and all the money and the\nsuits. YOu can fix this. You are the 'Mechanic' !<br><br>Mandarin..never saw you coming..really.. Guy Pearce great job.. Gwyneth\noutstanding.. Shane Black.. Hats off... It was more of a Shane Black\nmovie than the marvel movie.. Just don't know what to say.. still in\nanxiety attack..!!;) Was it the end of the iron man trilogy? or the\nstart of the phase 2? cant say.. but one thing I can say and which you\ncant take away.. \" I AM Iron Man..!!\"\n"
"\nI thought that Iron Man 3 was a smash hit! The movie shows that Tony\nStark, played by Robert Downey Jr. is truly a superhero, and shows that\nhe does a lot more heroic qualities of Tony Stark. The previous Iron\nMan films were shown by the perspective stand point of Iron Man, but in\nthis film shows a lot more of Tony Stark. <br><br>The special effects of IM3 was amazing! It made everything just come to\nlife, it made me feel like I was right there in the middle of the\nmovie. The special effects also made the movie so much more suspenseful\nand intense, I didn't want to stop watching it! This movie is now one\nof my favorites!\n"
"\nits not as same as the previous ones. But a must watch. The movie is\nwell directed, well poised. This movie deals more with the human\nemotions and the separation from real love because of the involvement\nof machines in the life of a human. Movie tags along well and well keep\nit to your seats till the very end. I have not given it a 10/10 because\nthe plot could have been a slightly better. But, nevertheless the movie\nis awesome, and a must watch. a complete family thriller. ACTING -\n10/10 DIRECTION - 10/10 PLOT - 8/10 CLIMAX - 8.5/10 ACTION - 10/10\nTHRILL - 9/10 CINEMATOGRAPHY - 9/10 VFX - 10/10 . OVERALL - 9/10. :) .\nENJOY IT! MUST WATCH!\n"
"\nThis is the best super hero movie I have ever seen. It was complete in\nevery way, with the humor and plot and characters. Robert Downey Jr.\nplays Tony Stark perfectly, and the plot twist in the middle is great.\nI had no complaints about this movie. This film is the best movie, by\nfar of the Iron Man series, and of every series of super hero movies.\nIt has the action and sci-fi content, the dramatic content, as well as\nthe humor to almost classify it as a comedy. This movie also proves\nthat Tony Stark does not need the suit to be a successful hero, he can\nmore than handle thing with only his wits and his knack of creating\nthings. This was one of the best films I have ever seen.\n"
"\nWatched Iron Man-3 today and I MUST say it was a BLAST out there.\nStandout performances from Robert Downey Jr and Ben Kingsley\n(SpeCiallY) It was a follow-up of The Avengers &amp; i MUST say i had d\nsame feeling in d FINALe of this one as in the Avengers .....awesome\nMOVIE-awesome COMEDY-ACTION scenes were beyond GREAT &amp; d SCENE where\nIRON MAN(not TONY ) saves 13 people falling from a AIRPLANE at same\ntime......but FRIENDS don't watch it in 3D which was added after\nproduction as it robs the screen of much-needed brightness and color\nand contributes nothing positive<br><br>Well Must say this one was more about TONY STARK &amp; less about IRON\nMAN....&amp; here \"EVERYBODY was IRON MAN even PEPPER\"..........<br><br>So everybody MUST watch this piece of ART even u r not a SUPERHERO fan\nat all,but after this U surely will be.\n"
"\nI watched this movie with my friend in the theater, and I thought it\nwas fantastic! Iron Man 3 perfectly blends comedy, drama, and action.\nSo what if it doesn't follow the comics? I kind of like it when movies\ndon't go by the book and change things up to make it interesting.\nRobert Downey Jr. brings back the acting we saw in the first one, in\nthe second one, he was really only playing the douche persona that is\nTony Stark. The effects was really good, and I normally don't go for\neffects. Plus, without giving anything away, all I'm going to say is\nthe way the movie wrapped up was perfect, it was a heck of an\nexperience! <br><br>I just ask that you don't listen to any friends who did read the\ncomics, and just go and enjoy this great superhero movie!\n"
"\nThese nerd purists make me laugh. \"It doesn't follow the comics\" \"It\ndoesn't follow the previous stories\" \"It doesn't...blah blah blah\"\nThese nerds should talk about what this movie Does. The movie is a\nsuccess in every sense of the word. Huge box office, amazing effects,\ngreat, enthralling, clever storytelling-this film has it all! If you\nlike the Iron Man movies, you will love this one because it is simply\nthe best of them. Downey is so fun to watch-he can take any line and\nmake it funny, quirky or touching as the moment merits. Paltrow is also\nfun-a great match for Tony. The villains are amazing to watch-the CGI\nfire effects, the constant surprises-all good fun. See it now-the best\nMarvel movie to date.\n"
"\nIron Man 3, it should have been the finest one according to the\ntrailer. I had expected much more though didn't left me disappointed\nand is an indeed amazing movie. The awesome action in the film is worth\na watch. Though the plot was not very strong, I liked it very much.\n'The House Party\" was yet a new mind-blowing element in the movie which\nleaves the audience amazed. The acting by Robert Downey Junior and\nGwyneth Paltrow was also splendid. The few jokes made me really laugh\nout loud. Some parts of the movie may leave the audience bored but it\nis highly recommended to watch this one for RDJ fans and Iron Man fan.\nBeing a Marvel movie, 5-7 minutes after credits there was a little joke\nabout Tony telling his story to Bruce Banner. That one was yet amusing\nand a bit of waste of time.\n"
"\nThe movie relates deeply with the previous 3 (including the Avengers)\nand the psychological state of Tony Stark in the whole movie made sense\nand gave a fair share of events! Can't really complain of anything, the\noriginality in the development of the plot as an extension of what it\nfollowed tops everything else. The humor was there, the love moments\nwere there, the action was there and on top *spoiler* Bruce Banner was\nthere :D Gotta love these two together, glad Marvel is feeling the same\nway. Really really really excited to see how his return will be played\nout for Iron Man 4 or The Avengers 2, I have complete faith in there\nbrilliancy with writing. <br><br>Good work Marvel.\n"
"\nYou can judge from my rating (9 out of 10!!) how much I loved this\nmovie. Watched it yesterday and and found it simply awesome. I have\nseen earlier sequels of Iron Man too and I think this was pretty\namazing it not the best and most importantly i found it an advancement\nover others. The movie has a WOW factor especially in some scenes\nincluding the one in which he saves people falling from the sky. I also\nliked the idea of controlling his machines (probably the right word for\nthose suits) that too not just one but so many by his brain. One of the\nmovies where you can see it is not just actors but overall crew,\ntechnical team, designers and directors are making the movie great.\nCast wise everyone played a pretty good role but there were two who\nstood out - one of course Robert and another Ben. Overall Superb Job\nand hope we get to see some more action, better movie in Iron Man 4!!\n"
"\nEveryone is complaining about the villain in this film and about how it\nwasn't a real villain and that they didn't follow the comic books and I\nsome what agree. They don't follow the comic books exactly because they\neveryone would know what would happen. I read the Iron Man comic books\nand I love what they did with the film. But while everyone is getting\nmad at the villain I think they are missing the point. I (and maybe it\nwas just me) thought #3 was more about Tony and how he grew from this\nand his problems. While the villain was apart of the story I just think\nit wasn't supposed to be all about the villain. This film looked at\nwhat was important to Tony his suits or an actual life like with\nPepper. There is a lot of action but I think people need to look past\nthat and see that there is a lot more going on then just things blowing\nup. It was a lot different then the other films because you actually\nsaw Tony on a struggle that wasn't so easy to overcome while also\ndealing with himself which you didn't see in 1 and 2.\n"
"\nThis is the awesomest Iron Man movie of all. It's great. It has\neverything funny parts, action, i mean lots of action, it has even a\n'time to cry' parts, by that i mean the ending fireworks. Whose idea\nwas that, blow away all the Iron Mans. The writers did a great work,\nexcept the ending, the fireworks using Iron Man, aw come on. Robert did\na great job. Nothing is missing. It continues Avengers, which is great.\nLittle number of mistakes, goofs and bloopers unlike Avengers. Tony's\ncar is same Audi R8 but in Iron Man style it's awesome. Shane Black did\na quite a good job. As the rest of the team congratulations on a great\nwork. And of course it would be better if you put Obama in Iron Man\nsuit except president Ellis. I'm just joking. The movie is great now we\nwait for more Marvel movies.\n"
"\nIRON MAN 3 is just plain awesomeness. I think Ben Kingsley did such a\ngood job that I think I'm okay with the feel steering away slightly\nfrom the comics.<br><br>I am excited about Robet Downey Jr coming back in an Avengers film and\nplaying this character. He has done is so skillfully that quite\nfrankly, I am not sure who they are thinking of to do it later. IRON\nMAN 3 features so many unique amazing costumes that I was just so\npleased with the design aspects. a good movie all around. There are a\nplethora of suits that show up that fans will be pleased who can name\nthem all.<br><br>Pepper Potts, is probably the most dynamic character in the film, and I\ndon't want to give anything away, but she challenges Iron Man in a way\nthat reminds me of Superman/WonderWoman dynamics.\n"
"\nI was looking forward to see what happened to Tony Stark and Iron Man\nespecially after the events of The Avengers, and while I enjoyed it, I\nfelt the whole movie was a bit overlong, but the ending knocked it out\nof the park! I will watch this again, as it is rare to find a movie I\nwill watch a second time anymore. Do not let he comic book fan boys and\nsmart marks talk you out of seeing this movie! A fantastic movie that\nwill help lead these Marvel characters into \"Phase 2\" - so bring your\nfamily to the theater and enjoy and exciting movie! Although just a\nlittle bit of an improvement over Iron Man 2, this now makes me really\nlook forward to Thor:The Dark World in November!\n"
"\nThe biggest hit of the summer was Disney's \"Iron Man 3,\" which made\n$408.6 million domestically and $1.2 billion worldwide. Huffington Post\nI guess the people who didn't like the movie didn't understand the\ncomplexity of the plot. It was twisted and so unpredictable, that's\nwhat made it so interesting. I was so relieved to not have to sit\nthrough another formula film. In the dollar theater now and your still\nable to see it in 3-D. It was packed in the theater and it has been out\nfor a long time. I was really pleasantly surprised. Considering I\nhaven't seen the first 2 I thought I might be lost but not at all and\nthe technology was so incredibly fun to watch. The action was not to\nlong and drawn out and it was funny to. Must See!\n"
"\nTony Stark(Robert Downey JR) is having problems sleeping after the\nevents of The Avenger(2012). He throws himself in his work, putting\nstrain on his relationship with Pepper Potts(Gwyenth Paltrow), then a\nnew threat named The Manderin(Sir Ben Kingsley) a terrorist who is bent\non domination.<br><br>Okay there is a lot to this movie then what you saw in the trailer, you\nprobably will be surprised or be very mad, that is up to you. But I\nenjoyed this, Robert Downey JR is still pretty good has the charming\nbut flawed hero Tony Stark/Iron Man. So was Gwyenth Paltrow and Don\nCheadle. Sir Ben Kingsley, Guy Pearce, and Rebecca Hall also shine in\nthere roles. It also had great effects and great action. In this we\nlearn it's not the suit that makes Tony a hero, but it's Tony himself\nthat is a hero.\n"
"\nI must say that I believe that this is the best film in the Iron Man\nfranchise. Downey was on top of his game once again as Stark. Saw this\nin 3D and should say that should be the only way that this movie is\nviewed. An epic movie experience for an epic movie. I would really like\nto say that Guy Pierce's character was very convincing. Sir Ben\nKingsley's Mandarin was very surprising. Other then that, I would\ndefinitely see this movie again. It was bigger then life and the action\nscenes really had my on the edge of my seat for the most part. If you\nhaven't seen this movie, then go. If you have seen if and liked it, see\nit one more time.\n"
"\nI'm not one to use superlatives, I hate it, eventually it becomes dry\nand loses meaning however, with Iron Man 3. Its a masterpiece.<br><br>Since the 'Avengers' stunned the world I've been eager to watch the\nnext chapter, as a huge Marvel fan I was not going to miss this. The\nmovie is brilliant, the plot is genius! I won't mention too many\nspoilers but be warned the following contains some:<br><br>Positives: 1: Downey is superb as Stark 2: Cheadle is simply brilliant\n3: Guy Pearce really shines as Killian 4: Harley was great 5: The\nMandarin 'reveal' was hilarious 6: The humor is great and not overused\n7: The plot is superb 8: The visuals are stunning<br><br>Negatives: 1: My only complaint is the lack of MENTION as to where\nS.H.I.E.LD are.<br><br>Many believe this to be the final Iron Man movie and Downey will only\nappear in the Avengers sequels. If so, they couldn't have done it\nbetter. This is simply one of the best, only beaten by the Avengers.\nAmazing.\n"
"\nWatched this flick yesterday on big screen and really enjoyed it.\r\n\r\nTony Stark Alias Iron man, affected with PTSD, sets out on finding and \r\neliminating Mandarin, and Afghan terrorist who is spreading terror in \r\nthe USA and who interferes in Iron man's life. Tony is also faced with \r\na psychic who is trying to use gene control over significant people to \r\nachieve his wicked purposes, and soon surprises are on the way for \r\nTony, all of which he has to handle.\r\n\r\nThe film is simply action packed. Stunts and effects all around 2 \r\nhours, and has lots of cheeky dialogs too. RDJr is of course the best \r\nactor, and the film is directed so well that even without watching the \r\nprequels one would understand it well.\r\n\r\nThe film also seems to be influenced by Bollywood, as evident from the \r\nposters of the hero and his counterpart, and of course other things \r\nwhich are quite obvious in the movie.\r\n\r\nAction and special effect fans - watch it ONLY on big screen and ONLY \r\nin 3D!\n"
"\nNow, I know a lot people didn't like this movie very much because of\nwhat it did to The Mandarin, how he was portrayed. But I don't give a\ncrap. It's an awesome movie, my favorite of the three Iron Man movies,\nand I think it's just great. <br><br>Tony's world is torn apart when a horrible, villainous terrorist named\nThe Mandarin comes out of the shadows to destroy the world. But the big\ntwist is that The Mandarin is only an actor, and the real villain is\nbehind the curtain, pulling the strings, whilst creating a race of\nsuper-people.<br><br>Overall, I give this movie a 10 out of 10, which in my ratings book is:\nFreaking Ridonkulous.\n"
"\nI thought the film was really good but the only negative thing I have\nto say the actor who played the mandarin and the president was really\nNot good at acting apart from that the acting was brilliant especially\nthe actor who played tony stark. I'd just like to say the mark 42 iron\nman suit was amazing !!!!! And the person who made the suit for the\nfilm has a an amazing, creative mind. PLEASE bring another film out\njust to make the iron man film come to an end for example making tony\nstark die. Or a bad guy detonating a nuclear bomb that is going to kill\nmillions of people and tony and the bad guy have to fight to the death\nand tony has to stop the bomb detonating and ends up killing himself\njust to stop the bomb\n"
"\nOMG!! How the marvel studios has managed to make their greatest star to\na great movie I have to say this that there should be appreciation for\nmarvel studios or such a great film.<br><br>Basically I am both DC and marvel comics fan but I hope that the\ncharacter ill be taken into another level in future films.<br><br>In this film I like the action scenes as well as the graphics story and\nwhatever and I have to say that they had made such a beautifully film\nand they had also make great use of their budget.<br><br>Robert Downey Jr. His efforts has taken this franchise to an another\nlevel and I have to say that he is the real iron man he totally suits\nfor this role he is born for this role.\n"
"\nThis movie is an example of Marvel at its best, especially for what\nthey have been trying to do with the Iron Man/Tony Stark.<br><br>From the beginning, this was a story about the human not the superhero.\nA man constantly at war with himself, who he is, and who he wants to\nbe. After the events of the Avengers movie, Tony finally breaks. The\nman who was always calm and in control, finally breaks. This truly\npeels the man out of his armor, both literally and figuratively. This\nis the first time that we see Tony Stark as himself and get a look\ninside his head. It really is fascinating and refreshing to take a\ndeeper look just how fragile a man truly is underneath their facade.<br><br>At one of the low points in his life, where he is set off by 6 year\nolds, and withdrawals from those closest to him, it takes something\ntruly drastic to come out of his funk and become the best person he\ncould be.<br><br>The best scene I have seen in any Marvel movie is his talk with Pepper\nin the garage about the after math of New York.<br><br>This is truly Marvel at its best. 9/10\n"

"\nIt's a first day buy on Bluray no don't! There's no doubt you will\nenjoy this film. The direction is well perfection. It has far too many\ncool action scenes and dialogue that it can not fail. The trailers\ndon't show you a thing from the film besides the house scene. But when\nyou think something is the way it truly is then you are wrong. It is a\ngreat film that I will be paying $25 dollars for. The film provides\nmany references towards the avengers and at one point there is a cameo\nby the one and only Joss Whedon, the director of The Avengers. List of\nSuperhero films in my favor. Top five....there not only MArvel films. <br><br>1. Iron Man 3 2. The Avengers 3. The Amazing Spiderman 4. The Dark\nKnight 5. V for Vendetta\n"
"\nFirst off, yes i do read the comics. Second off, everyone that didn't\nenjoy it, didn't understand the enemy and the stuff the Tony Stark went\nthrough.<br><br>Aldrich Killian clearly states at the end he is the Mandarin, and it\nalso doesn't show his dead body so he could come back. Also he could\nfind the \"rings\" later , or he could be covering for the Mandarin.\nThere are plenty of ways he could come back.<br><br>Yes this film has a little lack of action but the story is brilliant\nhow Tony Stark grows as a character so much. The Mandarin could quite\neasily be brought into The Avengers or The next Iron Man film. The\nMandarin is still just starting out and this won't be the last we see\nof him.<br><br>I hope all the bad \"press\" people are giving it won't put you off\nseeing this film.<br><br>Making a film from comics in the real world can be quite challenging\nbut i think they did a great job at it.\n"
"\nI had the pleasure of watching the film premiere last night and it blew\nme away. The film delivers in both storyline, and visual effects. From\nstart to finish you are thrown in to lots of action, twists and turns.\nThis film will not disappoint all you hardcore Marvel/iron man\nfans.There are some big twists, which really make this film that bit\nmore exciting. For me the most impressive part of the movie were the\nvisual effects, which you would expect from such a film as this. They\nreally push the boat out with huge explosions, gun fights and all the\nusual extras. I do believe this will be one of the biggest films to\ndate. Definitely worth an 8 out of 10.\n"
"\nI thought the second IRON MAN film wasn't bad at all, a certain step up\nfrom the wonky first instalment, but this third outing for the\nsuperhero is one too many. IRON MAN 3 feels like a bloated and\nsuperficial comedy with all of Robert Downey Jr.'s annoying wisecracks\ncoming to the fore and not along else.<br><br>If I had to describe this film in a single word, it would indeed be\n'bloated'. The running time is bloated as are the endless CGI action\nsequences, which go nowhere and add nothing of any entertainment value\nto the screen. Downey Jr. gives a lazy performance, while the script is\neven lazier in bumping off key characters only to bring them back five\nminutes later in supposed 'twists'.<br><br>My interest was briefly raised by the appearance of Guy Pearce, but\neven he doesn't seem to be very good here, and the less said about Ben\nKingsley's over the top acting the better. If you like childish action,\nlots of bonding with that annoying kid from JURASSIC WORLD, and a\ngeneral lack of momentum and direction, then IRON MAN 3 might be the\nfilm for you.\n"
"\nFirst of all the mandarin is fake. Shane Black may be the worst\ndirector of our time. Why on earth would you take the mandarin, one of\nMARVELs greatest villains and turn him into a British drunk guy?! When\nShane Black sat down and started working on this film was he thinking\n\"hey I'm going to make iron man 3 the worst MARVEL film of all time. Oh\nand while I'm at it ill go ahead and make a joke of the mandarin\"? I\nhave no clue how MARVEL is going to recover from this tragic event. The\nonly good thing about this \"film\" is RDJ. I left the theater wishing it\nwere just a bad dream and that when i awoke Jon Favreau would be the\ndirector. Shane Black shouldn't be allowed to direct a cereal\ncommercial after what he did to MARVEL.<br><br>The Mandarin is fake.\n"
"\nOverall, it was pretty terrible. They tried being too funny, the new\nsuit was stupid, War Machine didn't do anything except kick doors down,\nand Tony Stark barely fought as Iron man. <br><br>Most sequels are made to be better than the movie before it, but this\none almost went a step backwards in comparison to the second film. Less\naction, villain was stupid with the whole paid actor bit. They keep\ntrying to find more creative ways for the suit to be put on, but I\nthought they should have just left it like they put it on in the first\nIron Man. My vote for biggest disappointment of the summer thus far.\nEspecially after Marvel put out a great movie like the Avengers, I\ncan't believe the first follow up to that was this poorly written and\nlack of action movie.\n"
"\nI really wouldn't bother with this one. The plot was a bit all over the\nplace and really doesn't grab you, I wondered out of the screen half an\nhour from the end, went to the loo, checked my phone etc and probably\nwouldn't have bothered going back in if my partner hadn't still been in\nthere! The script was really cringey, lots of lame one-liners but not\nmuch else. There weren't really any likable characters in the film, and\nthe ones which had potential to be likable were barely in it. Typical\ncocky guy saves the world type thing, nothing we haven't seen a hundred\ntimes before. Few random unnecessary sexist bits, girls in bikinis\nplaying table tennis (??), girls in lingerie etc. So cliché and\ncringey. Lots of plot holes which I won't go into in case you are going\nto waste your money but in general it was just messy and lame. And\nkinda boring in a way.\n"
"\nThe main beef I have with this film surrounds the directorial choice to\nuse the Mandarin as a total foil instead of the true antagonist.\nPerhaps a candidate for one of the worst ideas EVER by the MCU!\nObviously the director had little affinity to the original Iron Man\nstory, or he would never have attempted such a thing. And yet I thought\nthey picked THE PERFECT ACTOR to play the Mandarin too! Such a\ndisappointment that they wasted his talent, especially since the\nantagonist (Aldrich Killian) was a laughable substitute with a nearly\nspoof-like backstory and shallow motivations. To add insult to injury,\nthey write the plot where Tony spends basically the whole movie out of\nthe suit, and then has him totally destroy all his remaining suits at\nthe end for some fireworks. Overall, I'd give it 5 exploding Iron Man\nsuits out of 10.\n"
"\nFor the last year I've felt that the massive success of The\nAvengersand I mean its artistic success, not its box officewas a\ndouble-edged sword for Marvel. After all, wouldn't the individual\ncharacter films feel a bit... small after that? IM3 attempts to use\nthat to its advantage by making it smaller on purpose. It's a character\nstudy with a bit of spectacle slapped on, and I do mean \"bit\". While\nthe third act does follow the standard \"Stuff go boom!\" formula, the\nfirst two thirds of the film keeps the action rather conventional (with\none notable exception). To make this work you need an actor who can\nhold the audience's attention. Thankfully IM3 has the ultimate ace in\nthe hole in Robert Downey Jr. But even his unmatched charisma can\nmerely Spackle over the film's many flaws. The story is weak, the\nstakes feel small and it just never builds any momentum. There are a\nlot of things to like here. The aforementioned RDJ, some sharp dialog,\na scene stealing turn by Ben Kingsley and a jaw-dropping twist.\nUnfortunately the sum of IM3 is less than its parts.\n"
"\nGood = special effects and surrounding sound mix in cinema and Miguel\nFerrer cameo (always reminds me robocop) Bad = everything else :\nscreenplay, dialogue, runtime, villains,soundtracks, casting, the\nbudget, the connections with avengers and previous iron man movies.\nResult = 1 billion at the worldwide box office and i hope lots of\nrotten tomatos. Tagline: Unleash the stupidity behind the title\nConsequences: not even sure willing to watch avengers 2 or other marvel\nmovies. Maybe gonna give a chance to Thor 2 though,,,and make second\nthought on upcoming robocop remake if they do not push the button too\nfar from the original.\n"
"\nThe first one was average, the second diabolical. I thought surely this\nwill be an improvement ?. But on no, this is just awful. Really really\nbad. The plot is stupid and makes little sense, the action totally\nunrealistic and half the villains have crazy x-men type powers which is\nnot properly explained how it came about. The humor is tacky and quite\nhonestly its the worst film I've seen for a long time.<br><br>All the old tacky clichés are in abundance, scenes are repeated from\nthe second film time and time again, its like watching the same film\nhalf of the time.<br><br>Please pray they never make another!\n"
"\nThe movie should of been called Tony Stark I, for it has nothing to do\nwith the two previous Iron Man movies. As others have said, they wasted\nthe Mandarin character, turning him into a joke. Most of the story is\nabout Tony's inner demons, boring!! Then they try to make the movie kid\nfriendly by introducing a child's part to help Tony as he once again is\nlost in the rubble which is his life. Really, thought that is why he\nmade Pepper his girlfriend. Was utterly disappointment with this\nrelease, seems like it was rushed and thrown together, because the\nstory line is barely coherent. Don't waste you time on this, wait till\none of your friends buys the DVD/Blu Ray, borrow it from them and then\nhelp them by trashing it.\n"
"\nThis movie would score higher if it had a proper rating. Seems they\nwant to get movies rated as low as possible anymore regardless of\ncontent. My son and I have been watching the Marvel Universe movies,\nthis should have been skipped. Its by far the worst of all. <br><br>Tony Stark talks about \"going to town\" on a woman in the beginning.\nThere are a ton of 4 letter words who's use isn't just bad, but they\nare used in bad ways making it worse than just normal curse words. They\nalso shoot each other left and right, and may as well be a Jason Borne\nmovie the way they shoot each other in the head and blow each other up\nin this movie. Only difference in this is you do not see the blood\nsplatter. <br><br>This is one PG-13 where the 13 should be taken seriously.\n"
"\nThe movie was obnoxious from the beginning, Robert Downey Jr. is not\nthe one to blame but a total waste of time and disappointing, Sorry MCU\nfans. <br><br>The character of Tony Stark it's boring this time, i think he has some\nkind of depression that we didn't see before or they didn't tell us.\nNothing to say about Mandarin, a total fraud, it could have been a\ndecent Marvel villain but they screwed it again. Then again, the jokes\nanother Marvel problem, if you are in a serious situation, come on\nthat's why this movies are for kids.<br><br>By the way, what the hell is Rebecca Hall's role in this movie she's\nlike there doing nothing.<br><br>Hope Marvel one day make good movies again like IronMan, Captain\nAmerica 2 or Civil War.\n"
"\nIron Man 3 is better than 2 , even more so is disappointing , the film\nsimply spoiled the villain Mandarin , even the actor Ben Kingsley\ncompetent, Robert Downey Jr. is great as always, the end of the film\nthat appears Carol Iron Man is cool , this film Marvel commits more\nabsurd script error at the end of Tony Stark takes the shards of the\nbody and ceases to be Iron Man more in the movie Avengers : Age of\nUltron he simply appears with fighting armor and worse than the film\ndoes not explain , something the film does not account what happened to\nPepper Potts if she was cured film does not explain , Iron Man 3 is\nbetter than 2 , has some fun scenes more contains several errors and\nsome forced scenes in addition to having the worst villain of the film\nuniverse Marvel . Note 5.5\n"
"\nA new director takes on the reign to the Iron Man franchise, Shane\nBlack. Iron Man 3 is better than Iron Man 2 but not on par with the\nfirst Iron Man. The film is a little darker and more serious than its\npredecessors but not by much. Entertaining adventure, some cool action\nsequences, with some surprises, let's get right to the surprises. 1 of\nthe notable twist was Ben Kingsley's supposedly role of The Mandarin,\nwasn't really The Mandarin, he was just an actor with substance-abuse\nhired by the real villain to fake it. Ben Kingsley's talents were\nwasted. As a long time, comic book fan, I've gotta say, that was truly\na disappointing twist in the movie, disgusted by it. And that's that.\n"
"\nIron Man 3 has gotten a lot of hate over the years and still does and i\nunderstand it completely but the reason why i loved it is because we\nall got shocked at the movie theatre because the Trailers didn't spoil\nhalf of movie (cough Terminator Genisys, Amazing Spider-Man 2,\nAvengers: Age of Ultron, Fantastic Four and many more cough). The whole\nthing with the Mandarin i found it pretty clever and it shows us again\nwhy Ben Kingsley is such an amazing actor and i loved the fight scenes\nand the effects and Mark 42 was such a badass suit they even turned\nPepper into a badass chick protecting herself but the biggest thing\nthat made Iron Man 3 better than Iron Man 2 in almost every way is that\nhe is more Tony than Iron Man in here since it shows that he can defeat\npeople without the help of his Iron buddy he is a clever dude and he\nuses his brain to fix things and stop threats and that's why Iron Man 3\nis a great movie in my opinion.\n"
"\nMain focus of writing a review- 1. Don't spoil the movie ( spoiling a\nmovie means telling somebody what happens before they get a chance to\nsee it, I guess that's bad, like somehow people are incapable of\nfiguring out before hand what will occur in the movie, Hollywood a word\nsynonymous with formulaic repetition and you just can't abide somebody\nspoiling the plot for you even though it's a plot you have already seen\nin ten other movies ). With that in mind here is the review for Iron\nMan 3, too many villains and none of them do anything, child actors are\nawful all humans despise child actors why do we continue to employ\nthem, also where the f*ck is Iron Man? Nobody cares about Tony Stark,\nthat's why the movie is called Iron Man, you have an Iron Man movie\nwithout Iron Man in it, sh*t, might as well call it Iron Man 3\n"
"\nBack in 1999, Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) meets up with Maya Hansen\n(Rebecca Hall) who is working on her bio project. It would simply be an\none night stand and he would also blow off Aldrich Killian (Guy\nPearce). The two of them would come back to cause trouble in the\npresent. In the present, Stark is haunted by the battle of NY and is\nsuffering sleepless nights and panic attacks. Pepper Potts (Gwyneth\nPaltrow) is now CEO. Colonel James Rhodes (Don Cheadle)'s suit has been\nrenamed Iron Patriot. And there is a new terror menace named The\nMandarin (Ben Kingsley).<br><br>I love the fact that Stark is suffering from the battle of NY. The\nsarcastic humor is funnier than ever. In this one, Stark even picks up\na funny boy sidekick. His character is deeper than ever. If there is\none problem with the movie, Stark is too often without his suits. It\nmakes the ending less reasonable. But the ending is chalk full of\nexplosive fun, and I'm willing to ignore any minor problems.\n"
"\nI enjoyed Iron Man and Iron Man 2. Despite the science fiction, cartoon\nhero nature of the movie, the plots were reasonably believable and not\ntoo ridiculous. Action scenes were good, but not overdone. Moreover,\ncharacters had depth - quite rare in action movies in general and\nespecially so in superhero movies. Dialogue was snappy and funny.\nPerformances were first-rate.<br><br>Iron Man 3 is no exception. In fact, I enjoyed it slightly more than\nthe previous two. Tony Stark showed a vulnerability that wasn't evident\nin the first two. Plus, in the Mandarin and Guy Pearce's character we\nhave a villain who is a match for Iron Man.<br><br>On this note, Guy Pearce put in a great performance as the bad guy.\nUsual great, snappy, witty performance from Robert Downey Jr. <br><br>Great entertainment.\n"
"\nAt first i was mad because the Mandarin not being real and of course\nthe villain was like not good enough but after a while when i was\nthinking about the film i really saw the big plot there. Imo they tried\nto show how a mare man deals with the life after the big event from the\nAvengers. Ofc he is Tony Stark (genious, billionaire ... etc. etc.) but\nhis experience so far is nothing compared to the others(Thor, HULK ,\nCaptain America). After all i like how the movie showed his struggle\nwith accepting all that happened. It was funny, action was good and\noverall a solid performance. Big movies are coming up and we should\nlook at the movies Marvel universe as something new and not to compare\nit with the comics and the animated movies. I am really looking forward\nwith great expectations and a chill for the next movies and how they\nwill show thing and what innovations will they present to the public.\nCheers.\n"
"\nYeah I kinda liked it, sue me. <br><br>After everyone was beating the fecal matter out of this movie, my hopes\nfor this film were as high as the dirt under my carpets. Yes, this film\nhas a lot of errors you might notice or don't make sense, yes, there\nare pretty big plot holes in there (especially that one at the end\neveryone is complaining about), the plot-twist in the last act is\npretty much \"hit or miss\" and there is at least one plot-threat that\ngoes nowhere. <br><br>But if you are not looking for anything too fancy, Iron Man 3 is a good\nrental.\n"
"\nThe third Instalment in the lucrative Iron Man franchise pits the cocky\nhero against an elusive terrorist wrecking havoc in the United States\nthrough untraceable means. The battle becomes personal when Iron Man\ncalls out the Mandarin and sets himself up as a target. <br><br>Taking the helm from Jon Favreau, Director Shane Black steps in to some\nbig shoes as he directs an already all star cast in addition to Ben\nKingsley, Guy Pearce and Rebecca Hall. Fortunately he doesn't\ndisappoint as this summer blockbuster checks all the boxes leaving you\nentertained while you munch away on your popcorn. <br><br>Robert Downey Jr is in top form and Paltrow adds to the eye-candy quota\nas does Rebecca Hall even if her character is a little weak. Pearce and\nKingsley shine while Don Cheadle has more of a cameo. All in all, the\nstars do what they're paid to do and do it well. <br><br>Full of both action, effects, explosions and laughs, Iron Man 3 is one\nyou're sure to enjoy. Make sure you wait till after the credits are\nover!\n"

"\nWe have seen what the Ironman is capable of in Ironman1, ironman2 and\nThe Avengers. His powers, intelligence, attitude and so on. But in this\nmovie we see the weaknesses of him and how he overcomes them to save\nthe world and live up to his name. I would say that this movie is a\nMarvel version of The Dark Knight Rises. The movie is good in its own\nway but has a few flaws like the weak ironman suits, tony stark's\nstupid idea of announcing his address to the world so that the enemy\ncan attack him, tony's negligence causing him to be the root cause to\nthe origin of the Mandarin, making ironman look so beatable in the\naction sequences etc. Except for these flaws the movie is great!\n"
"\nA top form Robert downing jr,Tony Stark and Iron Man.Plenty of\nswashbuckle like we would expect from the latter 2. The Mandarin\ncharacter was a master piece that was perfectly executed by Ben\nKingsley.<br><br>The Story seems to drag a bit sometimes,but inventiveness in the fight\nscenes are welcome rather just blowing up stuff.<br><br>Improves on the 2nd one by not being merely an action movie and\ndelivers other things that we love like the humour of the stark\ncharacter and creative battles.Gives all its main characters enough\nspace to show some sort of development rather than being standing\nmanequins.<br><br>But the story is not as compelling as Iron Man 1 and fails deliver what\nit tries to like the dilemmas supposedly stark finds himself in to like\nbeing ripped of everything,he just breezes through coolly unlike when\nhe truly was in Iron man 1 in that cave and robert downing junior\nshowed another facet to the character.<br><br>But definitely fun and thats what we want more than anything from this\ncharacter just like with Captain Jack Sparrow.\n"
"\nHow can you not like any of the Iron Man movies? They are exciting,\nfunny, clever, and original. Robert Downey Jr. is amazing as Tony\nStark. Of the 4 movies (including Avengers) this was my least favorite\nhowever.<br><br>Having said that, however, this is NOT an unfavorable review. I loved\nIron Man III. I just don't think it was as strong as the previous 3\nmovies.<br><br>My main issue with the movie was the lack of actual Iron Man in it. You\nrarely get to see Iron Man in all of his glory, and then when you\nfinally do, he is easily ripped apart by the enemy. Other than that,\nTony Stark is great as usual, and the movie has all of the great\none-liners, funny moments, and action that you would expect.\n"
"\nIron Man 3 continues the franchise on a familiar note: it has action,\ninternational weapon politics, technobabble, and Robert Downey Jr's\ntrademark banter. The story takes a somewhat dark path but overall the\nfilm has a lighthearted outlook and has its fair share of comedy.<br><br>Ben Kingsley is pretty awesome in his role as The Mandarin, and the\ntwist involving his character is clever and surprisingly surprising.\nOther than that, the story doesn't offer much that's original. Guy\nPearce's character (a mad scientist idolizing and resenting Tony Stark)\nworks at the beginning but goes on a downward slope and ends up\nridiculous. Rebecca Hall is great as Tony's ex and you could cut the\ntension between her and Gwyneth Paltrow with a knife.<br><br>The third act of the film is rather embarrassing, consisting almost\nentirely of a silly CGI fight with robots and flame-men.\n"
"\nThis film was a nice entry in the Ironman series, although probably not\nthe film fans of the comics would of wanted. Being both, a fan of the\nfilms and comics I was perched on the fence with this one. First of all\nthe cast were great Downey Jr is a brilliant Tony Stark and I thought\nthe film was quite amusing in places, a great film for the casual fan.\nAlthough maybe fans of the comics should give this a wide berth. When I\nread that the Extremis storyline was going to be the basis of the film\nI was excited, but this film doesn't retain the dark brooding tone that\nI would come to expect from such a story arc. The mandarin character\ngets put through the ringer as well and could be seen as a bit of a\nmiddle finger to the fans (although Kingsley is pretty funny.) Anyway\nmy least favorite film of the series but still a good, enjoyable film.\n"
"\nRobert Downey Jr. has played the role of Tony Stark so many times he is\nIron Man. Here he is again, this time after the villain called the\nMandarin played by Ben Kingsley. Gwyneth Paltrow gets a bit more to do\nbut still gets to stand around and look good.<br><br>The movie seems a tad long and maybe too many things blow up. Seems\nlike nearly everything and everyone blows up.<br><br>When you go to an Iron Man movie you should know what to expect. This\none delivers. Remember you are going to a comic book movie that is best\nenjoyed when you forget logic, plot and just go with the action and the\nhumor.<br><br>it's a great way to start off the summer movie season.\n"
"\nLike Nolan's third Batman, where he is portrayed as a cripple, hobbling\nout of retirement at half strength, here we have an Iron Man lamed with\nbusted and under-powered gear throughout. What are we paying for if not\nto see our superheroes be super? <br><br>Then there was the lame plot. Stark dares the Mandarin to come and get\nhim, gives his home address, and then doesn't bother to suit up, all\nthe while having the wife in the house, exposed to risk. How stupid. <br><br>Equally stupid is that the Mandarin actually comes, with nothing more\nimpressive than a few missile firing helicopters, despite knowing what\nIron Man is capable of, and having no reason to suppose our man\nwouldn't be all suited up and waiting. Or at least have his radar\nturned on.\n"
"\nShould have kept the same plot and story line of the real mandarin and\nthe 10 rings. Kingsley put on an outstanding performance as the\nvillain, at least for the little amount of time he was. Would have been\nsmarter to keep him as the mandarin and move along with the 10 rings\nstoryline. Very disappointed or else this movie could have gotten a\n10.. For the mandarin being starks arch nemesis, i just thought\nKingsley could have given us a Heath Ledger worthy performance, which\nmakes or breaks a movie....and no dis respect to guy Pearce, but he was\ndoomed the second they fell from the story of how the mandarin came to\nbeing and with Kingsley doing such a great job. Bad directing....Black\ncould have had a real winner instead let his ego get in the way of a\ngreat what could have been..\n"
"\nAfter having seen IM3 last weekend I thought it was at least as good as\nthe first, but better than the second one. It was about the same as The\nAvengers. What some of the reviewers fail to remember is that the\nstudios make movies to make money. Explosions, special effects and (or)\nstars sell tickets, therefore making money. Star Trek The Motion\nPicture is a perfect example. The trekkers, myself included, wanted the\nreunion of Kirk, Spock, McCoy and the rest. The special effects and\nsets pushed Star Trek beyond the boundaries of TV. It wasn't a very\ngood movie but people went to see it for the stars and special effects\nand it made MONEY!\n"
"\nThe producers and writer and director of this movie left me feeling\nlike the group who put together \"Return Of The Jedi\". What I mean is,\nit felt like they KNEW this movie was going to make $$$ so they just\nmade whatever. Story? Plot? Much loved villains? Ehhhhh, who cares?!\nIts gonna make money.<br><br>When I heard THE MANDARIN was going to be the villain, I read up on him\nand thought it would be a very cool story. But the writer and director\ndecided to change THE MANDARIN cause, ehhhh who cares?! This movie is\ngonna make money.<br><br>There is better writing and ideas on WALKING DEAD. The continuity in\nthe story left me thinking, \"wait, that didn't make sense.\" <br><br>I gave it a 4 / 10 cause I am a RDJ fan, the effects were cool and\nuhhhh, hmmmm, maybe I should have gave it a 3 / 10.<br><br>AGAIN, I REPEAT, the movie felt as though the producers, writers and\ndirector knew this movie was going to make $$$ so why worry about\nquality.\n"
"\nWhy even name the villain Mandarin if you don't even mention or show\nthe 10 rings of power.<br><br>They even had trivia before then movie when i went to see the movie and\nthat was one of the questions. The mandarin was a magical type villain\ngot his powers, from his 10 rings of power. Not some common terrorist\nwith a AK47.<br><br>Why cant marvel get anything right. They say they study the history of\ncharacters and then they make a movie and totally forget the history.\nThen claim they cant show everything because of just don't translate in\nreal character movies.<br><br>If thats the case then ANIMATE THEM.<br><br>Still waiting to see a good ANIMATED version of THE INFINITY GAUNTLET\n"
"\nThis show was OK. The questions I had was, was this a love story,\naction flick or a movie to \"find ones self worth\". Don't get me wrong\nbut the graphics were great but how many machines does one person need?\nWhere were they (since they can sense danger) when the house was\ngetting blown up? Oh yea getting blown up. While in all this, everyone\ncomes out unscathed. Reading the other reviews, I would have to agree\non some parts. IM says the suits only for him but man he dressed almost\neveryone in the movie with his suit. As well, IM can defeat aliens\n(Advengers) but can not take on these \"earthling experiments\". I would\nhave to agree with comedy in a movie is OK but how that was displaced\nin the movie confused movie goers on what type of script/movie this\nreally was. What's with the kid helping him \"find himself\"? But in the\nend, some pretty cool stuff presented him frm IM (nice car). Overall,\nthe story was \"so so\" (clip after the credits was well presented) &amp;\nalready awaiting the DVD version as it would have the commentary to\nexplain everything.\n"
"\nWatched it yesterday at the local theatre. I heard some people talk\nabout how it is the best Iron Man movie of the three. Well, let me tell\nyou, it is as formulaic as it gets. The bad guy is shown with the\nrather tiring motive of world domination and has a female accomplice\nwho as usual is enamoured of Tony Stark and saves his skin.<br><br>Also Tony's squeeze has a few bad ass moments herself. He creates a\ndozen computer controlled suites for Doomsday but then destroys them\nafter the final fight. Well what if it happens again, huh Tony? Sure,\nthe effects are good but the plot is weak, and it is not hard to guess\nwhat happens next. The surprise hardly feels like it because we have\nalready guessed it. Also the humour is cheesy, it hardly matches up to\nthe first movie.\n"
"\nThe first Iron Man was great. The second was pretty good, this is in\nthe dirt unless you like the cartoon humour. Personally, I don't like\nseeing people bounce around like they do in animation. It's a film with\npeople, it needs to have ground rules.<br><br>Also, the story line is very weak. It's like they tried to make a\nsequel but they didn't know what they were doing and improvised a half\nchewed script. There is no depth or complexities to the story. They had\none goal and that was doing something with Iron and and his girlfriend.\nI won't spoil it for you, in case you still want to watch it. But I\nadvise watch the trailer and you'll get the best parts.\n"
"\nThis was a good movie, not great but definitely good. The misuse of the\nMandarin was a hard one for comic lore lovers to swallow. It was also\nhard to understand how Pepper became so aggressive in the end . Why was\nthe armor so weak and got destroyed like tin foil during the climax of\nthe movie. Tony was going through suits of armor at the rapid rate\nduring the finale. My question is with the large sum of money made off\nthis film, more than doubling what it cost to make, why have they not\ngreen lit another one? I know he is going to be in Avengers 2 but I\nfigured they could start moving forward on Iron Man 4 too. Anyone know\nwhy they haven't? Is is because of the price tag that RDJ has demanded\nfor reprising the character? Seems worth it if he can double a figure\nlike $200 million.\n"
"\nIm not gonna go into a lot of detail, just what I didn't like.<br><br>May Contain SPOILERS One of the main things that stuck out was the\nwhole movie Iron Man was getting his butt kicked. Literally every fight\nhe was in he got beat up and in a few he was bailed out by humans and\neven a kid. Really? Now Iron Man has to be bailed out by a regular\nhuman child? That's one of the main reasons I hated this movie so much.<br><br>Another reason I hated this movie was in a lot of the scenes with Iron\nMan Stark wasn't actually in the Suit, he was controlling it from far\naway... Yea WTF! You would think he was in it then they would show him\nin a different area controlling the suit. I don't wanna see that, I\nwanna see Stark in the suit kicking bad guys butts.<br><br>Then there's the storyline. Im not gonna go into detail because I would\nbe going on for days, but in short it was horrible. It was so far off\nfrom the original story.<br><br>In all this was a mess! TOTAL MESS!\n"
"\nThe movie was great in all but the story caught me by surprise. I loved\nthe action and the special effects but it got me kind of confused about\nthe mandarin villain and seeing Tony Stark blow up all his suits at the\nend. It was different from the other iron man movies and that was what\ni liked about it. I was amazed how they tried to relate the avengers to\nthe movie and telling you all that Tony's been through. The iron\npatriot was a perfect idea to put in this film and seeing Tony with a\nnew iron man suit. It felt pretty intense at some parts of the film and\ni think that's what made all the difference because the last two films\ndidn't feel as seriously intense as this film. It makes you think at\nthe end Tony doesn't want to be a hero anymore but something tells me\nhe will return. That's definitely making me look forward to the\nAvengers 2. Overall it was a great movie and especially for Marvel\nfans.\n"
"\nPersonally I didn't like any of Ironman movies much, first one was\npretty interesting.<br><br>Then there was second one that went beyond boundaries mixing all the\nstuff together so viewer couldn't understand at all. Great effects\nthough.<br><br>Then this third one, too much explosions and such boring stuff, too\nmuch ideas and all but still... Acting was very good, directing also,\nmostly I didn't like that it was two hours or something like that.<br><br>Very nice ending for trilogy I think. Very much CGI and all but it kind\nof not bothered me. Well done, maybe little character stuff too much.\nBut liked it somehow, few times I almost slept and there were issues\nwhich made movie more watchable.<br><br>8/10 for great directing etc. Script didn't quite catch me.\n"
"\nif you've seen the previous iron man movies this is a must see to the\nsequels before it. great movie wicked sick action, and as always tony\n(Robert Downey Jr.) delivered an amazing show with spectacular\nincitement into the life of playboy, billionaire, and therapist. great\nmovie with thrilling ending. overall Robert made an excellent role come\ntrue and aspire but yet again in this re-producing film. in the movie\nyour seen with tony struggling to adapt to his new life after the\nfeature duo film with great role characters Captain America, Hulk,\nHawkeye, black widow, and God of thunder Thor, known as Avengers. Tony\ndoes so with his new suit and new armoured iron men.\n"
"\nI am a big fan of Marvel and have seen all their movies. I enjoyed Iron\nMan 1 and 2 but this one disappointed me. It looked promising at first\nbut then came the flaws: <br><br>The Mandarin wasn't in the whole movie. He just appeared on TV talking\nabout destruction. In the end of the movie they make Aldrich say he is\nThe Mandarin which is stupid because the guy isn't even Asian or have\nthe rings on. Why mess up one of the greatest Iron Man antagonist?<br><br>They renamed War Machine to Iron Patriot and made his suit look almost\nlike Captain America's costume. They also didn't have War Machine\nappear, only Rhodes which bothered me because I was hoping to see Iron\nMan and War Machine in action.<br><br>A majority of the movie didn't even involve Tony in the Iron Man suit.\nMostly Tony just shooting guns and making weapons from stuff he got\nfrom a hardware store. The movie should have been called Tony Stark.<br><br>So if you want to watch it just keep that stuff in mind and don't get\nyour hopes up from the lies the trailer showed you.\n"
"\nI really looked forward to seeing how Iron Man would deal with his next\nenemy...with all his fine art battling skills, his always one step\nahead science and most of all...being very smart and unbeatable...just\nlike in The Avengers.<br><br>After seeing Iron Man 3 I was left with an awkward question: Now where\nwas Iron Man?<br><br>Spoiler Alert below! --------------------<br><br>Thruout the movie Tony Stark is busy finding out who his enemy is and\ndoesn't need Iron Man for that...only to find out in the end that, when\nfinally in action, he cannot beat his enemy himself.<br><br>I was expecting Iron Man...IRON MAN..That bright smart scientist, that\nunbeatable super action hero you don't want to mess around with...just\nlike in The Avengers...and then even some more!<br><br>Well...let's hope Iron Man will return in full glory in The Avengers 2.<br><br>By the way, Robert Downey Jr. is still perfect as Iron Man! Compliments\nto him. The poor script is the issue.\n"
"\nIt's a good action movie BUT oh my god, the \"twist\" completely ruined\nit in my opinion. How could they do THAT?? Don't get me wrong, it's\ngreat acting all over but it's a huge letdown for IM fans.<br><br>What a waste of potential after casting Sir Ben Kingsley (whom I am\nvery fond of). Unforgivable, period. <br><br>Comparable only to the Lost finale, ouch. Shame on you Drew Pearce and\nShane Black! You should be arrested for that one, tight scheduled,\ncould't think of a better script? I don't get it,it is plain wrong,\nvery disrespectful to the true fans <br><br>- Go work with Damon Lindelof!!!!\n"
"\nIron Man 3 is the typical loud, pointless third chapter in a superhero\ntrilogy. Why oh why do they throw everything but the kitchen sink at\nyou and expect it to work? Especially galling is the writers borrow\nfrom the Dark Knight Rises (phew) putting the superhero's alter ego on\ncamera for 70% of the movie. Then there's the business of everybody\ngets to wear the Iron Man suit, which dilutes and cheapens the whole\npremise. As soon as the bad guy or his minions smash the armor to the\npoint of non-operation, another suit flies out of the sky and clamps\nitself to the hero, or the hero's girlfriend, or his buddy, or the\npaperboy if he's nearby. Finally, the villain is ...well, I won't spoil\nit if you haven't seen it. In the early comics the Mandarin was Iron\nMan's Luthor or Dr. Doom, his main nemesis. This movie portrayal is an\noutrage. Even the Stan Lee cameo was not good and over in a blink of an\neye. On the plus side, Gwyneth Paltrow is gorgeous.\n"
"\nI'll try not to spoil it too much.<br><br>So, it takes place after the Avengers movie. Sure, it had a lot more\nSci-Fi stuff like aliens, hulks, etc, but Iron Man 3 just didn't have\nto take the same path.<br><br>The enemy Stark faces is somewhat \"overpowered\" and have some super\nhuge powers. I'd expect a more complex, secret, dark one instead. It\nwent a bit off reality and it seemed weird, at least.<br><br>It's a half action-packed movie. I was expecting more, as a follow up\nof the Iron Man 2 film. In the middle of the picture, it kind of slows\ndown the beating.<br><br>One other negative aspect was a half depressed Tony Stark for the first\ntwo thirds of the picture.<br><br>The humorous scenes have increased in this movie, which to me is the\nsingle remarkable positive aspect of it.\n"
"\nOkay,I checked out the long anticipated IRON Man 3 and I gotta be\nhonest, I wasn't impressed! It started slow and then it only got\nslower! Because of the leisurely pace my movie partner crashed before\nhalf time!! I purchased 3D because everything else was sold out! It was\nseriously 3D at the beginning but became a regular movie early in,\nabout ¾'s of the movie was not 3D. The story was Okay, **Spoiler**\nMandarin wasn't even Mandarin! I give it a \"6\" and the Codec wasn't\neven worth wait'n for!....... I'm not surprised by Ironman 3's big box\noffice opening. All the places and times I tried to get tickets to were\nsold out.My main issues are with (1) the slower than normal story line\nand (2)the scheme to use the Mandarin to pull in Ironman fans and (3)\nthe high price for 20minutes of 3D!\n"
"\nOK I think this followed the Jurassic park thing where the first one\nwas spectacular, the second one sucked and the third was better than\nthe second, but not quite on par with the first.<br><br>That is how I felt, I mean RDJ does great as the still ego filled\nmillionaire who is iron man. He still plays it likabley. The other\nactors do good as well, and though I was angry at first that mandarine\nwas not being played by a Chinese guy at first, the twist ending does\nmake up for it. I actually thought the twist at the end was funny, and\nmade sense honestly. <br><br>The action was great it was nice to see more war machine having more\nchances to fight. And the last fight at the end was a little confusing,\nyou would know what I mean if you saw it, but it was also WOW.\n"
"\ni walked into this movie expecting a lot, and i walked out very\ndisappointed. this movie is terrible. I would not recommend it, it was\njust plain bad. although the cgi and animation was great, the plot the\nacting and the stupid corny jokes just ruin the film. iron mans armor\nfalls apart all the time. and if tony can just call s robot and make an\narmy of iron man suits attack the extremist soldiers. why on earth is\ntony stark iron man anyway. if he could to that the whole time why even\nhave tony in the suit. god and the whole mandarin not being the villain\nand having Killian be the villain, was so expected. not a good plot\nreveal.and pepper killing Killian was also really dumb and completely\nshut done any chance this movie had of being any good it also ruined\niron man its like trying to be so feminist but really it ruins the\nsuperhero motive. this movie sucked.\n"
"\nWell I can't say the movie was very good but yes it keeps you\nentertained the Robert Downie Jr way. It has just the amount of action\nand they have managed to add the laughing scenes.<br><br>The script has nothing new but the way they have presented it is\ndifferent, Stark is amazing and Guy Pearce is just cool, every actor\nhas done a fab job and director keeps you on the edge of adrenalin\nrush.<br><br>Too good of a action movie and yes they have learned to make a suitable\nand longer climax for this one than the other 2.<br><br>Over all the movie was good but I expected more. I give it a 8.\n"
"\nI just got home from seeing this film and I have to say while it is\nmiles better then the second movie it really was not a great movie. I\nfelt there were a lot of plot holes. Now I do think its worth stating\nthat all super hero movies have plot holes but this one more than most.\nIn this movie it seemed like they focused on one thing he can do with\nsuit ( make it come to him) he did this about 10 times in the movie.\nThis focus made the other \"powers\" of the suit fade into the back.\nAnother point I feel the need to share is they didn't go into the\nantidote enough and all the sudden he breaths fire!!!??? Was just crazy\nand out of no where I think a lot of explaining is needed for the\nantidote. To sum up this movie had plenty of plot holes, too many bad\nguys to care, didn't make sense and didn't explain enough but was\nentertaining to watch I think a solid 6 is a generous.\n"
"\nthe main problem with the movie is the time it takes the film to build\nput to the end, don't get me wrong the end is good great action but its\nnot put to the £6 ticket price people. how ever the humor in the film\nis great but does take over the drama of the film in places.like in\niron man 1 however you spend more time is tony himself out of the suit\nrather than \"iron man\", which does work for the film but you do miss\nthe action of the suit any now and again specially when the film slow's\ndown. <br><br>last the end; if u are a iron man law fan then you will walk out done\nwith the film, but with your not that u can take the ending and move\non.<br><br>ps wait for the end of the film :) ·\n"
"\nUsually Marvel super-hero movies are good, and I like them all. Iron\nMan 3 was something I was looking for both because it is the first\nmovie after Avengers in Marvel's universe and because I liked the\nprevious 2 Iron Man movies.<br><br>I am not yet sure if my expectations were to high, or just misplaced,\nor this movie managed to actually be boring. Special effects were\nperfect as usual, 3D was acceptable but not that good, but the story\nand the action... well they were boring. When the movie finished I\nthought it was a 3 hours movie just to realize it was less than 2 hours\nlong.<br><br>Does it deserve to be seen? Absolutely. But keep your expectations low,\nit may help.<br><br>Finally I gave this movie a 6/10, and I personally think it was the\nworst modern-day Marvel movie (including Thor, Avengers, Captain\nAmerica, Hulk, and whatever I can't remember right now).<br><br>Looking forward to Thor 2. I hope it will be better.\n"
"\nThe Movie is just not good. I was not happy with it. It got too much\nmoney. All the awards it got nominated for and Money it got was just\nnot cool. Fans Hated it. I did too. I was just plain upset about what\nhappen to the Maderin. Marvel ruin a character who could have been just\nas popular as The Joker or Loki. Look at the trailers. It looks like\nits going to have a Dark tone. When you see the movie, it has Waaaaaaay\nto much comedy. I could not understand it well because so many people\nwere just laughing and I could not hear. Plus people were laughing at\nstuff that were not even funny. These girls behind me were just plain\nannoying laughing win nothing funny just been said. Also I was not\nhappy with War Machine not keeping his old suit. Its overrated and\nignore the credits. 3/10\n"
"\nThe movie was a disaster.I am not an Iron man fan but i enjoyed the\nfirst two movies.This one is a mess and didn't have a point.Endless\njokes,unnecessary scenes,way too much Tony Stark and the list goes\non.It was like watching a movie making fun of a superhero.<br><br>1)The plot was bad. 2)Pepper...really?I like female characters who can\nhandle themselves but that was completely ridiculous.I didn't know if i\nshould laugh or cry.Maybe both. 3)The twist-BIG disappointment.I was\nfurious. 4)final fight-It seems to me they tried to make the worst\nfinal movie confrontation in history.They nearly succeeded. 5)I feel\nbad for Ben Kingsley because he is a great actor and deserves better.<br><br>Avoid it if you are not a fan. Avoid it if you are a fan. Actually i\ncan't think of any logical reason(besides boredom)to watch this movie.\nI give it 3 stars because of the actor performances.\n"
"\nI find movies to be constantly going downhill, iron man's trilogy has\ngone from bad to awful. Robert Downey Jr's awful portrayal of iron man\nthrough his arrogant, simply irritating nature and the lack of\nchemistry he and Gwyneth paltrow have together all blend together to\nmake one very mind blowingly average film. its boring, its cheesy and\nits predictable. its just plain poor. is it really too much to ask for\na marvel film that in some way challenges the superhero series of\nbatman? because at this point its out of hand, maybe the bar has just\nbeen set to such a high standard by the batman series that anything\nelse just fails to match up, but they could at least make an effort.\nvery much struggling to find anything positive to say about this movie,\nin some of these types of movies you could at least push for some good\naction scenes to somewhat disguise a horrible storyline and an even\nworse script but it lacked even that basic need for a good superhero\nfilm. don't start to watch it, you could spend 130 mins doing about\n130,000 better things.\n"
"\nThis is not an Iron Man movie. Tony is in the suit for maybe 15 mins\ntops. Most of the movie is slapstick and RJD throwing out one liners.\nThere are so many things wrong with the movie. No building tension as\nnone of the attacks are on screen. You only see the one incident at the\ntheatre caused by Happy. It would have been better to see escalating\nattacks around the globe and a building threat. The Mandarin was a\ntotal throw away after building up the Ten Rings over 2 movies. Maya\nwas a wasted character. She would have been interesting had she been\nTonys first love who came back and caused friction between him and\nPepper. Instead she was a one night stand and there was no emotional\nweight to her heel turn. It was ridiculous that Tony had 40 sets of\narmor but the only one available to him during the attack on his house\nwas an experimental model that didn't work. In addition he then spends\nthe next hour of the movie investigating without functioning armor.\nReally? He has no armor at Stark Tower? Very disappointing movie.\n"
"\nWhen they made the first Iron Man, i was like \"Man! They have to make\nmore.\" Then they made Iron Man 2. It wasn't a bad movie it was just not\nup to (or close to) the first movie's standards. Well my friends, the\nthird was not as good as Iron Man (1), but it was up there. I feel like\nIron Man 3 is at least the second best in the trilogy. As far as making\nthe film goes,(not gonna spoil anything) look out for all the\nforeshadowing. You will also be hit with a little comedy. Kind of like\nall the Iron Man movies. There isn't much I can say about Iron Man 3. I\ndid like the action sense of the movie. I did contain a lot of action\nand it did live up to it's title of being an action movie. Also like\nthe first one. Throughout all the Iron Man films, Robert Downey Jr.'s\nTony Stark was always my favorite actor. I cannot say the same for 3.\nGwendolyn Paltron's Pepper Pots was mine in this one. She acted very\nwell. Overall, Iron Man 3 was a good movie that is most definitely a\nmovie worth watching. However, it still can't beat the first.\n"
"\nTrailers usually indicate or show the movie in summary. How sad that\nthe brilliant trailer was made so well that the movie was a big\nlet-down.<br><br>PROS: <br><br>1. Tony Stark and Pepper Potts <br><br>2. Happy Hogan and Downtown Abbey<br><br>3. Tony Stark and James Rhodes <br><br>4. Plane rescue <br><br>5. The Tennessee kid (yeah I liked it) <br><br>CONS: <br><br>1. The Mandarin. 'nuff said. <br><br>2. The Lego-Iron Army <br><br>3. The villain's non-motivation <br><br>4. Wasting Rebecca Hall and Ben Kingsley's talents <br><br>Lastly, nothing ends a disappointing film like a disappointing scene at\nthe end of the end-credits. The brilliance of the past Marvel movies\nwas that the extra scene left me excited for the next movie. This scene\nwas like a slap in the face after being punched in the gut by the movie\nvillain reveal.\n"
"\nIf the teasers make you incredibly curious about this movie, I would\nsay you were right. At first, when I watched the trailers I was pretty\nexcited to go see it. However, the movie was a failure. Fight scenes\nwere so complicated, at least in 3D, to catch up. Even the scenes were\nblur and you wouldn't understand who was doing what. The best fight\nscene was the last one where Iron Man suits were teared apart. The\nstoryline, was also a stupid idea for Iron Man. Firemen around, what\nthe hack seriously? Oh, girls looked pretty hot with their fire\nabilities, but there were only 2 of them so it is still a waste of time\nto watch. I think, this would be the worst to publish as Iron Man 3.\n"
"\nThis review may contain spoilers.<br><br>Iron Man 3 is an excellent movie in terms of its visual effects and is\nonly enhanced by 3D. However, for me, this was the best part on the\nfilm. Although the plot is fundamentally decent, I did not feel\nfulfilled or satisfied after watching Iron Man 3. In terms of story, I\nwould probably rather watch IM 2 again.<br><br>Why? Although the extremis idea is good, the ending is awful and the\nsuits are treated like disposable water bottles, being repeatedly\ndestroyed. Moreover, the fact that Stark destroys all his suits and\nremoves his arc reactor just makes me want to scream in frustration.<br><br>Overall 6/10 for the high quality craftsmanship and the basic but\nflawed plot. In my opinion MARVEL has just ruined the Iron Man series.\n"
"\nOf all the ridiculous mistakes they made, the one that is unforgivable\nis why they needed to blow up Aldrich Killian twice? He was blown up in\nthe Iron Man suit. Vaporized. And then...he wasn't. Pepper Potts has to\npull an Underworld/Resident Evil maneuver and kick a grenade at him and\nblow him up again. How cheap.<br><br>I gave 4 stars for the CGI and the airplane scene. There was so much\nother stuff that stunk like Rhodey not even trying to save himself.\nYou're the Iron Patriot for chrissakes. Maybe they should put a Marine\nin that suit. Stark finds a 10 year old who acts like he's 35.<br><br>Last but not least: the most accomplished actor in this movie is\nreduced to playing Keanu Reeves from Bill and Teds Excellent Adventure.\nThat dude is KNIGHTED. SIR Ben Kingsley. You don't waste that kind of\ntalent!\n"
"\nWell there was a few awesome action scenes! ... However, there was a\nbit too much of \"Just Tony\". The McGyver bit was over the top... The\nbroken down suit got old fast....<br><br>That was not the Mandarin. In all fairness the bad guy was cool however\nhe was still not the Mandarin. I'm a bit surprised that Marvel signed\noff on this. Did Stan Lee sell out? Also I don;t recall the Stan Lee\ncameo now that I think of it.<br><br>I would say Iron Man 2 was my favorite, then Iron Man 1 is in second\nplace and this one pulling up the rear. <br><br>It was a fun watch but once was enough, I won't be adding this to my\nBluRay collection.\n"
"\nI guess I just hate female characters in Marvel movies. They just\nconstantly get in the way and never die even if they should. I know\nthat Robert Downey Jr enjoys playing his quirky Tony Stark but this\nmovie showcased that quirkiness way too much (i.e. the second, third\nand fourth Pirates make the same mistake for Johnny Depp). The story\nhad a nice setup and the action was of course first rate, but it just\nto me falls flat because some of the story elements that didn't fit\ntogether. If you're going to have the main character have angst about\nsomething then at least explain more thoroughly what he has angst about\nand then allow him to work through that in the end. This movie\nintroduces Tony's anxieties but really they don't make any sense and he\ndoesn't really resolve them in the end. I also really didn't care for\nthe great reveal of Ben Kingsley's character, why too cartoony and\ndumb. So all in all OK but not great. Hope they bring the avengers back\nsoon and I'm personally waiting for Thor cause he and Loki are a much\nbetter team than Tony Stark and Rhodie.\n"
"\nIron Man 3 was such a waste of my money. I went to watch the movie\nbecause of Sir Ben but was disappointed. The movie is poorly directed,\nit has cheesy jokes which I found really unfunny. <br><br>If you are going to watch this movie because of the 'super awesome'\ntrailer, you are going to waste your money and your time. Believe me,\nthe movie sucks. Robert Downey Jr. played his part and it was really\nexcellent, Guy Pearce's acting hardly made an impression of a villain.\nThe movie is more of a comedy movie than an action movie. The movie's\nreally good for small kids. If this is an end of the Iron Man trilogy,\nit's a rather disappointing end.\n"
"\nThe suit breaks way too much in iron Man 3 it is as if the writers and\ndirector never saw the previous iron man movies or the avengers. Tony\nStark is only in his suit about 10 min. in the whole movie and every\ntime he puts on a suit it is broken off in about 5 seconds. A truck is\nable to completely knock the suit off in this movie and a little boy is\nable to pull of the finger of the suit. In the previous iron man movies\nit shows the supremacy of the iron man suit by being hit by a missile\nand not having a mark, being hit by Thor's mighty hammer and THors\nlightening and withstanding the damage as well as a long fight against\nalien creatures in the Avengers. It was if the suit was made of plastic\nin iron man 3 it was ripped off so easily. I think he went through at\nleast 40 suits in the movie.\n"
"\nVery good movie!!!!! Most people on here ripping the movie seem to be\nthe comic book geeks who were upset that the mandarin was not portrayed\nas he was in the comic books!! One person was upset that they didn't\ndisplay his \"ten rings\"....really?? Sorry they didn't have Tony \"in his\nsuit enough\"! I enjoyed how they displayed Tony as vulnerable! Yes he\ndoes have anxiety attacks---and he can overcome them within a few\nminutes .....in response to another person on here who said that\nanxiety attacks could not resolve so quickly!!! The reviews and\ncomplaints about the movie on here is comical!!! Great movie Great\nmovie\n"
"\nJust saw Iron Man 3 . . . what a snore fest . . . Iron Man 2 and even 1\nis better. From the director the brought us 'Kiss, Kiss, Bang, Bang!' -\nwhat you have never heard of it? No worries hardly no one has. While\n'Kiss, Kiss, Bang, Bang!' is in itself a great art-house movie, why in\nthe world would they give such an important franchise into the hands of\na novice in the action/adventure flick? Oye! Would have rather have the\nJohn Favalora directing rather than Shane Black . . . he is a better\nwriter than a director. And if it was not for the cinematography of\nJohn Toll the movie would have been flat. If it was not for the saving\ngrace of cinematography the movie would not have as successful. So why\nis the movie make insanely large amount of money at the box office, not\nto mention all of the DVD, Blu Ray, toys, Video Games and merchandising\nand licensing. Because of all of the hype that it got from the other\ntwo Iron Man movies and Avengers and Thor movies.\n"
"\nLets start by describing this flick with one word... an absolute\nDISAPPOINTMENT. The movie stayed true to its origin with strong action\nscenes and special effects with peppered in comic relief, although, it\ncame off more as a comedy than an action film. Kids will love this\nmovie none the less, but anyone over the age of 10 who has any taste in\ngood movies will agree this movie was a let down to the series and\nmarvel especially. The story line was terrible, and in no way stays\ntrue to the comic series involving the Mandarin. This movie had all the\npotential in the world and fell short in every category. My suggestion\nis save your money, and if you enjoyed 1 &amp; 2 as much as I did avoid\nruining the entire franchise by not watching this movie.\n"
"\nWe start the movie with 'blue' song which maybe done to give us a clue\nas where this movie stands however, the subject gets too serious too\nquickly, with the bombings, the people vaporizing... It gets really\nhard to find a joke in it. then as we learn how these bombings happen,\nwe don't believe it, it can not happen in the real world. The odd thing\nis the movie realizes this in the second half of the movie and mocks it\nself. it turns into a full on comedy mode. it is really hard to find\nany seriousness any darkness in the story line. I appreciate that Shane\nBlack mocks the formula every other movie uses(which is dark knight\nformula) what I don't appreciate that he does this through iron man\nfranchise. <br><br>If you are hard core fan of Robert D. Jr. you should go and see this\nmovie. Otherwise I suggest you wait for the DVD, or just watch it for\nthe laughs.\n"
"\nTo start this off this movie was alright tin my opinion but does not\ndeserve it's current ranking on IMDb. There was just too many plot\nholes and unanswered questions for me to like this movie. <br><br>Starting off with the main \"villain\" The Mandarin, turned out to pretty\nmuch be a joke, as much as i love Ben Kingsley, i hated his role in\nthis, The Mandarin was supposed to be iron mans arch nemesis, not guy\npierces character. I hated the whole extremist storyline which pretty\nmuch left with more questions than answers. i also hated how iron mans\nsuits were apparently made out of tin foil in this movie, with those\nextremist just cutting through them like butter. Thors hammer and\nlighting could barely scratch his armor and these guys can just rip\nthrough them? a joke to my eyes. <br><br>Other then that RDJ's acting was good, great special effects. but this\nhad more of a dark feeling, not consistent with the other marvel\nmovies. Also i thought the scene at the end would have to deal with\nmore phase 2 of the avengers, but i guess not.\n"
"\nKeeping it short and sweet, 'Iron Man 3' does not live up to the\nstandard the first two Marvel creations paved over the last five years.\nJohn Favreau's replacement director, Shane Black took the reigns on the\nthird installment and Marvel clearly provided him freedom within its\ncreation. While the action holds up, fun choreography blended with\nTony's new tech there are some major plot holes. Over the years Stark's\nsuits (MK 7-8) have endured encounters with: Thor the God of Thunder,\nIvan Vanko's reigns of lightning...oh and a trip through a worm hole\nwhilst battling the alien race, Chtauri. These old suit model types are\noutdated and yet his MK 47 in IM3 cannot withstand the heat from Guy\nPearce's poorly explained fire-henchman. This, I just cannot\nunderstand.<br><br>For me this was a disappointing end to the Stark/Iron Man legacy.\nFavreau should have held the torch til the end. This movie will receive\nsome very varied reviews, no doubt. Hell, I'll watch it again just for\nthe entertainment and good chuckles.<br><br>6/10.\n"
