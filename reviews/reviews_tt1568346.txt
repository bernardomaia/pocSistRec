"\nI cannot see how all the Hollywood money was used? I must have been the\nmost expensive removal of subtitles in the history. Camera and light\nfelt a bit better than the Swedish original version, but the end result\nfelt too similar to the previous one. I also questioning reviews'\nsanity when they claim 'Rooney for Oscar' - she did nothing out of\nexpected performance - in my opinion. Still the movie is better than\ngeneral Hollywood movies, where 'actors' only scream f**k to each\nother.<br><br>The story around rapist Nils Bjurman was probably the poorest part, it\nmade a flat impression, perhaps because of the scenes coming to close\nto each other 'First forced oral ... a few minutes ...then rape ... a\nfew minutes ... then revenge'. in the Swedish version, and in the book,\nmore happened with the character between these scenes. It should have\nscored six but I feel the failure of keeping up to the expectations\nreduce it one score.\n"
"\nThe Girl with the Dragon Tattoo just adds to the list of crummy\nAmerican remakes. First of all, what is with the opening credits? Are\nwe watching a James Bond movie? Just because Daniel Craig is in it? The\nopening credits are completely disconnected from the rest of the film.<br><br>Then the accents are entirely messed up. Daniel Craig kept turning on\nand off a \"Swedish\" accent and then mixing it with his real accent.\nHowever, I think Craig made a good Blomkvist in the end.<br><br>Noomi Rapace is a far better fit for Lisbeth than Rooney Mara. Mara is\njust not as convincing in her character portrayal. I lost count of the\nnumber of times I had to see her naked during the film. This is what\nreally cheapens the movie for me. The nudity in the Swedish version is\ntasteful, this film is anything but tasteful. And I'm not complaining\nabout the rape scenes, those are important plot points to the films and\nbooks. However, unnecessary nudity is entirely pathetic. Mara's accent\nis bizarre too, it sounds like she has no nose.<br><br>Please don't make the other two, just..don't.\n"
"\nDavid Fincher's adaptation of the Stieg Larsson novel is an\nembarrassment. Fincher manages to reveal all the wrong details at all\nthe wrong moments, effectively destroying any mystery or suspense to\nthe story of the missing girl. Which, despite being the center of the\nbook, is merely glossed over and instead we get unnecessarily graphic\nrape/sex scenes and a jumbled storyline. Nearly the entire cast give\nsub-par performances, particularly the main character. Mara Rooney\ncouldn't be less believable as Salander. It was garbage. I can't\nbelieve this unoriginal piece of trash managed to get nominated for\nmultiple Oscars. What a shame.\n"
"\nI was thrilled when I heard that this wonderful book, translated from\nthe original Swedish, would be made into a movie. My husband and I both\nwere fans from the get go. I expected some omissions and can forgive\nthe omission of Blomkvist's affair with Cecilia, but cannot forgive the\nchange in the end of the story ... another Hollywood thinks they are\nbetter than the author fiasco. Why oh why does this happen to all great\nbooks? Why do they have to dumb it down? Of course, they will make\nanother and another. How will they screw with the next two? One can\nonly imagine. I do however recommend you see it. Make sure you wear a\nsweater, it is cold throughout most of the movie and it is winter you\nknow.\n"
"\nI really was hyped too see this as David Fincher is one of my favorite\ndirectors, but this movie seemed pretty unnecessary to me.<br><br>The movie is pretty much a re-thread of the Swedish movie same plot,\nexcept that the ending dragged on more than the Swedish movie.<br><br>Rooney Mara is good as Lisbeth and so is Craig as Blomkvist but they\ndon't have the chemistry that the actors in the Swedish movie have.<br><br>The dialog seems pretty forced at times and I think this movie might\nhave been better if it have been set in the UK or in the US, instead of\nhaving mostly British/American actors speak with awful accents.<br><br>My biggest question is why does this movie even exist it is completely\nunnecessary.<br><br>This movie falls in the same trap as many Hollywood adapted movies, it\nbuilds up a more hype and falls flat.<br><br>My verdict if you have not seen it go see the Swedish version, it's way\nmore stronger as a whole.\n"
"\nThe main story of the movie, at least based on screen-time and\nstoryline, is discovering the killer in a supposed murder committed 40\nyears ago, however there's a lot of time dedicated to Lizabeth's life\nthat leads to nothing, especially the ugly rape scenes, that after\nseeing the ending of the movie, I found completely irrelevant to the\nstory, if the idea was to show her past and all the mess that was her\nlife, a couple of minutes of a review of her files would have been\nenough.<br><br>Some of the reviews that I have read claim that on the book, Lizabeth's\nlife and his will to make a stand against violence against women was\nthe main story of the movie, if that's the case then the director made\na mess of the story and the movie is worst than I have rated it,\nbecause there's no way to get to that conclusion after watching it.<br><br>Also I still don't get the first ten minutes of paint and Trent\nReznor's music, totally out of place.\n"
"\nWatching Fincher's remake was so much like deja vu that I wondered if\nthe director had simply employed CGI artists to superimpose American\nand English faces over Swedish ones. I also wondered how Hollywood gets\naway with this level of grotesque artistic plagiarism. Niels Arden\nOplov must surely be outraged because this is more his film than\nFincher's. This is a remake with absolutely no creative effort put\nin-except for those appallingly unnecessary and unconvincing\nfaux-Swedish accents. Why even bother? All I can think is Fincher was\nunder contract to make his film identical to Oplov's, but using English\nlanguage.\n"
"\nfirst, it's a really really good movie<br><br>second, it's absolutely useless with the only purpose to satisfy David\nFincher's ego and greed for money and the all American need to own\neverything.<br><br>a remake just after two years of a fan/critics praised original? and\nnothing is changed but the actors?<br><br>the swedes speak English now, with some weird accent? authenticity???<br><br>also the title character is seriously underdeveloped just like the\nemotional connection with the male lead protagonist. <br><br>I said its a really really good movie but hence the above stated\nrating:3\n"
"\nI was excited to see Finches version of this fine movie. I was\nextremely disappointed after watching it. The acting was good...but I\nmust say the script treatment was not as sophisticated as the original.\nIt seemed not as smooth as the original and a bit forced in some places\nto get the story to flow faster. It suffers from the same sickness as\nmost Hollywood remakes of already good movies...the sacrifice details\nin favor of shock, but such is the stuff of McMovieland. Everything\nabout the movie was acceptable and on par with the original EXCEPT for\nthe script treatment. You remember Let the Right One In? Hollywood\nremade that one too and to me it sucked compared to the original. Both\nremakes lack the ability to emotionally connect me to the characters\nand their goals. A bit clinically and technically treated, as though\nsomeone was in a big hurry to capitalize on the Tattoo series' success.\nShame on Hollywood.\n"
"\nIf you are going to watch The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo film, watch\nthe Swedish version that came out in 2009. The Swedish version is much\nbetter, with a good plot development and character development. If you\ngo for the U.S. version expect to be bombarded by Coca-Cola and\nMcDonald product placement. It's pathetic that U.S. audiences have to\nendure all this advertising. The U.S. version also seemed to add all\nthe very violent and sexually-exploitive scene without developing the\nplot. The Swedish version has better suspense. Also the U.S. version\ndid a horrible job of developing the story of Harriet. In the end I\ncan't believe I paid money to see this movie again, as the U.S. version\nwas truly of lesser quality than the Swedish version. Also the U.S.\nversion was a bit less gory and sexually explicit.\n"
"\nI have read the book and was really looking forward to seeing the film.\nI was pondering between choosing the American or Swedish version. In\nthe end I opted for the American. I have quite liked the book;\nunfortunately, the same cannot be said about the film. The first thing\nwhich really annoyed me was the fake Swedish accent. It was horrible\nand it made me switch on the subtitles. I know that it is impossible to\nhave in the film everything that was in the book; however, some very\nimportant things were left out. As a result, Mikael &amp; Lisbeth look\nrather shallow. They are there, they do things but the viewers do not\nreally know why. Actually, just like all the other characters. Also,\nsome things were completely different from the book (not just slightly)\nand it did not help the film. I do not understand how this film got\nsuch good reviews. I just hope the Swedish version is better. Although,\nnow, I'm not quite sure I want to watch it.\n"
"\nHaving just seen the film I am at a loss as to why so many critics have\ngiven it a positive review.<br><br>I hated the product placement........Rooney Mara was way out of her\ndepth.............the script buried the story with a who's-who of the\nfamily........it also included some of the original book's sub-plots\n(which the Swedish version quite rightly left out)...I thought the\n'jokey' chat between Lisbeth and Mikael laboured............the title\nsequence would have been better attached to an 'Alien 5'...I could go\non..as for the changed end, actually I missed it as I walked out while\nLisbeth and Mikael were following someones computer activity....another\nattempt at humour (Amazon,Solitaire) (I have seen the original\n(Extended Version) and can honestly say that it is far better.)<br><br>PS 04/01/2012 Watched the original again tonight....No contest :-)\n"
"\nDavid Fincher. 30-second spots strung together for 2 1/2 hours. As much\nas I love a beautiful scene, a quick, clever edit and Trent Reznor's\nedgy sounds all separate from each other, these elements together are\nnot the way to tell this story  a complex one at that. Because today's\nyouth, and by extension their parents, are so enamored with anything\nthat is \"quick,\" it has to be revered as a work of genius?<br><br>Fast-cut MTV-style editing, like fast talking, does not make something\ngood. Just because you, audience, could not follow entire sections of\nthe plot doesn't make you dumb. It makes the director dumb.<br><br>I give it a \"3\" for raw techniques, music, albeit totally misplaced and\ngratuitous. And a good performance by Rooney Mara.\n"
"\nThe sound, and music are without doubt the worst my wife and I have had\nto endure in any motion picture foreign or domestic. The so called\nsuspense sounds are ridiculously ineffective. The noise, so called\nmusic, distract from the dialog, making it impossible to hear in some\ninstances. Evidently actors no longer find it necessary to speak\ndistinctly. Surely they weren't taught that in their training. It has\nbecome the norm to mumble, and slur words,particularly when speaking\nsoftly. Scenes with \"whispering\" are totally incoherent. A few years\nago we attended the holiday concert of a 200 +/- man chorus in Boston.\nOne of the pieces was totally pianissimo. You could understand every\nword. No excuse for lack of diction, nor in the noise blotting out\nspeech. The foreign / Swedish version was infinitely better.\n"
"\nThe original \"Men som hatar kvinnor\" movie was more suitable for the\nplot, because the writer did write it in Swedish NOT in English. From\nthe beginning when the rumors of a English version of \"Men som hatar\nkvinnor\". I thought to myself: Is Hollywood out of idea, for a movie?\nWhy most they ruin a good book and a good movie? I know that I had to\nsee this movie, because I am such a huge fan of the original. The movie\nstarted by giving me a feeling like I was watching a James Bond movie.\nAll the characters, places and things was in Swedish of course, that\nmade the movie fake because they spoke English throughout the whole\nmovie. This movie was a disappointment for me. I suggest that you buy\nor rent the Swedish movie \"Men som hatar kvinnor\" and watch it. I hope\nthey don't make the second movie at all.\n"
"\nwell well i thought that after destroying Let the right one in (Låt den\nRätte Komma in) by making such a s**t remake Hollywood won't do it\nsimilar things anymore but they had to like always they need to destroy\nthings <br><br>Girl with dragon tattoo (Män Som Hatar Kvinnor) is great movie, great\nacting and directing everything, so David Fincher thought he can earn\nso made re-make of the same movie with same story just with Hollywood\nstars who honestly sucked in this, special girl who acted Lisbeth she\nain't up knees to Noomi Rapace who did same role in original, <br><br>anyway this is one more tragedy that come from united states of\nHollywood from directors who don't have anymore ideas so they are\nstealing from others and when u doing a re-make you need to do it\nbetter if u can't get the f*** of it,,,,,,,, <br><br>if u really wanna do favor to people don't do other two from trilogy\n"
"\nthe original version of the girl with the dragon tattoo (2009) was the\nbest movie. Noomi Rapace was and still is the better actress. plus why\nis it, that the American version of Lisbeth Salanderthe is so dirty and\nfilthy. in the original film she was clean and nice. yes she had\ntattoos and a Mohawk hair stile and body piercing but she was very\nclean and intelligent and nice. But, the American version totally made\nher look like a slut, prostitute. Americans stereotyping people. Even\nDaniel Craig should have declined this role he is not better than\nMichael Nyqvist actually, Michael Nyqvist is better than he is. People\ngo get the original 2009 version of the movie on DVD. that is the only\none must see version.\n"
"\nI watched The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo last night for the first time\nand....well...what am I missing? Long, slow, boring really. Granted it\nwas network TV so I'm guessing I watched a very edited version, but\nstill, I can't see what all the fuss was about. Daniel Craig was his\nusual flat self (missing what all the fuss is about him too but I'll\nsave that for another time.) Rooney Mara did an OK job as Lisbeth I\nsuppose, but I thought I'd be watching a much more seething, angry,\ndangerous character. Disappointing is the only word I can think of to\ndescribe the film. Now I have to admit I did not read the book (yet-\nbut I've got it right here) and did not see the original version (yet).\nBut I have to guess the cut scenes must have added a lot of impact to\nthe movie because what I watched was a fairly bland, not very\ninteresting, overly long, disappointing effort.\n"
"\nI am a big fan of David Fincher's movies but this one,Not a winner for\nDavid Fincher. Roony Mara - no match for Nooami Rapace. Not to blame\nher as an actor but the way , the main character was portrait was\ndisappointing. The make up and hair styling was to make fun of her.\nGothic look was incomplete.. missed the Black lipstick, The eye brows\ncould have been darker - should go with the hair color. She was too\nskinny- not a strong personality as required for this Character. If\nDavid Fincher or any other director is planning to make the sequel, he\nneeds to bring a huge change in Rooney Mara's (elizebeth salander's)\nget up. Also the Guardian - in the -ve role was not up to the mark -\nthat of his counter part in the original movie. Hats off to Daniel\ncraige - he was flawless. You can re-do something that was good and not\nso popular, but this movie was a hit in 2009.. i liked all the 3 parts.\nI hope Hollywood doesn't waist time and money remaking the other two\nparts.\n"
"\nI was excited when I saw IMDb gave this 'masterpiece' 8.2 out of 10. I\nthought it would have been amazing.<br><br>However... after 3 long hours of not much excitement, or much story\nline, I left the cinema bored stiff.<br><br>I'll keep this short.<br><br>1) It didn't ring true to the book 2) I found the rape scene very\nuncomfortable to watch 3) I hated how it would jump from one characters\nstory to the next.; I felt as if it was 2 stories leading up to one\nmajor story at the end, which really had a poor ending. 4) The ending\nwas awful! So quick and had no relevance at all.<br><br>I realize there will be a sequel, but I won't be going to see it.<br><br>What a waste of money and time, such a disappointment!<br><br>However, the movie gives Apple Mac and Nokia very good publicity. I\nmust admit, if my Mac was as genius and as fast as lightening like\nthose depicted ... I'd be a very happy man!<br><br>8.2 out of 10?? more like 4.2 out of 10.\n"
"\nThe most important thing I can say is, just see the original Swedish\nmovie. This one doesn't provide the same feeling as the original at\nall. Everything down to the score for the film is off. They aren't as\nclear when telling the story in this version either. Rooney, while\nlearning the mannerisms and portraying Lisbeth to the best of her\nabilities just simply doesn't have the right look at all. She looks\nlike a soft small child playing dress up rather than a worn abused yet\ntough young woman that Noomi Rapace portrays so well. Noomi has the\nsharp angular features that give her a tough serious look while Rooney\nis softer and sweeter looking. I probably won't watch the other U.S.\nversions once they come out. The Swedish version told the story right,\ncreated the environment for the story, and provided the feeling that\nmade the movies so great.\n"
"\nHaving seen the original trilogy, this lame Sunday school version is a\njoke. Awkward acting, poor story-line, bad directing, cutting and\nsound...quite honestly I could just go on and on. There was absolutely\nnothing I would rate highly in this Tinseltown version of the true\noriginal. Fake Swedish accent speaking, ugly and unsympathetic actors\nrunning around from A to B without any sense of continuation in the\nstory- line or script. If I hadn't seen the original first, I would\nhave been really confused. Is the US audience really so different that\nthey had to have their own Disney version? I have seen dozens of\nEuropean classics turned in to this kind of mush. After the story is\nsqueezed through a one size fits all machine of the Hollywood industry,\nall the goodness and taste has been removed to leave bite size, easy to\ndigest goop with just a hint of added coloring and flavoring.\n"
"\nAs much as i respect, and in fact appreciate David Fincher's work, this\nfilm was really disappointing.<br><br>This film is disrespectful to the people from Scandinavia who really\ndid a great job with the adaptation of Stieg Larsson's books. And\ndisappointing because i expected a different and necessary adaptation,\nonce this is a film made shortly after the Scandinavian.<br><br>Excellent interpretations from almost everyone in an extraordinary\ncast. But scene after scene, the feeling of déjà vu is intense and\nunfortunately accurate. All the key scenes are desperately similar to\nthe \"older\" film.<br><br>If there wasn't the other film, this would be a masterpiece.\n"
"\nOK, this movie makes no sense what so ever! Why even waste time and\nmoney making it when there already is a Swedish and original series of\nmovies made?!<br><br>It's filmed in Sweden, all the names are Swedish, newspapers are in\nSwedish, well, everything is in Swedish except the language! What's\neven worse, some characters even have a ( fake? ) Swedish accent!<br><br>If they now had to make an English version, at least film it England or\nthe US! Use English speaking actors, to watch this version is like\nwatching an American ww2 war movie where the Germans speak English with\na German accent!! <br><br>And yes, I have seen the Swedish version and I am Swedish so I know\nwhat I am talking about.\n"
"\nFirst of all, I much prefer the original movie version. Almost\neverything about the original is better in my opinion...the actors, the\nscript, the locations, the soundtrack. The new Hollywood version is\ntypically more sexed up and that's a negative for me. The bigger\nHollywood budget was not apparent, except of course for the higher\npriced actors. Daniel Craig was unconvincing and seemed to walk through\nthe movie half asleep. Some of his more dramatic scenes, when he was\nshot and the basement scene, he was a bit laughable in his acting.\nRooney Mara was good. However, the Hollywood version downplayed\nLisbeth's talents as a computer hacker and wiz, which, for me, was a\ncentral theme of the story. I love, LOVE the original version. This\none...I wish they had left well enough alone.\n"
"\nLisbeth is a dark person. A border liner. In this makeover she is far\nfrom that. In the original movie, she is the main character. Here she\nis only but a shadow of the real Lisbeth.<br><br>The original movie brings out characters, not just \"screen ppl\".<br><br>Nils Bjurman, her new custodian, is to weak in this movie. He is a real\npig, and has no moral. He do not apologize for what he has done. He\nhates women.<br><br>Her hacker buddy is a friend. Same goes for her boss. He cares for\nLisbeth, and this should have come across on a deeper level.<br><br>I have watched the original movie, and feel that this is not up to par.<br><br>For a new viewer, the movie might be OK.\n"
"\nStrange thing, this Stieg Larsson-hype abroad. His books are very\nSwedish and you have to live here to understand the social criticism\nand the satire, which is also in them. Besides, Larsson writes from a\nclearly politically left perspective. You find nothing of that here.<br><br>Anyway, this is lame and stiff. It's like just any average filmed crime\nstory and there are many like them. The actors certainly don't behave\nSwedish in any way, except for Lisbeth Sallander, who really hasn't any\ntypical nationality at all. Not in the books and not here.<br><br>It's all made for the international market, which doesn't stop the\nSwedish version to be the better adaptation.\n"
"\nI saw the movie last night. First of all; I admit I was biased going in\n( in favor of the original Swedish film; why remake a movie made only 2\nyears ago? ), but they seemed torn between the native language for the\nscenery, and English for most of the computer screens. And I admit it\nhas been a while since I read the book, but they could have spent a\nlittle more time on how Lizbet go they way she was.<br><br>Like the book ( and the Swedish original ) it was a little distracting\nbouncing back and forth between Blomqvest's story and Salander's until\nthey merged, but the plots ( plural ) were very well done.<br><br>And other than to save a little money, I' not sure why they left out\nthe part about Australia ( I'm putting this intentionally a little\nvague to prevent a spoiler for those who have not read the book ). <br><br>Others seem to prefer this to the original; I am not convinced the\nacting was any better. I have to recommend the original Swedish film on\nDVD.\n"
"\nA journalist teams up with a computer hacker to find a woman missing\nfor 40 years. As Larsson's popular novel was made into a decent Swedish\nfilm two years earlier, was a Hollywood remake really necessary?\nEverything is overdone, starting with the ridiculous opening credits.\nIt is poorly paced and goes on much too long, yet the plot is a bit\nmurky at times. Craig does better in the role of the journalist than\nNyqvist in the original film. As for the Lisbeth, the edge goes to\nRapace, who wasn't particularly good in the original, but Mara is too\nrobotic here. However, Lisbeth is such a one-note character that it\nwould be difficult for any actress to make her anything more than a\ncaricature.\n"
"\nDavid Fincher is directing what is merely a marketing stunt here, not a\nmovie on it's own right. This is the optimized version of another movie\nthat barely needed any optimization, not even for the American market.\nIt didn't need any and it didn't really got any, so Fincher is right to\nappear bored as the whole effort basically is only necessary so people\ndon't get confused by Noomi Rapace, who does look terrifying in the\noriginal, which was kind of the point. Now while this is certainly not\nthe worst movie ever, I don't quite see where I could start praising\nit. Americas version of the not quite ingenious, but nevertheless\nsomehow outstanding Scandinavian original is generally unintense, the\nperformances are mediocre at best, the accents suck ass (if already\nconverting it, why not start by putting it into America??), Trent\nReznor Music is off, the Fincher look is unnecessary and the whole\nmovie just appears pointless without it's human edge which was kind of\nthe only real thing to the original. This definitely is Finchers\nweakest movie up to date.<br><br>4/10\n"
"\nUnless you simply, under no circumstances, can tolerate subtitles,\nwatch the Swedish version (AND the sequels). We've watched them three\ntimes - so far, in addition to reading the books. <br><br>They are brilliant and vastly superior. This is a very deep, detailed\nstory and must be portrayed as such - not your run-of-the-mill American\nthriller.<br><br>Rooney Mara is \"okay\" but she doesn't remotely have the edge and spice\nand talent of Noomi Rapace. <br><br>Daniel Craig should stick to Bond movies. He just doesn't have the\ndepth and complexity for this part. <br><br>I generally like Fincher's stuff but this one is just a yawn.\n"
"\nI doesn't make sense to make US version of the movie just 2 years after\noriginal was released. Original was exceptional. This is a merely\ncommercial corporate Hollywood copy designed for mass entertainment and\nprofit. The reason they did this remake is because most US viewers are\ntoo ignorant when it comes to non-US, non-English movies and they are\nnot capable of reading subtitles. They did similar thing with another\ngreat Swedish movie called \"Let The Right One In\". Such an ignorant,\nsenseless and pointless attitude is a typical of multinational\nmainstream profit-entertainment companies. I give it 3 stars as main\ncharacters performance was very well done.\n"
"\nFirst the good news, Daniel Craig is better as a Swedish journalist\nthan as James Bond, and, Christopher Plummer is still an imposing\ncharacter actor at age 82. Now the bad news. Having read and enjoyed\nthe book and Swedish movie, I waited to see this film on pay-per-view,\nwhich is kind of good news considering ticket prices these days.\nUnfortunately, my familiarity with the story was of little help as I\nspent over two and a half hours scratching my head watching a complex\nmess that bore only a slight resemblance to the novel or foreign film.\nI felt sorry for anyone who had neither read the book nor seen the\nmovie, and sorrier for those who had. Swedish names and towns with\ndouble-digit letter length and difficult pronunciations only made\nfollowing the dialog and story more difficult. I have not watched many\nforeign films with English subtitles, so, if you haven't already read\nthe book or seen the American film version, I highly recommend the\nSwedish movie.\n"
"\nconfusion, disconnected, junk. Very upset with Fincher. Those stories\nof the two characters remained separate for so long they might as well\nhave made two different films and split the change. Just tell one story\nor the other. Do not care for the book because I didn't pay money to\nsee the book, I paid money for the film. <br><br>It would be better to betray the book and make something worth seeing,\nother than a 3 hour Apple advert, than try to copy a good book and mess\nit up.<br><br>Sex comes out of the blue, as expected in Hollywood. And let us not\ndiscuss the ending that would not end, except started to mutate into\nanother film. Sometimes you look back on the Rambo/Die Hard endings and\nmiss the old days. Blow it up - Roll the credits. finito.\n"
"\nI am so glad I didn't see this garbage in the theaters...not only\nfincher has manage to change the important details and give away things\nhe should not have he has completely changed the climax...he took away\nall the thrill and excitement from finding the (real)Harriet\nvanger...who actually stays in Australia... Anita vanger is actually\nAnita vanger...unbelievable..unless of course he plans to reveal it in\nthe next film..otherwise this can be easily the worst fincher movie\never...unless you are die hard Craig fan..there is no reason to watch\nthis..so disappointed...the original is far more better..this is just\nwell disguised and stylized trash..\n"
"\nI wanted to like this movie I truly did but it just can not compare\nwith the Swedish film. Everyone has their own opinion but to me this\nfilm was lacking and I could not stay focused as opposed to its Swedish\n counter part which I couldn't take my eyes off of. 1st is Rooney Mara\nas Lisbeth Salander she gave an OK performance I believe that they were\nmany other actress that could have done a better job.  Noomi Rapace\n(the original Lisbeth) owned the role one of the most captivating\nperformances I have ever seen! People say this version is closer to the\nbook and in some aspects it is! But it's a boring movie. I'm an\nAmerican I love American cinema, I don't mind read subtitles but I'd\nrather not have to. Believe me when I say the Swedish version has a\nbetter dialog, a way better cast and is overall a much better story.\nI'm sorry for the fans of this film but there was truly no need to\nremake this story after the Swedish people did an excellent job\ntransform a book from their nation into film. Two thumbs down for me\n"
"\nOkay but nothing compared to the original. <br><br>Whilst watching this American version I kept finding excuses to go make\na cup of tea or toilet or something. This never happens in the original\nand I have watched it countless times for its sheer brilliance. <br><br>Once you watch the original, you will find it hard to like this\nversion. I don't blame the cast. They tried. But I found it hard to\nbelieve they were Swedish. They spoke quickly and the new scenes just\ndidn't work for me. They didn't fit into their roles. And i'm not just\ntalking about the lead characters. The only good character was\nlisbeth's guardian as he didn't talk. It just lacked the finesse of the\nfirst film. <br><br>If you haven't yet watched the original then you are missing out on a\ngreat film.\n"
"\nA movie can be made well (cast &amp; photography) and still not have a\nworthwhile story to tell. This is such a movie. If you enjoy brutal\nrape, forced incest, and a serial killer who tortures young women\nbefore he butchers them, then you will like this movie. If, instead,\nyou are in the (apparently) shrinking population of movie goers who\nwish to come out of a movie feeling better, not worse about the human\ncondition, then you should avoid this movie like the plague. It has 3\n(not 1, not 2) separate unredeeming stories each more depressing than\nthe one before it. What this movie is not is a mystery story. Because\nof Hollywood's inability to think beyond typecasting, as soon as I saw\nthe opening credits I knew who \"did it\" even before I learned what the\ncrime was. If you want to see female nudity in movies, I recommend\nporno films. At least the women in those appear to be having fun. This\nmovie is for masochists who only enjoy inflicting pain on themselves,\nor sadists who enjoy seeing pain inflicted on others.\n"
"\nI can't see any reason why David Fincher decided to make a remake of\n\"The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo\", because the original from 2009 is an\nexcellent movie with lots of action, a great story and actors who\nreally knows what they're doing. I wish I could say the same about this\nversion, but Finchers version of \"The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo\" is\njust very boring and tedious - and I think the actors seriously should\nstart thinking about changing career! Not even the good actors (Robin\nWright and Stellan Skarsgård) gives any great performances like they\nnormally do! <br><br>When I first heard they were going to do a remake of the 2009 film, I\nthought that it might be good - maybe even better than the original.\nBut I was wrong. The original is much better and it's a movie I would\nratter watch than this one.\n"
"\nThe Swedish version was much more well-written, orchestrated, and\ndirected. There was a sense of suspense, emotion, and realism to the\nmovie that the Fincher version simply lacks. Lisbeth's past is seldom\nexplored, and when it is, it's poorly placed in the movie. The\nemotional connection between Mikael and Lisbeth is 'forced' at best,\nand quite awkward at certain moments. There are so many interesting\nfacets about Lisbeth's personality and character that could've been\nexplored a lot better, and you simply don't leave the theatre with the\nsame sense of 'wow' that defined the Swedish version. The more positive\nthing about Fincher's version though, is Rooney Mara, who played\nSalander nicely.\n"
"\nBad acting, zero character development, no atmosphere. <br><br>It doesn't take it's time to tell the story and everything is rushed\nthrough. <br><br>Rooney Mara is completely unbelievable as Lisbeth Salander. <br><br>And Daniel Craig has nothing to work with as Mikael Blomquist. <br><br>Americans should stop being lazy and bother to read subtitles so awful\nremakes like this can be avoided in the future.<br><br>I have nothing more to say but IMDb demand 10 lines.<br><br>Crap<br><br>Crap<br><br>Crap <br><br>Movies like this should make a 0 star rating possible.\n"
"\nI've heard from sources that a person cannot resist three things and\none of them is \"attraction to opposite sex\". The girl with Dragon\ntattoo (ie.. Rooney Mara) attracts the viewers and no wonder she\nreceived Oscar for it. I enjoyed the way she acted as a shy, yet as a\nbold girl with a disturbed mind and also a smart and intelligent\ndetective. Another feature I loved is the cinematography, the Sweedish\nwinter is such a sight and of course the scenic beauty of the same.\nDaniel Craig was good too in his role of Mikhel and I enjoyed Plummer\nand Skarsgard in their roles as well.<br><br>Now the cons of the movie. The only problem is the \"Remake\" factor. If\nyou've watched the original movie then you may hate it. The original\nSweedish movie is too perfect to be remade. Naomi may be far better\nthan Mara but you must appreciate the efforts of Mara for her role.\n"
"\nOkay, so all in all this is a good film, unfortunately it not so good\nif you ave watched the original series of 3. For those of you who\nmissed the original 3 films (The girl with the dragon tattoo, The girl\nwho played with fire, The girl who kicked the hornets nest) this film\nis a good and edge of the seat whodunit. Personally I think the\noriginal Swedish films were better. They seemed more of an ongoing\nstory and were less \"Hollywood\" and more gritty. Also the characters\nwere better defined and more believable. But what the heck, this is a\nmovie worth watching, and if you like it look for the other two Swedish\nsequels. Let's see if Hollywood has the guts to do all 3!\n"
"\nThe only thing that made me go see this movie was to simply compare it\nwith the Swedish version. OK, in term of special effects, camera\nangles, you know setup, this movie is way better but then if you\ncompare the thriller in this one with the original version I think that\nthis version is way under. I'm not saying, like I've seen here, that\nyou should definitely see this one because of Daniel Craig's acting, or\njust give you the classic stereotype \"oldies but goldies\" regarding the\nSwedish version. I'm just saying that if a movie is born in some\nculture, Nordic in this case, you should at least let go of the\nAmerican felling when you rate it. For me even the Swedish accent makes\nit more mysterious and more thrilling than this one. But both are great\nand if you've seen it with Daniel Craig you should also try it with\nMichael Nyqvist.\n"
"\nThe original (2009) movie version of the book was gripping, stylish,\nand original. This version, while adequate, adds nothing to the\noriginal. Hollywood's mania for remakes of everything notwithstanding,\nit is difficult to see why this movie was remade at all. The film only\ndiffers from the original in that it offers a laughably cheesy intro\nfilled with meaningless MTV-style graphics and a ludicrous version of\nLed Zeppelin's already overblown (but great as it is) \"Immigrant Song\".\nThe score, by Nine Inch Nails frontman Trent Reznor and partner Atticus\nRoss is better than average, but this minor addition does not justify\nremaking a million dollar movie. Please, Hollywood, enough with the\nremakes of movies, TV shows, comic books, and the like!\n"
"\nThe 2009 version had a much better story and was far more raw, rugged,\nand compelling. I was incredibly disappointed by this Hollywood retake.\nThe acting in this version was solid which is to be expected from the 5\nstar cast on display here. However this story really lacked by\ncomparison, it dragged on and on to the point of boredom. In this\nversions its characters didn't interact into this film story much\nduring its course. They were given little time outside of its main two\ncharacters, Rooney and Craig who interacted with each other to much.\nAlso a lot of the elements here seemed to be cut out and were made\ndifferently. This took away a lot of the edge and mystery of the\noriginal film.<br><br>I am curious on how Fincher takes the next two books in the trilogy,\nalthough with this film the original 2009 version was better.<br><br>6.5 out of 10\n"
"\nI loved the story line. Very interesting plot. But there were more than\none vulgar rape scenes that were completely unnecessary. It could have\neluded to the fact but instead, showed lots of disgusting details. I am\na fan of the director. I loved Se7en and Fight Club is my all time\nfavorite movie. I don't usually get offended when I see violence or\nsex, but this was horrific! I hope no one brings a child or teen to see\nthis. Seriously, the movie would be a 9 or 10 if they had skipped over\nthe 10 minute scenes of torturing rape!!!! Daniel Craig was awesome.\nThe movie was long but I was very interested in his case he was working\non, lots to think about, a who done it. I like Mikael and Lisbeth\ntogether, I thought they worked well together.\n"
"\nGreat film, Great remake. Seriously, both the Swedish version and the\nAmerican version were great and so were the books, do not listen to any\ncritics. I know good films, and I know how seldom a good movie comes\nalong among the usual garbage that is pumped out annually, the story is\nrefreshing, the characters are intriguing, and you end up wanting more.\nI believe this is a very capable franchise, and since the books\nthemselves were so great and well read it would be very easy to give us\nmore into the world of these fascinating characters. You may need to\npay close attention to understand it, but it is without a doubt a\nclassic, one of the few that is put out during the yearly one hundred\nor so crap films. That being said, to the writers and director, PLEASE\nMAKE MORE. Thank you, from a satisfied movie fan.\n"
"\nFirst off, I admit that I am biased. I prefer foreign and indie films.\nThis version was atrocious. Anita's turning out to actually be Harriet\nwas ridiculous and didn't explain why the flower presses postmarks came\nfrom all kinds of places around the globe. Lisbeth opening up to Mikael\ndoesn't follow her character at all. The rape scene wasn't as graphic,\nI suppose in deference to its puritan audience. <br><br>Of course I expected differences, but I didn't expect to be as\ndisappointed as I was. Even Miriam was treated in the film as a new,\ncasual affair. And while I &lt;3 me some Robin Wright, her accent was\nunconvincing, to say the least.<br><br>A positive thing I can say for this version is that Blomkvist's\ndaughter was kept in and did make the contribution to his investigation\nthat she made in the book. Also, the scenery was lovely.\n"
"\nI love this haunting, beautiful movie, it is one of my all time\nfavourites and I can't wait until it is available on DVD. Having\nwatched the Swedish version first, I was very impressed and surprised\nby how good this American adaptation actually is.<br><br>Daniel Craig is excellent as the journalist Mikael Blomkvist and plays\nthe understated leading man role to perfection. Rooney Mara is\ncompelling as the dangerous and damaged computer hacker and, strangely\nfor an American movie, plays the role with even more perversion than\nher Swedish counterpart, something I didn't think was possible. <br><br>The opening credit scene and score is amazing and will stay with me for\na long time.\n"
"\nA strong cast, all apart from Daniel Craig, who can only play one type,\nmovie after movie (that of a wooden sideboard)<br><br>The first movie is far more edgy, exciting and authentic. This revised\nversion is typical Hollywood; over produced, over simplified and over\nhyped. You can tell its been through a 1000 different hands, and that\nfor all the money spent what they ended up with just does not capture\nthe feel of the book (and doesn't follow it at all well either!)<br><br>Stellan Skarsgård, Rooney Mara &amp; Grandfather Plummer do produce\nexcellent performances (with Grandpa doing a great Swedish accent.\nspeaking of which why was Daniel Craig unable to handle the accent? Oh\nyes, he can't act I forgot!\n"
"\nI was so eager to see this movie, because I saw Swedish original.<br><br>It is, I don't know, sad, because a lot of English speaking people\n(UK/US) is not common with reading subtitles and then they did not see\nthe original.<br><br>Comparing leading actresses is nonsense. Noomi Rapace made it look like\nshe is Lizbeth in private life. Rooney Mara was not even close. I\nreally do not understand how she got nominated for the Oscar.<br><br>Whole movie atmosphere in Swedish original is so much better shown.<br><br>Sincerely, I hope there will be no remakes of two remaining parts of\nMillennium trilogy.\n"
"\nand even if they like to use a rather neutral term like \"product\nplacement\" it's still just dumb advertising. So here's some of the\ncompanies I identified to have paid money for having their products\nshown or names dropped ...<br><br>Computer &amp; Telco: Sony, Epson, Google, Apple, Nokia, ...<br><br>Food, beverages and stuff: Coca Cola, Marlboro, some vodka brand I\ncouldn't identify, Clinet wines, ...<br><br>and the list goes on and on, of course.<br><br>There's some puzzlers though. Like why doesn't her motor bike show a\nmodel and company logo? Really confusing. Until Craig comes to drop his\nobligatory line of course: \"I used to have a motorcycle ...\" - what? -\n\"... a ... Triumph.\" YES!<br><br>Thanks for meeting the expectations. And have fun counting all the\nmoney.\n"
"\nThe movie was simply annoying. I wanted to skip forward so badly, but i\ndidn't and now regret it. You people can talk your philosophical crap\nabout how amazing were the actors, sound or whatever you're talking\nabout, but it is what it is. The first 90 minutes are awful and boring\nas hell. The only interesting scenes were the rape, the blowjob scene\nand the blackmailing one and i say interesting only cause actually\nsomething was happening (the people on screen were moving and others\neven running!!!). And for God's sake stop being fanboys. I don't care\nwhat book or comic this movie came from or if it's a Swedish or\nRomanian remake, trilogy or else. The fact of the matter is that this\nmovie is boring. The only good thing was Daniel Craig and the acting\nand if you like a boringly annoying plot and good acting, well....this\nmovie is for you and you will enjoy it. I've waited 2 hours while\nwatching this movie, just to see a boring TV show \"twist\" at the end,\nsomething like CSI or else.\n"
"\nIn this movie, there's a kick-ass lady shaped like a model who: - not\nonly knows how to handle firearms like an expert, - she also ride a\nblack motorbike with a 'cool' helmet - she fights thugs on the subway 3\ntimes her size - hacks phone lines, computers, police records using a\nmac and some 'magic' box her mate gave her - survives a violent rape\nonly to have mad sex later on with Daniel Craig - is some sort of\ngenius with a photographic memory.<br><br>Look, it was entertaining popcorn, but it wasn't the work of art\neveryone on this site is making it to be. Think 'swordfish' meet your\nusual james patterson novel and you have this.\n"
"\nI hope the sound editor never works again. For some reason, dialogue\nwas over driven by music. And it wasn't even good music. The first\nscene, I struggled to figure out what they were saying. That should\nnever happen, but it happens at least three times. The acting was very\ngood. Rooney Mara was an excellent Lisbeth. Just one problem: Noomi\nRapace was better. I feel bad comparing the two, but when you remake a\nfilm, you are going to have comparisons. If it wasn't for the sound, I\nwould give it a 10, just like the original. There were a few plot\nchanges. I'm guessing that US audiences wouldn't get the jail time for\nlibel. It happens in Europe a lot more than the US. The ending was also\ndifferent. Don't know which I prefer. Overall a good film. But, see the\noriginal as well.\n"
"\nA German company that sells American movies, mostly Hollywood, has\ncoined the slogan \"Hollywood macht glücklich\" -- \"Hollywood makes you\nhappy\". The truth though is that \"Hollywood macht süchtig\" --\n\"Hollywood gets you addicted\", and in my case on remakes. Which really\ndistinguishes me from the average Hollywood fan-chick... Argh.<br><br>Craving for a hit of the evil drug I bought the DVD of \"The Girl with\nthe Dragon Tattoo\" and watched it. That was last week.<br><br>Just now I found the DVD on a heap of books, looked at the title and\nthe cover and for a quite a long moment I had no idea what this movie\nis about. I wasn't even sure if I'd already watched it. But yea, I\nremember now, I did watch it. I faintly remember Rooney Mara's talent\nwasted on some boring and embarrassing (at the same time!) table-dance\nmoves, the screaming chick from (highly entertaining, cult classic,\nimo) \"Beowulf\" being a highlight, and yea, Daniel Craig was in the\nmovie, too. Had the lead role. And that's all I remember.\n"
"\nAs a huge fan of the books and original movie in 2009 I had high hopes\nfor the newest addition and was in no way disappointed. The movie was\nin fact incredible, with all the suspense and vast intelligence of the\nbook and 2009 film this remake has easily made itself a contender for\nthe best film of the year. The script was incredible, location and\nshooting was beautiful and the cast was absolutely incredible. As a\nlover of Daniel Craig and Stellan Skarsgaard I expected great things\nand was not disappointed, but both had to take a back seat for the\nlifetime performance by Rooney Mara. Easily one of the best\nperformances I have seen in a very long time, you could see every part\nof her being and soul went into playing the amazing Lisbeth Salander,\nNoomi Rapace should be proud that her amazing performance in 2009 has\nbeen carried on to the same excellence with this astounding remake.\n"
"\nExcessively long. Could have been 60 minutes shorter and not lost much\nof the story. I liked the lighting, and the costumes/clothing were\nright on target. The acting performance of the girl with the dragon\ntattoo was good. However, the development of her character and many\nother supporting roles were excessively OVER-developed. The carving was\ntoo much and added nothing, as were the 4 or 5 interactions with 'the\npig'. The film was more focused setting an agenda then telling a a\nbetter story. The technology and budget were there, as was a desire to\ninclude an excessive amount of purposefully pandering details that\nadded nothing to the storyline, but trying to appease small audience\ngroups made the film too long and caused the final product to fall far\nshort of the what it could have been. Given his work on Seven, I\nexpected more, but will not be paying for this director's films\nanymore.\n"
"\nThis is my favorite movie, made by my favorite director, with the\nsoundtrack made by my favorite musician, starring the actress who most\nresembles Lisbeth in my opinion, with a better Mikael than the first\nadaptation. But with a predictable Martin, you can realize that he is\nthe villain even if you did not read the book.\n"
"\nLoved the movie. Great cast and plot. Never a dull moment. The lady was\nwonderful the way she handled the rapist was every woman's fantasy.\nWell worth watching especially with the rise of the Trump scourge on\nAmerica. I would recommend everyone that believes that the teachings of\nthe Old Testament should be law. Please see this movie and see the sick\nresults.\n"
"\nOne of my biggest problems with this is when she scrawled I am a rapist\non the perpetrator! Its is nothing but a sharpie and extremely poorly\ndone at that , does not not even resemble a tattoo, it was a poor job\nat using a sharpie! I laughed out loud when I saw how poorly that was\ndone. Also for the dungeon at the end, if everything needs a card to\nget into each door why is it then left open at the end! I did enjoy\nthis movie but it has a lot of head scratching moments way to many to\ngive it a better rating!I need more lines of text the movie is\nintriguing but the tattoo is so terribly done , its is some what\ndisappointing, Sure the tattoo on Rooney is fake but at least that is\nbelievable.\n"
"\nExcellent overall movie!<br><br>You can't ask for better acting, a better plot, and a movie with better\naction. This movie is slow at times, but the story keeps in interested\nthroughout. It's a violent movie and you find yourself rooting for the\nmain character. <br><br>Very well made movie. I have 0 complaints. When a movies is a complete\nsuccess in every aspect, I give it a 10. This is one of those movies.\nIt will not let you down. It's a murder mystery drama with a twist and\nviolence. Not for the faint of heart.<br><br>Enjoy! Jim W\n"
"\nFirst of all, It is the best Daniel Craig acting until now, it is far\naway from average 007 acting, it is deep and has a complex story. The\ndirector made a amazing work getting all the puzzles together.<br><br>Furthermore, this story is a classic murder drama, but goes beyond\nbecause how deep the characters are contracted, specially Lisbeth\nSalander, the social dysfunctional interaction behavior against the\nhight develop detective instinct is one of the maximum of this\nthriller.<br><br>Finally the main lesson in this film isn't about solving a case, but it\nis about how human can be bad with another, specially in familiar\nsituations. This movies goes beyond the simple Who \"Killed Him?\", it\ngoes in how human need is uncompleted and costly in so many ways.\n"
"\nhello to the forum <br><br>As per my summary I loved the film which I watched on TV. However, I\nwas driven nuts by all the background noise in many of the scenes and\nthe fact that most of the actors to some extent tended to mumble.<br><br>Anyway, that's my carp done - gonna read the book now!<br><br>Sorry thought brevity was the soul of wit exit Polonius.Were the sex\nscenes twixt Mikael and Lisbeth not gratuitous considering her sexual\npersuasion. The first scene when the man is on the telephone to Henrik\nwas totally incomprehensible to me - did not get a single word of\nit.Maybe I should have watched the Swedish version with subtitles.\n"
"\nWhat I liked about this movie is the mystery that you really get into\nand try to figure out who's the bad guy. I like how they made it to be\nsuch a good mystery movie. Watching Daniel Craig in it makes you forget\nhe's JB. He especially surprised me as how good he was in this movie,\nalong side Rooney Mara who should be the star but is not really. It's\nDaniel. <br><br>But on top of everything I loved in this movie (and there's a lot of\nstuff I liked), I was surprised how David Fincher made it to be a\nmystery with no crappy action scenes. Excellent job, mate. <br><br>The thing I think they could've had done better is making it a bit\nshorter. Seriously, 2 and half hours? But I can't say it wasn't worth\nit, but less would be better in this case.<br><br>In the end, I liked it very much and I recommend everyone to see it. I\nrated it as Excellent.\n"
"\nThere a very few movies made based on a book that hold true to the\nstory line. This is mostly because it is very challenging to fit a\ncouple of hundred pages into two hours. The written words have the\nluxury of time. The authors can take their time to dig deep into the\ncharacters of the story, the movies have less time, a lot less.<br><br>In this case we do not get to learn a lot about the characters either,\nbut we do get to have a glance. The casting is done right, the acting\nis very good, and the director, David Fincher, has done a great job of\nfitting various pieces into his silver screen version of the book and\nstill evoke the same feelings in his audience. Daniel Craig and Rooney\nMara are excellent, and the supporting cast is not far behind. This is\na complex plot, so make sure to watch and follow it very carefully. You\nwill be greatly entertained.\n"
"\nRooney Mara nails her portrayal of Lizbeth and this is one of the best\nwork on cinematography I've ever seen. The ability to make the movie\n\"dark\" without it actually being dark was impressive. I liked Rooney's\nportrayal of Lizbeth better than Noomi's.<br><br>When I heard that they're doing another movie without Rooney Mara as\nLizbeth I felt they killed the series. The idea that a movie can make\n10's of millions of dollars over the budget and be considered a flop\nbecause it didn't make the \"experts\" expectations of what it should\nmake is a Wall Street model that has no business in movie making. The\nday Hollywood became more like Wall Street was the day creativity left.\n"
"\nHands down! Even rumors popping up about replace the cast with a lower\nbudget to make its way through box office, I'm not worry anymore. This\nmovie will stand at its own as one of the greatest and best crafted\nthrillers in recent memory and a masterpiece of storytelling and flow.\nDavid Fincher was the ideal director to make this adaptation with a\nproperly dark style and operatic quality. Daniel Craig may stand out in\nthis role as his second best known aside 007. But Rooney Mara is the\nbest stuff. She's priceless, since the physical transformation to her\nown performance (more aggressive, more seductive, deeper and with a\nbetter yet tragic closure). Even the movie could expand its world (from\nthe source novel) or close the chapter on its own as the finale shows.\nWhatever it happens in the future, this movie will be as rock-solid as\nhell. Should surpass the 8/10 in this site (with all my respect to the\nmembers of this community).\n"
"\nWow, I'm stupid for never seeing this movie. I mean, I've only owned\nthis movie for about 2 years now. Being a Fincher fan, I already knew\nwhat to expect. Great direction and editing, a haunting score, gritty\natmosphere, interesting characters, good script, this movie had it all.\nThe film did a great job at balancing the narratives between both lead\ncharacters. In the first hour the film was edited with great style and\ndirection; allowing the viewer to slowly piece together the motivations\nof both characters. When the leads finally meet, the plot reaches a\nwhole new level of intensity.<br><br>Simply put, this was a crazy good detective movie that was very\nwell-paced. Fincher's brilliant world-building and direction really\nelevated The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo to be one very thrilling ride.\n"
"\nIf you haven't watched it yet read this... OK I begrudgingly say this\nis a 7 purely because the story is good and so to be fair i cannot rate\nit poorly but... having watched the original (which is great) i felt\nreally disappointed and empty because honestly the acting is just a\nhell of a lot better in the original, its more raw, gritty, real - less\nhollywoody-americany shallow action movie. it grates on me that they\nfelt people couldn't just deal with the subtitles for the sake of it\nbeing so good - its even somewhat offensive even to the original movie\nwhen it was so good...if you are considering watching this - watch the\noriginal movies, and then maybe skip the re-make altogether as I kinda\nwish I had as now i also think of the poor job done on the remake\ninstead of just thinking how great they were. I just don't know why\nthey had Daniel Craig do it, it wasn't a good fit at all, and the\nRooney Mara one, really blank, wasn't right at all, no connection or\nsomething, just wasn't right after seeing the original.\n"
"\nI read the first book from the Millennium saga recently and loved it,\nthat's the reason I decided to watch the movie. It's okay but it's not\na brilliant adaptation, I feel like David Fincher could have done a\nmuch better work. It doesn't respect the chronological order of the\nbook and misses really important information, also the story seemed to\nwrap up too quickly. The fact that the end is completely different\nbothered me a lot. Overall, if you never read the book you'll probably\nlike it, if you have, don't bother watch the film. I'm going to give a\ntry to the Swedish version of the film and hope that it respects the\nbook a little more.\n"
"\nYes, it's a powerful movie (and immensely long). However, only in a\nprose work can you convey the mass of detail required by this complex\nstory: the magazine Millennium, the reasons for Blomqvist's fate, his\nrelationship with the married publisher, his journey north, his\nrelationship with a tangled very wealthy family, his investigation of\nits background and the fate of a teenage-girl member, his discovery of\nsatanism, his relationship with Lizbeth, and so on. It's a complex\nstory told in hundreds of pages by its author (with many hundreds more\npages in the two follow-ups) before his death. The movie is a pale\nshadow, with only a few brutal passages between Lizbeth and her cruel\nsocial worker, and Blomqvist and the Nazi. There's a couple of pretty\nexplicit sex scenes between Blomqvist and Lizbeth and that's it. It's a\nsketch of the novel, even if it remains a powerful picture and worth\nseeing.\n"
"\nGood, and about as good as the Swedish original. (And no, I am not one\nof those people who rail against Hollywood remakes of non-US movies.\nFor example, I thought Infernal Affairs was great, but thought that The\nDeparted was even better). Retains the grittiness and atmosphere of the\noriginal. <br><br>Having seen the original previously, the plot was fairly second-hand,\nso the original diminishes the impact of this movie quite a bit. In\nfact - why remake it at all, as the plot is the same, and the original\nwas so well done.<br><br>Good performances by Daniel Craig and Rooney Mara in the lead roles.\n"
"\nThis movie was well made and well produced but it can't even come close\nto the original Swedish version. One thing that bugged me the most is\nthat the movie takes place in Sweden but everyone in the movie speaks\nEnglish with an English accent. The movie also tries too hard to be\nlike the original movie. It felt too much like they were trying to\nreplicate the original film when instead they should have been trying\nto tell Steig Larsons story.<br><br>I think this could have been a brilliant film if it took place in an\nEnglish speaking European city, or if they at least had Swedish accents\nand most of the towns people spoke Swedish. And if they stayed true to\nthe book instead of the original version of the movie.\n"
"\nA lot of story was left out. I don't know how people who haven't read\nthe book or seen the previous version made sense of what was going on.<br><br>The graphics are better and the Trent Reznor music was a plus. But it\nreally lacks depth. The director basically ripped off the other version\nand added more special effects. That's it.<br><br>I also didn't really buy Lizabeth's character. She is way to angry,\nmuch more so than she was in the book. She did actually have\nrelationships with other people (hacker's, her lesbian friend etc). <br><br>Read the books. They are amazing. You don't even get the back story of\nher relationship with her father, brother and why the Vangaurds are\nreally even interested in Bloomkvist. That and they showed an\nunnecessarily graphic dead cat.\n"
"\nFirst off, the casting was perfect. I wasn't sure if Daniel Craig could\nmake a believable and realistic transition from James bond to an\naverage journalist. And the most impressive factor to this film was\nRooney Mara who hasn't had a good deal of limelight other than playing\nErika Albright in the social network (also by David fincher). The movie\nwas gritty, realistic, and very entertaining. With a plot that a\nmystery buff couldn't resist, it captivates your attention and keeps\nyour eyes on the screen throughout all the two and a half hours you're\nwatching. All characters show their personal pros and cons in simple\nways that only add to the depth of the story and all things related. To\nsay it all in all, the movie was tremendous and should win at least two\nof the Oscars it's been nominated for. It's worth going out of your way\nto see, because you won't be disappointed.\n"
"\nI can't figure out why all the good reviews. The original was so\nsatisfying I wonder why this version was made at all. Does it take a\nlot of talent to copy another movie so exactly. Another question I have\nis how Daniel Craig was picked to be the lead. My opinion of his talent\nis very low. His bland portrayal is maddening. I can't understand his\npopularity at all. It is hard to see the edgy relationship between\nLisbeth and him, that was so important in the Swedish Film. Daniel\nCraig reminds me of the dull- visaged Channing Tatum. I guess it all\ncomes down to what makes a director copy another film. If he or she\nintends to bring a new interpretation to a movie from a book, that's\nfine, but if the director simply copies another film, spending a few\nmillion in the process, why bother. It is hard to believe that this\ncopied film got Oscar nominations. Rooney Mara, nominated for an Oscar,\ncopies Noomi Rapace's character step by step, how can this deserve a\nnomination?\n"
"\nfirst of all i have to say that i read the book one week earlier than\nwatching the movie. i can't say it is a badly written book, but the\nplot seemed to be simple, even if the intention was to complicate\nit.after all, the clues to the case were found through some photos and\nnewspaper articles.<br><br>secondly, the movie is an unfortunate combination of sequences taken\nout of the book. despite the fact that it is lengthy enough,the\ncharacters were nearly at all developed. for example in the book\nCecilia Vanger, Martin Vanger, Dirk Frode are much more stronger\ncharacters than in the movie, where they play easily forgettable roles.<br><br>and lastly, the ending of the movie is simply disappointing compared to\nthe book. until i read about the mysterious escape of Harriett in\nAustralia, i thought it is an average detective novel, but this element\nreally surprised me by its originality. it's a pity the movie hasn't\nreproduced it.\n"
"\nSaw both films and read the trilogy.<br><br>I was skeptical adaptation about a Hollywood adaptation of the novel\nafter having seen the Swedish film and loving it. However, Fincher has\ncrafted a film that is outstanding in its own right.<br><br>And after falling in love with Noomi Rapace as Lisbeth Salander I\ndidn't think that I could see anyone else in the role, but Mara nails\nit and creates an interpretation of Salander all her own.<br><br>I wouldn't say that Blomkvist as played by Daniel Craig is better, but\nthe novels continually describe how handsome the character is and how\nmany women he beds. I never believed that Michael Nyqvist inhabited\nthose aspects of the character even though his performance in all other\nareas was admirable. Craig as Blomkvist does possess a charisma that\nhis Swedish counterpart did not.<br><br>Hopefully this film will perform well, as I would like to see this team\ncontinue with adaptations of the rest of the trilogy.\n"
"\nIsn't it nice that you don't actually have to choose which version is\n\"better\"? They're both outstanding. They're different. They have\ndifferent strengths. The Swedish version does a better job showing\nSalander's background; the American version does a better job showing\nthe relationship between Salander and Blomqvist. The Swedish version\ndoes a better job handling the Wennerstrom subplot; the American\nversion does a better job handling several aspects of the central\nHarriet Vanger mystery. <br><br>As far as the ending is concerned, neither version follows the book\ncompletely; the book's ending is a kind of composite of the two. Or,\nmore accurately, the two directors chose to emphasize different aspects\nof the book's ending.<br><br>Take my advice. Don't choose between them and don't waste time arguing\nwhich is better. Appreciate the strengths of each. And while you're at\nit, read the novel AND listen to the excellent audiobook version\nnarrated by Simon Vance.<br><br>And keep all the versions away from your kids.\n"
"\nThe IMDb rating for this is higher than the Swedish version? What a\ntravesty. I admire Rooney Mara's very different portrayal, but this\nfilm is otherwise a sad shade of the remarkable first installment of\nthe Swedish series. I pity the fool who thinks otherwise. Plot elements\nresonant with meaning in the original are here passed over or utterly\ndissociated. I'll not provide examples in this forum for fear of\ndisplaying too much information. Viewers can decide for themselves. I\nsee nothing in this movie but greed. People can't be bothered to read\nsubtitles? I suppose with a film of this popularity we can look forward\nto versions in all major languages. If it's released in Latin, I\npromise to go see it.\n"
"\nIs is right to rate a movie on a moral basis? Fair to cry foul about a\npopular film promoting a lethal product? Is there anything sadder than\na (once) esteemed director whoring himself by sticking in a blatant\nproduct placement for a cigarette manufacturer? Does Mr. Fincher have\nno self-respect? For that matter, does the film industry overall?\n(Remember In The Bedroom, which did the same thing and still received\nmultiple Academy Award nominations.) You can answer these questions for\nyourself, but I just wished I had been forewarned before the people\nbehind this film got some money out of me. If you want to see a film\nversion of this book, there is still the 2009 Swedish production,\nagainst which this new production is being compared.\n"
"\nStoryline completely predictable. Was clear Harriet is alive already\nafter the task to explain her death was assigned. Possible candidates\n(one of the two) already clear in the middle of the movie. Junk movie\nabout junk world where any man is sick. See 28 Days Later instead.\nUnpredictable storyline instead and just a little hope for the mankind.\nStoryline completely predictable.

"\nDavid Fincher is truly the master of book-to-movie adaptations. And\nwith such a successful and dark book as The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\nto work with, you'd think that this would be a recipe for success. So\nwhat did this movie lack to be so ignored and not talked about by the\ngeneral public?<br><br>Nothing. This movie lacked nothing. It is a beautiful display of\nacting, musical score, cinematography, and directing. The reason that\nthis film is is unfairly underrated is because the wrong audience came\nto see it.<br><br>The audience that came to see this movie had never seen a film like\nthis before from David Fincher (because he had never done anything like\nthis before). They came with the wrong expectations and as a result,\nthey were unsatisfied. So what is the \"right\" audience?<br><br>If you are one who likes extremely dark, demented movies that are\ndriven purely by dialogue, disturbing imagery, and great directing and\nnot by action or horror movie scares, then this movie will most\ncertainly not disappoint.\n"
"\nThe movie is good but but original version in Swedish is better in the\nfollowing movie . Certain things are changed which weakens the\ncharacter of Lisbeth which hurts if you have watched the original movie\nin which she is too strong.<br><br>She killed his own father who is cruel to her mother in childhood and\nbelieves that people who treat women badly should be punished brutally<br><br>In the final seen in the original version she let someone die\n(according to her he deserve to die) where it was shown that she can\nsave that person but in this version it shows that she did not got the\nchance to save him, which is according to me is a very important seen.<br><br>And few more things are changed which weakens the story and make few\nthings meaningless which are shown in the original version properly.<br><br>I personally believe that in this movie directer try to made male\ncharacter strong and forced to change few things\n"
"\nThe words of describing this movie is really hard to be found. its kind\nof controversial. its a smart story of a young woman, expert in using\ncomputers who helped a journalist in his search of a missing woman for\nforty years. the movie has a lot of twists and turns. some scenes are\nvery harsh. a lot of scenes reminds you of European cinematography but\njust remember that a Swedish writer wrote the novel. the hair, the make\nup, the set decoration are just how they supposed to be to get the best\noutcome. Daniel Craig had the opportunity to give an amazing\nperformance I'm not really sure that he succeeded in that (your judge).\nalthough Rooney Mara gives a stunning performance (my opinion she worth\nthe Oscar, but she was competing Meryl). i would definitely recommend\nthis movie. the movie shows the reality as it is, maybe with a little\nbit of exaggeration when it comes to the background story of the girl.\ncant wait to see the next movie!\n"
"\nSpoiler warning at the end.<br><br>I read all three books, which were poorly translated as far as grammar\nwas concerned. Daniel Craig performed his role as Bloomquist with\nexcellence, a character in complete contrast to 007. The story followed\nthe book, leaving out certain details on how the girl gained complete\ncontrol of 'everybody's' computer. (It was through a pro' hacker and\nshe paid him a substantial sum.)<br><br>Spoiler warning. The spoiler is for anyone who has read the first book,\nso stop here.<br><br>Spoiler warning.<br><br>I was surprised and disappointed about the change in one of the\ncharacters and the deletion of another at the end of the search. It\nseemed to me the director and producer couldn't be bothered with the\nwork involved. It was a complete diversion from the book and the German\nmovie version, which in my opinion was much better because of its\nauthenticity and can recommend it to German speakers or anyone familiar\nwith the language. The one thing that saved this film for me was the\nsuperb acting from all round.\n"
"\nI never read the book and after hearing all the hype and seeing the\noverall bleak appearance of the trailer, I was not interested in this\nmovie. Boy, was I wrong. This is a thrilling detective story about a\ndisgraced investigative reporter trying to solve a family mystery for a\nwealthy eccentric and his bizarre extended family. There are some\nsqueamish parts involving \"The Girl\" before she enters the\ninvestigation that could have been left out in my opinion, but I'm sure\nothers would say those events helped define the character. There were a\nnumber of well-developed red herrings to keep you guessing and actually\ntwo mysteries solved by the end, neither of which were easy to figure\nout. I actually watched it twice over 3 days to pick up on more details\nand I find it worthy of repeated viewings. 8/10\n"
"\nWhen I first heard about the book I didn't think I would like it. It\njust sounded crazy. But when I finally sat down with it I couldn't\nstop. It was absolutely gripping. It has been a few years since I have\nread it so I can't be real specific. I liked it so much that I couldn't\nput it down and bought the rest of the trilogy. They were all great but\nthe second two wandered a bit after the gripping tension of The Girl\nWith The Dragon Tattoo. Thank goodness I read them in proper order. <br><br>The first time I watched The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo it was on\nNetflix and in Swedish. Luckily the subtitles were good. After that I\nhad to see the English version.<br><br>What a shame that the author died shortly after he finished the third\non. I would have loved to read more of his writing.<br><br>Heck, I liked the books and movies so much that I made a website at\nhttp://thedragontattoogirl.com. I hope to have more info on there soon.\n"
"\nI am very satisfied at the end of this hard thriller. I like this kind\nof mystery movies where tricky puzzles must be solved. The landscapes\nof Sweden were beautiful and created a good atmosphere. The performance\nof the detective work of Daniel Craig and his assistant Rooney Mara\nwere very respectable. Then another great plus for this film was the\nexperience of director David Fincher who delivered the other legendary\nthriller Seven. What I didn't like therefore was the long running time\nof two hours and a half. As I mentioned in other earlier reviews the\nplaytime must not exceed 2 hours. I think that a few scenes could have\nbeen cut here. But don't understand me wrong. The Girl With The Golden\nTattoo took me anyway on a real hell trip with lot of turns and twists.\nIf you like this genre of movies you shouldn't miss The General's\nDaughter with John Travolta. Final rate: 7/10.\n"
"\nI confess: the movie was a disappointment. The book and the deepness of\nthe characters is far superior. A book of course has far more potential\nwhen it comes to describe a large family over generations and their\ninternal battles. The genealogy is important to understand the various\nrelationships and I admit having had to go back to earlier passages to\nreposition the players. The book is magnificently constructed with far\nmore content to the \"investigation\" and the development of Lisbeth's\ncharacter. It also seems that the book's intermediate end (what did\nreally happen to Harriet) did not please the director, so he took a\nshortcut: open for discussion. In conclusion, people who did not read\nthe book are likely to give the movie a higher rating. To them I\nstrongly recommend to get the book and ... enjoy it.\n"
"\nThis movie was beyond fantastic, truly a well made film which let's\nface it, may be hard to come by often these days. Daniel Craig who\nplays the main role does so in such a thrilling manner as well as\nRooney Mara who had me convinced she'd lost her marbles. From a\ncinematic point of view, it was directed by one of the best thriller\ndirectors out there David Fincher who redefined the gory twist\ncompletely with the 1995 film Se7en. Fincher made the audience\ncompelled to watch to see what happens next. Although a negative point\nwould be that the film starts slowly and holds that pace for a while,\nbut if you stick with it you will no doubt be more than satisfied (\nbecause it does \"speed up\"). I can honestly say that this film is a\nmust-see but if blood &amp; gore, violence , substance use and/or graphic\nsex scenes/nudity tend to bother you, i would undoubtedly advise\nagainst this movie. If you feel you can take it, you are in for the\nride of a lifetime. I recommend this movie 110% !\n"
"\nI had not read the book, but I had expected the movie to be quite\nviolent in its treatment to women. It starts out quite slowly, but\npicks up the pace and story quite soon.<br><br>Rooney Mara plays her role quite extraordinarily well and so does\nDaniel Craig. It is quite amazing how she plays out her role. She does\na splendid job to portray the girl with the dragon tattoo.<br><br>Story was not as mysterious as I expected, but the suspense plays out\nwell through the movie. <br><br>If you see the movie, you will definitely enjoy it. Waiting for the\nrest of the series to be made soon.\n"
"\nThere is only one word for this movie and it is brilliant - no, utterly\nbrilliant.<br><br>Loved the story ,location , acting, filmography and could not find\nfault Loved Rooney Mara too.<br><br>Daniel Craig surpassed himself and was so much better than his role as\nBond.<br><br>Scandinavia is wonderful to see and is definitely the future trend for\nmovie goers.<br><br>The brutal scenes are brutal but the film would not be the film without\nthem.\n"
"\nHollywood did not mess this up. David Fincher did a spectacular job\nputting this together and he did a great job putting his own spin on\nit. I think the best strategy was what they did - they did a completely\ndifferent angle than the Swedish set of movies. You really can't\ncompare the two - they're both spectacular.<br><br>Loved the opening sequence - very James Bond-y. All of the actors were\ngreat and Daniel Craig was awesome as Mikael Blomkvist. Rooney Mara\nalso did a great job. The cinematography was great. It stayed true to\nthe books while taking on a bit more of an action-y feel. Highly\nrecommend watching this one - cannot wait for the next two!\n"
"\nWhen I read the books I felt compassion for Lisbeth and what she had\nendured. The same was true of the Swedish films despite the handicap of\nsubtitles. Consequently, I was really looking forward to this version,\nbut somehow the edge had gone.<br><br>The actors were fine. I am unsure whether the problem was the script or\nthe production, though I suspect the latter. There there was a gloss on\nthe film that, for me, deprived it of bite.<br><br>If you had not seen the earlier version, no doubt viewing this will be\nenjoyable, though uncomfortable in places. I shall stay with Noomi\nRapace and company.\n"
"\nOK I just saw this movie and it was really good. I think there are some\nvery intense moments that made me very uncomfortable to watch. I think\nmost people agree to that. If you read the books you know that its\ncoming, but still hard to watch it and not sure we needed to see as\nmuch as we did. But, the acting was superb! I was also reading of\nRooney's transformation for the character, all her piercing and stuff.\nThat is very commendable that she went so far to embrace the character.\nI'm not an actor but I don't think I could go that far for one movie.\nimpressive. I agree that it is very dialogue driven, and there are a\nlot of moments that might have come across as slow moving. But the\nactors kept it so interesting I was not bored at all. they are both\nvery talented actors. I would recommend it. But read the book first!\n"
"\nI went to see this film today and just knew that I was going to be\ndisappointed. I've seen the original at least five times...in both\nlanguages. To my delight and surprise each film is better than the\nother. Where one version lags the other takes over...they should be\nseen as companion pieces.<br><br>The acting is superb in every character! The scripting has some new\ntwists and turns.<br><br>When the academy awards take place this 2012:<br><br>Best Picture<br><br>Best Actress<br><br>Best Soundtrack (I didn't hear a note, that means that I was had)\n"
"\nAlthough I've read all three of the books (structurally, they're really\n3 installments of one big honking novel), I haven't seen the Swedish\nmovies. Forget about the books. Forget about the other movies. On its\nown, this adaptation does manage to capture the general tone and\nresonance of the novels, and it does this with admirable brevity and\nto-the-bone editing. There is a bleakness in the novels that is nicely\nencapsulated by the exterior and interior backgrounds. Snow. The\nsterility of Martin Vanger's modern house on the hill. The cool patina\nof years on the old cottage's walls, furniture, and stonework. The\ncamera dwells on Lizbeth Salander's inexpressive face and you can\nalmost hear her complex gears spinning away. The lighting director in\nthis film is a genius -- and so is the cinematographer -- emotions are\nrelayed in light and shadow so well, and the camera angles nudge our\ntensions without being overt about it. It's not perfect, of course. No\nmovie version of a well-plotted novel ever is. But it strives to do the\nstory justice, and manages to accomplish its task.\n"
"\nthis movie was great i have see the Forgien Verison and now Rooney Mara\nwas Perfect choice for the Role Lisbeth Salander this movie was very\nwell done and the storyline well done and now made me want read the\nrest of the book ! this movie is not for Children ! they are some\nsexual things in beginning shows Lisbeth Salander Gets Rape is showing\non Screen and there are some very brutal Violence scenes and the movie\nis overall Disturbing but great is not for everyone and is not for kids\nunder age 17 even at That Age They Might still be Disturbing and\nshocking overall i say go see this movie great and Really Hope Rooney\nMara Wins at Oscars and Golden Goble Awards and the Torture scene is\nDisturbing ! overall worth See At The Theaters !\n"
"\nI have always read reviews and not taken the time to actually write my\nown, but for this film Ill make the exception.<br><br>For a fan of the books, I have seen the first Swedish film and now\nliving in Sweden, working where it was filmed in Uppsala. I had a huge\ninterest on how this film would reflect the book and more importantly\nSweden.<br><br>Without giving too much away, I think this film has done an excellent\njob, I have abstained from giving a full 10 due to the slight change to\nthe ending.<br><br>For me, the level of detail, subtleties of how we eat Sandwiches with\ncheese on the single slice of bread, the Swedish response when Mikael\ncouldn't get a signal on his phone and much more. I loved this film and\nhas truly put Sweden back on the map, its not all ABBA you know.<br><br>Rooney Mara in my opinion played Lisbeth better than Noomi as I thought\nNoomi Rapace was too old. The Swedish film didn't really mention the\nWennerström affair and the money, which is a major platform for the\nnext 2 books.<br><br>For a solid cast, great setting, I highly recommend this film.\n"
"\nLoved the movie, and I have read all three books and seen the Swedish\nversions. As one reviewer already mentioned, I wanted to clear\nsomething up: this is not a remake, but an adaptation of the book.\nPeople take away different thing from the book, hence why the movies\nhave slight differences. Its fine to like one over the other, but\nreasons shouldn't be 'it's an American remake.' Both films took away\ndifferent parts of the book, which on both films, can be disappointing.\nHowever, the book is written so in depth that some cuts had to be made.\nPeople cannot compare or say how Lisbeth is portrayed between the films\nwithout knowing her character in the book. Side note, I could have done\nwithout the beginning. A little too stylized for me. However, the\nperformances were brilliant. And the score was great. This movie makes\nme want to watch seven again.\n"
"\nALERT: THERE IS CURSING, NUDITY, SMOKING, AND A FAST MOTORCYCLE.<br><br>GO SEE IT!!<br><br>I know about the books. I know about the Euro-films. I paid no\nattention to them.... I went in cold, wanting an unbiased opinion to\nthe Hollywood version.<br><br>1) Craig played this roll brilliantly. His 007 \"stereo-typing\" is no\nlonger in question.<br><br>2) This flick is l-o-n-g. 2.6 hours. Yes, my butt told me it needed\nshifting. But, this flick kept me wanting more, and I got it.<br><br>3) Thinking. There are places in this flick where you must think on\nyour own, making your own conclusions. I love this in a drama, I get to\nplay a part, I'm also an investigator.<br><br>4) Next: THE GIRL WHO PLAYED WITH FIRE. This is a trilogy, ya know.<br><br>5) Get the LARGE popcorn.\n"
