"\nOK OK I get it.<br><br>This may not be the overall \"best\" animated film of all time but, now\nthat I have seen it six or seven times, I think it is not only ONE OF\nTHE BEST but also it excels at the following: <br><br>* best use of video games as a metaphor for an action story.<br><br>* best atmosphere -- just when you think you are comfortable with the\ninterior of one game, they introduce another. It is like a 3D film\nwithout the actual need for the glasses.<br><br>* best matchup of voice actor and personality -- every animated film,\nnow, in the past, and yet to come, strives for this. Many die-hard fans\nwill say that Ellen Degeneres as a fish nailed it. Well, I don't think\nso. The voice acting of Sarah Silverman matched with the animated\ncharacter (which I swear seems to be just Sarah herself when she was\nmaybe 5 or 6 years old) is the most perfect meshing of the two I have\nseen.<br><br>The story, the acting, the direction, all perfect -- this is an amazing\nmovie that really did not get the attention it deserved.\n"
"\nI love the idea for a video game bad guy going to a bunch of other\ngames to turn into a good guy. <br><br>I especially loved all the video games jokes. How all the characters\nmade jokes in video game form. <br><br>One of my favourite characters was King Candy. He's one of those bad\nguys that you just kind of love. <br><br>When I was watching all the Wreck-it Ralph trailers, I was just like 'I\nhave to go see this movie!' <br><br>My favourite game in the movie is Sugar Rush. Especially how the\ngo-karts are made of candy. <br><br>One of my other favourite characters was Vanellope Von Schweetz,\nbecause I love wacky characters on movies and I love Disney. And when I\nsaw Vanellope I was like 'so she's going to be the wacky character.' <br><br>But my favourite thing about Wreck-it Ralph is how they did scene after\nscene. Because once they did one scene and carried onto another scene,\nit was really well balanced. <br><br>Wreck-it Ralph is one of the greatest Disney movies I've seen and I'm\nsure that when you go and see it, you'll say the same thing.\n"
"\n\"Most Fantabulous animated movie I have ever watched\" I told myself a\nlot of times while I was watching the movie and could not stop myself\npraising the entire crew of the film. The animated locations were\namazing and mouth-watering ha..ha.. This movie will take you to the\ndream land that you will never find even in your dreams, believe me.The\ncharacters are pretty cute and funny trust me you will not get\ndisappointed after you watching Wreck-It Ralph.<br><br>The way Rich Moore handled the script was great I am sure that he would\nnot get any script better than Wreck-It Ralph in the future, he did not\nmiss any emotions like Happiness, Emotional scenes and excitement in\nthe entire movie.<br><br>Finally I had a great treat with Wreck-It Ralph Thanks to the\nDirector..\n"
"\nThis is a great movie.<br><br>For someone who grew up with computer games from their conception, I\nfound lots of little nuggets in here to make me smile.<br><br>The story is surprisingly sophisticated for a cartoon and the\ncharacters are quite fleshed out considering its target audience.<br><br>I saw this at the pictures and I was glued. The child we took to see it\n(and some others in the cinema) didn't seem as gripped.<br><br>I would have liked it if they had visited a few more games.<br><br>I would recommend this, especially if you like computer games and want\nsomething you can enjoy as well as the kids.\n"
"\nI liked it! I liked it so much I'm going to buy it on DVD, heck even\nthe extended DVD.<br><br>I thought it was really well written.<br><br>The pacing was good.<br><br>The characters were well drawn out.<br><br>And the overall story was pretty amusing - in fact, it was so amusing I\nhoping it will come out on xbox or a computer game to play with.<br><br>The only thing I wished for was perhaps more jokes about retro games\nthat I loved - like Space Invaders, Galaxian etc.. it would have been\ngreat if they had made a come back at the finale to help defeat the\nenemy.<br><br>This together with Toy Story 3 - are one of my fav animated movies.\n"
"\nEasily the best animated movie ever. Despite the glaring flaw of the\nCandy King entering an original Sonic cheat code onto a NES controller\nwhen it should of been on a Mega Drive controller this is easily a\nperfect animated movie.<br><br>Everybody from Pac-Man to 'Sa-teen' gets a look in here. Oh and who\ncould forget the 'Surge Protector'!? Everything in this movie is so\nwell thought out and the video game twists are genius. The animation is\nalso flawless, although I only saw this in 2D. So tempted to go back to\nthe cinema already and see this in 3D.<br><br>Re-live your childhood and see it!\n"
"\nIt follows the Disney formula for a good, heart-felt movie, and while\none could criticize the use of such a formula, one is likely to be too\nbusy falling in love with the characters and getting misty-eyed as\nthose characters face the issues they face if one would simply sit and\nwatch the film. Even without being fully familiar with video-game\nculture and all the references and cameos that the film displays\nabundantly, any movie-goer will likely find themselves enthralled with\nthe animation, character design, plot development, and genuine issues\nthat each character faces. Undoubtedly, by the end, you will be\ncheering with moistened cheeks. This movie is a must-see!\n"
"\nI was anxiously waiting for the release of Wreck-It Ralph in India, as\nI'd already fallen in love with the movie ever since it's trailers\nshowed a scene where all my favorite video game characters were sitting\nin a circle and discussing their problems.<br><br>As one of the millions who grew up playing video games, starting from\n8- bit systems to the highly sophisticated and complex PlayStation 3\nera, I really enjoyed the movie. It's a sweet, fun ride from start to\nfinish, and good use of 3D is made here. The animation is solid, as\nusual. Story, screenplay, voicing, everything was great.<br><br>I'd really recommend this movie to everyone.\n"
"\nTo say that \"Wreck-it-Ralph\" is excellent is an understatement.<br><br>This movie is fantastic. It perfectly combines comedy with drama and\nheart. The comedy comes from the many candy and game references that\nappeared in the dialogue and scenery. The drama comes from the twists\nin the plot. And the heart comes from the characters of Ralph and\nVanellope.<br><br>Adults will reminisce in memories of arcade games, and children will be\nentranced with this film. Both will love it.<br><br>In short, this movie is a must-see for all ages. (In the theater, I\nprobably saw more adults than children)\n"
"\nWreck-it Ralph I'm so amazed to see that I really liked the movie, it's\nanimation's. even tho I'm 23 years old. How the story goes and how the\nsmall information is captured all out the movie. You will be surprise\nfor sure. My personal favorite for sure and deserves the Oscar. <br><br>Vanellope is so cute and talkative, The voices of all characters are so\namazing. It does not need to know the characters upfront. even i didn't\nknow some characters. But it's always nice to see similar faces like\nstreet fighters etc. <br><br>I will recommend this movie to anyone, guess what It was that good to\nconvince me to register at IMDb and writer my first review about it. so\nIf you reading this \"Don't worry your time with the movie will be\nawesome\" worth every second of it.\n"
"\nAnimation film are always full of colors , vibes , fantasy , visual\neffects and humorous. If a film qualifies the above fields , then\ndefinitely it is a must watch. Wreck-it-Ralph certainly makes to\nfavorites with its impeccable screenplay and voluptuous direction.<br><br>Ralph is tired of being labeled as villain in the gaming arcade. He\nwants to earn the title of \"hero\" which brings in lot of changes in the\narcade where he lives in. <br><br>Wreck-it- Ralhp is especially for those who have enjoyed their\nchildhood playing arcade games. It will definitely bring in those\nmoments which will be cherished forever. Hats off to direction for\nhandling a challenged script. Script will make you engrossed in the\nfilm completely. Visually it is mind blowing . Voices by John C. Reily\nand Jane Lynch is good.<br><br>Watch Wreck-it-Ralph for stunning graphics , hilarious moments and fun-\nloving characters\n"
"\nI've seen some great animation films of this year such as ParaNorman\nand Frankenweenie and some disappointing ones such as Ice Age 4 and\nBrave but in my opinion none can be better than Wreck-It Ralph. This\nfilm is definitely a superbly crafted film. <br><br>I love the story in Wreck-it Ralph. Its an extremely unique film with\ngreat characters. I loved the characters Felix and Ralph and as time\nwent by, I really began to like the character Vanellope. I loved the\nrelationship between Vanellope and Ralph. <br><br>The pacing of the film is extremely well done and unlike other\nanimation masterpieces such as WALL-E or the Incredibles, in which the\npacing is slow at times. The voice acting was brilliant and the story\ncontinued to make me love the film. <br><br>The directing and execution is superb and this has to be one of the\nbetter FILMS of 2012 along with Dark Knight Rises, the Avengers and the\nHobbit.\n"
"\nJust watched this computer-animated movie from Walt Disney Animation\nwith my movie theatre-working friend. It's the story of Wreck-It Ralph\n(John C. Reilly) who's tired of being the villain of the Fix-It Felix,\nJr. (Jack McBrayer) video game because of the negligent treatment from\nthe rest of the inhabitants of his game. So he goes to another one to\nget a medal and then another one where he meets a girl who feels as\nlonely as him. I'll stop there and just say that I throughly enjoyed\nthe creative visuals employed throughout and the way the story went.\nOther voices like those of Jane Lynch and Sarah Silverman were also\ngood but I was most impressed by that of Alan Tudyk as King Candy which\nhe seemed to imitate Ed Wynn for since the character looked like Wynn's\nMad Hatter in Disney's Alice in Wonderland from 1951. In summary,\nWreck-It Ralph gets a high recommendation from me.\n"
"\nThis is a review for the latest Pixar film Wreck-it-Ralph, and I must\nsay that it's by far the best film that I have ever seen. It starts out\nwith a prologue said by Wreck it Ralph, the villain of the arcade game,\nfix it Felix Jr, saying how hard it is to love his job when no one\nlikes him for doing it. It pans out to an Alcoholics Anonymous style\nmeeting where all of the villains of today's popular video games gather\nround as a weekly support group. Ralph then states that he wants to be\na hero now. He embarks on an incredible journey by game jumping. I saw\nthis on the very first day when it premiered and I was blown away by\nthe plot. To all of the gamers out there, I highly recommend this movie\nto watch.\n"
"\nI'll start this review with this: Know your young children before you\nsee this movie. Gunfire, alcohol references, and beating on objects. I\ndon't want the \"Cars 2\" reaction.<br><br>Wreck-It Ralph is villain to hero movie, a division of Fish Out of\nWater. A Ludicrous number of game and movie references fill this movie,\nbut understanding them wasn't necessary for my twelve year old\ndaughter.<br><br>The arc of this story is a good reminder that every hero needs a great\nvillain to bounce against. The movie has happy, funny, sad, and scary\nmoments, put together like they should be. (I think they read \"Save the\nCat\", a great book on screen writing.)<br><br>For the bizarre, Gameinformer, Game Stop's house gaming magazine,\nrecommends this movie for the respect it gives to gaming characters.<br><br>I'm not sure about the music. A piece like Shrek's \"Hallelujah\" would\nhave been nice, but the piece was OK.<br><br>I'm hopeful that Disney will convert the DCA Video Arcade *back* into\nthe retro place they had for TRON. They now know what to put in there,\nincluding Rampage.\n"
"\nWatched today. <br><br>Could say many good things, but always better to watch without any pre-\njudgments, just watch it, you will not be sorry. <br><br>There're many themes for movies\\cartoons that we've seen billions time\nbut Retro Game theme - is fresh air.<br><br>I got so many positive emotions when i saw my favorite game characters\nfrom my childhood.<br><br>Wreck-It Ralph was terrific. Sense of humor, animation, story... all\nwas on high level without stupid and cheap moments. Sure it could be\nbetter, but all ahead. <br><br>And i could imagine how it will be fantastic if creators will make\nanother cartoon about retro game where will be more famous characters.\n"
"\nOne of best animation films it will rekindle your memories of playing\nvideo games like donkey kong and then over to role playing games. this\nmovie is so detailed in the description of its characters you will\nnotice that movement of characters from 8-bit games is different from\nthose in modern games, even the casting is so wonderfully detailed. You\nwill feel so great while watching this, it would be like you were\nwaiting fora movie like this to come up to theaters. Sarah silverman's\nperky voice for Vanellope is absolutely amazing. it is an absolute\ntreat for retro gamers like me.this movie clearly deserves a greater\nrating and an Oscar for this year.\n"
"\nAn incredible journey! The movie has a unique and innovative concept,\nthe characters are interesting and relateable, and the story has a lot\nof heart. People who grew up playing these particular games (arcade and\nvideo games alike) will enjoy the references with joyful nostalgia.<br><br>It could have spent lesser time in Sugar Rush land; a bit too candy for\nmy taste. Otherwise, the movie is entertaining from beginning to end.\nThe spectacular animation and graphics breathe life into these game\ncharacters. And the sound effects and score are quite exuberant too.<br><br>The movie has a good blend of laughs and heartwarming moments. The\ntwists are maintained well to keep the story intriguing.<br><br>The voice artists have done a commendable job. John C. Reilly is\nfascinating as the bored and irritated \"Bad Guy\", Wreck-It Ralph. Jane\nLynch is hilariously brilliant as Sergeant Calhoun, and Jack McBrayer\nis charming and funny as Mr. Fix-It.\n"
"\nI was not expecting to like this movie nearly as much as I did, but the\nvoices and characters drew me in right off the bat. The two leads are\nfantastic, as are most of the support. <br><br>There are tons of little touches that gamers, even older ones will\nappreciate. However, it's not a simple homage. The movie pays tribute,\nbut melds it all into a perfect world all its own. The story is simple,\nclassic, and to the point. There's little in the way of Follywood\ndemographic button-pushing and it somehow makes even the light toilet\nhumor seem classy.<br><br>Films like this, the Incredibles, UP, etc. make one wonder if not all\nof the best talent in motion pictures is in animation these days.\n"
"\n\"Wreck-it-Ralph\" is a perfect example of the Disney magic. I took my\nthree-year old son to see this film and it was the first time he sat\nstill through an entire movie. I enjoyed how well the computer\nanimation turned out and how well the traditional 2D characters like\nRyu and Ken from Street Fighter turned out. It was interesting\nexperience.<br><br>The storyline didn't seem cluttered or overly long, which was good, you\nwon't get bored with the film quickly (unless you watch it three times\na day). While watching the film though, I wondered if the writers had\ndrawn inspiration from an earlier Disney work, \"Tron\"? I really enjoyed\nhow the arcade games were incorporated into a film released during an\nage of Mobile Gaming as well, nostalgic for those of us who grew up\nwith arcades. Also, I thought it interesting how the characters from\nthe game used the surge protector as a subway system, that was\ningenious thinking.<br><br>I have also heard rumors of a sequel to this film already, based on\nplatform gaming. All I can say is, if you make a sequel, please, keep\nthe magic alive.\n"
"\nVisually inventive and a splendor to look at,introduces us to the\ngaming world and there are lots of references for gamers.Has a new\npremise unlike Usual animated movies though in the end it might end\nwarm hearted like all Pixar flicks/animated flicks(the good ones) by\nAmerican studios.It finds a new way to reach there and makes us enjoy\nthe gaming world.<br><br>Great characters,funny and suitable voice acting,one is immersed in\nthis i would not say childish but rather youthful world.Amazing that\njapan did not do a feature like this first since it is home to gaming.<br><br>It is great and it is fresh,the creative well had juice in it.\n"
"\nI hardly write reviews and just rarely happens that a movie really\nblows me away i write a review! This movie is really stunning. I was\njust interested the whole time while watching this movie. The story is\nincredibly creative and the very well depicted. The animation is also\nexcellent. Everything seems so real. And not to forget, it's full of\nhumour as well which is very important. The movie also had a great\nmeaning into it. It was really touching and also inspiring. Overall\nabsolutely worth a watch. One of my favorite movies now. You can watch\nit with your friends, family anyone and it'll be wonderful. A movie you\nwon't forget.\n"
"\nI saw this movie in 2D at the cinema the other week. I was not\nexpecting too much but I was pleasantly surprised and really enjoyed\nthe film. It has a bit of everything: pathos; excitement; thrills;\naction; tension; love; plot twists; surprise ending; nostalgia; good\ncharacterisation etc. It's a good story that keeps you involved and\ninterested all the way through. The film gets you involved and soon has\nyou rooting for the characters. It helps if you are young enough to\nhave played the games shown in the film or have children (or grand\nchildren) who have - but this is not essential for your enjoyment.\nDefinitely worth seeing whether you are young or old.\n"
"\nPLOT: An arcade video game character known as Wreck-It Ralph becomes\ndisappointed with his life and that he is always known as a \"bad guy\".\nHe decides to leave his game and jump between other titles in order to\nwin a medal and return to his game a hero.<br><br>MY THOUGHTS: What drew me into this film the most was the fact that its\nstory is one of the most creative and original ideas I have ever seen\nin a movie like this. It was done really well and made it feel like\nthere is really a living, breathing world behind all those arcade\nscreens.<br><br>PROS/CONS: The movie was very well done. Its very colourful and the\nfact that it takes place in various different video game worlds keeps\nits fresh and interesting as you watch. The only nitpick I may have is\nthat it spent too much of its run time in \"Candy Rush\" (a candy land\nstyle racing game). In my opinion, too much time and it made me want\nhim to jump to even more games.<br><br>RATING: 8/10\n"
"\nTo all the kids who were born in the 70s and 80s (or some early 90s),\narcade games are so popular. Even though they played them regularly or\nnot, they are still there in everyone's minds. When they watched\nWreck-it Ralph, I think that all that \"kids\" will not able to hold back\ntheir memories of Pacman, Mario, Fix-it Felix... And that is the reason\nwhy people keep telling me that movie is for gamers only. And just\nbecause of that reason, I didn't watch the movie earlier, which makes\nme regret. I don't know many characters in the movie, only Mario,\nPacman and guys in Street Fighters. Due to my shortage of knowledge, I\nrealized more than just a memoirs of game characters. Everything has\nits two-sided and once people spotted your bad manner, they will always\njudge you as a bad guys. It's OK, whatever, the person who is deep\ninside you is much more important. You are bad and at least it's good\nbecause you know who you are :)\n"
"\nJust the announcement was enough to perk my interest and the trailer\nwas enough to make it one of my highly anticipated movies to watch.<br><br>I don't 'analyse' movies like other people, I watch them with no\nexpectations and enjoy them for what they are, I watched Wreck-It-Ralph\nand it did what it needed to. It entertained me thoroughly and did it\nright.<br><br>If you're one of those who pick faults with everything, I have no time\nfor you, I found no fault in this movie. It was well put together, the\nstory wasn't stupid and the characters were great. It's certainly not\none of those where, what you see in the trailers are the best parts,\nthere are some great sequences throughout the whole movie and should\nkeep everyone happy, especially kids!<br><br>The 'retro' game characters are obviously there for the sake of older\nkids and parents/adults and the 'HD' comment was a nice touch to\nreference more recent games, but it was done just right to attract each\nmember of the family.\n"
"\n\"I'm bad, and that's good. I will never be good, and that's not bad.\nThere's no one I'd rather be....Than me\"______\"I don't need a Medal to\ntell me that I'm good, coz if a little kid can like me, how bad can I\nbe?\" :D____Ralph, a video game antagonist, who was upset with the\ntreatment of his negativity, set an adventure to prove himself a hero\ntowards his fellow game characters. An amazing Disney production that\nseems to have slightly smart touch of Pixar :p Characters' development\nwas well-crafted and the relation between Ralph and adorable Vanellope\nwas quite cute and stirring. Both John C. Reilly and Sarah Silverman\nmade a worthwhile voice cast :p Despite unnecessary romantic elements,\na full pack of fun and emotions___\n"
"\nI never expected to enjoy this movie so much. I came to the cinema just\nto accompany my ten year old daughter, but the story and the characters\nare amusing across time and space. Across time. The first video game\nI've seen in my life was \"tennis\" played using a TV set and graphically\nwas two vertical bars that the players could move only up and down and\na squared \"ball\" bouncing on TV screen's sides. There is a reference to\nthis gamesaur in the movie. And many other references to well known and\nless known video games. There are also references to many other movies\nlike Tron, Toy Stories, Cars and even Alien. Across space. I don't only\nmean that many video games have been produced in Eastern Asia, but also\nthat video games have had an international diffusion and some of them\nare now icons, like Pacman or Mario Bros.<br><br>The plot is quite conventional: the strength of this movie is in\ndetails, many many details which made me wishing to watch it once\nagain.\n"
"\nI wasn't that keen on watching this film but my brother made me watch\nit. I wasn't disappointed, it is a great film. It has a solid plot and\na lot of funny moments in it. <br><br>It combines nostalgia with comedy and has a great storyline, the\ncharacters (even though animated) are not 2D like their arcade game\ncounterparts but have real feelings and emotions and there are even a\nfew tearful moments in the film. <br><br>the basic story is that \"wreck it\" ralph is a baddie and felix \"fix it\"\njr is a good guy in a game centered around felix. One day, ralph gets\ntired of being a bad guy and being lonely, living in the dumpster and\nventures out to look for something more. However as ralph looks to\nbecome something more than just a villain, he disrupts the gaming world\nand it leads to a lot of mischief! <br><br>I must say it is a well put together film and visually looks great. it\nis definitely a film worth watching!\n"
"\nWreck it Ralph is self-consciously retro (Ralph even says so himself).\nIn a year where animated films come into their own, this is a\nparticularly brilliant entertainment.<br><br>The animation is delightful, the jokes are funny and smart, the\ncharacters brilliant, the story soars.<br><br>I was reminded of another retro Disney film 'Who Framed Roger Rabbit?'\nwhich wasn't really for kids, in fact I don't really know who it was\nfor... In comparison this gets it all right; it's cute smart funny\nmoving: fabulous. Sugar Rush is so brilliantly delicious that I just\nfelt like living there, the observations and the details throughout the\nfilm are priceless. <br><br>You'd think that maybe you'd be encouraged to dislike Ralph's nemesis\nFix it Felix Jnr. - the good guy - but instead he almost steals the\nshow! Great work with the script and voice-actors whose work shines\nthrough here.<br><br>John Lasseter proves again that he is even better at knocking Disney\nprojects out of the park, than with his sometimes more strange and\nawkward projects at Pixar. Bravo!\n"
"\nwreck it Ralph is about wreck it Ralph. he wants to be a good guy\nbecause he never gets properly appreciated.so instead of staying in his\ngame he decides to game jump.Felix ends up having to chase him across 2\ngames to find Ralph before he causes more trouble.<br><br>this movie ended up being the best animated movie this year. the\nstoryline was actually deeper than i thought. this movie is a mix\nbetween Aliens and toy story. and wow was i surprised. the movie was\nfunny stylish and cool! Fix it Felix makes a good buddy for him. i\nthought Felix was going to be a snob but i was surprised at his\ncharacter. he didn't hate Ralph and i liked that. besides an awesome\ncast that worked, it had bucket loads of heart. i ended up crying and\nI'm 15! not spoiling anything but there is actually unexpected things\nthroughout the movie. heck the whole movie was unexpected. overall an\nawesome time for all ages\n"
"\nOK, so I'm not a gamer by any means &amp; my review is going to be\nnon-techy. Hey, I liked PacMan back in the day and now that seems\narchaic.<br><br>I went to see this Wreck-it Ralph because it looked like fun. And it\nwas. This movie has beautiful visual colors/scenes and funny antics &amp;\nlines galore. The storyline is very clever and engaging. And I loved\nthe sessions with the other game icons, very cute. The actor voices\nwere right on, especially Silverman. Wow, how can her voice sound like\nthat?<br><br>What I wonder is will kids like this movie? To me it seemed rather\nadult in the story and I'm not sure a kid under 10 would necessarily\nget it. But an older kid or adult who likes animation and creativity\nwill love it. It is amazing what they do with animation today and this\nreally is a feast for the eyes. With a fast pace and good dialog, this\nmovie kept my attention and had me laughing at times and leaving with a\nsmile on my face. That's a good sign to me.\n"
"\nHere is a warm, clever, and funny addition to Disney's animated canon.\nWreck-It Ralph applies the general concept of Toy Story in a new and\noriginal way. The entire film is illuminated with familiar video game\ncharacters and little gamer jokes from invisible walls to jerkier, less\ndeveloped side characters. <br><br>The overarching Armageddon subplot could have been handled better since\nit has us nearly forgetting about it in an effort to focus on\ndeveloping the main characters and their own interests. Ralph seems to\nbe oblivious throughout the film about the fact that he pretty much\nthreatens everyone's existence with his carelessness. <br><br>But Vanellope! The highlight of the film. She is the most adorable\nlittle character, although it is a bit creepy that she's essentially a\nmini-me of Sarah Silverman. Nonetheless, if this movie has a single\nstrong point, it's that Vanellope will find a way to win you over.<br><br>The simple lesson of the film is conveyed well: grow to accept your\nidentity.\n"
"\nThis is one the best movies I have seen all year that I need to write\nthis review! I have never wrote a review before until I saw this movie!\nThats how much I loved it! First of all, I'm a gamer. I have played\ngames for over 25 years so I understand the world of games and I know\nall the characters from the movie. I knew I was going to like this\nmovie from the start but I did not know I was going to like it this\nmuch! This movie is more then just about games. The story is just so\ngood that you really do not need to know about games to love it. Of\ncourse it helps if you understand how the older games worked back then\nbut you can still have fun on the story and how funny this movie is!\n"
"\nIn the world of video games,Ralph(John C. Reilly), better known as\nWreck-It Ralph the villain in the video game titled Fix-It Felix. For\n30 years Ralph wrecks the building and Felix(Jack McBrayer) and his\nmagic hammer fixes it. Ralph has grown quite weary from being the bad\nguy,tired of being the outcast, he wants to be admired, and liked by\nothers, so Ralph leaves his game, and ventures into other game world,\nbut how will Ralph come out in the end? <br><br>John C. Reilly, Jane Lynch, Jack McBrayer, and Sarah Silverman, are\nsome of the best voice acting I've heard in years, the really made\nthese characters come too life. This also had some of the best\nanimation I've seen in years. I think Wreck-It Ralph tops all the pixar\nanimated films that came before it. You will not be disappointed.\n"
"\nWreck-It Ralph is amazingly funny, entertaining and appealing to almost\neveryone - be a 90s kid or a YOLO teenager.<br><br>The animation is terrific and by far the most colorful animated movie\nof 2012 I have seen. Should it win the Oscar, well it is good enough\nwith its direction, emotional plot and characters.<br><br>The innocence, realism &amp; fantastic approach of the characters is the\nUSP of this movie and the emotional punch with somewhat like an Aesop's\nfable at the end is very good. Children will love it. A wonderful\nfamily entertainer with inventive thoughts about inside of an arcade\nand all the niceties - taken care of nicely. As a whole, I loved the\nidea, and the execution! Sequel? I will wait for it.<br><br>WATCH OUT FOR: Skrillex &amp; Sonic!<br><br>Can be watched with a typical Indian family? YES<br><br>Language: No | Sex &amp; Nudity: No | Mouth-Kiss: Mild | Violence:\nCritical, but not octane\n"
"\nAlthough I'd seen many positive reviews of this movie, I went in\nwithout great expectations as I've never been much of a video game\nplayer, and hence didn't expect to get many of the references, but what\nI got was a brilliantly funny story that still managed to whack me\nbetween the eyes with the darker moments. My smile muscles hurt by the\nend, and I can't say that of a lot of movies. Kudos to all the main\nvoice cast (I did not recognise Alan Tudyk at all), and to the\nanimators, if only for the way they managed to capture in Sgt Calhoun\nnot only Jane Lynch's likeness but also her trademark tough sexiness.<br><br>Also, the short feature (Pixar is apparently infecting Disney, which\ncan only be good) is an entirely wordless sweet little story, and of\ncourse you should stay for the end-credit Easter Eggs, and the insanely\nboppy songs.\n"
"\nWreck-It Ralph was a movie that I was anticipating because I loved the\nidea behind it. That's usually a bad sign. Too much anticipation can\nruin an experience. To my great joy, it wasn't the case. The movie\ndelivered what the preview promised, except for one thing, you spend a\ngreater part of the movie in a single video game world.<br><br>The animation is excellent, the story interesting, the basic idea\npretty novel, and the characters lovable. They were even able to insert\na pretty dramatic and heart wrenching scene as well as a hero finish.\nYou can't ask for much else.<br><br>It's an all around excellent animation film, and if you're even\nslightly interested in video games, especially those old 8-bits ones as\nwell as how it all evolved and the different types of games, you'll be\nin heaven.<br><br>Go see it on the big screen.\n"
"\nAs a 30-something father of two I can say that I absolutely loved this\nmovie. This is really what you hope every movie experience will be like\nwhen you go to the theater. The homage to my favorite form of media and\nentertainment, classic video games, was just the frosting on the cake\nas this movie had real substance. The plot was wonderful, as it\ncontained all the right elements of surprise, anticipation and\nsuspense. The characters were delightful and the movie really drew you\nin to their plights and made you care about them and their\nrelationships to one another. I haven't seen a movie this well made,\nanimated or not, in a long time (excluding Avengers). This is one I'll\nbe able to watch over and over again and enjoy each time.\n"
"\nAfter seeing the trailer in June, I have been anxiously waiting to see\nthis movie. Well, the hype is legit and Wreck It Ralph is the best\nanimated movie of the year! John C. Reilly plays Ralph, the bad guy of\nFix-It-Felix's arcade game, and delivers an outstanding performance.\nBeing a hero is an overplayed storyline in almost all animated movies,\nbut Disney makes Wreck It Ralph fresh and original. I was laughing the\nentire film and it's charm won me over. As a hardcore gamer, the\nsoundtrack and appearances of various video game characters and\nreferences was awesome. It was not only nostalgic, but cool which\nbrought back great memories of going to the arcade and putting quarter\nafter quarter in a machine. Overall, I was blown away by Wreck It\nRalph. WHATEVER YOU DO GO SEE IT! And I'll definitely be seeing it\nagain in 3D!\n"
"\nI grew up in the 70's and 80's and constantly was in arcades. This\nmovie brings back a lot of sentimental memories which allows me to over\nlook dozens of goofs in the movie.<br><br>I know the score should be lower, but over all it was a goofy, fun\nmovie for the kids and isn't supposed to be taken as a serious movie. I\nlike that they threw in a bunch of adult jokes which caused the little\nones watching it say \"huh?\".<br><br>The ending wasn't what I expected either so it was nice to get fooled a\nlittle.<br><br>Direction 1 Acting 1 Fun 1 CG 1 Sound track 1<br><br>5 out of 5\n"
"\nGreat movie with a great voice performance by John C. Reilly. Also a\ndifferent kind of role (even if animated) for the otherwise very\nnaughty Silverman. But apart from those voices, the animated movie you\nget here is a treat. The idea itself is more than funny and there is\neven a morality here. The good thing is, that you don't get the message\nhammered into you violently.<br><br>It's more subtle than that. The animation is good apart from the\nsections that depict the \"game\" within the movie of course. But that is\nsomething that has to be that way. Kids watching this will never know\nwhat bad graphic was, because they never had to experience that.\nGood/bad for them is what you could say. But even they won't hold it\nagainst this movie, especially because those sections are not that\nlong.<br><br>Great comedy and good family entertainment movie.\n"
"\nI had my doubts about this movie. Taken into consideration the lack any\nof good animation films lately and simply how low Disney sank, you can\neasily imagine why I had these.<br><br>But I was blown away immediately. The story is complex enough - so it\ncan appeal to younger audience - and told right. Same goes for\ndirecting. Though, I think by putting the new and old generation of\ngaming together, this movie can be enjoyed much more, if you are and\nadult, for there is a heavier emphasis on the \"old-school\". <br><br>The main characters are simply stunning in terms of design and\npersonality. This is not quite for the rest. Most of them are just\npretty generic.<br><br>All in all, this is fantastic movie. It has flaws, but not any major\nones. I recommend this movie to anyone. I haven't been treated this\nwell for a very long time - regarding animated movies.\n"
"\nI never thought the day will come when I score a movie 10/10.. and this\nmovie?!! I don't like CGI. I like a well-written story with\nwell-developed characters, played by actors who respect their art. I\nfind fault with almost every movie I watch. I didn't plan to watch\nWreck it Ralph. I was at a friend's house to use his wifi when mine\nbroke down and he had just bought the DVD. He played it and I was not\ninterested the first minute then I was hooked! The movie is GENIUS\nGenius in story, story telling, script writing, switching between the\nworld of the tiny characters, in between their little worlds, and then\n\"our\" world. The script is flawless. The imagery is lovely. ALL the\ncharacters all likable. The movie is just hilarious! I am actually\ngoing to buy the DVD to watch again this weekend. There is so much\ngoing on it's amazing.\n"
"\nThis is Disney's 52nd animated feature and i must say it's truly a\nmagical film. It got some great visuals and graphics grinding through\nthe whole movie,the soundtrack and background score is nice. It is a\ncolorful and magical experience. Editing is perfect and most marvelous\nthing is the voice acting. John C. Reilly,Sarah Silverman,Jack\nMcBrayer,Jane Lynch and Alan Tudyk did a fabulous job. This movie is\nsurprisingly funny ,emotionally good and different story with a whole\nnew concept. i don't think there is a world left by Disney's Studio,now\nit's the video game world. it sure make us feel nostalgic with all the\ncharacters and references.<br><br>I wonder how could it not have won the Oscar, it is much better than\nBrave. but as the movie's moral. \"You don't need an award to tell you\nthat you are better\"<br><br>Disney has done it again,this roller-coaster adventure ride is a\nwinner.\n"
"\nI come to watch this movie twice. The second time strikes me... That's\nwhen I get a lot rejection in real life and was very frustrated. The\nbad guy, Ralph, kinds of remind me of people living in real life not\nrecognized by their colleagues of the same community. Ralph decides to\nleave and get recognition in other community/games that he can not get\nin his own game. This is so true in real-world workplaces, people\nalways jump out and in, trying to get higher salary and more respect.\nSkipping the long adventure Ralph had in other game, the ending is\nother citizens in Flex-fix-it recognize the importance of a role of a\nbad guy in a game and comes to appreciate his presence... and Ralph\ngets the recognition in his own game... Though making sense, this happy\nending normally does not happen in real life a lot. In real world,\naverage person leaving one community would be simply replaced by\nsomeone else...<br><br>There are other metaphors of this movie, and I recommend it as an\nanimated movie very well done for adult..\n"
"\nThis is a movie good for people of all ages, from the young to the\nadult. I enjoyed it, just as my friend did as well. The animation was\ngood. The storyline was pretty well thought out with bits and pieces of\nfunny stuff thrown into the cartoon. With it being a movie made based\non several games, it would help if you were a gamer though that is\nreally really not essential to understanding the movie. This is because\nit helps if you recognise the side characters portrayed and may help\nadd to the humor, but I repeat, this is not essential and will no way\naffect how one enjoys the movie!<br><br>So grab a popcorn and a drink and sit back to enjoy the movie with your\nfamily or friends!\n"
"\nThis movie is nearly perfect. I say nearly, but I don't think I've\nfound anything lacking about it. You can see the unrelenting hard work\nthat went into this movie. It is one of the best structured stories of\nany family film. Everything fits together logically. The visuals are\nalso mind blowing, and the performances are wonderful. It belongs in\nthe highest tier of Disney films. I hope it will be recognized as an\nenduring classic. I would like to say \"timeless,\" but setting it in the\nworld of video games may end up dating the story. If so, it would be\nthe only minor shortcoming for a film that has everything a viewer\ncould hope for.\n"
"\nSincerely i avoid western animated films in general once the are\ndirected to children, and i avoid at all video game films once they are\nidiotic, so with double reason i avoided Wreck-it Ralph for a good time\nuntil i read a positive matter about it in a video game magazine. I\nwatched it expecting the same garbage of all video game films i had\nwatched previously (except for Scott Pilgrim VS The World, the only\ngood video game film i ever have watched until then) and to my own\nsurprise i LOVED it. Not only the story and the characters are\nenjoyable but this film has something that lacks in all other video\ngame films: the REPLAY FACTOR. Even Scott Pilgrim i watched only once,\nbut i have watched Wreck-it Ralph at least three times now trying to\nfigure out and recognize all video game characters and references in\nthe film, and every time i re-watch it i find something i have lost in\nthe last time i watched it. AWESOME!\n"
"\nI heard a lot about how people consider this film the \"Who Framed Roger\nRabbit\" of video games, because of the licensed video game characters.\nI agree, because not only the licensed characters it's the characters\nthat are like the characters in Roger Rabbit. Now the designs and\nanimation of this film is colorful and creative from a 1980's 8bit\narcade game to a modern day first-person shooter game. The soundtrack\nis also really creative with using music from what a 1980 arcade games\nsounds like. Now on with the characters, the main character Ralph, who\nis more like Eddie Valiant were he's seems to have pretty much a tough\nlife being the main antagonist of his game, Fix-it Felix Jr., and wants\nto be a good guy, now Felix doesn't seem to have much of a character\nexcept we all know that he's the protagonist of the game and later fall\nin love with a character from a first-person shooter game, and King\nCandy is more like Judge Doom, witch I can't tell because Don't want to\nspoil the climax. In conclusion Wreck it Ralph is most definitely like\n\"Who Framed Roger Rabbit\".\n"
"\nSet in a backdrop of modern day games and entertainment, Wreck-It-Ralph\nis an extraordinary tale of unconventional friendships, fierce\ndetermination, and far-reaching dreams in a land of routine and\nestablished identities. <br><br>The film's message is clear &amp; the moral is simple -- Dare to be\ndifferent, yet the unique vision and approach of Director Moore has\nmade a seemingly ordinary kid's movie into a mesmerizing journey of\ncourage, consequence, and eventual self discovery. One of the few films\nthat actually live up to the ideals it conveys, Wreck-it-Ralph is on a\nleague of its own as it marries contemporary wisdom with traditional\nvalues that people of all ages could learn something from.\n"
"\nUsually when it comes to animated movies, I reserve my highest praise\nfor Pixar movies. They have constantly raised the bar for animated\nmovies for the last decade or so, and the competition has had a tough\ntime getting close with their efforts. That is why I'm so pleased to\nsee such a good challenger for honors, from in-house competitors Walt\nDisney Animation Studios.<br><br>The plot works well, focusing on video game bad boy Ralph, who is tired\nof being the villain and wants to bask himself in the glory of heroes\nby winning a medal. But what makes this a winner in my eyes is that it\nmanages to capture both the young and the old. The story itself is good\nenough, but what makes me fall for it is all the connections to the old\nvideo games I used to love. Growing up in the 80s and early 90s, I just\nlove seeing the characters I used to know from back in the days,\nincluding Pac-man and Q-bert, not to mention Bowser or Dr Robotnik.<br><br>I really had a good time watching this, and it gives Brave a run for\nits money being my favorite animated movie of 2012.\n"
"\nI found this movie funny and it was a video game version of Toy Story\nin that it focused on video game characters rather than toys. It made\nyou see how a video game bad guy may feel, centering on the bad guy\nfrom Fix-It-Felix Jr, Wreck-It-Ralph. Ralph game jumped to try to be a\ngood guy and win a metal at Hero's Duty. This was called \"going Turbo\"\nafter a rogue video game character called Turbo form the long since\nunplugged game called \"Turbo Time\". Turbo Time was the most popular\ngame when the arcade first opened and Turbo loved that and it lasted\nuntil Road Blasters was plugged in and overtook Turbo Time. Turbo got\njealous and he game jumped in an attempt to crash Road Blasters, but\nended up having both games unplugged for good. Turbo survived to\neventually take over Sugar Rush and become King Candy. This movie was\ninteresting and funny.\n"
"\nDisney's Wreck it Ralph presents as an animation visual thrill ride\nthrough multiple video game worlds, the audience is besot with comic\ngags and punchy one liners but is ultimately left to believe that while\nwe are all interconnected we also exist within the restricted confines\nof our own social strata. Through survey of film theories in\nStructuralism, Constructivism, Post-Structuralism, Post-Modernism,\nPost-Humanism and finally Super-modernity it may be proved that such\nchildren's fantasy entertainment posits social expectations within the\nimpressionable spectator. Wreck it Ralph as a mainstream entertainment\nvehicle lends credence to the empowerment of the individual whom does\nnot feel accepted by the status quo through recognition that as\nindividuals we must determine our own self-worth within our respective\ncultures.\n"
"\nWreck-It Ralph <br><br>The worst part of being a video arcade villain from the '80s is that\nyou got paid in sullied quarters.<br><br>However, the retro rogue in this animated feature only wants to be paid\nin gratitude.<br><br>Tired of his job as the baddie in the Fix-It Felix, Jr. (Jack McBrayer)\ngame at the arcade, Wreck-It Ralph (John C. Reilly) makes a pact with\nthe game's populace to prove he can win a medal like Felix.<br><br>To do so, Ralph abandons his game and finds himself in a coin-operated\nCandy-Land kart-game, where he befriends a glitch (Sarah Silverman)\nwith racing aspirations.<br><br>Meanwhile, Ralph's own game is in danger of being unplugged.<br><br>Despite its dips into EC rating territory, Ralph's astounding\nanimation, thorough storytelling and cavalcade of 8-bit icons secures\nit a high score.<br><br>Sadly, the only arcade-type appliance Ralph could crawl into nowadays\nis a Sex and the City themed slot machine.<br><br>Green Light<br><br>vidiotreviews.blogspot.com\n"
"\nAfter being dragged to the cinema by my younger sister to watch this I\nwas overly surprised by how great the film actually was. This film had\na great plot which fitted together perfectly! This film was a strangely\nemotional film which had laughter, sadness and happiness all in one,\nthis animated is film is not like any other, it did not directly aim\ntowards the children but to the parents also; with its witty puns and\ngreat voice overs this really got the parents involved in the film.\nAlthough I was rather disappointed as the film claimed to have great\nwell known video game actors from brands such as Sega e.c.t, although\nthese characters had limited lines; for example, Bowser was seen many\ntimes yet had little/no lines and that of sonic for the matter. This\nfilm also claimed to have the well known plumber Mario yet he was never\nseen throughout the film. Overall its a family film like no other and I\nwould highly recommend it to friends and family.\n"
"\nApart from being named Ralph, this movie is wonderfully made, smooth\ntransition and just transfers seamlessly into the real world, if I can\ncall it such, as I do, oftentimes, live in an imaginary one! <br><br>Rings thru even with your on-screen villains, we cannot do without the\nbaddies even in real life! If I could score it more than the limited 10\nI would, vigorously! I've often wondered where my medal has been\nhiding! Hey there's only one life yet tons of medals, but a hero,\nnonetheless is Wreck it Ralph.<br><br>Clean, funny, teary at points but above all wonderful. Well done,\nmasses of appeal, sensational. A treat for the family, single person or\ncouples.\n"
"\nHello friends,<br><br>I watched this movie because I am a Hardcore Gamer. Awesome Movie... no\ndoubt, people who love games will definitely love this game type movie.\nI love this movie because it describe that both good and bad this are\nimportant(seriously if we can not define that what is bad, how we can\nsay what will be good for a thing).<br><br>One more thing I liked about this move is simplicity of the movie and\nhow easily characters from different games are connected to each other.\nRepresentation is very good.<br><br>I will definitely love to see the second part for the movie, if they\nmake one. <br><br>Have a nice time :)\n"
"\nI enjoyed it so much, I could not wait to write a review. Ralph is a\nbad guy in his game. But in the inside he is good. He knows that, but\nothers did not. He wanted recognition as a good guy. That is how his\nadventure begins. In that amazing adventure he meets that cute little\ngirl, he meets a different Felix and discovers an awesome side of life\nhe was totally unaware of. His adventure leads him to various twists,\npresented him with innumerable obstacles. But Ralph with his goodness\nof heart and \"stinkiest brain of all\" overcomes all. At last he\nrealizes the truth. He does not need any medal to prove he is good. To\nwin the hearts of his friends, to be there when needed is all that\nmatters. That is the real challenge, that is the real game. <br><br>The relationship between Ralph and the cute glitch reminds me about\nanother touching animation \"Monster Inc.\". I was waiting all these\nyears for \"Monster Inc\"'s 2nd part. Now at last I have seen a movie\nthat could be compared with that one.\n"
"\nI watched this movie today on PC. I started watching this movie some\ntime back but initially I got bored and then I stopped watching it. But\ntoday somehow I started watching it and I felt how could I miss this\nmovie earlier. Its so entertaining and has a very good story line. I\nliked the animation and overall theme about video games. I liked\neverything about the movie. In fact background music was also good and\ntwo songs near the end of movie are also good. A very good movie\ncompared to the recent animation movie released last year. Honestly I\nwould rate this movie far above any good animation movie at this moment\nI can think of. So you can imagine how well it has gripped my thinking\nnow and I loved this movie so much. Watch this movie if you had played\nvideo games when you were younger and you will definitely enjoy this\nmovie.\n"
"\nWreck It Ralph, an animation film which entertains more adults then\nchildren. I went to see this film in cinema and the room was filled up\nwith different generations and not one person kept a straight face and\ndid not laugh. Video games comes to live.What more could you ask for.<br><br>It keeps you laughing constantly. With the voice of Ralph from the\nfantastic John C. Reilly from the classic Step Brothers, you are sure\nyou love it if you love him. The one thing which was quite bad was the\nfilm is in 3D but there wasn't much 3D stuff. They could of made more\nthings pop out, if you get the jist. Disney animations<br><br>have certainly made a good film which suits every person. I recommend\nfamily's to watch it as that way every one is entertained.\n"
"\nWreck It Ralph is a fantastic movie with a brilliant storyline,a\nterrific voice cast and hilarious characters that you grow very\nattached to.The movie is very funny,with great heart and\nimagination.Its not as good,but its just as good as the Toy Story\nmovies,I could see Wreck It Ralph being just as big,with sequels,theme\npark rides,merchandise,this is Walt Disney Animated Studios very own\nToy Story,so they shouldn't waste what they got,more should definitely\nbe made.The movie is also beautifully animated and caprtures what\nliving inside sn arcade game would really be like.I would recommend\nWreck It Ralph to all fans of Disney animation,it has enough for all\nages of the family to enjoy.<br><br>Set in a video game arcade,Ralph (voiced by John C.Reilly) is sick of\nbeing the bad guy of his game,so he leaves to prove that he is not a\nbad guy.\n"
"\nYes, I loved this because it had all the video game heroes from when I\nwas growing up, but this film is so inventive, stylish and complete, it\nis hard not to like it. The characters are great and the voice actors\nare absolutely brilliant. The humour is top notch and I laughed\nconstantly, even more so than my 6-year-old, who also loved this\nentertaining film. Some say it has a dip in the middle, but I disagree.\nWithout losing any of Disney's sentimental touch, the film moves along\nvery nicely through flamboyant colours and excellent (gaming) worlds\nand leads to a very fulfilling, if somewhat predictable ending, but\nthere is a nice twist thrown in, just to spice things up. Overall, it's\na film that manages to take a brilliant idea and do a lot with it. Of\ncourse, you have the standard morals and emotion linked with any Disney\nfilm, but that's the whole point. The product placement actually works\nreally well, though kids wouldn't understand that side of the humour.\nAnyone who says this is not a good film needs to grow-up. Irony? Well,\nof course it is. :)\n"
"\nI should say as an Adult I should not be reviewing this movie or some\nmay say but this movie was directed with a great piece of art. Apart\nfrom laughter, this movie is riddled with well written emotion through\nout. Kids would love this movie but not as much as an adult. Well done\ndirector and good luck with the nomination.Fantastic Animation !!!<br><br>In this epic age of video games arcade games would be a corner stone\nhidden away in the darkness of a university campus of closed high\nstreet chain. But even so to think that would be a mistake in this\nmovie as the director actually in my mind made me want to play an\narcade game. You probably would not have a clue what I am on about if\nyou haven't watch this story so get out there with your kids and WATCH\nTHIS !!\n"
"\nmany people might not agree, but 2012 has been a pretty good year for\nanimation. With Paranorman, Pirates! Band of Misfits, Frankenweenie,\nHotel Transylvania and Brave (among others), there's been plenty of\npleasing films for all ages. And Wreck-It Ralph is simply an awesome\ncreation by Disney, by far one of their greatest works in quite some\ntime, a beauty. I feel sad that I couldn't watch it on 3D. A must\nwatch! Credit should be given to these guys Rich Moore, Phil Johnston\nand Jim Reardon for coming up with this awesome story and Phil\nJohnston-Jennifer Lee for screenplay.<br><br>Overall a really great movie; Spectacular animation, the bright colors,\nthe set-ups, the environments, the characters all look fantastic, great\nvoice work, emotional and even touching at times, and humorous too.<br><br>Academy Award for the Best Animated Feature Film, is written all over\nit! I wonder how on earth, Golden Globe picked Barve over Wreck-It\nRalphthis film simply doesn't have any competition, its way ahead from\nthe other nominees.\n"
"\nDisney has always surprised me with many amazing movies. This is not a\nfairy tale movie. Well, that's not a problem. I do love fairy tale\nmovies just like the other Disneys'. But this one is different. First\nthought when I look at the posters, I have no idea what does this story\nabout. But when I watched it for the first time, I'm just sitting in\nfront of my screen and my tears falls on my cheeks. Because the movie\nis so emotional!!! And delicious, of course. Makes my mouth wet over\nand over again. High quality animations, real sweets animations, that's\nauthentic. I gotta love Disney, because besides many fairy tales story\never made, this one.. is very, very, very, impressive.. Fun, exciting,\nand probably watched it more than one time. Because it's delicious!!\n"
"\nRalph (John C. Reilly) is tired of being overshadowed by Fix-It Felix\n(Jack McBrayer), the \"good guy\" star of their game who always gets to\nsave the day. But after decades doing the same thing and seeing all the\nglory go to Felix, Ralph decides he's tired of playing the role of a\nbad guy. He takes matters into his own massive hands and sets off on a\ngame-hopping journey across the arcade through every generation of\nvideo games to prove he's got what it takes to be a hero. On his quest,\nhe meets the tough-as-nails Sergeant Calhoun (Jane Lynch) from the\nfirst-person action game Hero's Duty. But it's the feisty misfit\nVanellope von Schweetz (Sarah Silverman) from the candy-coated cart\nracing game, Sugar Rush, whose world is threatened when Ralph\naccidentally unleashes a deadly enemy that threatens the entire arcade.\nWill Ralph realize his dream and save the day before it's too late?\n"
"\nCute movie with some decent voice acting by the leads. I thought Jane\nLynch did not hit the right note, but everyone else was fantastic. I\nwas expecting to hate SIlverman, but was extremely surprised by how\nmuch she put into the role. I was also super surprised to see that Alan\nTudyk was in the movie at all and did a fantastic job as the \"King\".\nwas I would not say that the movie is top of the line, but it I\nthoroughly enjoyed it. I loved the set design and the world building\nwas pretty well done. The biggest issue I had with the movie was\nRalph's motivation kind of lame and drove much of the story. As his\nmotivations changed the story was much more relatable and engaging. <br><br>My favorite part of the movie would be the idea of what it means to be\na good person. It definitely has a really good message that I would\nrecommend kids engage with. Overall it was an enjoyable film, but there\nwas nothing that really caught me. I would watch again and recommend it\nkids.\n"
"\nWatched One Of My All Time Favorite Animated Films 21 Wreck it Ralph\namazing voice Performances from John C. Reilly(Step Brother) as Wreck\nit Ralph , Sarah Silverman(School Of Rock) as Vanellope Von Schweetz\nalso starring Jack McBrayer(30 Rock) as Fix it Felix Jr , Jane\nLynch(Glee) as Sergeant Tamora Jean Calhoun , Dennis Haysbert(Justice\nLeague) and Alan Tudyk(Firefly) as King Candy. The film is very Funny\nan Emotional also me being enjoying Games When I used to go to the\narcade when i was younger really enjoyed also an amazing performance\nfrom Both Reilly and Silverman they both had amazing chemistry Plus I\nreally Liked how they also I really enjoyed the Subplot between Jean\nCalhoun and Fix It Felix Jr it was cute seeing there romance unfold\nalso I really Enjoyed Ralph Characters he didn't want to be bad he was\njust lonely,also Amazing Production Design By Mike\nGabriel(Brave),Screenplay By Phil Johnston(Cedar Rapids) and Direction\nBy Rich Moore (Futurama) A Tribute to Gaming and a Heartfelt Story 9/10\n"
"\nThis film got better and better and went along. By the midway point, I\nthought it was okay, but nothing special, but by the end it turned out\nto be an entertaining film overall. In another words: a strong second\nhalf.<br><br>Make no mistake: this is a kids movie. However, there are things an\nadult can enjoy. While I found very few laugh-out-loud things, it still\nkept a smile on my face for a decent part of it.....and the colors were\nastounding. Please see this on Blu-Ray, if you have the opportunity. I\ndon't have a 3-D player so I can't comment on that aspect. Bet it looks\ncool.<br><br>Overall, a fun film that I'd watch more than once.\n"
"\nfantastic movie! <br><br>Didn't expect much from this when my partner told me what it was about,\nas i am into games, but have never played wreck it Ralph before, or\neven heard of it!<br><br>Loved the \"sugar rush\" game in this film, really think it should be\nbrought out as a real game!!<br><br>I will be buying this on DVD when it comes out, probably twice...one\nfor the kids, one for me :)<br><br>I have always liked Disney movies, and this is another great one to add\nto the collection!<br><br>If your in two minds about watching it, i would give it a watch :)\n"
"\n'Wreck-It Ralph' is a Disney movie that could easily be mistaken for a\nPixar film. It is about Wreck-It Ralph who is a bad guy in an arcade\ngame who is tired of being the villain and leaves his game to get a\nmedal in order to be respected by the good guys in his game.<br><br>The film has some great vocal performances by John C. Reilly, Sarah\nSilverman and Jane Lynch. The story itself is entertaining for both\nchildren and adults simply because there are jokes in it that suit both\ngroups. As far as children's films go it is actually quite\nunpredictable as there are a few revelations and funny scenes that you\ndon't see coming and they take you by surprise. The soundtrack also\nfits this film perfectly; a mixture of popular songs that everyone will\nknow and enjoy with some other arcade-sounding music that works really\nwell in the fast pacing scenes. <br><br>Overall, 'Wreck-It Ralph' is a really nice, heart-warming film that is\nenjoyable for both children and their parents. There are also lots of\nfunny video game references dotted throughout the film that a few\npeople will get.\n"
"\nThis is my favorite animated movie of 2012, and of course Disney's man\nit ought to be good in quality. The story line was good, not a\ncomplicated one that make you to think twice to understand rather\nwatching the visual treat. its enjoyable and love to watch again in big\nscreen.<br><br>Next I would rate very well the music, its the best part of the movie.\nMusic by Henry Jackman quite fits the movie very well. Cinematography\nis quite brilliant, nice creativity by the art director Ian Gooding.<br><br>Director Rich Moore could have taken the way the movie goes in better.\nSometimes it lacks the entertainment part because what I thought was\nnot there which I felt could be better rather what happened in movie..\nHowever, the characters like Ralph , Vanellope , Fix it Felix makes\nhappier..<br><br>Anyway its a visual treat for all. I don't categorize this movie with\ngender. It's suitable for all, every ages could enjoy.\n"
"\nThis movie, from all the movies I've watched this year really made its\nmark. Its the first Disney Movie since Toy Story in which I was just\ncompletely blown away and was left completely in suspense. The\nadvertising does show exactly how Wretch-It Ralph feels about his place\nin the world. I think it actually is a very relatable theme that many\npeople can relate to. Essentially his game and the pressure from the\nsystem is forcing Ralph to be the big bad and unlovable person that he\nwas created to be. Ralph shows them off by his heroic actions in the\nfilm. Besides from the theme the rest of the movie is completely\nunpredictable, and even more so, because of the games and plots that\nconjoin throughout the movie. Without giving spoilers, Wretch-It Ralph\nfinally finds two things that he was looking for. One is what he was\noriginally looking for, and the second which is what he found on his\njourney while looking for the first. The question for him is which of\nthem really give him the value he is looking for.\n"
"\nI loved every second of Wreck-It Ralph. <br><br>The jokes were spot on, the gaming references were plentiful but not\noverbearing.<br><br>The script was tight, and the overall direction, voice acting, and\nanimation were seamless.<br><br>The only reason this didn't get perfect was because at times there were\nsome cheesy moments and lines that were painfully obvious.<br><br>But then I realized, even though I went to see a 10:30 pm screening\nwith my buddy, this was meant to be a first and foremost children's\nflick. And with the exception of odd lines like that I completely\nforgot that I wasn't the target audience, and THAT is pretty amazing.<br><br>I wasn't overly shocked to see that John Lasseter was a producer in\nthis flick!<br><br>9/10 for gamers and non gamers, children and adults!\n"
"\nI wasn't really looking for much going into this movie. I figured there\nwould be a story, some plot development, and something to neaten things\nup in the end. I don't think I was disappointed.<br><br>Wreck-it Ralph starts as a first person account of a bad guy in a video\ngame, quickly jumps from that to a self-help group, moves into some\nother video games where non-pressing problems are resolved, and wraps\nit all up in a ending that may or may not be happy. It was just as flat\nas it sounds. No CGI eye candy. No human interest development. No real\nattempt. I get the sense that the video game theme was meant to carry\nthe picture, but it didn't.<br><br>This film compares well with sequels that were never supposed to be\nshown in the theatre. If you spent time in an arcade or played any\nvideo games the characters do what you would expect. Beyond tugging at\nmemories of past gaming experiences Wreck-it Ralph is just a\ndisconnected collage of those same memories. Watch it and then go play\nsome video games to erase it from your memory.\n"
"\nI've never seen such a film which script is wonderful in Disney films.\nWreck-It Ralph plays a villain in \"Fix-it Felix\", so most residents in\nthe game hate him, but actually, he is a good man and wants to get\nalong with them. Also, he wants to be a hero like Fix-it Felix Jr, so\nhe can not be convinced by his situation. So, he always has an\nemotional turmoil. Not only Ralph but also every character have a\nproblem , so we can empathize with everyone, even if he/she is a real\nvillain.<br><br>Afetr I watched this film, I felt warring emotions which characters in\nit have reflects the actual world. For example, discrimination against\nthe weak or changes of fashion occurs around us. therefore I felt\npainful some times.<br><br>In addition, this film tells us the importance to be ourselves. The\nimport of it is very deep.Pease check it once.\n"
"\nWreck it Ralph sure is a great cute family friendly film! This movie is\nwell written, well animated, and well voiced by the different actors.\nSarah Silverman, one of my favorite people ever, stars as the voice of\nVenelope, and she does such a great job! Her voice fits so well for the\nmain role. And Jane Lynch is a perfect choice for the call of duty like\nfemale gamer role! I really loved how this isn't just one of those\npointless kiddie movies about nothing special, but this is actually a\nvery well thought out film worthy of many big time cinematic roles. The\nplot summary is intricate and very smart, this is not a one dimensional\nmovie, this is such a great movie that anyone and everyone can and will\nenjoy! 8/10.\n"
"\nThis film is fun for all the family. The video games come to life when\nthe shop shuts, and i know people with children who wonder if that\nreally happens now because of this film.<br><br>The story is about a bad guy who wants to show he is not bad inside.\nThe film has good lessons (dont judge people before you know them,\nfriends are better than money). I've seen this film countless times\nbecause the storyline, characters are so original (except for a few\nclassic old video characters who make a brief entrance, like pacman)\nand the right voice has been chosen for each character. Bespite them\nbeing cartoon, I'm sure each of us can relate some way to one of these\ncharacters.<br><br>10 out of 10 for one of my favourite modern cartoon movies.\n"
"\nI love this film so much, that I think for a Wreck-It Ralph 2 that I\nmade up a possible plot about Vanellope Von Schweetz.<br><br>After Ralph's story has finished it's now time for Vanellope to have a\ntrue story to tell of how she got herself abandoned from the game and\nhow she's been restored. Now she takes the lead character role as she\nsearches to find a new lifestyle from being a child to a young adult\nand assembles her friends are all on a mission to magically teleport\nfrom outside of the arcade to the human world to track down a magician\nwho abandoned his game, stoled the golden rings from the Sonic game and\nbecame a famous celebrity in the world.<br><br>Click here to take an important first look for the sequel.\nhttp://walt-disney-animation-studios.wikia.com/wiki/Wreck-It_Ralph_2\n"
"\nI have to admit, this movie really showed a lot of video game icons.<br><br>It even brings back the time where you would only played the games in\ngame arcades before consoles were becoming popular. I found it\ninteresting when they show us what its like when you turn off the video\ngame. I wish that would happen like for real! I was so excited to see\nSonic throughout the movie, he should've really had more lines then\nbeing on a screen board warning the characters to not be killed outside\ntheir games (they aren't because the characters will always be in our\nhearts haha). Or even, he should've been included with the main cast,\nhe would be an awesome partner regardless his sarcasm! In some scenes,\nI thought Sarah Slivermans character was too sweet and childish even\nthough I know she plays a child but still, she should really have made\nher character have a rough personality. Just really like Jane Lynch's\ncharacter! Well done Disney\n"
"\nBeing raised in the age of Atari, Pac-Man and Nintendo, I was more\nexcited than my kids to watch this movie. I took the chance when my\nkids said they wanted to see the movie. I was not disappointed. It was\na great movie and it has an awesome soundtrack which I had to buy. This\nis a movie for little and big. It has great humor for everybody and an\nemotional story too.<br><br>It even has the curses that where made cute so kids would not hear\nthem. I have to say, you should watch this movie if you want to have a\ngood time with your kids, wife, girl or boyfriend, mum, dad or just\nanyone else.\n"
"\neverybody is raving about how good the movie is and i totally agree but\nthere was a message in the movie for kids about morality, the choices\nwe make and that everybody is different and special and that is what i\nfelt most while watching this movie. i think every parent should watch\nthis movie with their kids and have a talk afterwards and the world\nwould be in a better place.<br><br>aside from that the movie was AWESOME and this is coming from a 40 year\nold man. this is a movie for all ages, its funny and rousing and sad\nand touching all at the same time. Kudos to the people that came up\nwith this movie. its entertaining and has strong life lessons in it for\nkids.\n"
"\nWhen I first looked at Wreck-it Ralph I was like \"no, not gonna see it,\nway too childish for me\". But somehow I ended up seeing it anyway -\nwhich I did NOT regret! Even though it's animated this movie just got\nsome things not even all \"real\" movies (which would be the not-animated\nmovies) got. The plot is amazing written and the story is sweet with a\nbit of an edge with a hint of surprise.<br><br>I really fell in love with the characters. Ralph is - which is one of\nthe many things I liked the most - hard as a stone on the outside which\nmake him an outcast, but on the inside he's a total sweetheart and he\nknows it.<br><br>All summed up this is an AMAZING movie. Not only for children. Watch it\nalone, with your friend, your girlfriend/boyfriend, your family or\nsomething completely different - the only thing that matters is that\nyou watch it!\n"
"\nOriginal movie, and not just for kids. Very novel plot - arcade game\ncharacters have a life, away from the video game. With this as a\nbackground, the plot lends itself to many adventures, some in-game and\nsome not.<br><br>Mainly a kids movie. The plot is a tad overly sweet and harmless.\nHowever, there are many emotional moments which will appeal to adults.\nPlus, some jokes and scenarios only adults would understand (not dirty,\njust do rely on knowing more about life and the world).<br><br>John C Reilly is perfectly cast as the voice of Wreck-it-Ralph. Come to\nthink of it, every voice is spot-on. I couldn't think of anyone who\nwould suit Fix-it Felix more than Jack MacBrayer. Similarly, Sarah\nSilverman and Jane Lynch are great as Vaenellope and Calhoun\nrespectively.<br><br>Good, clean fun.\n"
"\nI so very much loved this film! First of all, I'm not a gamer, but I'm\nsure this film will appeal to gamers and arcade-goers all around the\ncountry! However, the only games I play are Candy Crush and Super Mario\nBros. So, even if you're not all that familiar with all the characters,\nyou will still love this movie.<br><br>The film is funny, so a great kids film, with fantastic animation.\nUnlike some kids films, the film has a plot with a few twists and turns\nalong the way.<br><br>I'd recommend this movie for anyone over the age of 0 and under the age\nof 100. I loved it and will definitely be watching it again.\n"
"\nDisney sets a high bar though. The movie was good and entertaining but\nstill, it was kind of forgettable. It had the usual Disney theme of\n\"love yourself, appreciate yourself for who you are, you don't need to\nbe something you're not\", which seemed very familiar since I just saw\n\"Monsters U\" the other day. But when they pound on those poignant\nthemes it always brings a tear to my eye. The movie has masterful use\nof classic storytelling and archetypes, as is expected from Disney.\nGorgeous animation and CGI, from Disney it practically goes without\nsaying.<br><br>I have to complain though: Why did they pick Sarah Silverman of all\nactors, to do the voice of a cute little girl? When I heard the voice I\nimmediately could tell it was her because it sounded so obnoxious and\nout-of-place. The voice of Ralph wasn't that great either, it reminded\nme of Barney Gumble.<br><br>The movie starts out interesting, then has a boring lull in the middle,\nbut then the ending it gets exciting again.\n"
"\nIf you like video games, or if you played any kind of a video game\nanytime in your life, this is a movie that you will most likely love.\nVarious characters from famous titles live in their own game worlds and\nwhen the Arcade room is closed at nights, something that most players\nnever thought about happens. You will see several cool references about\nvideo games in the movie that will make you smile, that will make you\nremember that moment in your childhood when you were having so much fun\npushing some buttons in a device that brought you into another universe\nwhile you were just sitting there. Other than these, Wreck-It Ralph\nalso carefully speaks about friendship and encouragement for both young\nviewers and elders. A must-see if you are already thinking about which\ngame to play tonight.\n"
"\nSome friends saw it and told me it's too Disney-esque. Now that i saw\nit i would say that's not really the issue here. True, from a gamer\npoint of view it falls a little short on paying tribute to the idea.\nAfter the first half hour the video game references are used up, which\nwas a little disappointing. But from a movie point of view it's\ndefinitely one of the better animation movies i've seen.<br><br>This is mostly due to the clever script. It tells the story of two\noutsiders unwillingly joining forces to archive their dream of being\naccepted for what they are, each in their own respect. For a recent\nDisney movie it deals with quite some serious topics like loneliness,\npeer pressure and social exclusion. And it handles those as respectful\nas possible in the sugar-sweet environment it takes place.<br><br>Finally the mandatory happy end kept on the saner side of kitsch, which\nis already a lot to ask nowadays. So yea, this movie is definitely\nworth a watch.\n"
"\nI can fix it! And so a meme was born that day.<br><br>The 1980s had 1960s revivals, while 2000 and on celebrated the 1980's.<br><br>We are in a world with thrilling new CGI games, but still we also\npraise classics like Mario that has his own Harlem shake.<br><br>Well, back to the movie that is a CGI animated Disney hit.<br><br>Just like TRON we enter a Video Game world now here filled with names\nlike Sonic, the Pac Man ghosts and other names old school players like\nme had been grown up with.<br><br>Ralph is a big strong man that lives in a game world with Fix it Felix\nas a revival.<br><br>But he is not that big any more, as he meets a little girl in Sugar\nRush where kids have go kart races.<br><br>Many dangers lies ahead like a mad king, and a swarm of Metroid like\ninsects.<br><br>This movie has something to please all like a little romance, fast\nracers and retro gaming.<br><br>10/10\n"
"\nWreck-It Ralph (John C. Reilly) wants to be more than a bad guy. He\njust wants to be liked. Fix-It Felix (Jack McBrayer) is the guy that\neverybody likes. Sergeant Calhoun (Jane Lynch) is a tough as nail\nsoldier from the game Hero's Duty. Vanellope (Sarah Silverman) is a\nsmart mouthed girl in the game Sugar Rush.<br><br>The animation is reminiscent of old arcade video styles. If you've ever\nplayed those game, you'll get a sense of nostalgia. Disney has got this\npart right. The best part of this must be the story. It's a poignant\nstory of a video bad guy who's trying to fit himself into the group.\nHe's isolated, ostracized, and ignored. But he wants to be more than\nthe stereotype. In a way, don't we all want to fit in and be more\nbetter than what we are.\n"
"\nI haven't seen any cartoon or animated movie for around 2 years until\nthis one comes out at HBO. This is simply the most amazing movie and\nthe story is very promising. I like the story, characters and how\nbeautiful the scenes are.<br><br>Some room of improvements. The story can focuses more on other games,\nfor examples: pacman, street fighter and maybe others minor game such\nas dig dug. The details on other games are not fully revealed. Maybe\nthat can be improved by making the shot to some other games characters\nand their environments.<br><br>One of the cartoon that can make me laugh and shed some tears. Good\njob.\n"
"\n\"Wreck-It Ralph\" is in my opinion one of the best animated movies of\nthe last few years. It can be compared to other great, recent films\nfrom Disney like \"Toy Story 3\" or \"Tangled\". The two are better, mainly\nbecause it lacked the amount of touching moments which were great in\n\"Toy Story 3\" and \"Tangled\". Nevertheless it is still better than\n\"Brave\" which in turn won the Academy Award instead of \"Wreck-It\nRalph\".<br><br>The movie tells a story of a arcade game villain who becomes bored of\nhis \"job\" and sets on a journey to prove himself worthy of being a\nhero. This is a great thing by itself because it shows the great amount\nof imagination. Throughout the whole movie there are many scenes that\ndepict Ralph dealing with various situations like attending support\ngroup, fighting outer space alien bugs or wandering through\ncandy-themed land.<br><br>\"Wreck-It Ralph\" has got what the good film should have; interesting\nplot, unusual setting, full-blooded characters, good music and great\nmessage to the viewers.\n"
"\nNow this is my most favorite Disney movie this past year! some people\nsay they don't get it and they don't know who the characters are and on\nand on... Well I'll start by saying I you didn't have a childhood of\ngames and arcade playing than you won't know half of what's going on.\nMy family has been playing games since the Atari was out and when this\nmovie came out we all knew all the characters from bowser in Mario\nBros. to the bar tender from Tapper. If you don't know your game\nhistory, then this is not your movie...... If you do know your game\nhistory and your child wants to see the movie or get the movie explain\nwho everyone is so your kid isn't sitting there talking and asking\nquestions during the whole film. For parents who don't like their kids\nplaying video games this movies is probably not your choice either so\njust out of confusion, know your game history.\n"
"\nWreck-It Ralph is definitely appropriate for children and lovers of\nvideo games. It is exciting, colorful, and easy to follow. They even\nleft out some of the usual adult oriented innuendo. <br><br>Parents may enjoy the nostalgia of the video arcades. It reminded me of\nwhen video games were simple, and my imagination ran wild with possible\nstory lines and personalities of the characters. <br><br>The story is built around a parallel universe where video game\ncharacters exist and interact with one another - sorta Tron like. It is\nvery creative, and overall I was very impressed. If you are looking for\nan entertaining movie for the family, you can't go wrong with this one.\n"
"\nFrom the get-go, I really enjoyed this film. It was a clever premise,\nthat computer game characters are real and interact with each other.\nThe characters were well drawn, fun and endearing. Typical children's\nfilm in that it speaks to the underdog and outcast being the hero, and\nfriendships being formed unlikely places. For children, to be sure, but\ncertainly enough in it for adults to enjoy. Really enjoyable,\nentertaining and laugh out loud funny in places. Great voice-actor\nperformances from an all-star cast including John C Reilly, Jack\nMcBrayer, Jane Lynch and Sarah Silverman and the design of the entire\nfilm is in the style of many video arcade games, which is clever. Lots\nof little in-jokes and asides for gamers to enjoy.\n"
"\nA great film, almost a film that did not have a princess.. A fairly\noriginal film in setting with a good soundtrack and solid characters,\nthe the interaction between Ralph and Penelope are really special and\noften don't come to surface like this in so called Disney 'family\nfilms'. I loved the design and the film actually felt like the crew\nthat made it enjoyed being on the project, it feels rare but Disney of\nthe past was small cubicles and corporate doctrine, they feel very\nindie in this one particular film with their direction and choice of\nthemes, I think they got a free ride on game culture in general being a\nlarge mash-up to draw inspiration from to begin with, very re-watchable\nand film that stands apart from the usual Disney offerings.\n"
"\nThe concept of Wreck-It Ralph is excellent but the end result maybe\ndidn't live up to the expectation. Seeing the poster for example, one\nmight think that the movie will really feature the characters of the\nclassic video games, but ultimately there are only a few interactions\nwith them and you can count their scenes on the finger of one hand.<br><br>Still, the movie is enjoyable despite the fact that the script revolves\nmostly around the Sugar Rush universe, which isn't bad, but maybe\ndidn't deserve that much room in the story.<br><br>The dialogues are rather well written, and a few puns and product\nplacements smartly add a fun touch to the scenario. Unfortunately, the\nmovie maybe lacks a bit of a more adult humour, more caustic probably,\nor different layers of interpretation like some Pixar productions\nmanaged to do.\n"
"\nDisney's latest animated adventure is a wild ride that nerds and boring\npeople alike will find irresistibly fun! But \"Wreck-It Ralph\" is\nultimately for the gamers, who will likely have more fun chuckling at\nall of the clever in-jokes and cameo appearances by famous video game\ncharacters. Beneath it all is a plot-structure older than Atari, but\nit's the shiny box the story comes in that makes it so desirable. John\nC. Reilly voices Ralph, a video game villain who longs to be loved and\nappreciated, desiring more for himself than his angry job description\ndictates He game jumps (Gasp! What will his home game do without him?)\nin search of a way to become a hero, and in doing so meets new friends\nand risks his life (if you die outside your home game, you die for\ngood) to give them a better one. Sarah Silverman, Jane Lynch, and Jack\nMcBrayer also offer their voices to this high-energy sugar rush that\ngives life to impossible characters and situations in an exhilarating\nway that no one has done since Pixar dunked us deep into the waters of\nAustralia.<br><br>-Thomas Bond\n"
"\nWhen I first read the summary, I thought it'd be an interesting watch;\nespecially because as an 80's child, I highly enjoy any reference to\nthe good old arcade games. I was a little bit disappointed that there\nweren't more of them, however; but not as much that I couldn't enjoy\nthe brilliance of the movie.<br><br>The best thing for me would have to be the characters from the \"Fix it\nFelix Jr\" game moving just like the old 8-bit characters moved in the\nreal games: those unnatural jerky movements. I found that little detail\nendlessly entertaining. The graphics were very good, especially when we\nwere shown \"Hero's Duty\" and \"Sugar Rush\". Vanellope was adorably done\nand I just know that if I'd been a kid still, I would have fallen\nutterly in love with (the sweets in) her (hair).<br><br>I did find some parts of the movie a bit long and I was disappointed\nthat over half of the movie was built around Sugar Rush.<br><br>But apart from that: solid story, solid graphics, lovable characters\nand references to a few 80's Arcade Games. Definitely worth to see!\n"
"\nThis was a really good movie, but I watched it once and didn't really\nhave a desire to see it again. I feel indifferent toward this movie. I\ndon't like the ending and the characters eventually became annoying.\nThe story is very good though, it was fun seeing video game character\ninteract when \"humans\" aren't around. It was sort of like watching Toy\nStory but the \"toys\" are video game characters. This movie brought out\nthe child in me and I love it for that. But, in saying that I also feel\nlike this movie was a bit unnecessary. I guess it does kinda teach a\nlesson, \"learn to love where you are and what you have,\" but I don't\nfeel like it did that in a unique way. I really like the movie but I\nhave no desire to watch it, buy it, or tell anyone about it, It's kind\nof just \"that movie I saw one time, because I was bored.\"\n"
"\nIm sorry everyone but I don't like how Sonys mascot doesn't get any\nrespect yet adhd hedgehog and gay Italian plumber get always attention.\nCrash Bandicoot has sold way more than freaking Qbert I don't thinkg\n99% gamers have even heard about him. The music is horrible dubstep\nmusic they should have used Crash Bandicoot music. The story tells\nabout some fat loser that wants to be a hero and help some annoying\ngirl that you wish would die as soon you see her- Most the movie isn't\neven based in real video game its more like candyland movie so they\nfalse marketed this garbage to gamers. I also fuind the lack of Call of\nduty disgustin How most popular game nowdays doesn't get even small\nrefence when lame chartchers like Sonic can? Disney just went full\nretard with this is movie Reall really bad avoid like plague\n"
"\nWreck it Ralph is a movie that is moving and touching. It is a movie\nthat you really you really need to take your kids and everyone else to\ngo see. I never saw a Disney 3D movie this good before ever that is how\ngood this movie was. If you are looking for a good movie to go see than\nthis is one of the movies. I hope you go see this wonderful film. It is\na heartwarming film that will lift you up that is how sweat it is. I\nhope you enjoy this one of a kind 3D film. It is a masterpiece that you\njust have to go see to believe it.You just need to go see this amazing\n3D film. I hope you enjoy Wreck it Ralph as much as i did. If you are\nlooking for a heartfelt movie than this is it.\n"
"\nThis movie is a blast from start to finish and I wouldn't mind seeing\nit again. When I first saw the trailer showing a CGI movie blending\nvideo game characters within video games. I thought it was a cool idea\nand thought it was going to be a good entertaining flick. But this\nturned out to be a great entertaining flick. Some reviewers compare\nthis movie to the \"Toy Story\" franchise. I can see the connection but\nthis has enough of it's own elements to stand on it's own without it\ngoing in a really gimmicky direction. There is also a bit of emotion\nand heart to this movie and doesn't seem forced in. The protagonists\nare all likable in there own way and I couldn't help but care for all\nthe main characters in this movie. Overall this is probably my favorite\nCGI animated movie of 2012. And can't wait for the sequel.<br><br>9/10\n"
