"\nThis movie is utterly awful unless you are ready for a bad comedy.\nThere are tons of flows. Albania doesn't border Turkey. Istanbul is a\nmagnificent city. In the movie it is portrayed as a third world country\nslam hole. Police in Istanbul have new cars. The girl doesn't have a\ndriver license in the US where everyone drives an automatic. Yet in the\nmovie she hops in a stick stick shift cab and shows some amazing\nskills...So lame... Shots are fired in a hotel, grenades are detonated\nin a middle of a cosmopolitan city ...and there's no Police... The main\ncharacter is taken on a ride for a few minutes and yet he appears to be\nalmost next to the hotel. Albanians converse in English?!\n"
"\nI was unfortunately taken to see the movie, hoping the directors (art\ndirector, etc) would have done a better job since Midnight Express. The\nscenario is full of awkward, hard to be believe events like Kim bombing\nthe whole covered bazaar area which is like one of the most crowded\nparts of the city. While she is doing that, the dad is kept by the\nkidnappers who were stupid enough to leave him alone for hours and let\nhim speak on the phone. He escapes from the place just like that, and\nthen is followed by Turkish police cars from 1970s. Kim who was not\nable to drive automatic car in US, right away makes all these car moves\ndriving a stick Taxi in the most narrowed streets. I also have to\nmention that all the women appeared in the movie were dressed in black\nveils- I don't know why, someone should explain that, also Turkey does\nnot have a border with Albenia. The list goes on, but I don't think its\nworth to spend money or time.\n"
"\nI am a big fan of the first taken movie, it not only had professional\ncinematography but great action, suspense and originality. Now this\nsequel i am ashamed to say was a money grab by the producers. Now Luc\nBesson and Robert wrote the original script without being pressured by\ntheir superiors to be limited to a marketable plot, unfortunately thats\nwhat has happened to Taken 2. <br><br>The plot follows Liam Neeson after the events of the original and well\nits the pretty much an identical situation. <br><br>The climax however is the main issue , it's rushed. It just happens and\nI was left wondering why it just ended so fast. <br><br>I cannot say this movie was terrible because it wasn't, it was just a\nmovie that could not even close live up to its predecessor due to lack\nof depth and originality. <br><br>Don't waste your money at the cinemas Wait till its on DVD\n"
"\nThe movie was very stupid and naive. Producers did not bother to make\nanything meaningful assuming that people will go watch it anyway. What\na disappointment. Nothing has remained from the realistic first part.\nThis one is more like a naive boring drama with infrequent heroic acts\nof Liam Neeson. In fact, most of the time he looks like a pompous clown\ntrying to be serious while playing a stupid script. As in a regular\ncheap movie, bad guys are not really bad and are very respectful to the\nmain characters, always giving them plenty of time to talk and to run\naway. What irritates even more is ridiculously large amount of product\nplacement. Save your time and money, don't watch this movie in\ntheaters.\n"
"\nWhat an utter disappointment. Like many fans of the original Taken, I\nwas looking forward to a sequel to see if it could match or in any way\nsurpass the original. I am afraid that as as sequel I am left perplexed\nat the lack of any tension, real action and pace in the film. The\nvillains were not as nasty as they should be- after all they were\nseeking revenge for the slaughter of friends and family and all\nappeared not all intimidating. There was no sharp dialogue and some\nscenes bordered on the risible especially when Liam Neeson was trying\nto give directions to his daughter on his whereabouts. The finale was\nrushed and overall the film lacked any bite or interest. Dull,\nunimaginative-only Liam Neeson kept what glimmer of hopes alive by his\nsolid acting. However, a real shame the film could not even match or\nequal the original. Do not waste your time- see the original Taken and\nleave this sequel alone.\n"
"\nTerrible and a major disappointment to anyone that loved Taken like I\ndid! Weak plot, terrible action and preposterous storyline make it\nlaughable. I know the first one was far fetched but much more\nbelievable. Takes away from the first one!!! The fact that Kim couldn't\nget her license and then magically can drive a stick shift is\nludicrous. The fight scenes were filmed too close up to see and the\nAlbanians were made to look like total idiots by missing every shot and\nLiam landing everyone of them. The story was slow to start and seemed\nfilled with fluff. The movie ends without a real build up leaving you\nwondering..... What just happened?!\n"
"\nI Liked the movie but they should know more details about Turkey! Even\nmy girlfriend she is from Russia, she told the city doesn't seem like\nIstanbul . Albania doesn't have border between Turkey.Budget is\n$45,000,000 How come did you find 80's police cars , Even those cars\nnot driving anymore for 20 years! I never seen before Covered Women in\nTurkey like a Arabian Countries. In the movie every women have black\ncover.Mostly people in USA drive Automatic cars and the girl didn't\npass driving test 2 times but The girl drives a manual car perfectly in\nTurkey. How come ? If you didn't go Istanbul before you won't go to\nIstanbul after this movie.It is not fair!I think Taken 1 was better\n"
"\nAs the the first movie was awesome,we were looking forward to watch\nthis movie.But when the film was over we were terribly disappointed.I\ndon't know where to start telling the nonsense of the scenes which were\nshot in İstanbul.First of all Turkey(Türkiye) doesn't have a\nborder(looks like a car park barrier) with Albenia.Also Albanians\ndoesn't have a relation with prostitution as the Turkish people are not\ntortures as well.I think it's about the film maker's point of view to\nTürkiye. The police cars in the movie were 1980 models and they are now\nexhibiting in Tofaş museum.Our police cars are recent as our\nbuildings.But there is a huge difference between the buildings in the\nmovie and the buildings in İstanbul.Director was focused in the old\nİstanbul called Historical Peninsula and in this area there are so many\nancient buildings bazaars and mosques. In modern İstanbul most of the\nwomen does not wear veils as the men in İstanbul doesn't have beards\nlike pilgrims. In conclusion İstanbul is not this,Turkish people are\nnot these.Albanians are not these.\n"
"\nFirst off, I enjoyed the film, and think it was worth the money I paid\nto see it. While other reviewers have been beating this film down, I\nfind that the story itself was carefully structured in the beginning\nand grants it believability from that point. By carefully structured,\nI'm mostly talking about the way an ex wife brings her daughter to\nIstambul to see her ex-husband.<br><br>The action sequences are, frankly, amazing. But not being an action\njunkie, I tend to go more for the story. What bothered me about the\nstory was the portrayal of Kim Mills' boyfriend, and the resolution at\nthe end of the film.<br><br>Just to note, the sequence on the rooftops of Istambul, someone\nmentioned it was believable, I wholeheartedly agree... let's just say\none of the characters put guts and enthusiasm on display without\nsuddenly becoming an expert... 'nuff said...<br><br>I loved Taken, I enjoyed Taken 2.\n"
"\n***** contain spoilers****** what a mess, a very boring film,\npredictable, and the fight scenes are stupid. Liam is getting old and\nthey had to move the camera so fast to cover his slow movements. Kim\nwho failed to pass the driving test is suddenly do those chasing scenes\nin Istanbul. the gang let him speak freely to his daughter while being\ncaptured without any interruption. he didn't even try to lower his\nvoice while calling Kim. Making the villains as Muslims looks awkward,\nspecially that there was no sign about that in the first Taken. In\naddition, Muslims don't name their kids with western names such as\n\"Marco\"!!!!!!!. Simply, it seems that the film makers have problems\nwith Muslims. and they wanted to make some non-reasonable changes to\nthe plot. Please respect the audience minds<br><br>On the whole, I regret watching this awful movie.\n"
"\nHmm where do I start? 1. He drives a 7 series what did those cops drive\nagain? 2. He reminds me of Commando, he literally beats up 20+ villains\nsingle-handedly without shedding a sweat who does that? 3. Still\nwaiting for the real villains, ones which will actually keep an eye on\nhim and get the revenge they longed for so long 4. The anti-Muslim\nissue is getting rather old now + we have Homeland for that 5. How is\nit my villains (i) let him make a phone call with his i-phone\nsubsequent to that do not even frisk him upon his capture 6.What's\nhappening in the end? #lost<br><br>Will not bother mentioning how badly scripted and directed the motion\npicture is(beyond predictable, sup with the story line) In conclusion\nsome things are best left un-sequelled\n"
"\n1. Tropoja located in north east of Albania doesn't not have Islamic\nradicals, they eat pork and drink Raki like every Albanian, People from\nTropoja maybe the mos brutal bands in Albania but they do not relate to\nIslam or Trukey<br><br>2. The film make a bad image of Albania (again) and also of Turkey. You\ncan see how they pass the border, the border is like a border of the\nsecond world was ad every body know that East turkey is a wonderful and\nbeautiful and modern also. Istanbul Police Cars are sh1ty cars from 30\nyears ago and that's not true. I've been in Istanbul and the real\nbeauty of it isn't shown in the Film.<br><br>3. Film film increase the hate between East and West and shows to the\nAmerican people how bad is Turkey. There are no Terrorists or Islamic\ngroups. Istanbul and Tirana (especially Tirana) are one of the most\nsafe capitals on Earth<br><br>Screw Hollywood<br><br>With Respect...\n"
"\nI have just saw this movie and in rush to tell anybody that still not\nseen it please Don't... not only to save money but more important to\nnot make you angry.<br><br>How can the Director, the Writer to not use the common sense ?? It will\nnot increase cost. The movie assumes that its audience are stupid\nenough. All in all it is against common sense and the crews are\nirresponsible to spend money that way.<br><br>How can an old man from somewhere in Albania bring tens mob to istanbul\nwith all resources needed arrange everything but failed to kill one\nperson?<br><br>Taken 1 was superb. Taken 2 is rubbish.\n"
"\nthis is my first time to write a review and thought of it as an\nobligation . yesterday I went to watch it under the impression that it\nwill be as good as taken 1 , but its not . the story line in taken 1\nwas more strong as it was driven by the love of dad for his daughter\nand of how extreme he can go to save her and that was touchy . I can't\nunderstand why do they have to involve Islam into this and to show that\nMuslims are that bad , they could have leave it open without indication\nto any religion, just gangs . by this they tried to show Muslims as if\nthey are very bad they kidnap girls they don't keep their words which\nis not the fact . what did this add except falsification of the image\nof Islam . if you are against disfavor between religions don't watch\nthis. but if you like action , and you can ignore the story line then\nyou might enjoy it\n"
"\nThis movie is so ridiculous. People magically learn how to drive a car.\nOthers just burst into embassy and walk out of it as if nothing\nhappened. And its nothing special to throw around grenades in a crowded\narea. Also there are huge geographical mistakes. There is no border\nbetween Albania and Turkey. Also not every woman in Istambul wears a\nburka. This is a really bad movie. I mean I really like movies like the\nfirst part and The Transporter but this is just ridiculous. Actually\nyou can see that Liam Nesson is really trying to play a good role, but\nthe script is so bad, he just can't. The worst thing is that they have\nalready announced a third part.\n"
"\nTaken 2 is the continuation of part one Taken. More or less story is\nsame. Liam Nesson will keep your eyes attached to the screen by his\naction moves in the whole movie.<br><br>The screen play of the movies is great. I would say very well written\nand very well performed by the actors. The movie also shows the emotion\nof a father or an ex-husband, who can be very dangerous who can be very\ndangerous if you mess with his family.<br><br>If you like realistic movie which contains action and thrilling scenes,\nyou won't regret watching this.<br><br>From my side, it is 9/10.<br><br>Thanks to the team of Taken 2 for doing a great job.\n"
"\nsince 2008 I have been watched the first taken over and over. I was\nexpected great one from taken again. the first day of screen I went to\nsee Taken 2 but it was very awful this time. there are many objections\nabout this movie that i can mention, and it is impossible to combine\nall of objections here. actually i could not find any positive point to\nmention about taken 2. the very ugly view and different view of Turkey\n(Istanbul), clumsily acting from actors and actress. all the dialogue\nwas exactly copy from first taken and there was not any new dialogue.\nand many other points that it is not expected from this movie which it\nhad great background from first taken. Taken 2 was not enjoyable for me\nat all and i think it created to get more money for producer only.\n"
"\nThe retired CIA agent Bryan Mills (Liam Neeson) invites his teenage\ndaughter Kim (Maggie Grace) and his ex-wife Lenore (Famke Janssen), who\nhas separated from her second husband, to spend a couple of days in\nIstanbul where he is working.<br><br>Meanwhile, the patriarch of the community of the Albanese gang of human\ntrafficking, Murad Krasniqi (Rade Sherbedgia), seeks revenge for the\ndeath of his son and organizes another gang to kidnap Bryan and his\nfamily. Bryan and Lenore are abducted by the Albanese, but Kim escapes\nand is the only hope that Bryan has to escape and save Lenore. \"Taken\"\nwas the best action movie of 2008 and Liam Neeseon surprised the viewer\nwith a performance that recalled the best 007 movies. Unfortunately he\nshould have stayed in the first movie, since this sequel is terrible.<br><br>\"Taken 2\" is a bad quality replay of the first movie, with an awful\nstory. There is excessive use of clichés and in the end this movie is a\ncomplete waste of time. My vote is four.<br><br>Title (Brazil): \"Busca Implacável 2\" (\"Implacable Search 2\")\n"
"\n'Taken' was a rough and dirty bloodbath that defied the odds and became\na smash at the box office, almost recouping ten times its $25m budget\nand reinvigorating Liam Neeson's career as a tough old son of a bitch\nin the process. It didn't have expectations to live up to, making it\neasier to enjoy. On the other hand, this follow-up has had the bar set\nat a modest height, and fails to reach it. Plot is never at the top of\nthe priority list for revenge-thrillers, so the bare-bones story can be\nforgiven; what can't go unnoticed though is the awfully clichéd\ndialogue (\"We will have our revenge\" hisses the cardboard cut-out\nvillain) and the muted action sequences. Seemingly out of puff, both\nthe movie and Neeson's ex-CIA operative Bryan Mills meander along\nchecking off the 'action-for-dummies' boxes, but never deliver any real\npulse-racers. The violence is unusually meek, the climactic showdown\nfizzles when it should burst and, most visibly, Neeson is perhaps\ngetting too old for this sh*t.\n"
"\nfirst of all , story is far from persuasiveness. anybody can produce\nbetter scenario in a 30 minutes deliberation. besides, acting is\nterrible, i mean really \"terrible\". idiotic conversations make the\nmovie extremely boring. in addition, i can honestly say that this\nproduction is malevolent. i live in Istanbul, please google \"Istanbul\"\nand see what it is. you cant see those cars on the roads in Istanbul,\nthey are antique! you cant see those women in the streets. producers\naimed to demonstrate Turkey as \"Afghanistan like 3. world country\"\ndeliberately. shame on them. nobody should use art for abuse. i condemn\nthis kind of ideological behaviors.\n"
"\nI have visited istanbul several times and the city shown in the movie\nis not istanbul or I have never been to İstanbul...istanbul is a very\nmodern, crowded (withover 13 million population) European city. this\nmovie is either shooted to insult one of the most beautiful city in the\nworld or they cut the budget and casted in poor and cheap places or\nused cheapest tools ever... if you are really willing to know about\nistanbul (so that you can easily understand how bad the movie was made)\njust hit youtube and compare the real one and the unreal one...when\nusing the name of the city in your movies you can not mislead audiences\nunless it is a fiction one...\n"
"\nI'm a Turkish guy and i assure you all its almost everything a lie\nabout Istanbul in this movie.<br><br>First of all clearly we have mini coopers as police cars secondly we DO\nNOT let anybody no matter who to take some innocent girl right in\npublic place the Turkish people are so protective about this.<br><br>And the most funny thing about Istanbul is you basically can not throw\na bomb to random place because this city has almost 20 million\npopulation and you could kill like 500 people if you'd throw a bomb to\nrandom roof or something because its almost full of people especially\nin that such old city.<br><br>I can not let this go without saying anything about the final fight ..\ngosh.<br><br>Worst fight scene ever IMO, they didn't even fight they just kissed\neach other and the bad guy crushed his head to gobektasi (that big\nstone in Turkish bath) oh guys believe me that really hurts.\n"
"\nNo this is NOT the worst movie of 2012, it fact there are so many other\ncrappy movies out there that in comparison, this movies is pretty darn\ngood. BUT.....this movie really isn't very good, it's predictable, the\nacting is robotic and stiff, the action scenes are almost laughable,\nLiam Neeson moves like he's an old man with arthritis, the bad guys are\nso stupid that they don't deserve to live, and yet will all that said\nthis is still kind of a fun movie to watch. The problem is I loved the\noriginal TAKEN movie, so when this one came along I went into it with\nhigh hopes, and there in lies the problem. Had I read a review like\nthis prior to viewing, I think I wouldn't have been so sorely\ndisappointed. For those of you who also enjoyed the original TAKEN, let\nme now warn you, this is a hollow shell of a sequel, but as action\nmovies go, this is not a total waste either, thus I rate it a 5 star\nout of a possible 10.\n"
"\nI have never written a review before but I felt I had to after watching\nthis film despite the 1 star ratings. <br><br>My opinion is as follows<br><br>The only purpose of my review is to say ignore the idiots who have\nrated this film badly because if you enjoyed the first one you will\nlove this one (if you didn't like the first one don't watch this one\nbut that goes without saying)<br><br>It is a good action film that yes has some unrealistic scenes but don't\nall good films ???<br><br>I would say this film is well worth watching\n"
"\nHow does this terrible sequel have a 6.4 on this website? Have people\nreally lowered their standards that much on movies? I mean c'mon. This\nmovie was filled with so much fake BS it was ridiculous. List go to the\nlist shall we: The fight scenes where terrible compared to the first\nones fight scenes, the bad guys weren't menacing at all, the daughter\nbecomes an expert wheelman in 5 minutes, apparently you can throw\ngrenades in a heavily populated area with absolutely no repercussions,\nthe gun sound effects where completely wrong (ex. apparently 9mm\npistols sound like they shoot .45acp rounds),I could not take the main\nbad guy seriously at all because he looked like the Dos Equis guy. The\nlist goes on and on. How this movie has this high of rating I have no\nidea, this is a 3 star movie easily. The only reason I gave it a 4 was\nbecause of Liam Neeson. The director and everyone involved should be\nashamed of themselves for making such a terrible sequel.\n"
"\nFirst of all, movie was actually quite good. Acting was good, music was\ngood. But, i have some words to Luc Besson.<br><br>Luc Besson , why you work really hard to show turkey/Istanbul as 4th\nworld country city ?<br><br>Every woman in the movie wears like a some ultra Islamic Arabian woman.\nReally ? This is not you can see it in Turkey. In reality there are\nsome small areas like that. Probably less than America.<br><br>And the cars ? You showed police cars that we used is 1980's.\n\"Murat124\" is the name of that models. I actually wonder how you can\nmanage to find them.<br><br>Is this your way to show us like really under-developed country ?<br><br>Shame on you.<br><br>BTW: Liam Neeson was/is awesome.\n"
"\nThis movie follows on from Taken 1 which was also fantastic! (If you\nliked Taken 1 - you will not be disappointed with Taken 2). Normally\nsequels are not as good as the first movie but this is an exception. It\nshows a reality that most of the time people from the first world\ncountries cannot even imagine such situations to be real. All actors\nperformed their roles flawlessly. The story is really concrete and the\naction is one of the best. It is also good to see Istanbul in this\nmovie from a more real perspective and not the touristic image that is\nnormally sold. The music is perfect and the sensation throughout the\nmovie makes you feel like you are right in the thick of it. I advise\nyou to take a deep breath. You will need it. Forget bad comments about\nthis movie. This is 10 out of 10 and a must-watch and should be better\nrated on here.\n"
"\nI usually don't write out reviews but for this one I am writing because\nthere are so many negative remarks on this one. I don't know why. If\nyou loved the first one then you'll adore this one. The people\ncriticizing about the action by his daughter in the movie are funny\nbecause if you actually watch the movie, it is all convincing. The\nstory and the plot makes perfect sense according to the movie and it\nsurprises you every now and then just when you get your hopes high. <br><br>The movie kept me engaged from starting to end. The plot is very\nintelligent and the action is amazing as usual. I liked it and don't\nhave a single point where the movie lets you down.<br><br>If you haven't done so already, watch this one! Its gonna be a 90\nminutes fun ride. Go For It!\n"
"\nTaken 1 was great and had an impact. It made it easy to believe that it\nis possible to be so swift/effective as Bryan Mills has been a CIA\noperative.<br><br>Taken 2 stretched it beyond boundaries making me feel I am watching a\nfairy tale or an act of wizardry. Location was good, the plot\nunderstandable<br><br>Where Hollywood inspire Indian movies ... Luc Besson or Olivier Megaton\nseem to have been bitten by an Indian movie.<br><br>Indian heroes can throw and catch live unpinned grenades, stare at a\nbullet out of the barrel and it will turn it's course, trains at full\nspeed can go reverse just by staring or waving the hand. A punch from\nthe hero will kill the opponent and the hero can survive with a bullet\nstraight into his heart.<br><br>Taken 2 will not beat those, however gives a tough fight to such movies\nfrom India.\n"
"\nFirst of all,I was really excited to see Taken 2.As I watched the film\nand laughed a lot,i was hopeful for the whole film.<br><br>If you ever seen Istanbul,you would know that Taken 2 is horrible.They\nboard on a ship from Europe to Asia but they are still in Europe side\nof Istanbul.Cop cars are from 1970 ( production fail). Entire movie is\nfilmed around Grand Bazaar and thats it. U.S. Embassy is not protected\nlike that by the way.Writers should have been more creative and careful\nabout the scening.They thought nobody knows Istanbul I guess.<br><br>Action scenes is too fast that I couldn't catch anything.Story was\nexciting though.Liam Neeson's performance was great.The movie could\nhave been better in my point of view\n"
"\nWhen I enjoyed the first taken I was surprised and although I don't\nnormally follow the 'hype' I thought taken 2, bring it on. Oh dear. The\nplot is ridiculously predictable and any allusion that the film is\n'funny' or 'poking fun at itself' is grossly overstated. This is a very\npoor movie with anachronistic sets, terrible action movie one-liners\nand some shocking fight sequences. By the end of the movie I was\nactually angry, this feels like a rushed together nonsense made to ride\nthe tidal wave of the first movie, hmm, Hollywood aping on the success\nof a popular movie by making an asinine sequel, I won't hear it.\nDespite all of this, it's an entertaining hour and a half, just not of\nthe quality that would bring anything like the 6.7 average rating it\ncurrently has. If this went straight to DVD or was a TV drama I would\nhave been a bit more forgiving. A well spent 45 million dollars!\n"
"\nI am really surprised that this movie did this well in the first\nweekend. Movie was not that great. For sure not better than the first\none. I think that movies have been so bad lately that people have let\nstandards slip or are just so hard up for some thing that is not a\ncomic book/remake of an older movie/old TV sit com turned bad movie\nthey are will to pay for any thing they think has some guts to it.\nMovie scene very poor right now. Where have all the good/great people\ngone. I do not want to see Harrison Ford in his 90's jumping around\nbullets in Indian Jones cause no one else can do it. Come on people,\nwhat the hell is wrong with you.\n"
"\ni want to make sure no one gets scared off and doesn't see it. i\nthought it was a really good movie , if you liked the first one. The\nway people judge movies sucks, and ill be quick and make it simple.Liam\nNeeson is still a bad ass and a great actor, the story still keeps your\nattention even if its not as real as the other story. Then as soon as\nit becomes tense again, Liam reminds you who the real bad ass is and\ntakes care of business. They did a good job shooting the film and the\nstory line is a good one for a second movie. Not to mention you get\nsome more cool intel on killing people and sercets of finding people.\ngo see it , you'll enjoy it!!!!\n"
"\nWhere can i start from? I don't know! I know Istanbul very well and\nthis is not real Istanbul which really exits. 1) All women in Istanbul\nnot in black clothes. The women views of movie belongs to 16th Century\n2)These police cars are not original police cars. Turkish police never\nused cars something like that. The movie has taken in 2012 but cars\nbelongs to 1960s. 3) Taken and Taken2, all polices are venal. Horrible\nidea 4) Ezan (the song which Imam sings to call people for praying is\nnot 7/24 on line 5) Albanians can't pass borders of Turkey like that.\n6)Bryan Mills is the man who has endless numbers of bullets - Really?\n7) You can't never enter into American Embassy like that, at least not\nlive. And i count many many. This movie was taken sloppy and careless.\nI don't advice anyone to watch.\n"
"\nIn Istanbul, retired CIA operative Bryan Mills and his wife are taken\nhostage by the father of a kidnapper that Mills had killed in the first\nmovie while Mills was trying to rescue his daughter. <br><br>This film lacked the thrills and suspense from the first movie,\nproviding limited excitement and intriguing moments. What it lacks is\nthe suspense built-up like the first movie, which we got when we see\nMills going through highs and lows and twists and turns to find his\ndaughter. This movie merely is merely a repeat of the kidnapping, but\nwith the daughter trying to be the rescuer. However, the mission is\nshort-lived and its results just leads to a gun fight between the good\nand bad guys - nothing too special.<br><br>Overall, a mediocre film. I would just stick to the original.<br><br>Grade C\n"
"\nAfter I watched Taken, I immediately rented Taken 2 this weekend,\nhoping the same adventure and excitement would continue, also being a\ncitizen, wanted how my country has been reflected (after the Bond\ncatastrophe I expected much more realistic scenes from Taken) but the\ndirector Mr. Olivier Megaton either has not been to the country or just\nlooked onto the streets behind dark glasses or alternately might have\nclose relations with the current government which has tendency to turn\nus to Iraq someday. You may see a few dark covered scarfed women\nunfortunately but not all of them are like this. Not even mentioning\nthe unrealistic parts related with the local police and peoples'\ninsensitivity to bombs and things like that.<br><br>So I decided not to watch any of this directors films with the\nexpectation of reflecting the locations' realities.\n"
"\nTaken 2 is a satisfying sequel to the original Taken film, though this\ntime around feels more Bourne Identity driven in global turmoil and\nadrenaline action sequences than the international espionage aspect and\nhuman trafficking of the first film. This is a theme that I did miss in\nthis return to the franchise but the film clearly makes up for it in\nthe form of high speed chases and heart racing suspense. Taken 2 still\ndoes hold on to the themes of a father/daughter bonding in the midst of\ntotal insanity and constant assassination attempts but to me it\nwouldn't be a Taken film without it. The film expands on the previous\nplot of the first film and wraps it up by the end of this one while\ndelving into more background about the enemy and characters surrounding\nit.<br><br>Overall Taken 2 doesn't bring anything new to the series but continues\nto allow Liam Neeson to continue his international campaign of\nbadassery to those who would even attempt to ruin his vacation and/or\nabduct his family members. Another volume in Liam Neeson's\ninternational guide of global a**kicking!\n"
"\nThis movie should have more credit, it's not as bad as people say in my\nopinion. I watched it in cinemas without watching the first and i\nreally enjoyed it. However i watched the original Taken a few weeks ago\nwhich was amazing that is why i have dropped Taken 2 from an 8 to a 7.<br><br>It's not as good as it's predecessor but it's still and enjoyable\nmovie. what really bugged me in the movie was the villains allowed\nBryan Mills to talk to his daughter giving her instructions on what to\ndo i thought that was stupid. However overall i liked this movie and\nthe acting was still brilliant and it still just about had it's\nsharpness that the first one had. But one thing to the producers do not\nmake another Taken. 7/10\n"
"\n...since that is assuredly what happened to audiences worldwide. The\nfirst film was really no great shakes, but at least maintained a sense\nof consistency and reality that didn't leave viewers shaking their\nheads. This follow-up from the same writing team of Luc \"The\nProfessional\" Besson and Robert Mark \"The Fifth Element\" Kamen just\ndoesn't cut the mustard, the cake, or even the cheese. It's tired,\ntrite, and terminally boring, and I can't really blame the new\ndirector, Olivier \"Columbiana\" Megaton. It's all in that lackluster\nscript, as is always the case in duds like this one. Liam \"Thanks for\nthe paycheck\" Neeson brings nothing new to the table (and hasn't for\nquite some time now), and the rest of the cast is, well, happy to take\ntheir paychecks, too. In a nutshell: utterly disposable and\nforgettable. Don't let yourself be taken as well; there are far too\nmany better films out there for you to be wasting your time with this\none.\n"
"\nHere we go again with Liam Neeson's ex-wife and daughter in peril from\nvery mean Albanians. This time, Neeson is in Istanbul, Turkey, when the\nfather of one of the guys he killed in the first film gathers his flock\nof gangsters to kill Neeson. His family happens to be there, and so, he\nmust rescue them from the evil villains. Nothing new in this go round,\nbut Liam makes the ninety two minutes go by briskly, and in spite of\nhis extremely annoying offspring, I was able to tolerate the spoiled\nbrat and just sit back and laugh at the adventure. Leave your brain at\nthe door and have some fun watching the big Irishman having a grand old\ntime.\n"
"\nThe main difference between Taken and Taken 2 is the vibe of film.\nTaken was an action,mystery,thriller. Taken 2 is more of the\nstereotypical \"Man movie.\" Minor spoilers start here.<br><br>Taken 2 is more action orientated, with more shooting and hand-to-hand\ncombat than any other element. In Taken, Liam Neeson was constantly\nlooking for leads and almost losing the trail once or twice, but in\nTaken 2 he is in one city where all he has to do is listen to the\nsounds around him so he can track down his enemy. Another problem is\nthe close quarters combat scenes. Punches and hits flash so fast it's\nlike you've gone back to the 90s and turned on an episode of Power\nRangers (there is an uncut version I haven't seen, so things might be\nclearer in that.) Taken 2 is best seen only if you've seen Taken to\nknow why Liam Neeson is being targeted by the villains and if you want\nto see the next chapter in Brian Mills' life, not if you're just\nlooking for a Friday night action flick.\n"
"\nI did not expect Taken 2 to be good as original Taken, but I thought at\nleast I would be satisfied and enjoy my time watching the movie. After\nwatching movie I was disappointed. I felt like I wasted my time. Only\none thing in this movie was good and that was performance of Liam\nNeeson. I liked other performances also, but it wasn't enough to save\nthe movie. Director couldn't help himself to spoil the memory of\noriginal movie by nonsense ideas. The ideas are so wrong but somehow\nthey seem to work, I am not saying this but perhaps director Olivier\nwas thinking this while he was creating this movie with full of\nnonsense ideas.<br><br>One of my friends was saying that \"you are thinking of Taken that's why\nyou didn't like taken 2. If you see taken 2 first then there is a\nchance that you will like it.\" But I say there is nothing you can do to\nlike this movie. Taken was a masterpiece and I agree too that it cannot\nbe remade but at least we expected some sense in Taken 2 but it failed.\n"
"\n* in turkey we are not using that old cars , its not legal to use that\nold car but polices are using in movie ... fun . of course im not\nvoting low for this. <br><br>* The movie unsuccesfull to use istanbul , every thing was going fast.\nframes were really bad. Liam Neeson also is a good actor but cannot\nmove in fast fighting scenes any more in my opinion. Give him some\nDrama movie .. He is really good at that worry &amp; sad looks.<br><br>* I cannot say i didn't enjoy the movie , it was good for killing time.\nBut there was almost no story in taken 2. some reflection of taken 1\nthats it. <br><br>* i didn't get that first granade bomb what for. you can already can\nmake bigger circle to cross other without bombing that was so stupid. i\ncan get other granades some how but first one was ridiculous.<br><br>* lets came acting . Acting was only good thing in this movie. <br><br>*** if you wanna watch a movie with full of non stop blindless action\nscenes you can watch taken 2 .\n"
"\nThis movie is one of those nowadays modern abominations. It's super\nsimple in every way, so idiotic it's insulting to one's intelligence.\nThe proof to that is that by the time the credits roll, you'll feel\nlike you haven't really watched anything, like you were looking at a\nblank screen for an hour +. That's how dumb it is. <br><br>The thing with this type of modern, so-called \"action films\" is that\nthey aim at being simple and mind-numbing intentionally. Deep down we\nall know they're not really movies, just replications of those older\nreal action flicks, their plots and characters. This is why you all\nknow how there's not point in describing the plot of characters of\n\"Taken 2\". The only supposed value here could be the replication\nitself, since it's taking inspirational content from old classics, or\nthat it's all being ironic! in the sense of \"oh my god, it's so bad\nthat it's good!\" <br><br>Of course, this theoretical idea of \"value\" makes no sense at all and\nnever works. Seriously, keep away from this turd. Read a book or\nsomething.\n"
"\nVery disappointing. It is supposed to be about Albanian revenge towards\nX- CIA agent and played in Istanbul. Action!!! But it's actually just\nstupid! Shame on the director and script writer. At least, if you\nreally want to make money, be realistic about it. Place geographical\nlocations where they are not where you like them to be. Portray\npeople's cultures as they are not as you like them to be seen. If\nAlbanians want revenge they don't wait. they don't hold you captive not\nfor a second. Also, in the end \"the father\" gives Liam his word that he\nis going to end \"it\" but picks up the gun and tries to shoot him?? That\nis so lame. When Albanians give their word they would die before they\nbreak it, everyone knows that. Also, I read the names of the cast\nmembers and there is not one real albanian playing a role, they are all\nturks. Anyway, based on the ending I am 100% sure there is a third\ncoming. Go study some geography and international studies as a toddlers\nstep.\n"
"\nThis the worse movie of 2012 perhaps. Taken 1 was a really good one.\nThis one is not only terrible in acting but also script. If you love\nthe story that Americans never die and with a small gun they can concur\nthe world, take your flag and march to the movie theaters. It is also\nfull of mistakes. The point of capture and point of torture is not the\nsame however somehow our hero in the movie counts the seconds after his\ncapture in Istanbul, a city with over 20 million people and one of the\nlargest metropolises in Europe. His wife and himself are taken hostage\nat the European side and brought to a place in Asian side. A journey\nwhich usually takes an hour but our hero remembers every second, every\nturn and every sound of it. Secondly when a prayers comes (5 times a\nday and lasts for 2 minutes) from a mosque he uses this as one of the\nsigns to remember where he was captured. Movie shows that prayers from\nthe mosque never ends. Terrible acting, terrible script, terrible\nediting.\n"
"\nAs great as the first film was, there was no need to make a sequel.\nDon't get me wrong I was looking forward to watching this but deep down\nI knew I was going to be disappointed. First film was a great edge of\nyour seat suspense from beginning to end. This poor excuse of a sequel\nwas the complete opposite. It was too short, no suspense and making it\na 12a rating didn't help as it took away the violence ( which made the\nfirst film even better )<br><br>If you looking for a normal action film then it was okay. Very\npredictable but easy watching, but of course your going to compare it\nto the first film and it's no where near as good. <br><br>If your a fan of the first film then I recommend to stick to that and\nsave your money and time with watching Taken 2. However, if your\nlooking for an average, predictable yet easy watching action flick then\nI recommend Taken 2.\n"
"\nFirst of all, I did give this an average rating for the acting and\naction. It did not put us to sleep. That said, this film was very\nordinary with no twists or anything shocking . It had that feel of a\nromantic comedy where everything that you expect happens. The film just\nveered along smoothly and that was the problem. In other Liam Neeson\nmovies, \"Taken\" and 'The Other Man\" come to mind; There were twists\ngalore , which made for an exciting movie going experience. It was\nclear this was along the lines of the Rocky series and other brand\nmovie series , this was made simply for a big ,guaranteed paycheck. Not\nmuch thought went into this film. It was most likely rushed to get it\ninto the theaters for that big payday. Shame on Liam Neeson, for this\nproject. Hopefully, he stays away from Hollywood greed like this and\nbecomes relevant again in his next film.\n"
"\nThere's a weak plot, a few big plot holes, an unbelievable character\narc, a boatload of movie clichés, an unrealistic-even-for-the-movies\ncar chase, but mostly the impression the movie left on me is lots of\nscenes of men fighting. <br><br>Not even well-choreographed fighting. <br><br>This movie might pass the Bechdel test, as the two female characters\nhave names and one of them even gets to do stuff. (And possibly they\ntalk to each other.)<br><br>Mostly, though, it's an action movie for teenage boys (of all\nchronological ages), and not a particularly good one. (Though if you're\na parent, be aware that not all content is suitable - threats of gang\nrape, for example.)\n"
"\nYou know how Police Officers can't watch cop movies and physicists\ncan't watch science fiction and lawyers can't watch, well, anything.\nNobody can watch this. It is entirely implausible. I was constantly\nreminded of that scene from whichever of the Austin Power's movies\nwhere the kid says \"just shoot him.\" \"Give me the gun I'll shoot him\"\nor something like that. Anyway this movie, no way. I too started to\ncatalog all the foul ups I could not find that kind of time. Oh, the\nex-wife, ick. Seriously ick. Makes me wonder if the first one was just\na fluke. BAD MOVIE. Why oh why did they have to make this weren't there\nbetter ways to make a buck. Oh, love that line from the reviewer who\nwrote \"Taken 2 as original as the title.\" Funny good line. I hope to do\nas well.\n"
"\nThis film used up about 90 minutes of my life I will never see again,\nand those 90 minutes could have been so much more meaningful; I could\nhave watched some paint, drying; I could have gone out and counted the\nnumber of traffic lights in the town I live in, but no, I watched Taken\n2 instead. <br><br>Let's be generous, trees have less wood than the acting in this film,\nthe only emotion this film stirred was boredom and I've been in\nsupermarket queues that generated more tension.<br><br>Suspension of belief is not enough whilst watching this film, you need\nto suspend your IQ as well, and keep a bucket handy; one thing it does\ninstill plenty of is nausea.<br><br>Watch it if you must, but if you happen to be on a bus route you might\nfind your time better spend watching for the last bus to go past, but\nwear an anorak.<br><br>The nominations for best Actor are:<br><br>a) Anyone who turned down a part in this film<br><br>b) Anyone in a cinema audience who stays until the end<br><br>c) Robert Donat (for being the real Mr Chips)\n"
"\nWhen I first saw this movie I enjoyed only the video effects. The story\nwas not interesting at all and it had a lot of false scenes which show\nnegative sides of Albanian people which is not true. Especially the end\nof the movie is a total disaster and the worst thing that you guys can\nthink of Albanians. When an Albanian gives the word, it is saint for\nhim and he will do whatever it takes to keep it. It is better to be\ndead than not to keep the given word. This is how Albanians consider it\nand I think that the end of the movie is a wrong fact for Albanian\npeople. Try not to create a bad image of the people worldwide\nespecially if you do not know them. It is not a good thing for the\ncommunities and different people to create a bad image for other\ncommunities.\n"
"\nWe got free tickets to watch this flick when it released in India,\ngiven to us by Radio Indigo, and oh boy, we really loved it.<br><br>The film is sequel to \"Taken\" and the story is about federal agent\nBryan Mills who is targeted by the revengeful relatives of the people\nhe kills in \"Taken\" while rescuing his daughter from them. He is soon\nattacked while on holiday at Istanbul with his wife and daughter. The\nrest of it is about how and if Bryan is able to tackle his enemies.<br><br>The film is really fast paced, with cool stunts and car chases, and\nnail biting thrills from the start to end that will keep you at the\nedge of your seat.<br><br>All I didn't like about it were some unnecessary scenes but that was\nnegligible.<br><br>Watch Taken 2.....you'll like it, as long as you don't keep trying to\nfigure out EVERYTHING that is going on logically. Watch the film for\nfun!\n"
"\nI was looking for this movie for a long time, when the sequel was\nannounced. But it failed me miserably.. As usual Liam Neeson did\njustice to his role, but the movie is not a Edge-Of-Your-Seat Action\nThriller. Really really disappointing. The movie starts on a slow note\nand then tries to progress with car chase,then abduction, finding the\ntrails.. All was just like a normal one.. Nothing new....! It was\nreally a disappointment. All i liked about this movie, is Bryan (Liam\nNeeson)'s instructions to his daughter to find their hideouts was lil\nbit OK.. But rest of all, the movie is an utter disappointing.\nBackground score was inapt. <br><br>MY verdict 5.5 / 10 {i gave Taken 9 on 10)\n"
"\nYet again another sequel , that doesn't have the same wow as the first\nmovie. I believe taken 3 is coming soon and the grandsons will want\nrevenge, but by that time Liam Neeson, will be to old for the role. The\nenergy he had in the first movie is gone in this one, even the Albanian\nmafia seem slow and old, maybe they weren't payed good enough. Althou\nyou receive good information about Istanbul, the traffic ain't so bad\nas they say, and you can buy cheap junk in every corner, you can steel\ncabs, and throw grenades as you wish, and the U.S. embassy is easy to\nblast <br><br>The conclusion..Americans suck in geography, how many city's are on two\ncontinents?? wasn't Europe in France somewhere :))))))\n"
"\nTaken 2 is the sequel the highly successful Taken, and stars Liam\nNeeson, Maggie Grace and Famke Janssen who reprise their roles as\nBryan, Kim and Lenore. <br><br>Taken was probably one of the best films to release in 2008. It caught\neveryone off guard in terms of it's rave reviews. Liam Neeson was\nfantastic in it. But I'm sad to say the sequel is nowhere near as good.\nNeeson, as much as I hate to say it, wasn't too good in this. A lot of\nscenes did not make any sense, and even though it is only 90 minutes\nlong it felt longer. It was an unnecessary sequel which shouldn't have\neven been thought up of. The mere concept of it was stupid. However,\nthat didn't stop me or the flocks of other people to not see it. <br><br>There were a few cool scenes, but they were mostly faltered by poor\nstory telling and mindless actions by characters. This film wasn't all\nbad, it was good for the first while, although there is a lot to\ncomplain about. It's not the best thing to come out in 2012. But it's\nfar from the worst.\n"
"\nThe best sequel to a movie i have said was to be one of my favourite\nreally pulled off for taken 2.<br><br>The story of the film is that one of the guys brian killed in the first\ninstalment hunts him and everyone around him to get revenge.<br><br>i thought that it was absolutely brilliant as it still had the action\nand drama the first had. i don't know why people say this is bad\nbecause it really isn't.<br><br>i would recommend the film to any fans of the first as this one is\nbrilliant so if you want to watch the sequel to one of the best action\nfilms made then this is definitely worth a watch.\n"
"\nTaken 2 is the sequel to the successful Taken film, sees a similar\nrehashed story, though set in a different location. Into the film and\nfor reasons that don't deliver, Bryan (Liam Neeson), daughter Kim\n(Maggie Grace), and ex-wife Lenore (Famke Janssen) who's facing a\ndivorce from her current husband, are all in Istanbul to have a good\ntime and unwind from the trauma of Kim's kidnapping. Taken 2 appears to\ntake its time getting to the action, dithering away an inordinate\namount of time on Lenore's crumbling marriage, her astonishingly good\nrelationship with Bryan, and Bryan's notification that Kim has a\nboyfriend. The film's action sequences are wide and thin and the camera\nis noticeably shaky in many of the scenes. The plot isn't too much, nor\nis it all that interesting. Predictable in the least. Overall, Taken 2\ndoes deliver in some ways but in general, the film is quite boring and\nnot too entertaining. Though it isn't too long, which is a plus.\n"
"\nThis movie does not offer any surprises. The plot is linear, no turns\nin sight; it's as if the original film has been remade. Lots of\nshooting, car chases, people dropping dead; it's the usual fare. Neeson\nlooks good, sounds good, and shoots good. He is like the unkillable\nhulk, just like the first movie. The other actors don't have much to\ndo. They are either running, shooting, or fainting. Unlike the first\nmovie, this does not have any memorable dialogues, not for me. If you\njust want to see an action flick, or if you haven't seen the first\nmovie, you can go for this one, but don't expect too much. If you have\nseen the first one, maybe you can leave this one out.\n"
"\nDon't watch this film unless you have nothing else to do and you want\nto watch another mindless Hollywood film that has the same old formula:\nSuper bad guys want to kill super good guy. 2 attractive females in\nshort skirts. Car chases, explosions, martial arts fight scenes. Even\nthe end of the film is exactly the same as many other Hollywood action\naction films you've seen (I won't spoil it for you but it required no\nimagination at all and you've seen this kind of ending many times\nbefore). Garbage film. Everyone involved should be embarrassed. (I\ndon't understand why I need to fill in 10 lines of text to write a\nreview on this website. I find that requirement ridiculous. This is my\npoint of view and my review I should be able to write it in a few\nsentences or in 2 pages if I want to.)\n"
"\nOK, it's a sequel. But uniquely, it's actually rather good.<br><br>OK, there are one or two clichés with that Romancing the ex-wife thing,\nbut even so this is excellently written, and makes use of superb\nlocations.<br><br>It takes about 20 mins to really get going, and then you are on the\nedge of your seat. All the essential elements are there from any decent\nthriller, but you never find the movie formulaic.<br><br>You probably know the good guys are going to win - they always do! -\nbut even so the masterful direction manages to build suspense, and the\ningenuity of our Hero when faced with his predicament is both novel and\nentertaining. <br><br>A refreshing and fully engaging movie from a talented team of writer,\ndirector and cast.\n"
"\nThe first film of Taken saga was interesting and not complicated by a\ncontorted plot. This movie doesn't' have a really plot and also the\naction scene aren't really fresh. In the first episode there was only a\nsimple motivation that carry you into the entire movie. In this movie\nthe motivation is forced and weak and doesn't thrill me. Acting is\nunnecessary and also Liam Neeson is tired. Scene actions are not\nrealistic and Istanbul don't create a real appeal like Paris. Maggie\nGrace is not a child anymore and Famke Janssen is had difficulty with\nacting. Everyone in this time made a sequel but it is not a rule! I hop\ne Luc Besson understand this and will not realize an entire saga with 4\nor more episode\n"
"\nRetired CIA special ops agent Bryan Mills(Liam Neesom) is vacationing\nin Istanbul with his ex-wife Lenore(Famke Janssen)and daughter\nKim(Maggie Grace). Mills and his family are abducted by Murad\nKrasniqi(Rade Serbedzja)seeking revenge for the deaths of Kim's former\nkidnappers. Murad's Albanese gang are avenging the death of their\nleader's son. This time it will be Kim who helps to free her parents\nunleashing Bryan to turn the tables on the ruthless Murad and his\nminions.<br><br>Plenty of action with precision violence. Several degrees of brutality.\nSome sequences are highly intense and harsh. And what is not to like?!\nOther players: Leland Orser, D.B. Sweeney, Luke Grimes, Kevork\nMalikyan, Jon Gries and Alain Figlarz.\n"
"\nInsultingly awful sequel, whose plot is very similar to the vastly\nsuperior original, but riddled with holes in the plot, numerous\ncontinuity, and simple logic, errors. <br><br>Characters hurl grenades through the air with reckless abandon just to\ndetermine another's location(!) , Neeson guides his daughter by using\nthings like a red flag, or a flower vendor as directions. If they were\nin Mayberry that might work, but not in a city of 14 million people.\nApparently it is possible to crash one's car through the front gates of\nthe American Embassy (which is in the Turkish capitol Ankara, not\nIstanbul) and not be shot at, and furthermore, be allowed to walk away\nmoments later!<br><br>The well choreographed and filmed action scenes from the original are\nreduced to shakycam and frenetic editing trying to distract from the\ncrummy action-- bloody hell, what action? It's just Neeson shooting\neveryone in sight after a very slow start. <br><br>I could barely remember much about this one after it was over. What a\ndisappointment.\n"
"\nI really didn't like the movie.. It had no dynamic like the first one..\nSome parts were lame for example; Kim has no license but in İstanbul\nshe is able to use non automatic car and a very professional way.. I\nhate how they showed my city and my people in the movie.. Turkey is not\nlook like a 3rd world country especially İstanbul is not an Arabic\ncity.. We are living men and women together in the streets and work and\nwe are not wearing black full body and face covers. <br><br>Some people are wearing turban, so that means they cover their heads\nwith scarf it's not something they show in the movie. We are Democratic\ncountry and İstanbul is a very cosmopolitan city. We have modern police\ncars even the Toyota Hibrit ones, and city is like a mixture old and\nnew.. You may see modern and historical things but they are not like\nsomething in the movie. <br><br>In fact that I'm very sorry about there is nothing change since the\nMidnight Express..\n"
"\nThis was okay, not as exciting and kick-ass ruthless as I remember the\nfirst one being. Still a decent story utilizing many of the tricks that\nmade the first movie so good i.e. the phone call -you will be taken (in\nthis case \"we've been taken\") Stay calm and do the exact (random)\nthings I say -geometry problems, throw a grenade out the widow.<br><br>Liam is cool though, I like him in these action roles and the plot was\nfeasible enough as it sees retired CIA agent Bran Mills and his family\nbeing targeted while vacationing in Istanbul by the vengeful crime lord\nfather of one of the men he killed in the first Taken. Bran is then\nforced to fight an army of killers in order to get himself and his\n(mostly unconscious) ex-wife back home alive.<br><br>Its almost identical to the first movie, tons of action, some cool\nfight scenes and while not great, still entertaining. 11/2/14\n"
"\nGood things are many like better cinematography, long action sequences,\nMaggie Grace used better, Liam was as well as in first movie.......\nthere were so many things could have been much better like Kim don't\ntrust her father before being in trouble.... Liam is one man army and\nfight like father of Rambo how? he never seen practicing boxing or\ndoing workout but he does it very well.. how? dozens of bad guys why?\nif Mr. Director you wanna convey viewers that CIA guys can fight\nnumerous bad and huge people then sorry keep bad boys at least less\nthan 5 or 4 at time....... what more I can say there should be\nfreshness in story instead of father Daughter but I think Director\nwanna show his daughter that her father can do anything...... and why a\nboyfriend was used ....... to create suspense ? sorry there was waste\nof an actor and nobody found him suspicious........ but good time-pass\nmovie... watch it.....\n"
"\nThis was one of those films that you just know from the title wont\namaze you. With the first movie in my opinion being very good I didn't\nexpect a second since it was wrapped up nicely in the first\ninstallment, but that was just a fantasy. The plot for this film is\nincredibly stupid, the action was much worse and the idiocy of some of\nthe characters for the sake of plot convenience is unbelievable.<br><br>Although the film thought it could add to the story some, it's failed\ntremendously. However, some parts of the film still hold up, Liam\nNeeson was probably the best part of the film proving that all action\nstars aren't bad actors and the fact that the film is on for a run time\nthat was acceptable to the story I'd give it an overall 5. <br><br>Basically if you have the time you might get a little enjoyment.\n"
"\nOne time these two members of a bad, large Muslim family kidnapped a\nmember of a good, white European family. The father of the good white\nfamily killed the 2 members of the bad family. Their father in turn\nswore revenge on the good family. Because this is a male fantasy\nromantic suspense novel, our hero is blessed with a daughter who is\ntotally obedient and follows all orders explicitly, and a wife who lays\naround totally passively and gets carted around like a big sack of\npotatoes. Various adventures ensue, like car chases and fights and so\nforth, as the good white father begins systematically mowing down every\nsingle member of the bad family. Finally at the end the bad father\nproves he's bad, so the good father kills him in the exact same manner\nthat the bad guy dies in Midnight Express, which is also set in\nIstanbul. Then they all go to to a diner and have milkshakes.\n"
"\nWhen i saw this film was coming out i was looking forward to watching\nit as the first one was so good but i was disappointed with this one,\neven though the plot etc is more or less the same it just doesn't have\nthe same feel... the first Taken was cool, interesting and enjoyable to\nwatch from start to finish but this one didn't have the same feel, it\nwas a little boring.<br><br>Liam Neeson was still good at playing his part but it was the \"plot\"\nthat was a little boring, as Liam was the one captured he didn't do\nmuch in the film apart from talking to his daughter on the phone a lot\nand i think the people that liked the first Taken would have loved to\nsee Liam doing more, more fighting scenes etc but still like i said he\nwas still good at playing his role, he is an overall great actor.<br><br>I don't think this one is as good as the first one so that is why it\nonly gets a 6 out of 10 from me but if another Taken comes out i will\nbe sure to watch it, i just hope there is more to it this time.\n"
"\nAnd finally Rade Serbedzija! Where was he hiding all these years? He is\nso perfect as the bad guy, when in the reality he is such a great\nperson! I wish they would give him a role of a nice guy! For once! Liam\nNeeson is fabulous, but he always is, I do not know the film where he\nwas bad. Other actors are something to be desired.<br><br>Plot is not that realistic and I do not like that. They could of made\nit a little bit more realistic, especially I hated when daughter was\ndriving. I did not meet a woman who knows how to drive. So giving a\nprominent role to the women is nice but not like this. I am glad they\ntouched into Albanian blood revenge, it is a middle ages custom.<br><br>Shots of Istanbul are fabulous! All those chikmas and sokaks, ministry\nof culture of Turkey and scouting people did their homework! All in all\ngood action movie! It is not a waste of time to watch it!\n"
"\nTaken 2 is for those who are 13 and older and like to watch fast paced\naction/spy movies. The movie moves at a fast clip and holds your\nattention throughout. Taken 2 is a good prime time movie to be watched\neither alone or with friends. There is a lot of killing and chasing in\nthe movie. Although the killing is done in several different ways, it\nis not gory. I did enjoy the chase scenes. Liam Neeson does make a good\nspy character. This is a good movie for pizza instead of popcorn as you\nwill want to do your eating before the film. You will enthralled with\nthe film to eat during its showing, once it gets going. Get your\nbuddies together and enjoy the film.\n"
"\nI just watched \"Taken 2\" and it was ridiculous how they portrayed\nIstanbul to the audience. I really don't understand,what kind of\nobsession does Hollywood have about pretending Istanbul as trash or\nshowing Turkey as a primeval country? I have two theories about that;\none of them is they don't have enough money so they can only take\nscenes in lower class areas or they are extremely jealous about it's\nbeauty so they are trying to traduce on it.I think the second one makes\nmore sense.But, At least, they developed themselves, i mean, in\"\"\nmidnight express\"\" we were traveling with ''camels'' but in ''Taken 2''\nour officers using ''cars from world war 2'' ,it is tragicomic. I\nreally don't know what is their problem ...\n"
"\njust too ridiculous and the ending is just unbelievable. This movie was\nOK but not as good as the first one because it's just too out there to\nbelieve that this happened to the same guy twice. Any ways, kick #ss\nspecial forces dude, Bryan Mills, is off to Turkey for work and invites\nhis ex wife and daughter along. They decide to go even though it has\nbeen just a short time since the daughter, Kim, was kidnapped and\nalmost sold as a sex slave. Well, the relatives of the men that Bryan\nkilled from the first film are back and want to make Bryan pay.<br><br>So we get a kidnapping and super cool way of Bryan figuring out where\nhe is and getting daughter Kim to rescue him. That was super agent\nstuff. What's really unbelievable is once they get to the US embassy,\nBryan doesn't use their help, he just goes out again on his own. I just\ndon't buy that.<br><br>FINAL VERDICT: If you want to see an older guy beat the you know what\nout of the bad guys, then this is for you.\n"
"\nAfter watching Taken some years back, i was excited to read about there\nbeing a sequel as it was a thrilling and unexpected hit. Unfortunately\n'Taken 2' does not live up to the first not even close. Its very\npredictable and unbelievable. Its not the worst film ever but i put it\nas one of the most disappointing. On a plus Liam Neesom is on a par\nwith the first with his his certain set of skills . He is nimble in the\nfight sequences and makes it look like second nature. However he gained\nsuper sonic speed at one point to rescue his daughter. A lot of the\nscenes are very convenient and and they seem to find their way around\nIstanbul very easily. On a plus its pretty fast paced and a short film\nby today's standards. If they do Taken 3 they need to come up with a\ndecent plot maybe not involving his ex wife and daughter. Watch it if\nthere' s nothing else on .\n"
"\nThis is watchable but it is hard not to compare it to the first film\nwhich was outstanding. I won't go into all the plot holes as everyone\nelse has mentioned these, but there was a lot of 'as ifs' coming from\nmy lips as I watched this. The first one was very clever and kept you\nguessing but this one was not very believable as many have already\nsaid. All the acting was first rate but the director and script writer\nlet the film down. The fight choreography was really bad and the final\nfights particularly badly done. Over all it was a wasted opportunity to\nbuild on an excellent first film. All too often Hollywood seems to push\nout sequels without much care. Sherlock Holmes, Iron man etc all had\nawful sequels In fact only the Bourne films seemed to get it about\nright.\n"
"\nThe first Taken movie is excellent in every way, it builds up to its\nclimax nicely and the climax itself is very satisfying after all Mills\ngoes through. Taken 2 is very rushed in that aspect. It is barely 90\nminutes long and by the time Mills and his wife are taken, it seems a\nvery short time before the credits are rolling. Some more problems I\nhad were that it was centered around Mills and his wife being taken and\nnot the daughter but Mills is taken for about 10 minutes and then\nescapes easily. His daughter was working on trying to pass her driving\ntest back in the states after having failed it multiple times, so\nnaturally she could drive a stick-shift like a pro huh?<br><br>I give it a 6 because it is somewhat fun to watch despite the flaws I\nhave with it. Liam Neeson is always good and seeing him whip up on some\nbad guys in a foreign country is enjoyable. <br><br>Overall, 6/10.\n"
"\nIstanbul is a city with both historical and modern buildings and it is\none of the most magnificent cities in the world. It is the only city\nwhich connects two continents in the world. It is possible to see lots\nof sport and expensive cars in Istanbul which is just the opposite of\nthe movie. Also police cars in the movie are the ones used in the 90's\nnot today. I think the way movie represents Istanbul is wrong in lots\nof aspects. So I won't try to explain all of them but I think this is\ndisrespectful to mislead people about Istanbul although people in this\ncity helped them to take this movie. People should research Istanbul\nafter they watched this movie to see what Istanbul is really like.\n"
"\nI had not great expectations after I have read the reviews. But Taken 2\nwas much more better than the critics wrote here. For all the following\nreasons I gave a solid 7/10:<br><br>1) Fast paced action movie with full of suspense<br><br>2) Very interesting detective and espionage details <br><br>3). Short running time of the DVD <br><br>4) The good story sticks to the first Taken<br><br>5) Good direction <br><br>6) Full of adrenaline car chases in Istanbul <br><br>7) The end leaves place for a possible third part<br><br>What there could have been better is perhaps to built up more subtle\nelements in the story. Here it went to quick and without surprising\nmoments to the point.\n"
"\nI hate when reading through reviews it seems as if for most of the\npeople there is nothing between super-good or super-bad. Everyone\ncalling this the worst movie of any year clearly doesn't have any idea\nwhat a really bad film looks like. Is the movie a money-grab? Propably.\nDoes it have a really good script? No. Is the script terrible? Of\ncourse not. Is the acting bad? No way! It's just not as good as the\n\"innovative\" (as far as a movie can be innovative nowadays) stuff shown\nin Taken. You get more or less the same basic characters and\nprotagonists and the antagonists seek revenge this time instead of just\nlooking for girls to sell them for profit. While the action is - like\nin every blockbuster - as far from believable as it can get, Liam\nNeeson (as always) shows exactly what we expect him to do: God-like\nskill in making human lives miserable and killing everyone in his path.\nNever judge a movie on 1 star reviews, Taken 2 is just maybe not worth\nbeing bought on DVD which doesn't make it a bad movie. Watch it once if\nyou can see it on TV, that's all.\n"
"\nI'am very disappointed﻿. When I watched it I wanted to take back my\nwasted time and just do something else. People who enjoyed it must\nreally have POOR taste on action movies. With its unimpressive plot,\nwryly written script and implausible lead actor, it's really a\ndisappointment. I think that that Schindler's List﻿ actor doesn't even\nknows how to throw good punches and do adrenalin-rushing fight scenes.\nThe only moments where I enjoyed the movie was when Liam Neeson wasn't\non the screen. Shame on this movie. Sadly, of all the characters in the\nmovie, I think the lead is the worst. I'm not that into action movies\nand before this I can't remember a single terrible action movie. I\ndon't really like it in general. It's just an over-hyped action movie\nwith nothing really special about it.\n"
"\nWhen i watched first movie, i was very amusing and waited for the\nsecond one impatiently. But second movie was a mess. First of all there\nare some logic mistake in the film. Because the girl cannot drive the\ncar very well, but somehow she managed to drive the car between the\nIstanbul street which the most difficult street even for the best\ndrivers for my opinion. And another mistake in the film is Turkish life\nthat is reflected in the film. Because, every women you see in the film\nhas a sheet on their everywhere. I have never seen so many closed women\nin my life in Turkey and police cars are really comedy :) Film\nproductor wants to show Turkey very back minded but I can say it is not\nlike in the film. Please try to be more realistic when you present a\ncountry.\n"
"\nI feel bad about Hollywood sometimes. Only for the sake of the 's and\n$'s they've decided to make this one as a sequel and they literally\nruined it. Movie has lot of gaps and mistakes that even the children\ncan detect it..<br><br>Liam Neeson killing people with some finger moves? Albanians crossing\nborder (or whatever it is) without any security check? Istanbul is full\nof ninjas?..<br><br>This is unfortunately; probably the worst movie of 2012. <br><br>Please do yourself a favor and don't spend your nickel on it, and don't\nwaste your time precious time. Instead, you can actually visit Istanbul\nand laugh the movie at your a**-out.\n"
"\nI would've felt ripped off a little had a saw this in theaters but I\nhad a free rental so I didn't even have to pay to see it! There's some\ngood action in this film but your intelligence might be a little\ninsulted. It seems like they were just trying to bank off the first by\nmaking this sequel! The problem is they made too much money off this\nfilm so I could see them trying to make a third but hopefully not if\nthey read these reviews! I didn't understand why they made a sequel so\nI had low expectations going into this so I wasn't disappointed! I've\nseen a lot of bad movies so this wasn't the worst and it was filmed\ngood with that dark effect like the first.\n"
"\nIf you didn't like the first Taken, do not bother watching this. If you\ndid like it, it doesn't necessarily mean you will like this though. I\nonly watched the watered down version (no pun intended), which is the\ntheatrical version aka as PG-13 version. So maybe the other one\nachieves to be as gritty (or almost as) as the original. But there are\nquite a few things here, that just don't fit.<br><br>Take the hand grenade scene. Now if you thought the first one was\noffensive and stupid, I wonder what you'd say about that! I might be\nmissing the \"fun\" it makes of itself or the prior installment. But I\njust can't seem to find it. While even McGuyver would go \"Duh\", Liam\nNeeson does save the movie from going completely down. Plus a very nice\nscene towards the end is really good and almost tops a similar \"themed\"\nscene from Eastern Promises.<br><br>At least his daughter gets to do more than in part 1. Still I miss the\ngrittiness of the Original ... be aware of that and you might be able\nto enjoy it even more than I did\n"
"\nI very much wanted to just sit back and enjoy this movie, however it\ncontained *WAY* too many plain and simple irrational events to just\ngloss over. I can usually let a couple of these things fly but when\nthey crashed their car through the embassy gates instead of stopping\nlike any rational person would (the bad guys had already crashed behind\nthem) I just couldn't take it anymore. The US Marines at the gate shot\nup their little car with a .50 cal but somehow left it fully intact!\nRIDICULOUS!!! Another thing was that when he was trying to go back and\nsave his wife he was somehow able to retrace his steps in such record\ntime that the bad guys couldn't even walk out of their own building\nwith his wife before he showed up. This movie contains many exciting\nparts and cool scenes but these ongoing inconsistencies with logic\nreally detracted from my ability to fully enjoy the story.\n"
"\nCan't believe how laughably bad this movie is. The daughter, who looks\nlike a serial mom, is supposed to be a virgin with an overly protective\nfather concerned that she doesn't \"engage\" too prematurely. The bad\nguys are evil far easterners with minds set on vengeance. This movie is\nalmost arty in the way it depicts prejudice on more levels than one. A\nmeta film about the European way of regarding American religious\nfundamentalism with extreme prejudice... Suppose I'm pissing off some\nAmerican readers here, but really, this movie would be regarded as a\nTaliban top ten had it been a guy in nightgown and turban killing off\nthe bad guys.\n"
"\nPreposterous picture that can leave you gasping at some of the\n\"brilliant\" methods used in this disappointing sequel. It all seems\nvery rushed and haphazard and delivers a Film that in no way can be\nbelieved and so for that matter it flounders.<br><br>There is enough action for the undiscerning but the spy's solutions are\nway too contrived and are at odds with even the most sophisticated\nadvanced training. This shatters the suspension of disbelief quite\nreadily and frequently and it wasn't really necessary.<br><br>If you can be taken in by unimaginable problem solving and routine car\nchases and jittery close up combat then this may be an acceptable\naccomplishment. It manages to lose all the tension from the first Film\nand plays fast and loose with the spy scenario and what remains is an\ninadequate and inferior sequel to an excellent Movie.\n"
"\nThe first Taken was an awesome movie. I thought about it for several\nmonths after I saw it. This Taken had a weak plot, but the action\nscenes were pretty cool. <br><br>I just wish it didn't have the propaganda against Islam and Muslims.\nThey show these wicked criminals, sorry excuses for human beings, and\nevery time they show them, you hear the call to prayer (adhaan). This\nis very wrong, and it makes me sad to see Hollywood get away with this.\nI would have given this movie a higher rating, but this is the highest\nI can go. <br><br>Next time they should at least show a group of righteous practicing\nMuslims that are against all the evil kidnapping, etc. At least this\nshows the audience that \"they're not all evil.\" Erase the hate.\n"
"\nThe film itself wouldn't be that bad if the first one wasn't as good as\nit was.<br><br>This film is like a bad rip off of Taken 1 but is still enjoyable in\nsome areas.<br><br>Some of the stunts are hilarious, especially with a certain train.<br><br>The fight scenes are also a little dull as it is just two guys hitting\neach other with a low volume score over the top. These scenes become\nvery long and tedious towards the end of the movie.<br><br>Despite this though I, surprisingly, enjoyed this film.<br><br>BUT PLEASE Don't LET THERE BE A TAKEN 3!!!! IT WILL RUIN THE FRANCHISE\nEVEN MORE SO!!!!!!\n"
"\nI don't mean to be gushy but I absolutely loved the first Taken, not\nexactly the case with its sequel though. Taken 2 is definitely a good\nwatch and I do recommend it. However, it's not nearly as powerful as\nthe first one.<br><br>Taken 2 follows the same structure of the former. Megaton does a great\njob in directing the film, as he maintains the story fast paced, making\nit dynamic and enjoyable. Suspense is also used in an intelligent way,\nwhich adds to the audience's surprise in positive lights. In this\nsense, the film gives what its genre promises, action and thrill. I'm\nnot impressed because it's an average action film, and it had the\npotential to be mind blowing as the first one was. <br><br>Taken 2 is not as unpredictable as the first is, there are not enough\ntwists in the plot, it's not as thrilling as it's promoted to be. That\nis the case in many other sequels, they don't live up to the high\nstandards the first films usually set.<br><br>Neeson's acting is flawless as usual, but in my opinion Taken 2 could\nhave given him a much better material to work with.\n"
"\nI'm amazed that Liam Leeson lent himself to this most ludicrous of\nmovies. It rates the highest improbability factor of any movie I have\never seen. The daughter about to sit her driving test manages to outwit\nhalf of the police force and the villains by driving like a formula 1\nexpert plus stunt car driver combined. She also manages to navigate her\nway across roofs, evading her pursuers and finding just the right\nchimney to deliver her missile down just on time. Well it can only be a\nspoof but some people may take it seriously. The sickeningly schmaltzy\nending is just puerile and embarrassing. Don't say you haven't been\nwarned.\n"
"\nTaken 2<br><br>The best thing about being abducted for a second time is that your\npre-existing Stockholm syndrome will allow you to immediately bond with\nyour captor(s).<br><br>However, the subsequent kidnapping in this action movie involves the\nparents of the previous victim instead.<br><br>Former CIA agent Bryan (Liam Neeson) meets up with his ex-wife Lenore\n(Famke Janssen) and their daughter Kim (Maggie Grace) in Turkey to\nsightsee.<br><br>But when the family of the men whom Bryan killed during Kim's\nkidnapping months earlier find him and Lenore on a date, they take them\nhostage.<br><br>Now it's Kim's turn - under her dad's directive - to wage a one-woman\nwar against the armed abductors holding her parents captive.<br><br>Even though the violence remains rapid-fire, this initial continuation\nof the original lacks the same urgency, while the dialogue verges on\nsitcom-y.<br><br>Incidentally, what kind of idiot would ever want to hold a divorced\ncouple hostage? <br><br>(Yellow Light)<br><br>vidiotreviews.blogspot.ca\n"
"\nI thought the second movie was more action packed than the first one.\nBut still, was all in all good. Though the original one was much better\nand had a story to it.<br><br>Bryan Mills(Liam Neeson), ex-CIA agent, and his ex-wife, Lenore(Famke\nJanssen) are kidnapped themselves by the father of one of the hostages\nin the original taken that was killed by Mills. Who has sworn revenge\non Mills.<br><br>After his ex-wife is now estranged by her wealthy second husband, as\nMills suggest she and their daughter Kim(Maggie Grace), come along with\nhim on a vacation after his recent assignment as private bodyguard.<br><br>But Mills gets out of it but it is his wife that is forced to become\nthe center focus as her life is on the line. He must depend on Kim more\nas Grace's role is not one of damsel in distress as that is now\nJanssen's role. Plus Graces role is expanded as she leans on her\ndriving skills despite the fact she does not have her license.<br><br>Action packed but the story is overlooked due to that. Not as good as\nthe first but still action packed!\n"
"\nSo the score is now Liam Neeson 30, bad guys zero. Seriously, at what\npoint does the ultra-stereotypical bad guy go 'look dude, sorry for\nthis whole revenge thing, I was miffed about my other son who really\nwas pretty evil anyway but now that you've killed another 17 of my\nfamily members and a seemingly endless score of my inept henchmen,\ncan't we just forget this whole thing?' <br><br>More formulaic than the first but enjoyable nonetheless as the Liam\nNeeson showcase continues. I especially liked the one-on-one throwdown\nwith the short, podgy bad guy who turned out to be an ultimate fighter\nor something and was almost able to beat our hero in an entertaining\nSteven Seagal-esque arena fight to the death.\n"
"\nI am living in Istanbul and the day we are living i never see these\nkind of police cars and women wearing black clothes. The government\nshould give the permission according to some rules like the company has\nto show the real views of the country not something unreal. On the\nother hand the second version isn't successful as the first one.The\nfirst one was very fascinate but this one is made for to make money\nafter a successful one and when we watched it we easilly guessed what\nwould be at the next stage.ın my opinion the best scene was the view of\nthe Bosporus from the hotel room.Besides that there were absurd\nscenes.When the Albania people were passing the Turkish border there\nwere only a few government officers and a barrier.\n"
"\nI am a Turk and I haven't seen so many women in my life in Istanbul\nwith black turbans as many as those I have seen in this movie. If you\nwant to show those kind of women go to Arabia or such countries. We\ndon't have them in Turkey. I believe this is a tradition for some movie\nmakers. As I said Turkey is a secular country and we are so modern as\nEuropeans and USA citizens. Please do not believe in these movie\nproducers. Just come and visit us. You will be most welcomed. See\nhospitality and live the warmth of being in a country with so many warm\npeople. We want to say again that if the movie makers want to give some\noriental ism they have to do it in the right way and treat correctly to\nthe country they are making the movie.\n"
"\nAfter enjoying Taken 1, I watched this one, with high expectations. In\ntotal, the movie was O.K, I haven't felt bored or anything, but I\nhaven't watched it with passion as well. The story line was poor,\ndepending totally on the previous movie, which I think it is not very\ncharming. Liam Neeson seems like an old man, trying to be in shape,\nthus, the action and combat scenes were short, slow, not so interesting\nand very cliché. The suspense factor were missing, no original ideas.\nyou feel like, they are depending on the success of the previous movie,\nand trying to get as much money as they can get. very poor choice of\nmusic and soundtracks, like they haven't put much effort into it. The\ntrick scene, the scene when he told his daughter how to find them, was\nthe most clever and interesting scene in the whole movie. at the end,\nit was O.K, emotionless, without a deep meaning, cliché, a rip off from\nthe previous movie and you have a feeling they didn't an effort into it\nanyway.\n"
"\nObi Van Schindler, being a senior citizen, is still in a good shape for\na \"some-secret-service-or-something\" operative, and a responsible\nfather, of course. Nobody takes his daughter and gets away with it. And\nour own Rade erbedija is good villain, as always (again deliberately\nspeaking English with some foreign accent). And that's it. Movie is not\nthat bad until a really (really!) slimy end. <br><br>Recommendation: watch Taken first and this one right after, in a row.\nThe movies (as movies) are not that bad, something happens all the time\nand it's basically a mindless action flick. If you don't mind repeating\nclichés (in this movie - about a millionth time) go for it. Direction\nis OK, camera good, acting appropriate. Time passes, everything is\npredictable and finally it ends. You take disc out of the player and\nforget about it. Or wait for Taken 3. And 4. And so on.\n"
"\nI like the first Taken very much. I actually searched every movie\nstarred by Liam in my local library after watching Taken. <br><br>Taken 2 is not as intense, but still entertaining.<br><br>There are many holes in this movie. I'll just point out a simple\nphysics one. <br><br>Speed of sound in air is 343 m/s. So if he hears the explosion 4\nseconds later, it means he is 1372 meters away. If he is 4.5 kilometer\naway (as in the movie), he should hear the explosion 13 seconds later. <br><br>This is simple high school physics.<br><br>They seriously should have hired a science consultant. <br><br>The fist fight scene is a little disappointing too. Hong Kong movies\nalways have superb fight scenes. So they should have hired a stunt\ncoordinator from Hong Kong.\n"
