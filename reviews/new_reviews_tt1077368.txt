just got back from an early screening of the movie
as someone who like johnny depp i was excited to watch the movie but nearly ended up walking out of the screening halfway through the movie
there are hardly any entertaining moments an extremely weak plot and some very average acting
sure johnny depp may be a brilliant actor but theres only so much an actor can do to salvage an immensely boring film
the weak development of the love story limited exploitation of what could have been some interesting timetravel anachronisms and absurd additions to the plot like ghosts and werewolves who remain mute spectators throughout the movie only to appear at the very end were insulting to the intelligent moviegoer
i was a huge fan of the original dark shadows serial soap
watched it every day until it was preempted in los angeles by the senate watergate hearings
tim burtons version of dark shadows staring johnny depp and michelle pfieffer is a great sendoff to the series and other 70s horror movies
green puke the exorcist
wearwolf wolfen
the boy staring in the hall damien from the omen
and the 1970s soundtrack was second to none starting with nights in white satin
it was tacky funny a little scary and definitely another burton hit
i would go see it again in theaters watch it every time it is on t
v
and go see the sequel too
this is one of few movies that i see out of the over 40 new ones i see per year that i can truly say you gotta see this flick
worst movie ive seen in a long time
recommended for people with shitty taste in movies
i was shocked that a great actor such as johnny deep is playing the main role in this film
the main character is a vampire
through the first part of the movieyou can learn that he is not a friend with the sun light
but still see him in daily sun but with a huge hatumbrella and sunglasses
and at the endthere he issaving a little boyand running into sun
normallyyou would expect that it just hurts himbut no he gets on fire
i dont know if this supposed to be a funny film
for me is just sadand 2hours of my life thrown away
and of course moneyim not disappointed for spending it on the ticketrather than knowing the money is going to the movie compilers
sometimes when a talented director and actor get together to make a film they forget something like a cohesive plot
not to worry they just fill in the void with computer generated special effects sexual encounters that completely lack chemistry some boring 1970s clichas and a werewolf
hey its tim burton
its johnny depp
so grab some popcorn and watch as these hollywood giants crap their pants
yes it is crude and they deserve it
this movie is horrible
lame from beginning to end
poor timing by all involved
it appears that neither burton nor anyone else involved was sure what they wanted this movie to be so it fails to be anything
it is neither dark nor scary
bleh
i am so over the weird and quirky tim burton stuff
how about a different approach
make an interesting smart and compelling movie
as a fan of the original dark shadows tv show this was a huge disappointment
what a missed opportunity to provide the massive babyboomer audience with something they could really sink their teeth into
i am a fan of johnny depp
but my two favorite movies of his were chocolat and donnie brasco
both of these movies had absolutely nothing to do with tim burton
he is a very capable actor with the ability to play many genres
but i dont think he has explored his potential enough
this will never happen as long as his movies involve the creative team of helena bonham carter and tim burton
bored to tears i had a hard time staying awake while trying to watch this movie
such a wonderful cast
nice picture and scenery
and a really badbadbad and nonsensical script
shame
i think the actors were really unable to produce something better
lots of nonsensitive humor
tim please stop making movies like this one
so much money for nothing
i prefer your oldgoodinnovative shortbudget projects
and i believe most of your fans are becoming tired after sweeney todd which was your last decent movie
leave the remakes
also the music was nonexistent in the whole movie
lacks emotion
to sum up mr
seth grahamesmith i hope your next attempt will be a better one
you are young and you have future
unfortunately it was a total bust
my favorite childhood tv show made into a movie by two of my favorite folks director tim burton and actor johnny depp
what could possible go wrong
everything
mr
burton never decides if he is making a comedy or a horror or a drama or a satire and ends up with a jumbled mess
what an utter disappointment
eva green tries her best with the script she is given and jackie earle haley as willie loomis gives a competent performance
johnny depp seems bored with his role and obviously does not have his heart in it
gulliver mcgrath does bring the innocence of david collins into the film and was the only character that brought to mind the feeling of the 60s hit show
i knew with it being a burton film that i was not going to walk into a remake of the dark shadows of the 1960s but i did not expect to walk into a piece of junk
my overall opinion is not negative but i feel like the idea is wasted a bit
the movie started pretty good
but after twenty minutes everything became predictable
it was not boring but it was not very entertaining either
i dont even think this movie is comedy
there are very few jokes
overall acting was kind of ok but depp is becoming a very one dimensional actor by playing always similar characters
the scenery was pretty good and i must say visuals were quite good as well
at the end i wouldnt watch this movie once more but at least i didnt regret paying for it
if you didnt like the other depp and burton movies dont even think watching this one
dark shadows is just absolutely terrible it is muddled boring poorly acted to be honest and a complete waste of talent
tim burton is obviously a very talented actor so i dont know what kinda whacked up stuff he was on when he did this movie but even if he was thats still no excuse for delivering this trash to us
im not a humongous depp fan but he has been good in previous films he was not in this one he is annoying and way too over the top here
this film is not funny when it tries to get out a laugh it falls flat every time
helena carter is lazy and lackluster here too
and i usually like michelle pfeiffer but come on michelle you deserve better material than this
the events are boring and the plot i
e
uninteresting and the script is very lazy and phoned in
110
tim burton used to be gooood
he did
johnny deep used to be a genius too
he did
here they both failed
miserably
utterly
wholly
completely
totally
pity
this is a vanity piece as they say
truly so
why was that film shot
we did see depp as a freak with all his nauseatic mimics his wiggling limbs and queerish gestures
we saw in awful sweeney todd
we saw helena bonham carter and we know already how bad she is
any clear spot
pfeiffer
nay she is very much like in stardust
old hat
so any clear spot
yeah
alice cooper
music
this is all
all that dark sepia gloomy scheme is so funny and laughable
we never even smile
we saw all those mannerisms before
the winning formula burton  depp is a small smelly quatsch here
no no redeeming feature here at all
no wonder it was so panned by critics
they are right
after seeing tim burtons ed wood which i consider his masterpiece i became a huge fan of his
hes really unique with has his own touch of gothic and dark imagery
i was really hyped for dark shadows but when saw it and i was disappointed
what kills it i loved the movie the humor is cool but what kills it is the lack of focus
the movie didnt focus on all the characters except for barnabus of course but i didnt care for any of the other characters
for example victoria is one of the main characters in the story and we see her only for 15 mins
i almost forgot she was in the damn movie
another thing is the acting they were all great except for that little boy he was boring
what made it good one of the coolest references was a poster for christopher lees hammer dracula a
d 1972which then followed by a conservation between barnabus and the count himself christopher lee c
lee who played dracula in every hammer dracula
alice cooper appearance was the best for me he made the movie for me the best part
over all i give it 610 average
its has the vibe in tim burtons view
i think sometimes combining the two can be refreshing
we need more films that require original and creative imaginations of any genre
even mixing two or three genres could be good justice
tim burton outdone himself on all his films and this one did not disappoint me at all
johnny depps character really was different than any films he has ever done but very good sense of humor and has a gothic view on how vampires should be
all of the casts and staff members who worked on this 150 million dollar movie made some fans go
eh whatever but most burtons and depps fans likes it
yes it is strange dark and funny but remarkably incredible
it was plain old fun
if youre expecting shakespeare or looking for an academy award winner look somewhere else
if you want to be entertained by helena stealing every scene in a bad wig and johnny depp doing something other than the pirate series this is the place for you
ive seen it twice will buy it on bluray and love it
sure there were some scenes that were kinda out there but its tim burton
did anyone expect anything less
compared to sweeney todd its a classic
compared to casablanca
its pretty awful
but isnt that what we go to movies for
mindless escape into someone elses story other than our own
go see this movie
and yes im praying for a sequel with hbc coming back to exact revenge
i loved it
although i never watched the original
it was an amazing movie the acting was really good
it is a definite must see
i kind of wished it was longer because the ending could have been potentially better
i thought is was worth the money spent
i am definitely buying it when it finally comes out on dvd and bluray
its a perfect date night movie
i considered it more of a comedy than a horror movie
especially since there isnt anything scary about the movie
the joke setup and timing was perfect
i hope this helps yall make a decision on if this movie is worth the money
my personally opinion is that the movie is but its up to you
enjoy
i love johnny depp and i love tim burton
together they can be sublime
look at ed wood and sweeney todd here well here they seem kind of lost
everything is in over the top tones without getting to the root of anything
the performances are shrill and disconnected with the exception of the wonderful helena bonham carter
the script is underwritten and the story is tired and unconvincing but in the present film going landscape it is more enjoyable than most others
im tempted to advise mr
burton and mr
depp to be a bit more daring in their intentions
were all aware of burtons visual wizardry and of depps remarkable beauty and talent why not put all that at the service of something meaningful
i am always open to something new
i really appreciate tim burton and johnny depps works as they are always unexpected and different
this one was not a replica of the show but showed it respect
how could anyone expect a show that ran for so long to be represented in a two hour movie
this was a fantastic piece that i look forward to seeing again and again
it is not a straight up comedy but i do not know of a better way they could have sold it
its nice to see vampires that do not sparkle and cannot be touched by sunlight
burton and depp have made a fantastic movie that has monsters that look like they are supposed to
it does homage to the original show as well as the monster actors of yesteryear
the original tv series was so beloved for its mystique and darkness
its hard to believe but this was actually scary at that time
i was excited when i heard the movie was being made
however i was expecting it to be a full scale horror film
this is what the loyal ds fans were hoping for
it would be great if they would remake this movie in a serious horror style
bet the profit margin would be significantly higher
man this one reminds me of when tim burton was on top of his game more or less
and i remember this not doing well so well with the critics but i liked it
wish i saw it sooner but whatever
anyway the film is based on an old boring show from the 70s
they rebooted it as a comedy just like what they did with 21 jump st
the movie is about a rich european immigrant business man who was turned into a vampire by a witch who loved him and stuffed in a coffin for a few hundred years only to be freed during the 70s and help his descendants and blah blah blah
check it out youll laugh a few times
the ending is rushed
final score 7 out of 10
i am old enough to remember watching the original dark shadows soap opera but i was a kid and so do not remember much about it
best i recall they played it straight
but it was of course a campy concept putting gothic horror elements into a daytime soap
which brings us to this movie
a lot of movies seem to fall into this trap they come up with a really good andor novel premise for the film
and so the beginning of the movie where they are establishing that reality is really good
but it is a movie which means it requires a story arc climax etc
superimposed upon the premise
and that is where it all goes if not bad it at least goes not as good
that seems to me to be what happened to dark shadows
it was still an amusing film with some interesting actors doing interesting roles
worth a look but dont buy it
its all about johnny depp as barnabus collins
every scene that you see him theres definitely a kind of atmosphere that follows him everywhere
while the other characters of the film just seem boring johnny adds life to everyone in every scene hes in
it almost became funny in places
the humor is of the dry variety of commentsjokes
they are told in a creepy and weird manner by johnny and solely by johnny
definitely not the kind of thing that you can laugh out loud to but instead you think about what was just said which makes for a pretty boring movie to watch
tim burton shouldnt bother with a sequel
if you want to watch a show about creepy monster types that the whole family can enjoy just watch the addams family
waaay more enjoyable
i went on to see dark shadows with much expectation but it did not deliver 100
firstly the acting by johnny depp was very good as alwayseva green also acted well as the cunning witchrest of the cast performed accordingly
story was also good but it lacked depththe movie did not know whether it is a comedy or a horror movie
dark shadows is undeniably entertaining and nothing else
there are things that could have been better
dir
by tim burton was not up to the markhe needed to make the movie more compact
the horror aside  theres nothing to make you bite your nails  dark shadows clearly works on three fronts
first is the picturesque setting then the acting and visual effect
i saw this movie three days ago and i had high expectations for the names of johnny depp amp tim burton  have a ringing name in my ears  and i was disappointed
the movie was too naive  the story was hollow and the acting was poor  johnny depp was the only one who knew how to play their rule  all other were missed up and was wondering out through the movie without a clue   i really expected much of this movie
tim burton returns in a very very bad movie  i thought it would be better with johnny depp on board
am still mad at them both for doing such a bad movie  the only good thing in this movie  which could be boring to others  is the music and songs for the early 70th  i really enjoyed it and this with the acting of johnny depp is the only reason i rate this movie 6 out of 10  without them music amp depp i could of rated this movies with a solid 4 or 3 maximum
wait till it is on dvd or go to theater if you feel bored and want to do anything but sitting home
dark shadows is based on the 19661971 television series that director tim burton was a fan of
here it becomes a mildly amusing mix of horror fantasy and comedy
barnabus collins becomes a vampire under the spell of a witch and is buried for 200 years
hes accidentally set free and returns to his ancestral family home
following the dramatic prologue the film becomes a comedy set in 1972 one year after the television series ended
the collins family is dysfunctional which makes for some good comic moments
ive never seen any episodes of the original television series however i feel the film would have worked more effectively with a darker more serious tone
burton is likely going for popular appeal here
introducing an old television series to a new generation
worth a look for tim burton fans
if you are going into this movie thinking you are going to see the drama filled dark shadows tv show brought to life by the infamous tim burton think again
if you are going into this movie thinking you are going to be watching another great burtondeppcarter movie then you are right as a stand alone movie this is a great movie about the life of a vampire who has been entombed for centuries only to have to help save his decedents from evil spirits after being resurrected however this movie has very little shared plot line with the actual tv program
with the tv show being somewhat of a drama burton went for more of a comedic feel to life as a turn of the century vampire
it all depends on which end of the spectrum youre looking from
me being the burtondeppcarter fan that i am thoroughly enjoyed watching depp submerge himself in the quirky somewhat naive barnubus jones
if you are watching the movie expecting it to be a movie version of the tv show then youll surely be disappointed
overall another win for burton as far as im concerned
i think i am confused
i have never seen this mysterious series that this movie is based on
and indeed havent even heard of this series
but still if a movie is good  i shouldnt need to know all about what it is based on
and this movie is not good
it is just not a good movie that is pretty much what it all comes down to
its not funny enough to be a funny movie
it could be darker when it just gets silly
it could be just silly but instead its boring
it could be dramatic but it just gets too boring silly trytoohard
sigh sigh sigh
love tim burton
love johnny depp
but what the heck was all this
it never took me anywhere
it simply confused me
recap silly
boring
notfunnyenough
what was mr burton thinking
dark shadows is unlike the many strange and different tim burton films that have come across in past years from charlie and the chocolate factory and alice in wonderland
this film had a great story with very good acting from johnny depp chloe grace mortez michelle pfiffer and jackie earl haley
haley and depp were hilarious while pfiffer and eva green provided the film a backbone
even though this film may seem strange from the posters and trailers it truly isnt when seeing the movie due to the story explaining the odd elements of the film
in fact the only strange part of the film was the always strange helena bonham carter who actually was decent in this film
this film has some decent scares and some good laughs along the way which makes this a more mature version of a nightmare before christmas and a funnier and very more kid friendly version of sweeney todd
this is an easy 7
5 out of 10 and should be watched regardless of how strange it may appear
i paid my bucks as i wanted to see this on the big screen should have saved my money and waited for the dvd
even with a large ensemble cast the script writing makes them look two dimensional
this movie cant make its mind up am i scary comedic melodrama
when the gags get going it jumps to a scary scene then a something straight out of a soap opera all be it that was what the original dark shadows was
also respect to burton and let down for depp as this is depps project he asked burton as a friend to direct
young script writers first big movie is a let down and to do it with one of the most famous hollywood partnerships burton and depp makes it worse
dark shadows save your money wait for the dvd
as a dark shadows and a tim burton fan i had high hopes for this film
those hopes were crushed
this film lacked in every sense
the script was poorly written the story was all over the place the acting was ehhh and i felt there wasnt enough focus on the characters besides barnabas
the show focused on victoria julia david barnabas and the other collins family members not on just one or two characters
the film should have been longer depps makeup was just too white and wow i can ramble on and on about how disappointed i was after wasting money to see this
the film has the same tim burtondepp feel it wasnt any different from his other filmscollaborations
i would rather watch planet of the apes and charlie and the chocolate factory two other burton films in which i dont care for than watch this again
my advice watch the dark shadows revival 1991 starring ben cross or watch the original show starring the late jonathan frid and wait til this is released on dvd to rent it from redbox
i thought it was awful
the first time i saw the trailer i thought it would be a bit tacky but then i saw johnny depp and i said it would be a nice comedy movie
but as it turned it wasnt funny and the story was crap
now about the acting
i thought johnny depp wasnt bad considering its a shitty role
and the girl i cant even talk about her shes like 15 and shes acting like shes in college
and angelique i found her more disturbing
tim burton really blew it this time this is one of the most awful movies in 2012
it should be banned from the country
and the ending is the worst thing ever the walls were bleeding and angelique kept on breaking like glass
and then barnabas jumped from the cliff to turn victoria into a vampire
and then the last scene was dr
julia under the sea and shes a vampire
i hope they wont film a sequel because i wont be able to stand it
this cannot be classified under any particular genre
a completely different concept even from the usual tim burton fantasy movies
this movie is obviously not meant for a lot of people and has left a lot disappointed
and thats not cos the movie was bad but just that the majority viewers prefer watching a stereotype fixed movie and are not ready to venture into something completely new and original
true i agree the the ending is a tee let down from the super high start
and i have given a star less for that
but apart from that  tim burton is a genius and can deliver something fresh for those in search of it
and outstanding performance by johhny depp helena bonham carter and chloa grace moretz not to mention the rest of the star crew
barnabas collins is a vampire cursed by a witch who is love and unfortunately for him barnabas does not return her love
he is left in a casket for more than a century and when released he finds that he has landed in the year 1972
johnny depp can play almost any role that is thrown his way
a pirate a hatter and a vampire
the latter is shown here and it is interesting and amusing to see him play a vampire from the 1700s
tim burtons macabre and creepy humor comes out throughout with johnny depp definitely helping with that
it is also considerably dark and while trying to maintain the comedy over the course of almost two hours the movie has its ups and down
the sexual content is a bit much as well and would have been perfectly fine without it
however i enjoyed it because you develop feelings for the characters and it certainly does grab you and make you want to learn how it all turns out
dark shadows is also a perfect halloween movie
yes its oldfashioned so is the tvgothicsoap dark shadows as well but the actors do so well especially jonny depp as eccentric vampire barnaby and eva green as wonderfully mean witch angelique that i smiled amused throughout the movie
great music love carpenters bloody moments playful jokes and beautiful fantastic decor and interiors make it fun
despite the glimpseshort cameo of dark shadows veterans jonathan frid david selby lara parker amp kathryn leighscott you catch them as party attenders at collingwood disappoints the whole storyline bout jonny lee miller does not touched me at all and some bumpy parts in the middle  still 6 out of 10
just a pastime but one tip to enjoy this rubbish maybe exclusively for sushi lovers
all the people in the town has long been preying on fish which beautifully has no appearance in any scene
well they people are killing them fish as ruthlessly as me and more savagely than any vampire who is the only exception to the humans tyranny towards the nature
laugh at the vegetarians
so when you go to a sushi bar at least just after this regrettable movie theater say thank you fish
this is the first work of any vampire art which has made me say yes to sucking humans blood
oh one more good news jackie hasnt lost it
this movie was a big disappointment
the big issue is the story its 210 there are many and many pointless section is the scenario
if you consider this movie as a comedy its again terrible 210 there are around 56 comic scenes over the movie so what
a terribly weak story pointless characters and guess what a couple of beautifulmostly technically scenes
here are couple of examples 1 who is davids mother why she could kill the witch
2 who is dr
julia hoffman for the movie at the end we see that she is still alivekind of so what
have to repeat my self its not a comedy not even 10 its not an horror film the story and characters are weak and its really boring
i wanted to like this movie as i am a tim burton fan but it was a boring film that was visually well made and well acted but lacked an interesting plot
the actors especially johnny depp were fun to watch as usual but didnt have much to work with
its almost as if there was a great idea for a plot and then everyone got caught up in the costumes scenery and witty comments leaving the plot to evolve through the scenes
i was bored about a fourth of the way in
the scenes where there were implied sexual encounters were pointless
i still dont understand being half in with sex
either put it in and its an adult movie and we can enjoy it or leave it out
it doesnt work when its half done
its not cute or amusing
i rate a film on a lot of areas but the most important is would i see it again and i will not be watching this one again
meaningless disgusting crap made just to earn profit
i dont really understand the concept of these movieswhy are they liked in masses
they just followed the trend like previous bollywoods hits i
e dabang and singham  a fruity vampire with a hair piece
wearing gothic garb a lot english fight action scenes
senseless dialogues repeated in every 15mins
idiotic emotional drama
idiotic villain
cheap item song to attract pervert crowd
johnathan dep is a respectable person and a good actori really used to like him
god only knows why hes selecting such types of movies ps the movie was so dumb actually made me write a review for the first time
i am a very easy grader on movies
as long as my mind is engaged and i dont find myself wondering about something else a movie gets a pass from me
i literally lost interest in what happened about twothirds way through the movie and agree with another poster that this movie was just all over the place without doing anything as far as the plot goes well
i have no problem with the performances and liked the cast
but i far more enjoyed catching safe for the third time than i enjoyed even the first two thirds of dark shadows
i found the tourist the ninth gate and sleepy hollow 10 times as entertaining and would watch any of them over again once a year
also pirates 4 which i had a bit of trouble with the first time through but since then have probably watched it a half dozen times with great appreciation
loved stardust and even hocus pocus
but i see no reason to ever watch this movie again
that is an incredibly harsh review from me
yes i was one of those running home from school to watch dark shadows each day
i bought the dvd collection and have my husband hooked on it now
i was almost afraid to see this movie after reading all of the early comments after seeing the trailers but there was no way i would have missed it
what great fun
except for a few character changes that i was not happy with such as julia hoffman and roger collins it was a wonderful and entertaining two hours
no one will ever replace the original but this was an excellent twist
i actually hated the house of dark shadows movie because it turned my favorite characters and the great story lines of the series into a mindless bloodbath
the ben cross revival mini series was lame compared to the original
this time burton and depp took a different approach and added some comedy to balance the drama
reminded me a bit of another favorite old movie of mine
love at first bite
add alice cooper to the mix and it was impossible for me not to love it
hope there will be sequels
orlando bloom would make a great quentin collins
well twenty dollars and two hours of my life i cant get back
you live and learn  but as my husband pointed out if i hadnt seen this movie i would have always wondered
i wish mr
burton had made up his mind to make this story either serious or campy
with johnny depp as the star id have voted for campy since he does it so well
there were some twists to the plot that to me didnt add anything and frankly didnt make sense
in the original soap opera barnabas collins looked fairly normal until the fangs came out
johnny didnt look even vaguely normal and any really normal person would have been put off by his appearance  and certainly wouldnt have been tempted to kiss him
put some more thought into your next one mr
burton
unfortunately for fans of johnny depp and chloe moretz this would have to be one of the worst pieces that they have made
hopefully fans will forget quickly
the film had me wishing that i had bought a bigger popcorn
that way after about the first ten minutes i would have something to do
the scenery was excellent and gave the film a great gothic feel that it needed
the ruins of the mansion looked spectacular
unfortunately the wooden acting and the manner in which each sub plot was written and resolved like a weekly tv drama made it difficult to have any real reaction when something happened
the comedy aspects that this film is supposed to have must have been playing in the cinema next door
i didnt find any comedy in this film except for the abysmal performance of eva green
yet again another movie where the ending is so obvious and embarrassing when it is finally revealed you sit cringing in your chair hoping that they really dont make the second movie
if you want to see this film wait for it to be on tv so you dont have to pay for it
if the tone set in the first ten minutes of dull shadows had been carried over into the last 110 minutes of the film this would have been a very good entry in the burtondepp oeuvre
instead the tone changes drastically from sleepy hollow to a poor mans beetlejuice
its as if the opening sequence was directed by a skilled craftsman and the remainder by a skilled but inexperienced dilletante
the sets are excellent as is the cinematography but the characters are underdeveloped and the actors underused
depp puts in a carefully crafted performance as count chocula but not barnabas collins
this is a disaster and the threat of a sequel is unbearable
certainly the original series was a bit campy but charmingly so
this film is just over the top in a very underwhelming way
guess though that as long as it sells seats thats all that matters in hollywood
as it goes this film is all dressed up with no where to go
if you always have enjoyed johnny depp movies skip this one as you will be disappointed
if you have always enjoyed tim burton movies skip this one as you will be disappointed
if you were a fan of the original television series skip this one as you will be disappointed
if you are a fan of eva green my favorite of the current bond girls skip this one as you will be disappointed
highly predictable and dull although with a twist or two towards the end
every funny scene that you have seen in the commercials is the sum of all of the funny scenes in the movie
otherwise this is two hours of your life that you wont get back
while not as bad as the third twilight movie from which i am still reeling this movie was a tremendous waste of time and talent
i will go see the next burtondepp combo but unless i am being paid or my family held at gunpoint i wont watch this piece of garbage again even as background noise on tv
i usually like the burtondepp combination sometimes a lot sometimes not so much but this im afraid is very poor stuff indeed
i have no idea what burton was aiming for but the general ambiance is of a lowgrade afternoon tv film aimed at the earlyteen market
the female characters were straight out of bewitched and many of the special effects were a mishmash of beetlejuice and death becomes her coated in the usual burton eyeshadow not intrinsically a bad thing but now starting to look like last years colourway
there is no character or plot development the film is neither scary nor humorous
would uncritical twelve year olds like it
i dont know but its not for critical adults thats for sure
spend your money on something else
im seriously surprised many people dont enjoy this movie while i have repeated this movie for three times
i know that movie review can be very different within one another but really this is not a bad movie very not
this is a really fun movie
the whole scene and time i spent in the cinema and in the tv i am very entertained
maybe because i am inspired by vintage stuffs and the vintage settings in this movie make me in love
the story is funny and again it proves that there is not a single thing johnny depp cannot do
maybe this movie is not suitable for you who are too serious
all the casts can do acting well
if you really need a good laugh have it a try
and a bag of popcorn will do
maybe this is all
dark shadows is not a great film but its entertaining enough to warrant a watch even if its a bit all over the place in terms of quality
the movie starts off a little slow but its got a strong and very entertaining middle that i feel elevates it enough that i can give it a mild recommendation
it looks great and youll get a lot of laughs out of it enough to forgive the end which sort of comes out of nowhere and unfortunately does not follow up with some of the charm it had earlier on
i had heard multiple times from people that a lot of tim burtons movies feel like the director lost his interest in the story towards the end and it really feels like thats the case here
i did enjoy myself while watching it and i have to say that some of the visuals and the sets featured in this film are really impressive
i had a blast just looking at the film
theatrical version on the big screen may 20 2012
ive read so many negative reviews of dark shadows that i just wanted to add my 2 cents
i enjoyed this film especially the look of it
the set design i think was brilliant and the interior shots of collinwood simply beautiful
and i also enjoyed the cast
this film is based on a tv soap opera that i was addicted to back in the day
that said anyone who watched dark shadows on television knows the program was riddled with problems
it was very low budget and props gave way actors forgot their lines booms and lights often appeared on screen and the story wound its way to hell and back
but those were not the things that mattered to me
it was the atmosphere of the show i loved and its gothic theme
yes the dark shadows film is flawed but i found it entertaining
it captured some of the ridiculousness of the television show while elevating the production value off the chart
if you like darkly brooding yet luscious sets combined with well acted quirky characters and a generous dose campy humor you might enjoy this film too
this movie is for those 13 and older
this dark shadows shares little with the dark shadows of the late 1960searly 1970s except for the names of the characters
yes barnabas is still a vampire and angelique a witch
with its overly dramatic acting and dark picturesque scenes this movie comes off more like a comic book
not the say the interpretation is bad it is just very different no werewolf in the original dark shadows in the original family
the interpretation is so different that many who grew up with jonathan frid as barnabas may feel a bit cheated
jonathan frids character tried to hide his monster from his family this barnabas does not hide his monster
who cares if the characters are shallow or that the script is not that good
it is a comic book rendition of dark shadows
for what it is it works
this is a popcorn popper and a cruncher at the end
you gotta love the sets and the addition of alice cooper
i give it five thumbs up
after seeing the trailer many times in the cinema the film looked very promising and i was very much looking forward to seeing it
however throughout the entire film i found myself completely uninterested and bored
the film proved to be the opposite of what i had hoped
yes there were quite funny bits every now and then throughout the film but they were all shown in the trailer
it was a real shame because of the brilliant cast the likes of johnny depp and michelle pfeiffer all brilliant actors and the acting was good  the plot was just a let down
a little bit cheesy and over the top for my liking
i hope they dont make a follow one it is just not needed
i wouldnt recommend it as a must see
so disappointing how could you mess this up with such a great director such amazing actors visuals that were amazing some sfx withstanding
the soundtrack was great the acting was great
the only thing that let it down and in a major game ending way was the script
more and more hollywood movies place less emphasis on a great script and just worry about the soundvisuals which is fine if its a boneheaded action flick but anything else its just sad and annoying
this started out strong and i was really excited to see a great new movie
ended up with my finger hovering over the stop button way too many times just a waste of good talent and money
tim burtons career has been kind of all over the place
recently his last film alice in wonderland wasnt anything to get excited about but this was a welcome return to form if he ever had one officially for burton
the best part of the film is johnny depp having a great time in the role of the vampire barnabas collins
eva green also does well as the witch who cursed him
the film has flaws however with its uneven tone not quite balanced between comedy and horror
just a closing note i thank the film for the carpenters references and the montage featuring top of the world
thanks for resurrecting the carpenters when they had seemingly disappeared from the modern culture
ok im a huge johnny depp fan so im gonna say he was awesome himself as usual so thats why i gave it 6 out of 10
i know tim burtons style so i didnt go to see the movie with high expectation
i think that all characters were underdeveloped
i expected little bit more detailed story about each one of them and there were way to many scenes showing only two people
i liked special effects mainly towards the end of the movie and attention to some details it could have been done even better
i have to say it was ok movie for rainy afternoon but definitely not as good as edward scissorhands or alice in wonderland
black humour was not strongfunny enough me
i guess tb tried to please bigger audience and he ended up disappointing his and jd fans
10 people in the imax theatre i went to on the opening weekend speaks volume on how people feel about the movie without even seeing it
sorry tb but you should have taken your time cause i know you can do better
afraid to say i was actually pretty disappointed by burton
i have watched every single movie burton has made from corpse bride to edward scissor hands
i love the cast love the acting but the film seemed empty
like there was no real story line just about building up the families fortune and then some interfering witch
the trailer made the movie look really funny but i didnt actual laugh at all in the film
for a 12a it was extremely sexual and for any one with children who is considering watching this expect some weird questions from children
i am only 18 and even i sat there and questioned the age rating
they made chloe moretz extremely sexual to the extreme it was sort of unnecessary
it is a movie that i would only watch once
overall i think very highly of tim burton but perhaps this wasnt one of his best movies
me and my friends came out wondering if wed enjoyed it or not but it is worth a watch the special effects are very well done
dark shadows  its good to watch johnny depp on screen
his acting could never disappointed you
directing by tim burton  official page the scenes of barnabas collins was first time in the world of 1971 after centuries left in the dark lonely coffin reminded me of his appearance in edward scissorhands
especially when he was taking his first breakfast on the dinner table
of course listing depp in a film would never make it less interesting
the other characters would certainly play so good role too
its kinda a very funny humorous film implemented in a complete plot of the collinswitch revenges
it was a very nice story and happened to be a very good use of cgi too
you would definitely find it very entertaining
too much of funny part that i rather say nothing much but to ask you go watching this movie by yourself
its 3 and a half stars worth
may be 4
