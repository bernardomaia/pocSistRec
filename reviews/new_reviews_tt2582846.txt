wow
being an avid book reader im always skeptical about watching the words of my favorite books transformed and materialized on the big screen
but tfios stayed true to the book
the movie was absolutely lovely from beginning to end
the young actors were great
the comedy hit on all the right notes the romance made your heart smile and the tragedy pulled at your heart strings
it really was a wonderful adaptation and i believe it stayed as true to the book as possible without many changes where there were any
the minute it was over i wanted to watch it again
upon leaving the theater i looked around and there was not one dry eye
not even the men
if you are a big fan of the book like myself
and are skeptical about whether this stays true
dont be
kudos the john green on his first film adaptation
it was an absolute success
id give it a 10 out of 10 if i could
but i dont believe in perfect
i dont really cry in movies unless theyre really really sad
and this movie is bound to get you crying like theres no tomorrow
i brought a box of tissues and i used about half of them
i have never cried so much in my entire life
being an avid fan of the book i was kind of scared that like some of my other favourite books the movie would be ruined
but no the movie had all of the books materials in it except for one thing
i never thought shailene and ansel would play hazel and gus but when i watched it their performance blew me away
i think shailenes ability to cry got me crying because thats how real it felt
it is an amazing movie and im sorry to say that its even better than a walk to remember
go see this movie and if you do maybe read the book first so that you can be somewhat prepared
some infinities are bigger than other infinities says my favorite quote from the movie and the book and its true because i am going to love this movie for the longest of the infinity
i am a huge fan of the book and one thing which really makes the movie stand out is an amazing performance by shailene woodley
she is outstanding in every scene she is and i have to say i am kind of in love with hazel
even though its a love story of a girl who has terminal cancer i wouldnt say that the film is tragic rather the film is about living your life to the fullest in your little infinity if you have already read the book the film is true to the book and the great acting directing and music adds another dimension to the story
the fault in our stars is definitely one of the best romantic movies ever
when you see this movie you are going to laugh and you are going to cry and when the end credit roles i can guarantee most of you are going to be completely in love with this love story
this film is horribly cheesy
hollywood does cancer very very badly
the male lead could not act and therefore i was not convinced and therefore i did not cry
i cry at everything usually but this film is not convincing at all
it was definitely the male lead that spoilt it for me
i just didnt understand his naked obsession with the female lead
from the minute he sets eyes on her wham he is in love
i found that very strange or maybe it was just the way he did it
i know love at first sight happens but this seemed way over the top
if you watch love story from the 60s which features cancer it has an authentic love story and build up but this film does not seem to be that genuine so you dont really care about the characters
to be frank the whole thing reeks of cheese
stay away
why anyone would care to see this play on emotion junk movie i have no idea
full of obvious heartstring pulling scenes fit for 12 year old girls
i wouldnt suggest this garbage be watched by anyoneunless you are that 812 year old girl that find badly written scripts good
you get more content from a maury whos my baby daddy episode
if you find yourself with nothing to do avoid this movie
even as a last resort
it would leave you empty inside from the hollow acting all the way to the bad script and plot scenes
should you have a daughter that wishes to see this prevent that from happening at all costs
this will only succeed in diminishing their intellect and giving them a false sense of reality with life and relationships
ok so heres the thing
i was so not going to bother writing a review for this movie
yes i loved it however there were things in the book i think should have been in the movie
thats why i give it a 9 not a 10
now the reason im writing this review this movie is sad
it promises to be sad just by the decription and the trailer
looking at the cover tells you that its going to be romantic
if you do not like these types of movies or you are a heartless bonehead like the guy that gave this heartfelt movie a 1 and wishes he could have given a 0 do not watch this movie
my fianca put it right this movie and book is the notebook on steroids
you will cry
you will get mad at the crying because it wont stop
and above all you will watch it again and again thinking each time youll make it without a single tear
that will not happen but youll try anyway
hazel grace and augustus waters will steal your heart and the end is the hardest part
yes someone dies but who i wont spoil that
its not who you think btw
watched the fault in our stars featuring shaliene woodleythe spectacular now as hazel grace lancaster ansel egortcarrie as augustus waters nat wolffstuck in love as issac also starring laura dernjurassic park as fran lancastersam trammelltrue blood as michael lancaster  lotte verbeekthe borgias as lidewij vliegenthart mike birbigilagirls as patrick and willem dafoethe grand budapest hotel as peter van houten
the film was great also a very touching story of hope and love also it was great to see the dynamic of augustus and grace living with terminal illnesses and still having a positive outlook on life
amazing screenplay by michael h weber500 days of summer amp scott neustdaterthe spectacular now cinematography by ben richardsonbeasts of the southern wild costume design by mary claire hannanserendipity and direction by josh boonestuck in love  a heartwarming romance better than titanic 1010
this movie will remind you about how special is your life is and helps you embrace your life with good deeds
its a one time must watch movie
go watch it and find out how lucky everyone is in this world
this movie can make you sad for characters but if you think deeply u will find out that its true happiness of life that those characters feel in the amsterdam trip
whether you got this happiness for small time or for whole life it doesnt matter its just that you should feel like that once in our life
the end was also good i like it when author van houten comes to meet hazel and give her that letter its awesome

this movie
this movie is a masterpiece i dont have any words regarding this movie this movie is a massage for those who dont understand the meaning of love
scene to scene this movie just manages to suck me into this beautiful world of hazel grace lancaster and augustus waters
the pain and emotions felt by the characters felt so real as if i was feeling the same emotions
it was also one of the most beautiful as it truly showed how exhilarating comforting and exciting love is
i probably cried throughout about half of the movie
please at least sit with a packet of tissues while watching this movie
honestly this is the best movie i have seen all year
i went into this movie expecting a stupid teenagerdrama
i havent read the book and im not really a love story type of guy
and although many people may see it as just that a stupid teenage love story i was very positively surprised
it was actually cute and funny and i really enjoyed it
it might still have a few klischea  teenage movie things and it might try to be all inspirational but it felt real and heartfelt
i was also positively surprised by the performances which were nicely and lovingly done
it was sad but at the same time gave you a warm chummy feeling
so if you like a good love story that has a little humour to it but manages to crush you a little as well i highly recommend this movie
ive been trying to figure out why this movie is so highly rated and not sure why or how anyone could sit through this nonsense
all around horrible acting and predictable storyline from start to finish
i was tricked into seeing this and by far the worst movie ive seen since 2004
highlights all the narcissism and self entitlement problems females today bring to the world
princess syndrome at its worst
two sick people and a family and one individual spends the entire time only thinking of herself and what she wants how these other person can improve her pitiful life while she does nothing to contribute back
thinking they need her and wont be able to cope or survive without her come on
just terrible avoid this and movies like that stop making this unequal nonsense
stop supporting it but then again i guess some people really arent as committed to equality as they claim
this film is a love story about two teenagers with cancer however the film may be about cancer there is so much more than just cancer
its about two teenagers who who meet each other though a support group and except that they have to deal with their illnesses
this film is filled with all sorts of emotions from happiness and laughter to anger and sadness
it has amazing actors and actresses in the film and you feel like you actually connect with the characters and feel their emotions
it is an amazingly powerful story thats full of surprises
its not your every day love story its a story that will stay with you forever and leave your mind wondering after the film has finished
however i would really recommend reading the film first firstly it may help you to understand the film and secondly the book contains more of the story and more characters
overall it is an amazing film and book that is definitely worth a watch
when i was begin to watch this movie i think this is not good movie
but after i saw this is excellent movie
it is so realistic movie about cancer patients
then i saw this movie written about book
i watched this film over and over
its so romantic film together drama film
its affecting you for some days
but the end of this movie isnt bad end
i can say its happy end to
hazel will not die virginaugustus too
and i didnt understand imdbs 10 line review thing
im not living in country which language is english
so my english is awful
if anybody try to speak this thing i know you are feeling this
there are 1 more line away
and its over bye bye
i watched a movie called the fault in our stars
i hope it won an oscar and any other award it could
it addresses and embraces terminal illness and death with
beauty is the word that comes to mind
you will cry
you will laugh
you will rage
and it will all be very real how do i know
im terminally ill
i am have sever copd yes like leonard nimoy and i could die literally at any moment
this film is a true representation of what dying is like of the sorrow and terror and silliness
i love this movie
every single person in the world should watch this movie
this movie is the absolute best of the film makersstory tellers art
i would have given it twenty stars but they only give you ten slots
by far the saddest movie ive ever seen never cried so much in my life
its by far the most beautiful and heartbreaking movie you will ever watch
if this movie doesnt move you then theres something wrong with you
a love story that will last the ages
you will instantly fall in love with hazel grace and augustus waters as they bring you into their world and teach you how to love and cope with loss
the performances by both main characters were spot on and the chemistry was indeed touching
i cried from the beginning the end and this truly was the saddest ending ive ever seen in a movie
it has a brilliant soundtrack to add to it
all in all this is a movie that will make you go through all the motions from laughing to crying
the best movie i have seen
okay so before i saw this movie i read the book and i loved it  the movie was a bit different and some characters werent in the movie but it was good no i mean it was great
its one of the best movies ive even watched it made laugh and cry it just simply made me happy
and its really amazing
ive given almost half the movies ive watched 1010 but this is the one that truly deserves it
and if i could give this movie a 100 i would i got so obsessed over it
if you want to watch a romantic movie thatll just make you smile and cry i really suggest this
its not like all the cancer love stories or whatever
its just kind of different people might say that im over rating it but i sure am not
everybody has a different taste in movies
but if you like romance youll love this movie i hope
i watched this movie today
i already knew the story from the book written by john green the fault in our stars that i have already read before
as i expected the movie would be it was worth my expectations
though some facts are skipped in the movie the movie is incredibly awesome and the part played by the shailene woodley as the hazel grace is perfect including her voice
it reminds me the quotes in the book
indeed john greens writing is adorable that contain much of interesting and funny quotes
i was much eager to watch it and now i am curious to read its story again and to remember its quotes
as i finished watching it i jumped into imdb to write a review about it
i recommend this movie
this is better than a walk to remember not that they should even be compared
i was opposed to the concept of the novel and waited until long after my friends raved about it to read it
then i did
i absorbed it in one night
i say absorbed because this story is not one that empties you takes your tears and leaves you devoid of emotion
this story fills empty places that you didnt know you had
it reaffirms that life is precious and shot
love is pure timeless knows no boundaries
all of the complications we make our lives have are not necessary we should all look at the world like augustus waters size what we want and love it with everything we have
such a boring movie
terrible casting terrible acting and so many things that do not fit into reality like underage kids drinking champagne in the park which is not in a paper bag and champagne cork just pops open when you pull
or a suitcase that looks giant and the driver lifts it up like there is nothing in there
details are important to make movie believable
both main characters did a terrible job acting you cant feel chemistry at all theyre just reading lines
constant staring which is creepy and empty and weird not romantic
boring
would be better if with someone else as main characters and better job in directing
i understand the girl is sick but a little make up wouldnt kill her or girly clothes
something that makes it work
i strongly dislike this movie
the love story physically makes me ill
i wouldnt recommend it to anyone unless you are a desperate and sappy teenager it is based on an extremely unlikely romance between two young teenagers who obviously only like each other because they come from similarly rough backgrounds and are so desperate to have a relationship that they start seeing the first person they bump into
in all fairness i did find the acting in this moving particularly from hazel quite good
her pain when gus dies is quite convincing
but unfortunately good acting in one scene is not enough and this movie and book turned out to be a complete waste of time
please dont put yourself through the pain of watching it
ok
so i saw this movie
what i think about it
it was awful
like the summary says one of the worst movies i have ever seen
the story its pretty simple
with basic ideas
shes dying
for like 7 years or so
because of course
her parents have money and manage to give her all that she needs
from my point of view it has too much drama
of course i spilled some tears but just because its all about dying in this movie
how can you not cry a little
the only brilliant thing about this story is that writer who says the things as they are right to her face
the first time they meet because the second time at the funeral he just becomes part of her drama trying to help her and all of that
i didnt forget about gus
the boy of course there is a boy
her boy
they where together for a couple of months before they kissed
and that kiss
just gave her her breath back after she climbed all of those stairs
classic
i could talk all day about this movie
but the idea is that its to long for the small idea they are trying to show
i have never seen a worse movie
the acting was the worst i have ever seen the dialogue was horrible and it is unrealistic i mean seriously star wars is more realistic and im not the biggest romance movie fan but it is still not good i can deal with it if there is good acting dialogue and is realistic but it has none of those factors
it is predictable because they try to make it unpredictable but it doesnt work it gets worse and worse they try to be funny but the jokes fall flat
ansel elgort was the worst actor in this and i just wanted everyone to die in this movie
it is even worse than titanic 2 and that movie was not good it at least had people die that i didnt like this only had one so it is obviously sucks
so for starters i didnt plan on watching this movie
me and my girlfriend tried to watch 22 jump street but it was sold out so we needed up having to watch this
if youre past the agar of 15 please save your time and money
this money if for those little helpless romantic girls who enjoy a tragic love story which is what this movie is
the only reasonable that it was bearable was cause at least the actors did a good job but its still a very predictable movie and sorta boring too
oh man some of the things in this movie were flat out stupid like for example gus the guy who falls in love with the main character hazel
hes a survivor from cancer but lost his leg yet he does this stupid thing were he buys cigarettes keeps them in his mouth but doesnt light it up
his reasoning is this its a metaphor you put the thing that kills you in your mouth but you dont give it the power to kill you its definitely the little stupid things like this that just made this movie dumb
am i the only one who did not like this movie
i mean i looove the book but the movie was a disappointment im not trying to be rude or anything i just thought the movie would be better the actors are good but i still imagined them being different i thought that they would
idk what i thought i just think the movie was a disappointment and when i read the book i cried towards the ending when agustus was dying but in the movie i was not even bothered like my eyes were not stinging or anything i think that the movie could have been better if it had a more touching ending and also i did not fell in love with agustus like i did in the book  idk im just sayin this movie could have been one of my favorites but its not honestly thou i just think that the book is too good to have been made into a movie caus im in love with the book
im not trying to say that i hated this movie i just didnt like as much as i thought i would
i cant describe how let down i feel there is so so much attention with this movie that i had to go and watch it so many people talking about it adverts everywhere i was so excited to see this cause i am a movie and especially a love movie sucker even better sad but i could just predict everything that was going to happen next in the movie like every little bit ive seen already before like much of it from my sisters keeper  which i did have tears to whereas not a tear shed with this movie i just felt like the acting wasnt very good either like shailaine however u spell it i absolutely loved her in divergent
but in this movie i couldnt feel her or her character  i want to watch it again and see what im missing  this has such a high rating  im so disappointed that i left the cinemas with no emotions from the movie  i mean i couldnt even feel my eyes water forgive me for my errors
i was totally spellbound on seeing an 8
2 rating for this movie
imdb rating has nowadays become wholly untrustworthy
the whole thing seemed like a soap opera series with crying tears and sentiments
if so much people are giving this rating i believe it is only for the sob
in real life this is really heartbreaking but for a movie it is sick and pathetic
the heroine does not deliver anything and the hero seems worst
the whole movie does not even require a review
it does not do the main basic reason for a filmto entertainwhether for crying or for laugh or for horror or any other emotion
this movie is for immature people who like to cry on seeing rubbish sentiments
every girl i know was obsessed with the book
and then the movie
i figured that it had to be good with such a high score
makes sense right
man was i surprised
the movie was awful
the majority of the actors werent at all believable and those who were played annoying and cheesy clichas
many scenes made no sense and were unrealistic
the whole experience was bad as well
the audience that went to see this film is made up of teenage girls who ignored all the faults in the film and gave it a 10
i hope someone like me is reading reviews here
then maybe they could avoid ever paying to see this movie
i nearly left the theatre towards the end when pretty much everyone in there started sobbing uncontrollably
it was too cheesy and bad to be at all emotional
there was nothing i took away from this film
i wouldnt recommend seeing it
i was extremely disappointed
take out cancer and they are left with a hollow storyline
the movie is simply not believable to me
i know it is fiction but fiction can be made into a very believable film if it has relatable characters or storyline
not to mention i find gus character rather simple minded
hazels parents characteristics are contradictory too
they are portrayed to be protective of their daughters wellbeing and safety but this conveniently dissipates when hazel wanted to fly to amsterdam with gus
sorry i think this is not for a more realisticmature audience dont get me wrong i love romantic films but this is sadly not my cup of tea
wow such great acting and such great and simple dialogue
the characters have such great chemistry
i love that in this story that you got to see the characters grow to being friends into loving each other
the characters really care about the people that they are portraying and they try to be as real and authentic as possible
this is such a sweet and great love story
spoiler warning the ending to this movie is so rough and so hard
we all know that he is gonna die but when it happens you cant help but feel so empty and heartbroken
the ed sheeran song to this movie alone is so sad as well
i love this movie and i want to read the book and compare both
such great acting and shailene is such a talented actress
two teenage cancer patients begin a lifeaffirming journey to visit a reclusive author in amsterdam
the fault in our stars was way too painful for me to watch you have this 2 kids that are sick and they have cancer and then they fell in love and they try to live every moment as their last and from out of nowhere one of them dies and it just hit me right in the feels
shailene woodley and ansel elgort in this movie are fantastic the same goes for willem dafoe and although his role is kinda small it still has to do something with the plot and he gives a good performance too and honestly the whole cast is great the movie is touching its funny and its a sweet romance for the whole family okay
okay
firstly this film is an adaptation of john greens book
before watching the film i read the book and from my point of view the book is better than the film because you can observe the little details quite a bit better
in this film we can also see the power of unconditional friendship and the importance of support when you really need it
the teenagers who fall in love in the film are called augustus waters and hazel grace lancaster and we can know that their love is going to be everlasting in spite of at the beginning we couldnt think it
if you have girlfriend or boyfriend this will be a very interesting film to see with him or her
im really glad i didnt watch any trailers for this movie because i probably wouldnt even have watched it
they look so damn kitschy but gladly the movie isnt
the best thing are the characters
they feel so real its like watching the everyday life of real people with real problems to live with
mainly because of the smart dialogue which is filled with beautiful metaphors about life and the incredible acting especially by the main character played by shailene woodley
this is underlined with a great score and some little turns within the story
if you dont need action or a lot of suspense to enjoy a movie i can definitely recommend seeing this one
if you are a sensitive person chances are high that youll end up crying although the movie is very life affirming for the most time
enjoy
if you enjoy a movie blatantly marketed at a 13 yr old girl then i would absolutely recommend this movie because youll barely get through the opening credits without being reminded of who the target audience is
it features fun bubble texting effects lots and lots of apple products and of course parents far better looking than any that exist in real life
everything that made the book so great has been stripped away and the result is a movie that in its most heart wrenching moments is merely funny
it has no depth no reality and 2d characters that struggle to get their best lines out
if youve read the book avoid the movie at all costs because youll never be able to read the book again
from the starting till the end the movie was epic each line and scene had its own meaning
this movie relates to my life as i have a friend like hazel who was suffering from a blood cancer but when she told her boyfriend he left her in her bad time
at that time she wanted to die because everything was going all wrong but i supported her too much at that time and finally she get rid off from the cancer after suffered from an year same as i was suffering from the same thing after that and she do the same as i do
the movie reminds both of us who you actually are and never loose faith
i never drop a single tear from eyes in any movie and this is the first movie my eyes were wet while watching
really an epic and tragic love story
this movie is just perfect in my view everything fits so nicely together
the story screenplay and above all the acting
just fantastic
i have never written a review before seeing this movie just made me to
the cinematography is just great it is not in your face and helps you to feel part of the story
the casting is so natural especially the lead actors very well done
the story feels so natural you can relate to the initial text exchanges amsterdam visitthe authors character all feels very realistic
there are so many lighter moments which makes the movie more enjoyable given the subject i havent read the book but i am sure i am going to
highly recommend this one
movie runs at variable pace
sometimes the story runs too fast so that you are not able to feel what characters are feeling
other times when director wants to throw some solid dialogues and wants the viewers to appreciate them he makes it go slow
he cuts way too many scenes but naah
not the dialogues
he adjusts the dialogues of those deleted scenes elsewhere
many a times he desperately put okayaokay thing to create the effect even when it is not fitting the situation
secondly the movie is too straight forward
everything is served on a plate for the viewers so much so that they are not required to think what is going to comeup next
in short this movie is made for dummies
when first viewing this movie it is as if your heart is a balloon
during the movie the balloon inflates to grow larger and larger and the entire time you know that this balloon is going to pop
when it finally does though you arent mad
the explosion is so beautiful that it doesnt matter
the movie is set up to lift you up and then drop you but it does so perfectly
the movie never seems to force the audience to feel a certain way it never pauses to say now you are supposed to cry
it balances the good and the bad so that no one leaves the theater feeling depressed
you may be sad but not hopelessly depressed
i have refused to watch this movie ever since it came out
i guess it was because i thought it was one of the cheesy romance dramas that have been flavored with classic cancer story
i could not be wronger
this movie not only exceeded my expectations but it made me regret every single second that i wasted with not watching this movie
it is not a classic cancer story
it has twists and turns
it has the element of the unexpected
it is one of the movies make you happy and sad at the same time
john green did an outstanding job with this story but i believe the movie also deserves credit
i think the is wellshot
the actors chosen for this movie could not be any better
also i believe the director did an amazing job
i give it 4
i never wrote a review before but seeing the average of 8
1 gave me the feeling i never will be able to trust imdb user raitings again
2 hours an 6 minutes of common places rigid dialogs bad acting predictability round of applause and trips to europe this are the ingredients of this film which abuses the resource of the drama around a serious illness and turns it in to a cheesy movie with no breakthroughmessage at all
i rescue willem dafoes character van houten
mr dafoe is an amazing actor and he plays a round solid and believable character with an interesting unexploited story
i havent read the book maybe it is bearable
the movie is just a low punch
the fault in our stars is a 2014 american romantic comedydrama film directed by josh boone
the film stars shailene woodley ansel elgort and nat wolff with laura dern sam trammell and willem dafoe playing supporting roles
woodley plays hazel grace lancaster a sixteenyear old cancer patient who is forced by her parents to attend a support group where she subsequently meets and falls in love with augustus waters played by ansel elgort
hazel and gus are two extraordinary teenagers who share an acerbic wit a disdain for the conventional and a love that sweeps them  and us  on an unforgettable journey
their relationship is all the more miraculous given that they met and fell in love at a cancer support group
the fault in our stars based upon the numberone bestselling novel by john green explores the funny thrilling and tragic business of being alive and in love
the fault in our star is based on the bestselling novel by john green
its the best book to movie adaptation ive seen in a long time
i was curious as to why this movie is so good and at the same time makes you cry
i dont regret watching it at all
it is very satisfying movie that will bring you to tears
every time i watch it it does really touch my heart
it shows you the meaning of life
the movie is hilarious beautiful and heartbreaking all at the same time
the casting is great the acting is great and it feels real
the acting was brilliant and made the whole film work
each character was likable and had arcs
the effects are great as well
it is one of my favorite movies of all time
ive read and watched the movie many times but i still wont get bored
i have to give most of the credit to john green for writing an amazing book
i highly recommend this movie to everyone especially teens
see it
dont miss it
or you will regret that you missed best movie of all time
ive watched many movies in my life
none of them were so close to my heart
i have not had movies with a not so happy ending in my best movie list
but man this ones different
to me the movie characters are all real
and i will continue to think so and feel so
although the journey was short the couple had sweet time unlike most of us ever have
trust joy love hope care beauty pain loneliness
is what this life is
thanks a lot to everyone who have been part of the movie
i wish them a happy life and am eternally grateful
i hope we learn to endure the relationships in the best possible way
let us not forget to remember that we need not necessarily be in pain to realise the value of life
this movie is a gods message to all of us to change for good
to live the only life we have in the best possible way we can
i had no expectations towards this film based on the reviews i thought its the kind of movie you have already seen without actually seeing it
however falling in love is so beautifully depicted in this movie that im not sure i have seen anything like this in recent films
the two main characters and the actors are absolutely lovable just for what they are for their silly jokes and meaningful thoughts
some scenes are so powerful that youd want to be in their place despite the cancerdying background
it certainly had an impact on me at least
and i was once again persuaded how great actor willam dafoe is and it was also nice to see lotte verbeek from nothing personal
a beautiful movie if ever ive seen one
honestly one of the best ive watched since watching perks of being a wallflower
the characters are convincing the chemistry between them is palpable and even though you only know the characters for 2 hours the ending is enough to make even the hardiest of men with a smidgen of a good heart cry
the story unfolds without flaw and takes you through a journey of love and loss making you understand the harsh realities of life while also showing to you the beauty that can be found in even the smallest of infinities
all in all an excellent movie and a worthwhile watch for anyone seeking to find a diamond among the movies of 2014
and to any person who has the gall to give this movie a 1 i say you must have absolutely no good taste and do not have mental capacity to grasp the deeper and more beautiful things in life
though i have not read the book i am definitely going to
i am certain that the director and the actors did a brilliant job at bringing the book to life for us
hats off to all of you
i didnt read the book
but i did watch the first movie trailer and knew i needed to see this movie
for me  it was excellent beyond belief
i have been graced by many loved ones and friends whom havehad cancer some of whom have passed
shailene woodleys performance in this movie was spectacular
akin to tom hanks performance in forrest gump
ansel elgorts performance is equally spectacular
nat wolffs performance was great too
shailenes performance was what draws people into the movie
she becomes and ultimately is hazel grace
with a few true stars you can see it in their expressions and mostly see it in their eyes
rowan blanchards performances as riley in girl meets world is similar
shailene is a star that has not reached her full potential
with her performance here i really would love to see another book andor film that continues this epic story
the movie was okay
no reality in emotions
the acting was below par as well and the main issue was that the storyline sucked big time
there was no real conviction that where this movie is going or what does the director aims to portray
a good romantic movie with love as center would be the eternal sunshine of spotless mind
there is marked difference between the two movies and the latter clearly outshines it big time
the actors did try to do justice to the scripts given to them but its way off from the actual story being told in the book
those who read the book dont watch the movie please as youll be really disappointed so save your time folks
few movies have had the ability to move me along the emotional line as flawlessly as this one has
the love story of gus amp hazel was young but wizened poignant and funny and classically modern
the director did an excellent job with each scene each contrast that made me want to watch it just a little more with each passing minute
as gus hoped i hoped as hazel hoped and dreamed and cried so did i
in many ways it was an exploration of all our selves insecurities and death literally and figuratively
what made it incredibly relatable was the age range of these actors through which the story was portrayed were it an older cast it would not have been as impactful
im not generous to give this movie 1010 cause its totally worth it
it has been a while since the notebook that i cried a lot watching a movie
beautiful quotes and scene adorable couple and their unfinished epic love story are the highlights of the movie
they also teach you how to appreciate life and people around
i love all the characters in this movie
hazel is sensitive and smart
gus is sweet and funny
others are all lovely
although i kind of hoped it would have a happy ending and was sad when gus died it did not ruin anything
in fact it actually made the movie become more real like it was supposed to be
incredible
being a massive fan of the book and an avid reader i was worried that the film wouldnt do the book justice
oh how wrong i was
the movie stuck to the book the way any adaption should and the actors were perfect for the parts they were chosen to play
one of the few movies adapted from a book that i have thoroughly enjoyed just as much as when i read the book itself as it wasnt butchered when made into a film as many book to film adaptions are
this is a story that shows the harsh realities of living with cancer and what life is like for those who have to live with it everyday
heartwarming and emotional i doubt there are many people who have watched this movie and left with a dry eye at the end
the film speaks about the unexpected love between two teenagers suffering from cancer
they met at a cancer support group
its a romantic drama from josh boone with shailene woodley and ansel elgort as main actors they did another film together  divergent
its probably one of my favourite films because the story looks so amazing he makes me dream even if the teenagers are sick
i enjoyed this film i found it hard to put down because the story is gripping
i found it so sad but also beautiful
the film is inspired from a book and even the book is gripping
ill read it as soon as possible
my only criticism is that i found it too short
you must see this movie if you like this kind of films youll not be disappointed
when i see a movie so grossly over rated it makes me remove some points from my actual score
this is to me a 6
but at 8
2 this movie is way over what it should be
but i understand perfectly why so many people were moved by it
and it what i want to discuss here
attention spoiler
when the protagonists go to amsterdam as if it was the place where they would find the answer to the ultimate question in their lives the character played by wilem dafoe tells them basically that they are not special because they have a terminal illness but that they are like all other human being faced with the hand they were dealt by life
i suspect the author of the best selling novel to have used this character to expose this truth which is hard to accept
but with appropriate music and endearing moments we forget that unpleasant encounter until this character comes back to tell us he lost a loved one to terminal disease
as for the actors only shailene woodley does her job
the sloppy acting that surrounds her is a little irritating
everything about this flick sounds phony from the dialogs to the reactions of all the people involved
for instance what kind of a love approach is this
dont underline all the time that they are talking about this particular book
what amazed me was the mother in front of her sick child saying i will never be a mother again
what mother would be so selfish in a situation like this
evry mother would first thing first think about her child
that quote ruined the moment and the mothers every appearances
te father is there but absent
both parents spent their time running in the stairs with a would be sad face
the worst part is that i never felt emotionally connected to the characters besides at the very end
the movie is supposed to be funny at times but with the kind of goody christian jokes
good story with a bad scenario
it could have been done with less pathos less clichas and
less music which is redundant with the emotions
i was quite disappointed in this movie
and surprised at all the 910 star reviews
i dont want to repeat everything people with 1 star reviews have said but totally agree with most of them
bad acting
i mean
where is the chemistry between these two people
where does this great love come from that they keep talking about but are not showing
love story
not on any level
and how many times can you say omg in a movie
was there some kind of guinness world record attempt here
it was very distracting and so shallow
i had watched the good lie just before this and was bawling my eyes out
this just felt like a cheat after that great movie great because it was so real
