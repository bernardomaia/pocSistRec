"\nchitchens fan  2 hours ago △ ▽ <br><br>− <br><br>Well, to begin, I cannot remember the last time I could not get up at\nthe end of a movie. I literally could not rise up from my seat. My body\nfelt as though it were being weighed down by something considerably\nlarger and heavier than myself... History had it's way with me( I am an\nAfrican American woman). Thank you Mr. McQueen, Mr. Ejiofor, Ms.\nNyong'o, Ms. Paulson and others, and yes, even Mr. Fassbender. I am not\na film critic nor a movie hobbyist, although I try to stay current, but\nwhat I am is a human being trying to understand the various problems\nand issues within our country. This movie is a potent reminder of why\nwe are where we are as a society today. How man can be so unflinchingly\ncruel to his fellow man, especially if he looks, speaks or behaves\ndifferently, I will never understand.\n"
"\nI just saw this at LFF. It is a brilliant piece of cinema. Clearly it's\ncentral theme is slavery, and the depravity human nature can so easily\nreach; but it has many other small moments that trigger thoughts about\nwider issues - the role of religion being one for example. It is\nviolent, and in some respects awful to watch, but this is the story of\nSolomon Northup told truthfully. There is nothing saccharine about the\nway Steve McQueen presents this and that is what makes it so\nastonishing. You cry because what you witness is truly terrible, not\nbecause the violins are out and the director's tugging on your heart\nstrings. All the acting is first rate, as is the score by Hans Zimmer.\nThis really should be essential viewing for everyone old enough to\nunderstand it.\n"
"\nWhere to begin? OK, by stating the simple facts. <br><br>The history here is distorted beyond all measure. 21st century\nsensibilities, seen through the lens of sterilized political\ncorrectness, make this film practically unwatchable from beginning to\nthe (oh will it ever come?) end. Every white character is a one\ndimensional pastiche of evil while, conversely, it's only black people\nwho possess anything approaching morality and basic human decency. It\nwears out and wears thin very rapidly indeed.<br><br>Steve McQueen - a director whose previous work I admired - got this\nfilm all wrong. He needed to do many things to put this film on the\nright track from the get go. But, most of all, he needed to work with a\nscript which had its roots in reality, not in this distorted, oddly\nperverse and, frankly, unworthy representation of antebellum America.\nIt's a shame and a sham yet it could have been a great story. Truly\nawful, but I gave it 2 stars - the extra one because, thank heavens,\nOprah is not in it.\n"
"\nBefore I started reading reviews on IMDb I actually thought the cinema\nwas a form of entertainment. Now I realise I was totally wrong. A silly\ncomedy like \"Meet the Fockers\" or\" Legally Blonde\" is condemned as a\ncomplete waste of time.\"I want my life back\" But a film lasting two and\na half hours which shows a man kidnapped into slavery,beaten half to\ndeath and then rescued is considered worthy of 5 stars. If I had gone\nto the cinema alone I would have left after 15 minutes.What sort of\npeople can enjoy watching other people being beaten senseless for two\nand a half hours.The only thing that kept me awake was the hope that\nthe slaves would rise up and cut those nasty white throats.No such\nluck.The slave was rescued.A weak ending to to a weak pointless film.\n"
"\nI feel that a Best Picture Oscar winner should 1) be a film that you\nwould recommend, and 2) be a film that you would watch again. \"12 Years\na Slave\" is neither.<br><br>\"12 Years a Slave\" falls squarely in the torture-porn film genre like\n\"Hostel\" or \"Passion of the Christ.\" So if you are into that kind of\ncinema, this may be a good film for you. If you like well-directed and\nwell-written films with a strong narrative, plot, character\ndevelopment, sense of place, and historical context and meaning, then\nthis film will disappoint you.<br><br>The last scene of the film when Solomon is reunited with his family is\nunbelievably bad but sums up the whole film: bad direction, bad\nwriting, a big mistake and waste of acting talent.<br><br>For heavens sake, read the book and learn Solomon's story but avoid\nthis disaster.\n"
"\nThe movie was a dreadful, racist piece of propaganda from Victim\nNation. The whipping scenes from \"Billy Budd\" or \"Master and Commander\"\nwere more to the narrative point than any of the gratuitous beating\nmeted out in \"12 Years..\". The premise that white people are inherently\nignorant and evil, and black people are mistreated saints is a blatant\nattack on the 100 years of civil rights progress in this nation. How\ncould the average rating for this \"film\" be an 8.5, which is higher\nthan \"Citizen Kane\", \"Paths of Glory\", \"M\", \"Lawrence of Arabia\",\n\"Amadeus\", \"2001-A Space Odyssey\", or \"The Bridge on the River Kwai\"?\nWe walked out after 15 minutes. I recall doing the same after watching\nKevin Spacey jerking off at the onset of another Academy Award darling,\n\"American Beauty\".\n"
"\nIn today's world, we are told to be politically correct. but this movie\nis a waste of time, nothing special to me .I consider myself on the\nleft side of the political arena.but I do wonder if we are being\nbombarded with this type of stories, consider the butler .12 years a\nslave , etc. I was expecting a great movie , but what I watched 2 hours\nof boring and I mean boring story.he the lead character is kidnapped\nand put into 12 years of being a slave , he was swapped between\nowners,sounds like a great movie basis , well it was not .instead it\nbecame a boring tale of this mans journey,roots is a much more moving\nstory that covered slavery , also brad pitt as a amish ,I was waiting\nfor vanilla ice to show up and them build a barn.<br><br>I hate to ask this question but I will ask, does this movie appeal more\nto a black audience that a mixed audience, as I stated before roots,\nboyz in nthe hood,and on it goes are all worth watching, but this is\nnot what I expected, I was very disappointed .\n"
"\nNO! This is NOT Oscar caliber material, sorry. So we have this virtuoso\nviolinist that is kidnapped, enslaved and tortured. Good story. But\nwhat the heck is McQueen doing? Minutes pass with images of trees and\nlandscapes. (remember \"Tree of Life\"--probably not). Not to mention the\nlifeless performance by our protagonist. I do like him as an actor but\nhe pales in comparison to the supporting cast. Yes, Fassbender is good,\nbut darn, that Paul Dano is something else. Watch out for him in the\nfuture. (see There will be Blood). The topic of slavery is of course a\nterrible chapter in our history, but the movie is simply not up to the\ntask of relaying this emotion.\n"
"\nIt's rare that a movie lives up to its hype, even rarer that the hype\nis transcended by the actual achievement. 12 YEARS A SLAVE does both.\nAided by powerful performances and cinematography, director McQueen\nexposes the barbarity of dehumanisation, of treating people as\nproperty. Reviews focus on the brutality on display, and it's true that\nthe film is not easy to watch, with its powerful juxtaposition of\nsublime scenery and human degradation. But to me the final scene is the\nmost powerful of all: we are party to the kind of raw emotion that in\nthe hands of lesser artists could easily descend into tawdriness or\nsentimentality. Here, as in the rest of the film, it is raised up high,\nas high as cinematic art can go.\n"
"\nStory of violence and sadism, which does not reflect historical\nreality. No one except a few sadists could live like this. In a\nclaustrophobic environment flooded with blood and death. All day and\nevery hour masters at home and their slaves crying and screaming in\npain. Every scene the same is weary (heavy). <br><br>That was not normal, despite the existence of slavery. The first time I\nsaw it, I qualified with a 7 but it was not one to save in the library.\nThe second time I found it worse. Now is a 4.<br><br>I'm tired of gratuitous violence in movies. Violence in TV or cinema\nbegets violence in real people. So I don't like this movie.<br><br>Good acting, good sticks. Good movie as propaganda against slavery but\nNot a movie to watch more than once.\n"
"\nI thought this story was reminiscent of Dumas's 'The Count of Monte\nCristo', so much so that I knew what would happen at the end and that\nhe would attain his freedom.<br><br>Its a depressing and brutal film, which of course depicts how it must\nhave been for the slaves. I applaud the acting from most of the cast\nand appreciate that Pitt and McQueen would have had a hard job\nconvincing actors to participate in this film. The whole shameful\nepisode of slavery is an emotive subject and must be difficult to\nportray in a way that neither attracts subscription to far right\nideology, nor receives condemnation of its portrayal.<br><br>I think the film is OK as films go, but the subject matter and the\ndepressing script, may leave people wishing that it wasn't such\nshocking viewing.<br><br>5 out of 10\n"
"\nI put off watching this movie when it came out because of the hype. Now\nit's calmed down a bit I wanted to see what all the fuss was about. I\nwasn't expecting the film to be incredibly boring. I struggled to keep\nany interest whatsoever in any of the very turgid story telling. I\nremember watching Roots many years ago and being captivated by the\nemotional drama. This film was so childishly written and presented that\nany emotional impact was entirely lost. It had a\nLittle-House-On-The-Prairie simplicity that grated in every scene. I\nhalf expected Pa to appear, playing his fiddle along with the main\ncharacter. Pa's emotional depth would have fitted right in with this\ndreadful movie. Chiwetelu Ejiofor seemed as bemused by this film as I\nwas. He was wooden, but then he had very little to get stuck into with\nNorthup. He had no emotional connection with any other character in the\nfilm and I really couldn't care less whether he lived or died. I wasted\nhours watching this that I can't get back. I'm only glad I didn't pay\nfor it.\n"
"\nThiis film won Oscars,rated 8.3 and listed in IMDb top 250.so i have\nsome expectations in this film and guest appearances by Bradd Pitt and\ncumberbatch increased them.But finally i felt cheated.no doubt acting\nis amazing.each actor gave their best performances.Especially Hero-\nEjiofor.He is amazing.and Oscar winner nupita too gave her best.none of\nthe actors will disappoint you.But what I felt is there is a lot of\nunnecessary violence,blacks may be threat ed in such a ways those days\nbut is it necessary to show whites sadism against blacks in that way?OK\ncoming to taking,i felt like this story took place just10 years\nback.not a great art used.and camera most of the times stared at hero\nfor long times which made this film unbearably bore.runtime is 2 plus\nhours and climax made this film totally worst.I am highly disappointed\nwith film.\n"
"\nWe decided to see \"12 Years a Slave\" after it won the Academy's Best\nPicture award. I cannot express how disappointed we were. Neither the\ndirecting, the acting, nor the story itself were even close to Best\nPicture quality. It was slow, wooden and full of clichés. Chiwetel\nEjiofor's acting was nothing special; I got tired of his perpetually\npained expression filling the screen. Why didn't he age or grow\nthinner? Did they have to portray all slave owners as sadistic? And\nthat final scene was so painfully stiff and staged it seemed as though\nthe director and screen writer just ran out of energy. We were just\nglad to see it end! Clearly this weak film was honored for political\nreasons, not artistic. Shame on the Academy.\n"
"\nOn the movie: Tedious monotonous slow boring gore fest that could have\nbeen easily made into a great epic movie. All Solomon did after his\nrelease would be a much more fruitful script than the ridiculous non-\nsubstance matter discarded for hours... and I mean tedious heavy hours.<br><br>On Brad Pitt: Where did he come from? What was he doing there? It could\nbe anybody else playing such role, even an empty bottle of water, but\nit was in fact more of a ridiculous fallacious cameo than a proper star\nacting quality.<br><br>On people who rated it over 4: It had loads of nothingness... I give\nyou that, and nothingness is Hollywood's recent attitude towards\nsuccess. I believe that when you walk the red carpet towards the\nOscars, this movie will face a bipolar crowd as its best crowd\npossible.\n"
"\nThe most overrated movie of 2013. The movie shows you the psychological\nhorror of slavery with the protagonist not really taking a part in\nanything. There is no lesson to be learned here, just showing how\nhorrible things were for African Americans at the time. Feels very\nforced and tedious, and five minutes in it you will know exactly what's\ngonna happen. Unimaginative or creative at all. I think the director\nwanted to say: \"Feel pain, cause I said so. I won't take the time to\nbuild characters or weave an interesting narrative\". The movie says\nlet's paint everything with a big general brush-which is OK for action\nmovies- but not for a historical drama.\n"
"\nJust watched this true story of slavery with my movie theatre-working\nfriend. It depicts the abduction of Soloman Northup (Chiwetel Ejiofor)\nfrom his family in New York State to the bayous of Louisiana (my home\nstate) where he is made a slave. Director Steve McQueen does a fine job\ndepicting how harrowing the experience is and provides catharsis when\nthe ending comes. He also does a nice job of providing some background\nof other fellow slaves like that of the doomed Patsy. If anyone who\npaid to see this expected to watch Brad Pitt in a big role, they must\nhave been disappointed to see him in only a couple of scenes but he\ndoes well in those and I have to assume most of the public was\nenthralled by the story to not even care by that point. Anyway, I\nhighly recommend 12 Years a Slave if you want to be challenged as a\nviewer by the way someone is depicted as the main character is here.\nOh, and nice shots of the Louisiana locations.\n"
"\nThis is another version of the movie Pianist. Black man instead of\nJewish man, and violin instead of piano. In Pianist, the guy was just\nhiding through out the movie; in 12 Years Slave, the guy is just\nwaiting for help instead. He waits and does whatever he is told to. He\nis taking no action, no fight for freedom and more than anything..no\nhelping anyone.<br><br>I really forced myself to watch the rest of the movie after the first\n20-25 minutes. All of the scenes were unsurprising. Giving the Best\nPicture Oscar to this movie is like giving Peace Nobel to Bush. I think\nHollywood will never give up awarding white-slave and Nazi-Jew movies.\nI wander if they will ever make Jew-Palestinian movie and award it! <br><br>I have to admit one thing though: The end was very touching. I couldn't\nhold my tears. But it had to belong to another movie.\n"
"\nThe film was powerful and a Goog Cast but I give it only a 4 there were\nthings that bothered me. There were too many times the camera left a\nscene to another while audio from the previous scene were still\nplaying. Although being taken and in slavery for 12 years we never got\na sense of time passing. He never mentioned today is my birthday or it\nwas X years I was taken and sold into slavery at 90 minutes I think it\nwould have been a good film at 134 Minutes it was torture to watch. It\nwas a good cast and super acting I thought the scenes of whipping and\nbeatings were going to be difficult to watch I did not find them\ndisturbing.\n"
"\nThis is a terrible film for many reasons and I could go on at length\nabout the over-simplified characterisation, the\n\"tell-us-something-we-don't-know\" of the story, and the dismal Terance\nMallick-style \"extremely lengthy lingering shots must equal something\nprofound\" but none of those things would really matter (it's only a\nfilm, right?) except that this nonsense will be viewed by some people\nas a true reflection of US society. For god'sake, this ridiculous\ndepiction of how the northern states of the US was an idyllic utopia\nfor black people (and only the nasty evil south was racist) is not even\ntrue NOW in 2014! Never mind how much this distorts the reality of the\nearly 19th century. You can go to Phildelphia, get on a bus, see the\nblack homeless lying in the street, see how STILL America has not made\namends for the abomination that was slavery. Race riots and the fight\nfor equality and end to racism were late 20th century events - and yet\nthis disgraceful garbage sets out to rewrite history and paint the\nnorthen states of the USA in an absurdly egalitarian light.\n"
"\nThis film made my eyes bleed it was that bad. If you have been alive\nfor more than 10 minutes you will know how bad slavery was and all this\nfilm does is re- iterates what everyone already knows. There's no plot,\nstoryline, character development, nothing. I am baffled how anybody can\nlike seeing a black man get beaten for 2 hours and say that it's a good\nviewing, disgusting. I had hugely high expectations of this film due to\nthe media hyping it up to being the 'best movie ever made'' but quite\nfrankly it was one of the worst films I have ever seen. No surprise\neither that brad Pitt helped direct it and he turned up an hour before\nthe end to become the hero. Overall a hugely disappointing movie and I\nwould not this to my worst enemy\n"
"\nsame old story. poor black people exploited by white man. how many\nhundreds of thousands times or million times we need to repeat? nothing\nnew. painfully slow. I hate when Oscar is given because of politics.\ndefinitely don't deserve Oscars, not to mention IMDb score.Reflecting\non the Obama era in a symposium on 12 Years a Slave McQueen said, \"The\nproblem is: When he's not the president anymore, will these films still\nexist?\" That's hardly the problem. The problem comes when we go to\nthese movies, have a good cry, and imagine that, through some kind of\nHollywood magic, they will bring about change. Look at the rubber-band\neffect from the night of the inauguration of Barack Obama to today.\nThere was this enormous sense of finally. Well, finally what? Finally,\nwe have a black man in the White House who at least on some level has\nan understanding of the black experience in America. But that in no way\nmakes this a post-racial society.\n"
"\nIts amazing how a movie like this could win so much Oscars,i don't,i\ncant even guess why,the movie is the worst ever to me,am thinking maybe\nit might be because of of that actor but i don't just get it,as for me\nits a movie,movies like this e.g American hustle &amp; all lord of the\nrings don't deserve a spot here on IMDb,but there's a saying that a\nmans food is another mans poison.but why would a movie like this get\ntop ratings it amaze me a lot,too much but if anybody could explain am\ngood with that,its really a tiring movie its a very tiring movie and i\nreally wanna know whats great about it. Got a problem with that contact\nme via twitter @iamowomizz..\n"
"\nSuggestion can be taken or not but it is my responsibility to warn you\nthat this movie is utter bullshit. 20 million dollars have been wasted\nfor producing this film and 140 million dollars is wasted to see the\nfilm. The choice of yours. Awful and continuous sounds of cry and\ntears. Even a normal person will suffer from depression after seeing\nthis film. Too much sadistic in nature. Hans Zimmer should not have\naccepted to compose music for this disaster movie.<br><br>After all these free advices given, if you want to want this movie,\nturn your video player and put it 16X speed so that you don't get\naffected as much as it was intended you to. Instead of watching this\nfilm, you could have a quality time talking to your family members\nabout nothing and everything.\n"
"\nWas really looking forward to this having read critics reviews. However\nwhile there is no doubt this depicts the terrible practices of slavery\nit is a horrid way to spend a Saturday night - and to what effect.\nSteve McQueen (the director not the great actor whose fame he is\npossibly benefiting from)undoubtedly knows how to create emotion in the\ncrudest of ways using scenes which would abhor any fair person. However\nthere is very little signs of skillful film making just a formulaic\nhitting of peoples emotional and moral buttons. We came out feeling\ndrained, like after the worst day in 10 years at work or worse. Would\nnot recommend friends pay to feel the same. Can not imagine a mental\nstate where someone would see this and feel better. Advice; avoid -\nplease let me know if anyone felt different after seeing.\n"
"\nThe story is of course painful so it's loaded with emotion. Human\nbeings suck. We get it. But there is no character development and no\nplot. All we know is Plat's physical pain and his apparent strength to\nendure it. We feel pity for him. We can sympathize, but we are given\nvery little opportunity to empathize. <br><br>The actors pain doesn't match the beatings. When the carpenters build,\nthey're not really building. When the field workers are working they're\nnot really working. Brad Pitt's monologue was embarrassing and amateur.<br><br>Sorry for the analogy, but it's like a porn movie where we are here for\nthe immediate gratification, not the substance.<br><br>Sorry...I just don't understand they hype.\n"
"\nI found this movie about as realistic as a Muffets movie. Every slave\nseemed to have an Oxford education which made it hard to believe. Don't\nwaste your money or time. I can not believe it is up for an Oscar when\nthere were so many better movies out there. I still can not get over\nall of the great reviews I have read concerning this movie, am I the\nonly person that got this. I saw this with two friends that had the\nsame feelings as myself and if you look at the top movies at the\ntheater right now you will see it is not even in the top five. This\nshould tell you what the people really think of it. So if you must, go\nsee it but keep an open mind and think for yourselves. It doesn't seem\nvery real.\n"
"\nI was hoping for much more - sadly,we've seen It all before. Since the\nbrilliant and awe-Inspiring 'Roots',nothing In this genre has been at\nall special and '12 years a slave' Is no exception. As unexciting as It\nIs predictable,this Movie gives us nothing new and Just re-treads old\nground. We've seen enough of pre-emancipation stories. We KNOW what a\nterrible time slaves In America had without constant reminders like\nthis. Black folk have enough reason to hate White folk without stirring\nup hackneyed old stories. If you can watch this the whole way through\nwithout falling asleep waiting for something exciting to happen then\ngood for you. Giving this Movie 'top marks' just because of feelings of\nguilt(If you are white) or because of solidarity and mutual hatred of\nthe Slavers (If you are black) Is a naive decision. This boring piece\nof Americana will soon be forgotten. As the song goes...\"Tell me the\nsame old story....\".\n"
"\nThe amazing true story of a man being abused because he is black. Look\nif you do not like violence in movie then I do not see why you would\nlike this one just because it really happened. This make The Texas\nchainsaw massacre. If you don't like looking at blood and gore. Then\nyou don't like looking and blood a gore period. Why should it matter if\nit happened. This movie does not deserve 8.1 it is awful. It is boring.\nAnd it is hard to watch. It has no entertainment value. It is junk. It\nis very badly written. The actor wasted there talent being in this\nmovie. Just because it is based on true story does not make it good.\nThis is one of the worst movies ever. Do not see it. Don't get me wrong\nI feel very sorry for the man who wrote the book.\n"
"\nFor me ,being only 15 years old, I thought this film would be boring,\nlike any other \"documentary\". However this movie was extremely well put\ntogether and it kept me engaged throughout the entire two hours. I\nespecially like how Michael Fassbender played his role in this movie.\nHe showed so much emotion and it was believable. Also I like how Brad\nPitt was portrayed as some sort of charming hero. Benedict Cumberbatch\nwas a very favorable character, as always. Chiwetel was very\nexceptional at playing his role. He also showed a mass amount of\nemotion which made the film, once again, believable. However, the\nending was sort of cheesy, and I didn't know who was who. Anyways, I'm\ndefinitely watching this and buying it when it comes out on DVD.\n"
"\nI should start by saying I enjoy slow-paced dramas. But I don't\nremember myself being bored in a movie that much before, everything 12\nYears a Slave tries to do is to disgust you from slavery, it's more of\nan educational movie.<br><br>The thing that really disturbed me was they were really forcing you to\nfeel bad; which caused the movie having almost no script at all. You\njust sit and watch the torment to slaves. <br><br>I believe the only reason why this movie won the Best Picture award is\nbecause it is bashing racism with it's all strength. It's a good\neducational production but as a movie, it's quite weak. It's nowhere\nnear movies like The Wolf of Wall Street, Dallas Buyers Club and Her.\n"
"\nThis \"black exploitation film\" lacks any real sense of narrative,\ninstead it showcases a near-sardonic attempt at complete savagery. The\nfilm is highly racist against white people, as it attempts to\ncapitalize on the \"brutal\" scenes and endear the white audience as\nsomehow responsible for slavery, which we of the present, are in no way\nculpable.<br><br>It is ineffective as both a polemic and drama. Brad Pitt (one of the\nfilm's producers) appearing as a ridiculous, self righteous cartoon,\nlowers it even more into the territory of baseless sentimentalism.<br><br>The director is working simply on hyperbolic elements, which make this\nfilm highly \"unreal\". No doubt he is merely using it as visual\npropaganda, for what cause, remains to be seen.<br><br>I would not take such a film to be serious at all.\n"
"\nOVERRATED<br><br>Acting was really well done in this movie for the most part. producing\nreally well done. i just simply found it a bad movie. <br><br>The script, which was mediocre at best, didn't necessary add up or make\nmuch sense at all. how did the rest of the family end up with Solomon?\nam i just blind and didn't focus enough? after about 15 minutes into\nthe movie, i just felt disappointed. The white person seems to be\npractically a Nazi. it doesn't add up to reality of the 19th century.\nthe protagonist's story really isn't that interesting either. they\nshouldve either made Solomon's story more interesting, or followed the\nwife's story primarily. her story was much more meaningful and sad.\nKids playing around when Solomon is almost being hung? kids. slaves.\nplaying. where does the logistics add up there? those kids have been\nbought as slaves. why are they playing around? i don't get it. i just\nthink this story has been murdered by Hollywood. simple as that.\n"
"\nThis movie was a big disappointment and after seeing it, we didn't\nthink it deserved the Oscar for Best Picture. Too many pointless\nsilences when they could have spent the time developing the characters\nand their relationships with each other. What about Solomon's family?\nThe \"whites\" in the movie over acted and it was like watching a high\nschool play. The accents were ridiculous, especially Brad Pitt's one\nnote, overdone \"Southern accent\" when he supposed to be Canadian. His\ndialog with Michael Fassbender's slave owner character was absurd and\nunrealistic. His hero stand would not have been tolerated. Frankly, I\ncame away from this finding it hard to believe this was actually\nwritten by a slave. Too many pieces don't fit together of a survivor's\naccount.\n"
"\nThis is the first review I've ever posted, but I saw this last night\nwith a friend and we were both pretty disappointed. This is nowhere\nnear the caliber of \"A Color Purple\". The story felt somewhat\ndisjointed and I just didn't \"feel\" most of the characters. Michael\nFassbender was excellent. The girl who played Patsy was quite good, but\nher part was really not big enough to warrant an Oscar. Chiwetel, who I\nlike a lot, just didn't quite get the ball past the goal line. The\ncomplexity of emotion that one would expect from his character wasn't\nquite flushed out. The final scene felt restrained and unrealistic to\nme. I cannot believe that this won Best Picture. My advice - save your\nmoney and wait until it comes out on cable.\n"
"\nI hate to disagree with most of humankind, but I did not like this\nfilm. I understand that it was based on a true story, but dud the\ncharacters have to be so one-dimensional? The plot line is predictable,\nand I could recite most of the dialog before it was spoken. I think the\nworst aspect of this film was the direction. If he were still alive,\nRobert Altman could have given some sage advice to the director. His\nscenes went on forever, and he seemed not to know when enough was\nenough. Short cuts would have been wise. I did make it to the end of\nthe movie, but I don't really know how. Good thing I rented it from\nNetflix and saved myself several dollars and some time. Too bad;\nhopefully this year's crop of Oscars contenders will be an improvement.\n"
"\n12 YEARS A SLAVE is one of those movies on the borderline between Big\nBudget and Just Plain Boring. While the intentions may have been good\n(the only thing I came away with was the idea that even slavery was\nsomething that could be overcome with a lot of hard work and some\nunbelievable LUCK), it's Ejiofor's lackluster performance- and the\nridiculously LAVISH look and feel of the movie- that undermines\nwhatever serious message or insight(s) the filmmakers may have had in\nmind. Not ONCE during the course of the movie did I BELIEVE what I was\nseeing: it has an almost over-fed Television quality to it (not unlike\nDJANGO UNCHAINED, for instance). The Hype turns out to have been just\nthat.\n"
"\n\"12 Years a Slave\" is an extremely touching and strong film in most\naspects. <br><br>Quality is there in every scene and the feeling that you are actually\nin the times of slavery never leaves you during the whole story. Those,\nwho think that Django Unchained had it all, prepare for a drama and\nmuch more brutal reality of those times. Colourful with violence and\nabuse, it is one of those movies when antagonists do not get any\nphysical or emotional punishment for their sins, nor the enslaved ones\nget to the point of so desired by the viewer nemesis, just like it was\nhistorically.<br><br>There is no happy ending. Bitter of injustice does not abandon you with\nthe redemption of the hero. Meant to be the most beautiful time of his\nlife seeing kids grow, he spent being abused, beaten to his knees. The\nunique mix of class acting, intriguing plot and right focus on the\nreality of those times make the picture my personal top pick in 2013.\nContribution of Michael Fassbender as the main villain deserves\nparticular compliment.\n"
"\nThere is no doubt that the makers of this film wanted it to be as true\nto life as possible. There is also probably no doubt that what was\nshown on screen was toned down from what probably happened in real\nlife.<br><br>Well I have say it I found it to be more than uncomfortable viewing, it\nwas horrific to see the portrayal of man's inhumanity to man. If you\ncan't stomach such portrayals don't go. I walked out after half an hour\nas I couldn't bear to see any more of it. <br><br>On that basis, I'm not sure how successful this film will be. I\nwouldn't recommend anyone to see it. Read the book instead if you want\nto know what happened.\n"
"\nOK, I accepted Pulp Fiction losing and Brokeback Mountain losing! But\nfor 12 years a slave to win! I ask that the Academy to start letting\nthe general public, to start voting! What a travesty, the Academy has\nalways, while out of touch! Got caught up in period pieces! The Wolf of\nWall Street, easy clean winner, American Hustle, runner up, Dallas\nBuyers Club even better than this ! First and foremost for those,\nincluding the Academy, that don't know, 20 bull whip strikes will not\nleave that on your back as a mark, try at least 200, which never\nhappened! The movie preys on our conscience, but it does a poor\nstorytelling! It was a horrible thing that happened, but we know this,\nits boring in general, the story has been told before, ever heard of\n\"Roots\"? My former favorite actor, Brad Pitt, who produced and so\ncleverly inserted himself into hero in this film, has been dismissed\nfor using a period piece, to win best picture! The film is a joke it\nwas purposely only made to win best picture, and you, academy fell for\nit again!\n"
"\nI could not believe the extent to which this film was \"honoured\" at the\n2014 Oscars. I found its directorial handling to be flat and\npedestrian, and even boring in parts. The film consisted of \"scene\"\nafter \"scene\", without conveying any real sense of movement, tension,\nand development in the story as a key illumination to the American\nhistory of slavery in the years leading to the American Civil War and\nthe eventual emancipation of slaves in the United States of America.\nContrary to received \"wisdom\", I found Chiwetel Ejiofor's performance\nas Solomon wooden in the extreme - as though he was sleep-walking\nthroughout (unlike his brilliant performance in \"Kinky Boots\"). Ms\nLupita Nyong'o ran away with the film with her heart-rending\nperformance as Patsey.\n"
"\nI thought this movie had some good qualities but it was just missing\nsomething. Sure the aggression and oppression was there but I didn't\nbelieve the emotion. The characters all looked too clean and too well\ncared for. Nothing seemed to be authentic. Unfortunately the cast is\nspeckled with talent but drowning in mediocrity and incorrect casting.<br><br>Probably the best bit in the whole movie was when the little white punk\ngot his ass whooped. Everything else just seemed to tick by slowly with\nno real climax.<br><br>I really wanted to love this movie but am I missing something...? It\nwas okay but it certainly wasn't good enough to be nominated for any\nawards let alone win. I've seen way better slave movies in the past\nthat got less credit. I feel like this movie gave nothing new and was\ncreated to extend the feelings of \"white guilt\". It was a disgusting\ntime and the movie reflects that but it doesn't change the fact that it\nwas a weak movie. Every slave story is despicable but they don't all\nrequire a movie.\n"
"\nThe movie was directed in a boring way. Nothing unexpected, we have\nseen movies like this a lot of times. It was not that special. The\nacting was great, the pictures were disturbing, but I have seen better\nmovies. <br><br>But the movie is still very important, because we have learned nothing\nfrom these dark ages. Back in these days, white men thought that black\nmen are animals, not the same, that they can be treated in a very bad\nway. <br><br>How did we learn nothing from it, you ask? We try to spread our human\nrights to everyone in the world? Well, we do the very same to many\nanimals in the world. We torture them, put them in cages, kill them in\nthe millions. And we only do this because we think, we are superior, we\nthink, animals are not like us. <br><br>So it is important to remind us again and again that our humanity and\ndecency is not only for those we think comparable to us, but for\neverything on our world that lives and breathes. <br><br>Sorry for this derail... movie was mediocre, move on ;)\n"
"\nAfter watching 12 Years a Slave with my family, we all agreed that this\nfilm is a must see for any American. While it is awfully sad and hard\nto watch at times, it is rightfully so. As George Santayana once\nsaid,\"Those who cannot learn from history are doomed to repeat it.\"\nIt's important for people to understand that slavery is part of our\nAmerican history or else we may be doomed to repeat such atrocities.\nThis movie transcends time and is able to bring the viewer back to a\ntime and place that most history text books would like to skip over.\nPart way through the movie I even realized that I was instinctively\nscared when a white person showed up on screen. This is the kind of\nexperience everyone needs to even begin to understand what antebellum\nAmerica may have been like for a slave.\n"
"\nWhile I'm not familiar with Chiwetel Ejiofor and his past projects, he\nknocked his role of kidnapped freeman turned slave Solomon Northup\nstraight outta the park. Benedict Cumberbatch and Michael Fassbender\nplay their roles as Solomon's masters incredibly as well.<br><br>As for the title above, McQueen directs the film in a way that forces\nyou to comprehend the brutality and pain that plantation slaves felt\nback then, even if there where times where it was hard not to look away\nthe violence that was on-screen. <br><br>However it wasn't directed in the way to show the blood and gore just\nfor the sake of there being blood and gore. It had purpose to all of it\nand it never felt like the director was ever just \"throwing stuff in.\"<br><br>In short, the movie was great and it definitely sheds light on some of\nthe horrible, ugly, nasty things that went on back then. 9/10\n"
"\nIm gonna give this movie a 5 because i am really on the fence about the\nwhole movie and how i should rate it and now i will explain why. this\nmovie in an artistic format was a goddamn masterpiece and deserves a 10\nfor the realism and emotional power and art but when it comes to being\nan actual movie, this sucked. now i'm not trying to say that because i\nencourage slavery, i am saying this because at the end this movie was\nall based off of a stupid book and there was no point to the whole\nstory considering the people who put the man in slavery never got\ncharged or caught or anything. so basically my question is, WHAT WAS\nTHE POINT ? this was the worst thing i have ever seen in my life (well\nmaybe not as bad as \"Worlds Greatest Dad\" with Robin Williams) but\nstill. how can Hollywood even let this through? they completely wasted\namazing actors and ruined a good book, this should have stayed in the\npages instead of staying on the screen for a damn good reason.\n"
"\n12 years a slave makes the spectator feel it in their own skin. Steve\nMcQueen brings us a bunch of well-known stars and makes a brilliant\nmovie where Mr. Ejiofor shows an impressive skill as an actor.<br><br>The share-out also shows Michael Fassbender doing another amazing\nperformance as the lord of the cotton fields, showing the cruelty and\nmadness the lords of those years could show to their slaves. Also\nhaving great appearances like Benedict Cumberbatch, Paul Giamatti, Brad\nPitt, the movie reflects the hard living (if we can name it like that)\nof the African American people those days.<br><br>The movie, like The Butler did, shows how the USA has changed in the\nlast centuries, not even the bad things but also the good ones like the\nlove and the ensemble of the people in such a difficult situations.<br><br>The only reason i did not give a 10 star rating is just because i think\nfew sequences could be cut, it larges the movie just looking at the\nlandscape, what i think, in my opinion, could be expendable.\n"
"\nAlright, by saying this movie has no action, of course, this kinda\nmovie won't really have the same action as a movie about super heroes.\nBut there was literally nothing interesting about this movie, it was\nvery slow paced, with only a couple of good scenes. Although the movie\nwas incredibly well filmed and had great scenery, landscapes and\neverything from that aspect was very well taken care of. But the story\nas a whole didn't really seem appealing. The ending was kinda random as\nwell, wanted to see more in-depth background of the slave owners, maybe\nother slaves, but it was only centered around Solomon, which is fine,\nbut for a movie that long, it gets a little bit too boring and hard to\nsit-through. The story could have been way more diverse, hence making\nthe movie more complex and so straight forward, after watching it you\nliterally have nothing to think about, just like .. meh, a cool movie.\n"
"\nThe cinematography is great  pretty, \"meaningful\" artsy long shots \nbut this film could have been so much more. I live in Bristol, a town\nbuilt on slavery (both black and before that white) which struggles to\ncome to understand its past and the way people behaved  this film\nsimply didn't engage on that level. I didn't feel any great empathy for\nany of the characters, their motivations weren't explored at any depth,\nit didn't really raise even the most obvious questions of the way\npeople behaved beyond the most superficial level. And yet it has been\nreally warmly received  maybe it's the power of political correctness,\nor could it be a commentary on a nation that still hasn't yet the\nmaturity to come to terms with its roots. I'd give it a miss.\n"
"\nI am going to be short and sweet with this review and say that this\nmovie is absolutely awful. I decided to watch this movie because of all\nthe hype and attention that was brought upon this movie. Unfortunately,\nwhat I got was poor plot, little character development, and scenes that\nmade you want to leave the room. Let's be honest; it is not necessary\nto incorporate a 5 minute scene of Ejiofor staring into the distance.\nIt is absolutely 100% boring and left me appalled on how this won best\npicture. The only reason why I gave this film a 3 was because of the\nsuperb acting by Lupita Nyong'o who gave the movie a small dose of\nhope, but it didn't last very long. Ultimately, I will never watch this\nmovie ever again and I am utterly shocked that this won best picture.\nMovies like Captain Phillips and Dallas Buyers Club should have earned\nmore recognition for their accomplishments, not this.\n"
"\nIf you haven't seen The Soloist and Django Unchained then you might\nenjoy this film. The title could be as easy as ''1 year a slave'' .\nWhen I was watching the film , the 12 years were not there no matter\nhow boring were the repetitive scenes. The Plot is weak. Performance of\nthe main character lacks in character development, equal from start\ntill end. Instead of picking a violin not so far from a cello like in\nThe Soloist, the character could have any other instrument, maybe jazz\ninstruments to be more plausible and really show the afro-American\nimportant contribution to music and culture. That would add more life\nto the character and film. Lots of unnecessary scenes. Predictable\nending. Would not see this film again.\n"
"\n\"12 Years A Slave\" is a powerful picture on the challenging struggle of\nreal-life free-slave Solomon Northup, who was kidnapped and put back to\nthe horrors of slavery. Chiwetel Ejiofor's name will be pronounced\nnumerous times during movie awards season for his riveting starring\nperformance as Northrup. In fact, the whole movie was freed from lousy\nacting with other impressive performances; most notably from Michael\nFassbender as the villainous slaveowner Edwin Epps, Sarah Paulson as\nhis horror story-esque sister Mistress Epps, and Lupita Nyong'O as the\ntortured slave Patsey. Director Steve McQueen's work here will propel\nhim to elite auteur status. But believe it or not, John Ridley's\nscreenplay was a bit too detached for my taste. Nevertheless, break the\nchains and witness for yourself the gripping \"12 Years A Slave\". ****\nExcellent\n"
"\nThis type of slave movie has been done so many times before. In my\nopinion, the movies \"Roots\" and \"Django Unchained\" conveyed the message\nso much better. The main actors in this particular film weren't\nconvincing and neither was Brad Pit's cameo appearance. It really was a\nwaste of time and I personally found it disappointing. I am surprised\nto see that the rating was so high here on IMDb. Am I missing something\nhere? It fails to connect, and falls flat compared to the two\nafore-mentioned predecessors. Really... don't bother. I really can't\nunderstand why it won so many awards. Perhaps it was due to guilt or\nsomething. In all honesty, how many slave-whipping movies does a person\nreally need to see? I get it. It was very wrong to own and mistreat\nslaves. I promise I will never do it.\n"
"\nI thought the trailer looked good and I was wrong. As soon as Play was\npressed, my attention was never caught. I was bored and playing on my\nphone instead of watching. It did not seem like a 12 year span. I do\nnot see the hype over this - maybe only because these things really\nhappened. But there have been better movies. And what the heck are\nthese people freaking out about Lupita for? She didn't even do much!\nWhy wasn't the main guy given so much credit to? I'm so confused about\nthis. I think the hype was undeserving because it wasn't that good. I\ndon't mean to sound hateful or that I didn't care about slaves because\nthat is far from the truth. I just didn't like this movie. Or the hype\nit was given. Or the hype Lupita was given. Glad I didn't go pay money\nto see this in theaters.\n"
"\nThe movie which won Oscar for the best picture, is certainly the best\npicture for the year. Having watched all the nominated movies for Best\ndirector category, the academy should've given award to Steve McQueen\ntoo for this emotional pre-Civil war movie, IMO. Still the academy\nawarded the movie for the awesome screenplay. Lupita (the girl who won\nOscar for the supporting actress), was too good esp. with the sobbing\nand torture scenes (made me cry almost). I detested Tarantino's Django,\nbut now I feel like I may like it after seeing this.<br><br>Somehow I could relate this movie to an Indian (Tamil language) movie\nnamed Paradisi released in earlier 2013. Both of these movies deals\nwith slavery and the protagonist falling into it (not by his own will).\nIn Both, the protagonist is separated from his wife and children\nwithout their knowledge. Since I am an Indian and have seen the\nregional movie before this. So I couldn't give it a full 10/10.<br><br>Bottom line : A must-see movie. Not for kids for torture and nude\nscenes. Not for sensitive audiences too.\n"
"\nGreat pacing, and amazingly deep performances help to elevate this\nmovie through some of the hardest scenes you will, and should ever have\nto watch. Once again the time we live in has proved it's benefits, with\nfearless acting, direction, and story telling. No dancing on tiptoes,\nexcept in the literal sense, nothing is taboo, and all (or more than in\nyears past)of the sins of man are faced. Chiwetel Ejiofor gave such a\ngreat performance, and the Women were all very solid. The direction,\nand set design is all fantastic, and everything is made to feel very\nreal, and very painful. I would recommend this film to anyone, there\nare some tough to take scenes in here of physical abuse, and some\ngraphically violent scenes through out, but it is true, and real, and\npeople should know, and never forget. I Enjoyed this movie quite a bit,\nbut you must remember that this sort of thing is still going on in the\nworld, and not so far from you. If you see something wrong speak up.\n"
"\nAfter watching this movie my first thought was \"Why is this so highly\nrated\", although by no means a bad movie. The story is one of shocking\nhardship and unfairness as experienced by our main character played by\nChiwetel Ejiofor.<br><br>Performances are ranging from average bad to good, with Fassbender's\ndodgy accent and predictable character interpretation standing out as\npart of the weaker elements. Likewise Brad Pitt cannot be taken\nseriously, his one dimensional delivery destroys any narrative and\nleaves the associated components destitute of conviction. <br><br>Several times I felt I could be watching a TV movie albeit one with a\nlarger budget than normal. Considering the topic there was a lack of\nnarrative emotion which was compensated by some scenes of brutality and\n\"shock\". <br><br>A better director could have created a much more immersive production\nthat engaged the watcher with more depth. As it stands a harrowing\nstory, in an average package with a sprinkle of cliché and\nunintentional irony.\n"
"\nI agree with the last reviewer; I thought the movie was slow and\nawkward in the flashbacks. It totally omitted any sense of the long\nyears Solomon spent in slavery and how he reconciled himself to it.\nThere was no surprise with the sadism and inhumanity; as far as I am\nconcerned, moreover, it added nothing new to the already tragic picture\nof slavery in America. It would be more interesting to understand how\nhumanity was able to deal with slavery and why it produced such\nextraordinary sadism in the white population. The lack of decency was\nfinally resolved with the arrival of Brad Pitt; I found that casting\ntroubling as well.\n"
"\nThis film is a beautifully crafted and harrowing tale. It is, to me, an\nimportant film for all white people to see (I am a white person\nmyself). The emotions portrayed in this film are those that all white\npeople should absorb, and then reflect on the fact that oppression is\nstill a strong, ugly force in our lives. I have seen Solomon's\nexpressions in the faces of the young, black men I have known. We do\nnot live in a \"post-racial\" society. I strongly encourage people to\nwatch this film and reflect on your white privilege. I cannot imagine\nwhat it would be like to see this as a black person, and my only\ndissatisfaction with this film is that our society requires the pain\nand distress of people of color to educate white people.\n"
"\nIn 12 Years a Slave (2013), we are introduced to the story of Solomon\nNorthup, a black and free New York violinist, who is abducted during a\ntour in Washington and sold as a slave to a Louisiana plantation,\nbrutally portraying which took place in the southern United States\naround 1840. It is a cruel film with the spectator and will make you\nsuffer practically from beginning to end, leaving you discredited by\nseeing so much barbarism being made by the human being, but at the same\ntime hypnotizes you with so much beauty in the frames, the lighting and\nthe outstanding performances of Chiwetel Ejiofor, Lupita Nyong'o and\nMichael Fassbender, is certainly one of the best films of this decade\nand for me the best in portraying slavery, it is surely a must see for\nanyone who likes cinema.\n"
"\nA well made but flawed movie. My main gripe with it is the dialogue. I\nimagine it is authentic but the problem is that I could only catch\nabout half of what was said. Chiwetel is great as the main character\nbut when one can only follow parts of any conversation it spoils the\neffect of those parts of the script. It must have been a difficult task\nfor the actors to treat each other so appallingly, even given they were\nonly acting. It really is not a film that one can be said to \"enjoy\" it\nis more a question of appreciating it. Steve McQueen took on a\ndifficult and even controversial subject in this film and it was never\ngoing to be a blockbuster. It has been honoured more for the subject\nand the bravery it took to make it than for it's quality.\n"
"\nThis is a drama film set in the 1840s and 1850s. It's about an\nAfrican-American man who was born free in New York. He's kidnapped in\nWashington, D.C. and sold into slavery to work on plantations in\nLouisiana - until freed twelve years later. <br><br>The film is slow, boring and heavy-going. It doesn't give enough\nbackground and context for viewers who aren't knowledgeable of mid-19th\ncentury America. There's also very little about the protagonist's life\nbefore and after the twelve years that are the focus of the film.\n"
"\nThis movie had a positive impact towards me because it made me realize\nthe cruelty of others to enslave people to do the hard work for them,\nno matter what was it about and the irony that today we are still\nfighting for this kind of stuff, I mean human rights. It is impressive,\nby the story of a man, who struggles to keep his identity and dignity,\nin a period when slavery was like a dice game and you didn't know where\nlife would bring you after. The life of the main character is like an\nodyssey, with good and very, very bad times, but I think this is all\nabout life, in the end, to be smashed and moved backward, and then to\nget up and move even forward.\n"
"\nSuch a beautiful movie and a well told story. The cinematography\ntransported the viewer in every scene. The camera work, the acting, and\nthe story was very powerful. The story of injustice and triumph over\nevil came through. The passion the actors bought to the characters made\nyou feel exactly what the director wanted you to feel. It was hard to\nnot think you were there. It made you never want to see anything like\nthis happen to anyone. Bravo!\n"
"\nSteve McQueen's 'Twelve Years a Slave' is not exactly a bad film; but I\nconfess to a certain disappointment in it. McQueen's earlier movies,\n'Shame' and especially 'Hunger', were raw, visceral portrayals of life\nunder a certain sort of inescapably grim reality. But 'Twelve Years a\nSlave', while it contains many horrific moments, is basically full\nHollywood, with emotional background music underscoring the emotions\nwe're meant to feel, and a narrative that stresses the possibility of\nthe individual triumphing against evil and misfortune through strength\nof character alone. Of course, this is a common solution, because\ndepicting unameliorated misery could make for a grim movie: the\naudience prefers 'The Shaswhank Redemption' to a story ending in prison\nsuicide, or 'Schindler's List' to a drama actually set in the camps.\nBut McQueen has previously skirted the thin line between truth and\nunwatchability with considerable skill: this outing, though made with a\nmuch bigger budget, is a less ambitious effort.\n"
"\nAny film that engages with a topic as sensitive as slavery has to go\nhard or go home. 12 Years a Slave undoubtedly goes hard. Its portrayal\nof slavery is difficult but essential viewing. It treats all those\ninvolved with the utmost sensitivity. The performances are all\nbrilliant especially Chiwetel Eijofar and Michael Fassbender.\nEverything about this film is just a masterpiece. It deserves all of\nthe awards its won, all of the praise it's received. From the\ndirection, to the music, to the performances, to the props and\ncostumes, it is painful but magnificent to watch.<br><br>Read my full review here: http://goo.gl/1MIjY6\n"
"\nThis movie was a great 134 minutes of my life, but it's tough to say\nthat because of the topic of the movie which is slavery, and the\ngraphic violence of the slaves getting whipped and almost hung to\ndeath. It's just amazing to think that with the treatment that Solomon\nor Platt went through for 12 years and separated from his family at the\nkidnapping and still fought through it for so long to get freed. The\namount of courage that it takes and will to live to just take 100\nlashes a week and basically be bullied severely every day for being\nblack for 12 years is astounding, most of us don't have it. Overall, a\ngreat film, 2 thumbs up!\n"
"\nThe movie gives you what it says. And there are things that are far\nfrom easy to watch. The title itself is an indicator, so be sure you\nwant to watch a movie that will go to dark places. And there a couple\nof scenes that linger and seem to go on for forever (which is again,\nmore than hard too watch).<br><br>Obviously things like that did happen and it is despicable that some\npeople still will try to make it sound as harmless as possible.\nWhatever the case, after you watched this, you'll agree that slavery is\nnothing that should be tread lightly. Star names aside, this does take\nyou on a emotional roller coaster and you will find yourself hating\ncharacters for what they do.<br><br>It's nearly impossible to stay/watch this without a hint of an emotion.\nBe prepared for that and watch it, if you can ...\n"
"\nSolomon Northrup was a man living in upstate New York in 1841 who was\nabducted by slave traders and brought south to work on various\nplantations. Chiwetel Ejiofor is spectacular in the lead role and\ndeserving of an Oscar for best actor. The whippings and horrible\nconditions of the slaves is almost too much to watch. This is a long\nand draining experience for the entire two hours and fifteen minute\nrunning time. The entire cast is exceptional but be prepared to be\nemotionally exhausted in the end. Director McQueen has a keen eye for\ndetail but sometimes lingers a bit longer then necessary at times. His\nprevious efforts, Hunger and Shame were guilty of similar excesses.\nOverall, 12 Years a Slave is McQueen's best film.\n"
"\nI am an Australian, bored and alone more than I would like, sometimes I\nturn to escape a bit with films, imprisoned in other ways perhaps. It\nwas midnight, I got up and looked at Facebook, then bits and pieces, I\nhad 12 Years a Slave, it has moved me forward, as if pushed me from\nbehind and slapped me in the face. Now it is morning, I started the\nfilm near midnight, alone, it held me like speaking right into me, I\nwas not afraid of the self confrontation as the clock passed 0100am, I\nreally engaged in a way that I could not have known. Now I have learnt\nand experienced and want to make more of me for my daughter who is 9.\nSlavery and exploitation are written into capitalism now, it is perhaps\nworth meditating on that. This is not a film, it is a testament to life\nas we all seek enlightenment.\n"
"\nWas this movie good? Sure. Was this movie great? No...<br><br>Throwing Brad Pitt in your movie for two scenes, Paul Giamatti for two\nscenes, and Benedict Cumberbatch for three scenes doesn't really\nimpress me. It's like, oh hey, we got these A-listers in this movie, so\nit must be good right? Staying on the slavery theme, I really thought\nAmistad was much better than this was. And sorry to Lupita Nyong'o, but\nOscar worthy performance? Didn't really seem like it being she was\nshort on lines and screen time. Chiwetel Ejiofor as the lead was\nprobably the only character in this entire movie that held my interest,\nbut even his performance is dwarfed by Djimon Hounsou in Amistad. Was\nthis the case of the Academy trying to make a statement again, such as\nit did with Halle Berry and Monster's Ball?\n"
"\nMaybe it was because I heard so many good things about it that I was\nexpecting too much out of this film. To be fair however as I stopped\nhalf way through the film (it lacked any emotional 'hook') so I'll just\nspeak about the parts I did see.<br><br>Acting was terrible. and I'm not talking about the lead characters\nhere, but the smaller roles. For instance the scene where Solomon is\nbeaten with a wooden bat for the first time. I think the director was\ntrying to get some shock value out of the scene, but frankly, the\naggressor seemed to be over doing it. Scenes like these repeated\nmonotonously over the next hour or so that I watched before I finally\nquit. <br><br>I think this movie was some sort of an American apology to the black\ncommunity. Sit for two hours and curse your ancestors for what they did\nand then move on in life. I wonder why no one makes a movie on the\nhorrors of racism people face today?\n"
"\n12 Years a Slave is one of the most devastating dramas I've seen in a\nwhile, having some truly astonishing performances by the cast involved.\nIt's certainly a hard watch at times and Steve McQueen really captured\nthe brutality and sheer horror of slavery. There are several well known\nactors here and I must say that even though some of them had short\nappearances, they were still quite memorable. Whether you feel\ndisgusted by despicable characters or feel relieved by seeing others\nwith compassion and who respect human rights, there is always a strong\nsense of realism that transports you to this period of time. Everyone's\nimmersed in their roles to such a high degree, which just made me\nspeechless. Chiwetel Ejiofor gives the performance of a lifetime, with\nMichael Fassbender and Lupita Nyong'o being just as impressive. Steve\nMcQueen is a director to keep a close eye on and he brings us another\nemotionally wrenching journey with 12 Years A Slave, one of 2013's best\nfilms.\n"
"\nWhat happened to Steve McQueen, the talented director of Hunger and\nShame ? He completely trivialized himself with 12 Years a Slave,\nputting aside everything that made his previous movies so singular.<br><br>He delivers a completely asepticized movie, formatted for the mass \nand probably the members of the Academy  with ultra clichés shots far\nfrom what we were used to and a grandiloquent soundtrack by Hans Zimmer\nthat seems like a re-edition of the one from Inception.<br><br>If at least the scenario was surgically precise, but that's not even\nthe case. The narration is laborious and that just emphasizes as the\nmovie goes, the last half-hour is particularly chaotic, scenes follow\none another with not much coherence.<br><br>The film doesn't have the dramatic dimension of the true story on which\nit relies on, as poignant as Chiwetel Ejiofor's performance, the only\nactor to stand out within a fancy but under-exploited cast.<br><br>12 Years a Slave turns out to be a terrible disappointment in\ncomparison with what we were expecting from a talented director.\n"
"\nI was hoping this movie would have some redeeming qualities and not\njust like every movie that depicts whitey as a brutal, cruel, and\ndemeaning, stereotypical southern slave owner. This movie was just one\ncruel treatment followed by another, then another, then another, and\nthen another. I understand that there was some of this going on but\njust think of the millions who watch this think this movie is what\nhappened to the majority of slaves. I saw no creativity or originality\nor anything that would make this movie special.<br><br>As a southerner I was hoping to see this subject matter handled with\nsome balance and saw none. To say this was bad guys wearing the black\nhats is an injustice to what was a dark time for America but this\ntreatment of this highly sensitive issue was heavy handed with no\nobjectivity at all. This is no way to offer a docudrama as fact when it\nrepresented a myopic vision to a much more complex issue. I just hope\nthose who see this movie and not prejudiced by Steve McQueen's poor\nhandling of this time in history.\n"
"\nLets begin, this movie is probably exactly what could have been made\nout of a book like that. It's a movie that makes you think and his bad\nand good moments :)I liked this movie, of course. It was good, it had\nall the element a drama and history drama needed. The director was\ngood, and the actors couldn't be better. It lets you see the life of a\nman captured and the released after 12 years. TO be honest, movies like\nhis has been done before, don't get me wrong, it was reallllly well\nmade. But i am so tired of depressing movies about like even the\nHolocaust, it seems like if you do a movie about this you are\nguaranteed to be in the high leagues of Oscars.\n"
"\nThis one lacked soul and not sure it had a focus as well. It failed to\nmake me feel anything for its characters, except maybe for the cruel\nsadistic master.<br><br>But a movie talking about the dark times of slavery should focus more\non the life of the slaves. Instead of feeling the main hero's agony and\ntroubles I was just horrified by the actions of his awful master.<br><br>In any case, it didn't tell us anything more than what we have seen\nbefore in much better movies or/and TV series.<br><br>It is not a great movie and I can't understand all the hype about it.\n\"Oscar movies\" are more mediocre every year...\n"
"\nMaximum spoilers alert.<br><br>I thought this film was pretty bad. The acting was fantastic - full\ncredit to the cast - but the way the story was conveyed was amateurish\nat best. The whole family/freedom thing played about a 3-5 minute role\nin a film of 2 hours and 15 minutes - and there was no 'pre-kidnap'\ndevelopment of the character to humanise him and let you empathise with\nhim. When it should have been fast, it was slow, and when it should\nhave been slow, it was fast.<br><br>A remake of this should have ~30 minutes at the start just to ease into\nthe film and develop the character, and let the audience really\nempathise with what he was losing in life. Key scenes later on were\ngood but were cut with too many filler scenes to be fully utilised. The\nending was also quite anti-climatic, leaving the reunion too brief to\neven qualify for 'brief but sweet'.<br><br>It's saddening as this post will probably be taken as some racist\nhatred thing, when in fact it's just a review of the director. This\nfilm could have been so much better, but sadly this is an opportunity\nmissed.\n"
"\nIn 1841, Solomon Northup is a free African-American man working as a\nviolinist, living with his wife and two children in Saratoga Springs,\nNew York. Two white men, Brown and Hamilton, offer him short-term\nemployment as a musician if he will travel with them to Washington,\nD.C. However, once they arrive, the duo drug Northup and conspire to\ndeliver him to a slave pen. Northup is later shipped to New Orleans\nalong with others who have been detained against their will. A slave\ntrader named Freeman gives Northup the identity of \"Platt\", a runaway\nslave from Georgia, and sells him and another slave Patsey to\nplantation owner William Ford. Due to tension between Northup and\nanother plantation worker, Ford sells him to another slave owner named\nEdwin Epps. In the process, Northup attempts to explain that he is\nactually a free man, but to no avail.\n"
"\nThe fact that this movie won three Oscars should be a reason to watch\nit. It took me bout 2 years to watch this movie in full. Movies like\nthis usually leave me very unsettled. I kept pausing it and coming back\nto it a few months later. There is hardly any fillers for music in this\nfilm. The director makes sure that we can hear everything and I feel\nthat is why it is so chilling. The actors and actresses did a\nphenomenal job. I felt the pain in every sentence. I believe everyone\ncan agree when saying that the scene with Lupita being whipped was the\nmost heart wrenching scene. I don't want to spoil any of the movie but\nall I will say is, be prepared and just realize that this is history\nplayed out on a screen.\n"
"\nBased on the 1853 novel by ex slave and freeman Solomon Northup. This\npre American civil war exposure of slavery 150 years ago in the united\nStates. Requires a very strong heart and a stronger stomach for\nviolence. This is without question one of the most important but also\nthe most gut wrenching emotionally packed films ever to obtain the BEST\nPICTURE Oscar. An amazing piece of artistic cinema, both horrible and\nentertaining. How, can that be so? All performances are truly stunning\nwhile the craft involved is simply breath taking. A Truly AMAZING film.\nBrilliant Cinema!Directed with extreme brilliance by Brit former artist\nSteve McQueen and with a sensational cast who deliver astonishing\nperformances from the already famous and the soon to be alike, This is\na very important film every one shoud see.\n"
"\nI found the movie well played and heart breaking, and also I believe it\nis still relevant for today, if people realize the link between that\ntime and those events and the new still disguised kind exploitation of\nthird world countries taking place nowadays. <br><br>Still one thing about this movie is a bit disappointing to me, which is\nthe fact that Brad Pitt is playing the (short) role of the only\ncompassionate white person ánd saviour of the day. I don't know why a\nmovie like this needs an actor like him for such a small part, while\nthere are no other big names in it. It seems like Brad Pitt is playing\njust for his image, and they let him play it to make the movie bigger\nor something. To me this really detracted the movies' credibility. Much\nmore impressed I was by the actors who dared to play the roles of the\nclearly unscrupulous (too white) people.\n"
"\nThe film 12 Years A Slave was a highly detailed film, accurately\ndepicting the horrors of slavery and the injustice that befell many\npeople. The brutal whippings and physical violence that was given out\nof pure spite to those who, for the most part, did nothing that could\npossibly warrant the receiving of these punishments.The story of\nSolomon was a great tale of a man beating the conditions that he was\nwrongfully put into. Solomon managed to escaped the inhumane things\nthat he was put into by staying alive and not giving up hope that one\nday he would be freed. This film opens one's eyes to the sin of slavery\nand makes one realize how bad slavery was. Even though these horrors\ncontrolled many plantation owners people like Bass proved that people\ncan still be kind- hearted even when their life is at stake.\n"
"\n12 Years a Slave was a magnificent example of what slavery was like in\npast history. Based off a true story of Solomon Northup, a free black\nman that was sold to slavery, he has to face a multitude of\nirrationality and abuse. As a slave, he now has to face the \"Horrors of\nSlavery\" for the hardest 12 years of his life. The film demonstrates\nthese horrors with much emphasis on the process of demoralization of\nevery single slave especially Solomon. Horrors as in the straight\nbrutality and cruelty of slavery without out any boundaries. Solomon's\nstruggles along with the other slaves and owners he's encounter\nrepresents humanity's evil in the world. Evil that no man has to ever\nface throughout their lifetime. So if you really want to see slavery in\nits true colors and notice these \"Horrors\", it is highly suggested to\nwatch this film that might change your perspective on this \"evil\".\n"
"\nThe story told is one of brilliant execution. How the life of someone\ncan dramatically change within a few seconds just because the of the\ntime and because of the slavery at the time. The excellent portrayal by\nM.Fassbender and B.Cumberbatch of ranch owners shows the hardship of\nlabour and slavery. Even the remorse shown by Benedict's character was\nflattened by what could happen if he went soft on his slaves. The Story\nshows how much pain he goes through and the eventuality of meeting Brad\nPitt's character was heartwarming to know that someone out there was\nlooking down solemnly onto him. The Ending was very basic but was what\nthe film needed with a happy reunion of the family once more.\n"
"\nI think this movie is a movie everyone needs to see. It shows the\nbrutal truth of America's history that so many people want to ignore or\nnot realize it was as deplorable as it really was. For over 200 years,\nblack people were treated as nonhuman objects to be abused and taken\nadvantage of until they died. This movie is an amazingly well written\nand produced film with an outstanding cast. It makes you feel so many\nthings; anger, fear, disgust, sadness, and pain. It was at times quite\ndifficult to watch, but I think that's what it's purpose was. It was so\nmoving yet painful to watch, especially being a black woman. Knowing\nthat this is what my ancestors actually went through tears me apart and\nangers me. However, I did enjoy this film very much.\n"
"\nin 2013 there were many great movies and yes 12 years slave was one of\nthem which showed slavery in a way never saw, but in that year it was\nobvious that the best movie of that year was not 12 years slave. i do\nnot wanna defend gravity which was the best in that year but still even\nAmerican hustle was a better movie. yes Lupita Nyong'o's act was\nabsolutely brilliant but still the title of a best picture is for the\nbest production of that year not the movie that had more impact on the\npeople. you could do a better job with this production, get a better\ncostume design, set production and etc. in movies like this the score\nhas the first impact on audience. they could do a better job. i am not\nsaying that i could but i am saying that if they just put a little bit\nmore effort on this movie they could get a brilliant job but they\ndidn't. instead you could not get a better job with more effort on\ngravity or American hustle. the title of the best picture should belong\nto the best production and for sure this movie was the 3rd of that year\nin my opinion.\n"
"\nThe movie was sensational. It has some of the best acting I've seen in\na long time. The setting and horrors of what slavery was like in the\n1800 is excellent. The story was very interesting and good. A freed\nslave and his wife moved to a free state. He from their was educated\nand started his own family. He was very successful in educating him\nself and his wife. He was then captured and brought back to a\nplantation.<br><br>He was trapped their for years has his family grew and got older. He\nhas been a very rebellious and resource individual. He had made\nconnections and friends. He stood up to various of slave masters. He\nhad been desperately trying to contact his friend to help him. He\nfinally get his letter sent by a Canadian man.<br><br>He was finally saved and brought back to his family. The gruesome gore\nof slavery and setting was good.I wish they would show his family\nprogress a little bit more.\n"
"\nThis movie was a beautifully rendered piece of history. Showing how\nSolomon Northup was thrown into the life of a slave from a life of\nwhich had both comfort and the opportunity that showed itself everyday-\nthe opportunity to live. Throughout his struggles, Soloman never gives\nup hope, and that's an important lesson for us all. He trusted few and\nalthough he tried, regularly failed to keep his head down and mouth\nshut. Finally, his faith and devotion to being free again pays off,\nbringing him home to what he once had, 12 years later. Symbolism used\nin this movie was subtle, however beyond amazing. When he hangs from\nthe rope when one man decides that he can take his life, however wrong\nhe is, time passes slowly for the viewer, showing just how unimaginably\nlong it is for Solomon, having to take the slow way around, one day at\na time.\n"

"\nWhat can I say that hasn't already been said? This movie taught me, it\ntormented me and it shamed me. The fact that a person can just be\ndrugged and *pulled* into that type of situation sickens me to no end.\nWords are not enough. HOWEVER, my main complaint about the movie was\nthat, in the beginning I noticed it was a Plan B production - ie: Brad\nPitt. I was thinking to myself - wow! maybe he really DID do a good\nperiod piece without reminding us that he, the almighty BP had\nsomething to do with it.<br><br>WhaaaWhaaaa....Brad, you just couldn't keep your self-absorbed \"look at\nme I'm a man of the people, I help Katrina, I adopt needy children\" mug\nout of the film.<br><br>To be quite honest, I was getting into the rhythm of the film when\nda-da-da-daaaaaaa here come the hero Brad. He was soooo out of place!\nIF it wasn't for BRAD, the letter never would have gotten sent and po\nol' Samson would've been stuck.<br><br>I give it a solid 7.5 outta 10 for the movie, an I give a good 10 outta\n10 to Brad for his self-indulgent razzie.\n"
"\nThis is a though movie to go through, it has so many scenarios where\nyou think no that couldn't have happened and then again you keep\nwatching the hate and cruel intentions over and over again. It is a\nstrong movie and kind of a heartless but also heart filled movie in\nmany cases, there are ups and downs and a very strong believe and\ndetermination all the way.<br><br>The scenes are really beautiful, and the characters really well acted,\nthere are these small things here and there that makes the audience\neither like or hate the characters more. Benedict Cumberbatch is a\nslaver, but he tries to be a good man, Michael Fassbender is though and\na general a-hole, there is this scene where he leans on the head of one\nof his slaves. Its these small things that make the characters the way\nthey are and really divides them into \"good\" and \"evil\".\n"
"\nBecause I don't like films that reside in the past I wasn't paying much\nattention at the start and it took me a while to get into it. The time\njumps made it even harder to follow (I actually watched the start\ntwice).<br><br>But along the way the film started to get good (and coming from me that\nsays something). The plot was very well written and was not to fast or\nto slow.<br><br>I wanted to see this film because the idea of slavery is idiotic to me.\nHow people back then could be doing this is beyond me, but I guess it\nhas something to do with greed and group pressure. This film really\nshowed the viewer how awful slavery was.<br><br>Chiwetel Ejiofor did a fantastic job playing this character, Brad Pitt\nwas really poorly cast and absolutely the wrong man for the role, even\nfor the small part.\n"
"\nThe film tells the true story of Salomon North who plays him Chiwetel\nAgiofor, Black talented violinist who was kidnapped and sold into\nslavery in the United States before the Civil War. The film is very\ninteresting and important to see this film because this film tells\nabout an event that everyone should know more or less what happened to\nhim The film has only one drawback: too long and film excerpts that\ncould give them The film is based on a true story and exciting African\nAmerican man living in New York with his wife and two children and is\nsold into slavery in the American South Excellent game of cast Film 12\nYears a Slave won an Oscar for best film and justice I would recommend\nthis movie\n"
"\nThe opening scenes of this movie left me completely shocked. It does\nnot ease its viewers into the content, instead it fully immersed them\ninto the violence and hatred that went hand in hand with slavery. The\nmovie begins with him already in slavery, and within the first half\nhour, we watch as Solomon is deceived and drugged into slavery, and\nbeaten. We watch as he is nearly hanged, as he is traded from a kinder\nmaster to one so despicable he is known as a \"slave breaker\". The movie\nfollows his dark journey marvelously, and displays it amazingly. I can\nnot remember the last time I watched a historical film as interesting\nor as captivating as this one. My eyes were glued to the screen, and I\ncould not tear myself away from the movie. This film delivered a\ndifficult topic without beating around the bush, and for that it should\nbe applauded.\n"

"\nPrior to watching 12 Years A Slave, I figured I knew what to expect.\nTalking about slavery in history, you hear over and over again about\nthe brutal past of those persecuted by their race. However, listening\nis not the same as experiencing. 12 Years A Slave embarks the audience\nalongside Solomon's journey from being a free African man, kidnapped\nand sold into slavery and experiencing the cruelty faced upon him. With\ntalented and sympathetic actors portraying the lives of those who\nunfortunately fell victim to the bitter side of humanity, makes this\nbiographical film come to life. It's safe to say that 12 Years A Slave\nhas not only captured my attention, but my empathy and heart, with high\nhopes that the future will learn from history and every individual can\nlive in pure peace.\n"

"\nIt was very difficult for me to watch this movie because of the\nbrutality of the way people were treated. However the movie portrayed\nthe times very well and gave me a better understanding and appreciation\nof how the slaves were treated in those times. It was an awful thing,\nslavery, and the way this movie so accurately showed what these people\nwent through for many years was incredible. Furthermore, it is an\namazing thing that there were people like the character Bass played by\nBrad Pitt who saw how truly awful it was that the African Americans\nwere being treated this way and did what they could to help them. I\nwould most definitely recommend this movie to people because the acting\nwas fantastic and the story line was accurate. Beware this movie is not\nfor the faint of heart because there are some very graphic scenes.\n"
"\nThis is a great movie that shows how unfair and cruel slavery was to\nthose that were affected by it. Solomon was a free black man who was\nkidnapped and forced into slavery. Although he is eventually freed\n(thank you Brad Pitt), Solomon had to endure some horrible treatment at\nthe hands of his masters, like whippings, beatings, living in horrible\nconditions, working in the hot Southern summer for hours on end, being\ncalled horrible names and being dehumanized. This movie does have a bit\nof nudity and sexual content. My main problem with this movie is that\nit's hard to tell when and where the events occur. After saying the\nyear and area in the beginning (Saratoga NY, 1841), you never know when\nthings are happening afterwords. All we know is that the movie takes\nplace from 1841-1853 and is in the Southern United States. All in all,\nI really enjoyed this movie. This one of my favorite movies of all\ntime.\n"
"\nI will not be marking spoilers in between so read at your own risk. 12\nyears a slave was good movie. The struggles of Solomon Northup played\nby Chiwetel Ejiofor and Patsey played by Lupita Nyong'o made feel\ngutted for them. Especially Patsey when Solomon leaves the plantation\ntowards the end of the movie. But it did not deserve the awards that it\ngot. Lupita Nyong'o deserved her Oscar but not the movie. Felt like\npeople were pressured to give it an Oscar just because of being afraid\nthey might be classified as racists otherwise. Anyway more about the\nmovie, great acting from the whole cast. Fassbender, Paulson and even\nBennedict Cumberbatch in his cameo brilliantly portrayed the\nhelplessness of his character.\n"
