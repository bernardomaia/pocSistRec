the place beyond the pines tells a unique compelling story in a way that i have never seen before
this movie kept me interested from start to finish
it is far from traditional storytelling
the story is split into three sections all very different from each other
i enjoyed each section of the movie almost equally but the first hour of the movie is definitely the strongest
the movie may be slow to some but i was invested in the story from start to finish
this is the best ive seen ryan gosling and bradley cooper no doubt
there are no bad performances but cooper and goslings stand out the most
dane dehaan plays an important role and does a great job of it
dehaan is definitely a rising star
the tone of this movie is incredible and i would recommend it to anyone who enjoys a good drama
it is the best movie i have seen this year and with the breakthrough performances throughout this is a movie youre not going to want to miss
this movie has excellent cinematography and great camera work and famous actors
that is it
i wish i could talk to the director and just figure out what the hell he was thinking
the first story of ryan gosling as the bank robber was excellent
the first 45 minutes the second story of bradley cooper exposing corruption within his police department was decent the idea certainly had potential
and the last story of their two kids meeting had little potential but still could have been an alright movie
when all three are combined it is nothing but irrelevant wasted potential
ultimately this movie dies with lives and dies by ryan gosling
i walked out of the theater angry that i was so manipulated by a near perfect movie trailer
the idea of ryan gosling as a bank robber is now wasted and bradley cooper as a good cop among bad cops is ruined
and for the record there is no place beyond the pines it has nothing at all to do with the movie its just a good marketing title to manipulate people into wasting their money on this disappointment of a movie
the first section holds promise of a tense thriller as ryan gosling gets addicted to robbing banks and using his motorbike riding skills to escape at high speed until
the second section focuses on bradley coopers cop hailed as a hero but who finds it a mixed blessing carrying both danger but also opportunities worth exploiting
once the headline appears on screen fifteen years later we are in the third section and its here that the film completely falls apart
the story becomes melodramatic and utterly predictable the coincidences and plot contrivances are just ridiculous
to make matters worse we are served up a load of codpsychology about fathers and sons
if only the director had stuck to making a solid thriller without all the pretentious overtones this wouldve been a really good movie
since i like mr ryan gosling as an actor i went out with friends to watch the place beyond the pines
in this movie mr gosling is quickly killed leaving bradley cooper not a favourite for me to finish the long remainder of the action
this immediately put me off
i could not watch the movie to the end
the two leading characters gosling and cooper meet in a police chase only for a few minutes in which mr gosling is shot dead
to my mind this felt like a cheat a trick
since i did not know about it beforehand
so if you  like me  want to see mr
gosling i suggest you give this one the skip
mr gosling has several good movies worth watching excluding this one of course
lukes downwards spiral and crosss guilty conscience were compelling and the lack of contrast between the two made it an interesting commentary on the medias and peoples tendency to force situations into a right vs wrong black and white mould
luke being a bank robber with seminoble intentions who simply couldnt accept that hed couldnt have the life he wanted with his son and sons mother vs avery cross being an ambitious cop who doubts his supposed heroism and almost lets himself go down the path of corruption really makes you question who to root for and whether rooting for someone is the right way to go
the story of their sons however is hard to enjoy
while the idea that the effects of your actions dont stop at you or your generation holds water and the way lukes son and those that knew luke cast avery as the villain reflects the past treatment of luke and the same error in perception the characters sons are so unlikable and have such poor judgment that the second half is hard to enjoy or appreciate
seeing the great cast in this movie fooled me
this movie made no sense the storyline was not smooth and was not realistic
ryan robot goslings role was short lived in the movie and was ridiculous
bradley cooper eventually shows us half way through the movie as a crooked hero cop that is taking pleasure in being the hero after murder amp theft
eva mendez was the only actor that was decent and she had a minor useless role
once ray liotta entered the movie the story comes apart
i so disappointed and wish we rented another movie
dont be fooled by the usual amazing cast
this was a terrible movie and would have rated it lower without the actors used in the film
the place beyond the pines is honestly one of the worst movies i have ever seen
it was unnecessarily long and incredibly boring
the characters were not engaging at all and almost no back story was ever given
the editing was sloppy and the first part of the movie felt like it was being rushed and the movie makers were just trying to get it over with
the camera was constantly unsteady and shaking
to be honest the whole thing felt more like a bad independent film than an actual movie
the worst part in my opinion is that the summary and trailer of the movie is completely misleading
the movie is entirely different form what the trailer would have you believe
please dont waste your money on this movie
if you really want to see it it would be better if you just waited until you can rent it for a couple bucks
spoilers directed by derek cianfrance the place beyond the pines seems like it may have been a decent book maybe it was based on one  i didnt look as its details are fairly involved and sometimes vivid
but as a movie it didnt work for me especially as it kept going
really it meandered badly and failed to hold my attention especially during the third and final act
it seemed to be bitten by the wandering bug and the music was monotonous and outofplace
too bad as the movie started out fairly well especially in the first 3rd with the focus on actors gosling and mendes  there was good focus there but then it keeps going and going and trying to show meaning where theres none
unfortunately its a stumbled missed opportunity
510
let me tell you something a felon is a felon
nothing deep
stop promote this kind of characters
those kids are the same crap in real life
they are like rats poisoning the society
i want my money back and my wasted time
who create this movie
i want to see the guy
show yourself
the image of the felon who jump of the window was too long
it was disturbing to see the dead guy for many seconds
sick director
awful
come on so many good ideas are waiting to be on the big screen and they concentrate about felony bad guy corrupted policeman drugs and teenagers all together in a story who wants to make the people to felt down in tears
american crap
pardon me for my english
the place beyond the pines follows two fathers and two sons over two decades in a quite effective film
in spite of its being a little overlong it has a strong rawness and two excellent acting performances
ryan gosling and bradle cooper are a perfect pair of opposites gosling is all wildness whereas cooper wonderfully plays a man who rehearsed for life and seems uncomfortable with praise
the films first twothirds focusing on these two men are fascinating but the story ends up losing a bit its own way in the last halfhour the coincidence of the grown sons coming across each other is forced
however everything ends on the right note with a journey on an old motorbike and a slow fade into a new beginning
sad to say but the talents of ryan gosling bradley cooper and eva mendes were completely wasted on this film
there are no characters who are particularly likable or unlikable or that are even much deeper than a cardboard cutout
the story is slow which actually make a little sense since it goes nowhere
wheres the conflict
hmmmm not that sure
any redemption
not too sure im seeing that either
any real point at all
no not really
this is the kind of film that people pretend they like in order to appear sophisticated
it thats you save yourself the 2 hours of your life that youll never get back and just tell people you liked it
youll thank me
the place beyond the pines feels like three incomplete films stuffed into one film
the ambitious story follows a bank robber then the cop involved and then both their sons
a mini series format would suit this a hell of a lot better and flesh out the story where here all the stories feel rushed yet the film feels endless
the first part of the film with gosling is the most successful as we watch this motorcycle daredevil go on a bank robbing spree to leave something for his newborn son
the second act with cooper is a half assed corrupt cop story with zero payoff
and the last act about cooper running for public office and tying both his kid and goslings kids fate together feels extraneous when it should bring the story full circle
its an epic story indeed spanning a generation but director derek cianfrance doesnt pull off the execution
it starts well enough them the ryan gosling character is killed by the bradley cooper character within the first hour
its like ok now where are we going the lead is just killed off
it continues by following bradley cooper through some challenges personally and professionally following his recognition for being shot in the line of duty when he killed gosling
i really liked seeing ray liota ive always been a fan
then it jumps 15 years forward
what
where are we now
i was really losing interest by now
i appreciated the work of the cast but the story didnt cut it for me
i felt like i was watching an adaptation of a novel that was cut too thin to make sense
awfully boring movie
the place beyond the pines reads like a book
probably a good read
regrettably the place beyond the pines could be one of those books which transfers to film poorly
the storyline is long and dry
dry in the way of an over cooked turkey which is hard to digest
the acting and characters are wooden
the characters are stiff and unbelievable
great cast ie cooper but the directer gives a feel that every character is constipated while they are talking
the place beyond the pines story unfolds like a boring power point presentation which has too much information
the movie lost my attention after the first 30 minutes
i found myself playing with my smart phone then i went onto the computer
finally its over i thought to myself when the place beyond the pines ended
i give 4 stars out of ten
i have to applaud the place beyond the pines for its effort
this film has a fantastic premise and was certainly ambitious with its story
the risks it took and the tale it was attempting to tell are truly fantastic
unfortunately for this film and those watching it never truly succeeds
this is due to some terrible pacing and badly written characters
its hard to care about any of them as none of the interesting ones are given enough time to become fully developed
those who do get sufficient screen time just arent that attention grabbing despite some descent acting
i would also just like to state that after watching this film i wanted to strangle emory cohen
im sure hes a fine actor but he plays probably one of the most aggravatingobnoxiousannoying characters i have seen in recent history
on the bright side this film contains some great cinematography and a fantastic soundtrack
seriously instead of watching this boring and convoluted mess get on spotify right now and listen to the soundtrack youll have a better time
i cant deny everything said by the people whove rated this as a 10
what i can say is that this director put a lot of effort into the drama aspect of things
if by drama you mean taking extended pauses between dialogs
at some times so much so that it is uncomfortable
i kept finding myself saying come on i get the point now get on with it
its almost as if the director felt making a good movie required that it be 2 12 hours long
this movie definitely could have been reduced to 1 12 hours and wouldnt have lost a bit of quality
now the critics and the academy awards click will love this but the average viewer will feel as i do
the movie has a great albeit slightly predictable plot
the acting is superb
the story itself is a great one
had it moved at a comfortable pace i would give it a 9
for now its off to go find some caffeine
i cant remember the last time i was this excited to see a film
started off with so much promise and slowly built tension and momentum
then it all fell apart for me
ryan gosling does his typical tough guy shtick which works for the first half hour
bradley cooper starts off strong but there doesnt seem much for him to do after his big shooting scene
the more he is on screen the less believable it is to me that he would be a cop
i do like how he handled the corruption but it left me with a lot of questions as well
act 3 was just depressing and i became uninterested as it slowly dawned on me that this movie was a huge disappointment and basically going nowhereslowly and painfully
it could have been better good acting might have carried it but the absolutely clichad soundtrack started grating on me early
and the most surprising thing about the ending is that anyone would think it was believable
after all the dawdling over the beginning of the movie it was quite a shock to see the dreaded 15 years later show up like something a highschooler would have written
in fact i think the clichas and choppy storytelling show a lot of immaturity in the writing
its not a bad story and like i said the actors did what they could but so much of the character motivation was vague and for a movie that lasted so long it felt like a lot was missing
best line for unintentional rhyming comedy he got ecstasy from that kid from schenectady
not sure that was worth the 15 year wait
the film is not worthy the money nor the time
its long and boring
it lacks argument and meaning nothing seems to happen for scenes and scenes and the final message is really thin
if you want to delight your sight with eva mendes or ray gossling you can do so in much better films
the film is not worthy the money nor the time

the film is not worthy the money nor the time

if you want to delight your sight with eva mendes or ray gossling you can do so in much better films
when i saw the previews to this movie it looked very interesting i figured it was going to be a movie that starts out kind of slow and builds up to a really great story my god was i wrong
this is the exact opposite the movie starts out laying the ground work for a motorcycle riderbank robber and then when the story just gets good it stops
from that point on they just kind of toss in little side stories here and there from this persons view from that persons view from everywhere
about midway through this ghastly long winded movie you understand where it will all come together and heres the kicker it does
it comes together just like you think it will and then nothing happens
its seriously one of the most disappointing movies ive seen this year and if it werent for ryan gosling and eva mendes this movie would have easily been a 110
this movie had decent acting but the pacing and connection between the two story lines was weak at best
the first 30 minutes or so were pretty good and then things shift dramatically and i started losing investmentinterest in the characters
the plot just kind of trickles along with no real direction it felt like the writers got kind of lost in their own story
i think it was meant to be a movie about how our actions affect others and maybe about the rolelegacy of the father but it didnt reach any kind of significance for me
i got really bored towards the end and considered walking out which is saying something bc it is rare for me not to finish a movie
the movies had the ingredients to potentially be a solid movie but it just did not make it happen
the movie is about a man named luke who rides his motorcycle inside the globe of death a carnival attraction
he runs into his old lover romina who has secretly had lukes child
in an attempt to support his new son and win his girl back luke quits his job at the carnival and robs some banks
he is successful until he tried one too many times and was accidentally killed in the process
the story then shifts to the police officer that had luke in pursuit avery cross
fifteen years pass and the rest of the story unfolds
the film was produced so well and had a very grabbing plot line and the actors were hot
this movie was so great
i didnt fall asleep but i didnt pay much attention either
its not painfully slow moving its not flashy either
its 3 small movies none of which could stand on their own stitched together into a clicha riddled saga
the first story with gosling is cookie cutter depressed mumbling gosling
the second story is a 70s episode of a tv show about dirty cops it even has ray liotta being a dirty cop i know wheres my fainting couch
the third is the most cinematic replete with morality tales about sins of the father and whatnot
but at the end its light and fluffy
not much to it
would have made a good flick 30 years ago
stunning actors beautiful camera work first take in the movie was absolutely gorgeous and a great story with a message
it just felt so realistic and close to the characters
but i think it was a little bit too long and sometimes felt a little unfocused in the second half
added to that it felt because of the realism kind of depressive but that is just my own personal point of view if you dont have a problem with something like this cool
but that is what makes movies a little bit worse for me
but still almost a brilliant piece of filmmaking
my mom said this movie was really good and gripping
i watched it and was disappointed with the tediousness of the length and the differing story lines
this film should have been presented as three short films tied together however flimsy
the story lines that should have been rife with tension and consequences are not
just when you think something will go the distance and really explode
it backs up or takes a detour and its way too neat especially the end that would be highly consequential in real life but in this movie its another weak soft spot
the only real event that happens is the end of the first act then everything else keeps going soft
itss a hard 212 hours with no payoff and dumb characters that you cant believe or want to succeed
ok the story is about two men and later their sons
in the summary it says something about the place in the woods where they find refuge but to be honest they hardly ever went there
the performances were good probably the only thing that saved the movie from hitting rock bottom as the story doesnt unfold as well as it would have been expected
i mean its a good drama in theory but it fails to deliver
in the end what did the movie had to say
that the sins of the parents are burdens of their children
that one cant escape their fate
maybe that there is an authority problem in the police system
anyway the first part of the movie was better than the second one the one that limped into the future fifteen years later
it had more feeling into it i guess
but to end this i have to say that even though the main idea of the film was great the movie didnt live up to it
so three out of ten
this film is a great study of characters and how lives intertwine
giving a meaning to what a small world
this film is in 3 parts and derek cianfrance travels through them fluidly
it is a film of strife and struggles and shows the audience that people will do what needs to be done
no matter the circumstances
a bold movie with no lulls and some pretty good action
there are a couple of genres that this picture moves through
making it an exciting and enjoyable feature to watch
ryan gosling and bradley cooper were great and evas character progressed beautifully
mike patton did the score which carried the film through its long time line and added a certain atmosphere
all in all an excellent film with great acting awesome story writing a powerful score and interesting characters
i highly recommend this movie
it has been a while since i watched a movie that did hold me like this on the edge throughout the whole movie
with a length of over hundred and forty minutes it is worth every second
the place beyond the pines is a well made structure where every moment means a new layer of complexity and uncertainty
with an epic structure but with an lyrical content
the most difficult thing is to form an opinion about the main protagonists
do you condemn someone who never had a chance to be a better man or react instinctively to fear for your life
it is far from perfect but achieves perfection
its interesting to see three different stories so interconnected
when i had first watched place beyond the pines it was mostly only because it stars both ryan gosling and bradley cooper
it has since become one of my favorite movies and is somewhat similar to another favorite of mine drive
the story is split into three acts all layered well and coming together at the end
although the first two acts were done extraordinarily well the last act lacked a lot
it honestly probably couldve been cut from the film entirely but that wouldve taken away from the larger scope to complete the storyline
but that didnt make me enjoy the film any less
the cinematography was great and so was the acting
i would definitely recommend this movie to anyone looking for an intense drama with great acting
the places beyond the pines tells us the story of the death of a criminal and its longer term aftermath three separate stories focus sequentially on a different character
the weakest section is the third focusing on the children of the original participants their motivations seem more stylised and less particular than those of the leads in the earlier sections which by contrast are subtly and well portrayed
this is a selfconsciously serious movie but its not quite as engaging as it could be none of the protagonists are particularly appealing
its not just that theyre flawed human beings theyre all quite close personalities selfishly selfcontained and while their alienation provides a unifying theme the film fails to truly probe its underlying causes
what is left is simply a story of some not particularly likable people doing bad things to each other
ive seen plenty worse movies but ultimately this one takes quite a lot of screen time and while it takes it quite well the overall effect is underwhelming rather than emotional
going into this movie i didnt know what to expect
i had heard mixed reviews and was intrigued by what i had heard and you know what
it was a genuinely good movie
the cast is varied and has two very prestigious actors as the main characters
the seamless change between protagonists after the biker played by ryan gosling dies is to be admired and the psychological effects of events on the cop played by bradley cooper being only subtly worked in so they are noticed by the viewer is rather impressive
the movie superbly shows the truth behind corruption in the law and how far the people in charge can abuse their power even though i suspect that may not have been their intention
also i thought about what i would give this as i watched the movie i tried to decide what i would give it i decided on 8 however as i watched the scene were i discovered the two sons were friends years later i decided for a nine as my mind was blown
the only reason it was not a 10 were some minor things along the movie and i believe that very few movies are worth full marks
there are few films that can grab me the way the place beyond the pines did i believe the script is so well written that the characters do not feel to be just characters anymore and i dont feel to be part of the audience
this film will grab you and take you on a roller coaster
it truly is a credit to derek cianfrances ability to not just write but to create
credit is also due to the actors in this film for an excellent portrayal of what cianfrance had envisioned
it is truly a bittersweet shame that this movie hasnt received the commercial success it deserves
i recommend this film to absolutely anyone who is interested in good cinema particularly good acting and even more superb scripts
i think the movie was great in terms of screenplay and script
the first half of the movie is too interesting with ryan gosling and his motorcycle mania
eva acted good too as a supporting character but then when bradley cooper comes into the show and the movie loses its pace
bradley is a great actor and he did very well but somewhere i think jake gyllenhaal could do it more precisely
the story gets a bit messy when bradleys character get into trouble between the corrupted cops i think jake would have been an excellent cast in this role
jake gyllenhaal was great in prisoners as a cop and i think he would have been excellent non the less it was a good movie it had some sort of mystery from the beginning
this movie takes you on a ride not quite many others
the story starts off with a struggling motorcyclist ryan gosling who is trying to win the love and trust from his exgirlfriend eva mendes and newborn son
gosling finds himself going to extreme measures to do this when he meets a man that he would later devise a plan to rob banks with
after some success he is later caught as he tries to rob too many banks at once
the cop bradley cooper shoots and kills gosling and an entire different storyline is presented
cooper is faced with the tough situation of being portrayed as a hero and avoiding what dirty cops do with the money that was compromised from the robbery
the movie then progresses 15 years later and a successful cooper is now faced with dealing with his rebellious son who later would become best friends with the son that gossling had
we watched this film last night  not really knowing to much about it
at 2 hours 20 minutes its quite long
as said previously  its a 3 act film which all comes together in the end
i love the feel of the film
reminded me a little of crash the way you have several stories all going on that all come together in the end
there were times during the film  that i found it quite uncomfortable to watch but when the movie picks you up  boy does it thrill
there are times when its really slow also  but stick with it
the music in the film is brilliant especially the track used for the end titles
this is a film  im glad ive seen  but not sure if i would buy it for my movie collection
would i recommend it
absolutely  but stick with it
dont give in and youll be rewarded in the end
hmmm so i dint get a chance to see this film immediately
when i was in redding california i almost got to see drive while at the stardust motel but it cut off
i forgwet what film it was where ryan was amongst steve carell but i think it was more than once
if im right unless the other time was when he steve was with m wahlburgh whatever
so here we see a robbery
very dreamy seemed kind of easy
he shrieks a bunch ryan gosling
the c ops chases him finds him and then has weird feelings after the attempted arrest
its over
but maybe not
emotions and loss and identity towards desperation bring our cop mister bradley on a reimbursement like agenda even though it seems the force coexisting ray liotta has intent on pursuing this situation 100  and its not bad the vocabulary and interaction seems seedy and ridiculous but it wasnt dressed up that way
time passes and the generation of heroics versus crime becomes misinterpreted through more leadershipconsequence and confusions
making this a story that sort of became a sequel in one film
i really enjoyed this movie
i could not pick ryan gosling out of a lineup before i saw this movie but i thought his performance minus the high pitched squealing during robberies was fantastic
his character had a quiet energy and even though he didnt speak all that much i think he was the star performance in the movie
i was sorry to see him die with all that movie left
the other performances were average and the story was ok but gosling really shined in his brief appearance
the story had a sort of domino effect to it with consequence after consequence resulting as effect of the first part of the movie
moderately unique good acting and a decent story
not great but better than most of the movies i see these days 810
derek cianfrance is easily one of most talented young directors today
this picture is so goddamn ambitious i cant even handle it
do all of its aspects work maybe not but they come real close
soundtrack and music out of this world
the best ive heard that utilizes contemporary electronic music like witch house to its advantage
sean bobbit cinematography really really impressive and very memorable
to operate in a spaghetti western changing of the protagonist style is very clever for the time and you dont see it often
the film was just just slightly off point but it was so close to being unbelievable
its third act was most likely its downfall
i liked it but it was way to naturalist after what we had seen previously
still an amazing try at a very contemporary picture for the masses
i cant wait to see what cianfrance does next
what really caught my eye about the place beyond the pines is how the focus shifts as the movie progresses
first its about luke then its about avery lastly its about the sons
moreover in each case you want the focusedon character to achieve his goal even if its something ethically questionable
its as though director derek cianfrance  who previously directed ryan gosling in blue valentine  is playing with the audience much like alfred hitchcock did with psycho which also shifted its focus from character to character getting the audience to root for each character
the result is a very good tense movie one that progresses at just the right pace to let more and more of the story develop
i recommend it
i am going to start out by saying that this film is beautiful in every aspect
the cinematography direction acting and writing are superb
this film is not your average heist movie it is much more than that it is about consequences not only of yourself but to those who surround you this was certainly exposed in a variety of ways
ryan gosling bradley cooper eva mendes dane dehaan and ben mendelsohn were all spectacular
these are the performances we live for
derek cianfrance is one of those directors who you can trust to make it happen captivating audiences with storytelling
place beyond the pines has easily become one of my favorite films of the year
its simplistic non flashy gritty film not regularly found in a heist film is a refresher
it brings you in to the real world of what someone like luke would do how far they would go for their loved ones
this movie was very unique to me
i havent seen any movie play out quite like this one does
the story line is very good with a great twist at the end that everyone will love
although this movie had a good story line the reason i gave it an 8 out of 10 was for the way the movie is written
it has 3 main segments to it that has a new main character but it all comes back around at the end
most movies stay with the same main throughout the film and the way this one takes on almost an entirely different movie between segments is fascinating and even though the movie is long and sometimes drawn out it keeps your interests throughout
i strongly suggest watching this movie you will not regret it
the creativity is superb
when my wife brought home this film with the dippy title i was dreading another teenage horror flick
but i was wrong
if youre tired of all the formula flicks this may be just the right one for you
there have been a number of past films with three or more stories some connected some less so
but this film is to me at least unique in that it follows one protagonist for a time then switches to follow another and finally winds up following still another
all are of course closely connected so you always know youre watching one story unfold as the film progresses
everyone does a good job in the various roles and while the pace is measured the film is always beautifully filmed and keeps you watching trying to guess whats going to happen next
its hard to describe much of this without getting into spoilers and i dont want to do that
some may find the storyline a bit contrived and predictable but on the other hand done differently it probably wouldnt have been so satisfying
a thoroughly enjoyable film
i give it a thumbs up
the story depicts the chronicles intercrossing a motorbike stuntman who chooses robbery to grope his childs happiness with a young promising cops life
director derek cianfrance once again comes stupendously with a depressing family crisis plot likewise his previous blue valentine
ryan gosling makes a stout performance as the motorcycle rider who is desperate to retain his family back
bradley cooper as the cop brilliantly brings his essence to show inner struggles regarding the events
eva mendes ben mendelsohn the two teenkids also put their acting aptitude
the gloomy setting throughout the film with excellent score definitely play a lot with emotions
there isnt a dull moment in this movie
like one reviewer said already this movie has three stories in it each linked with the other
there are some unique and uncommon emotions that are dealt here and this is not a typical heist or crime flick like the storyline might suggest
the first section belongs to the character played by ryan the second section of the movie revolves around the character played by bradley cooper and the third section is about the sons of the above mentioned characters
each of these section is strong and well written and well played out like i mentioned there isnt a dull moment
this is one of those underdog movies that will take you by surprise
top notch performance from ryan gasling bradley cooper dane dehaan and emory cohen
congratulations to the producer and the crew
well done
the place beyond the pines 2013  ryan gosling eva mendes bradley cooper rose byrne harris yulin ray liotta mahershala ali ben mendelsohn robert clohessy bruce greenwood emory cohen dane dehaan
well acted character study with a novelization approach from filmmaker derek cianfrance  who collaborated on the screenplay with ben coccio and darius marder  enables three acts concerning the tapestry of a motorcyclistcum bank robber gosling who teamed with cianfrance previously for blue valentine is excellent after learning a onenight stand mendes acquitting herself nicely too has produced a child to raise a morallychallenged policeman cooper in a wonderful balance of right and wrong with aspirations and consequences beyond his realm and the offspring of the two men years later with echoes of steinbeck and oneill
wellcrafted if a tad too long in structure the film rolls along at a decent pacing with some sublime performances and a great ensemble including the lowkey mendelsohn and a returntoform by liotta as a corrupt cop
dont care if i offend anyone but  the place beyond the pines has to be the most overrated pile of crap this year
it wouldnt have been so bad if they cut out the whole ryan gosling part and just said the father was a scumbag instead you get almost a full hour of that slab of meat mumbling trough the story and chewing up the scenery
bradley cooper is always worth watching and does a fine job here with a limited supporting cast
the sure fire banker in this movie eva mendes  couldnt even give the kiss of life to this 120 minutes of tedium
do yourself s a real favor and watch some paint dry at least you will have something at the end of that
610 on the pigometer
i really wanted to like this film
unfortunately i did not
the acting was truly fantastic
cinematography was brilliant
it might be worth it just for the performances and the filming alone
the story
it could have been great
it should have been great
but it was told so poorly
it was coincidental at best and disjointed at worst
the pacing was dreadful
there is no reason to care what happens to any of these characters
this is not the actors fault
this all falls on the director and i loved blue valentine
you will be better off renting this 8 months from now vs paying for it at the theater
i thought this movie was great
it was basically 3 little mini movies in one
i love the idea of interweaving stories and all of that and this movie kinda did that except in different acts
the leads in this movie were fantastic
gosling and cooper had a great presence on screen and i believed their characters and acting
there were some very cool camera shots in this that i absolutely loved
i especially loved dane dehaan from chronicle
he really played his character well and i cant wait to see what else he makes in the future
i would definitely give this a watch
its got a love story action thrills suspense crime everything all in one movie
it could have been just a little shorter but the movie wraps up nicely and was a great watch
now i want to watch director derek cianfrances blue valentine
