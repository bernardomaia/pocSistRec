not sure whats with the negative reviews but i enjoyed the movie very much
its wellexecuted and the direction was clear and crisp
theres no distinct feelgood actions scenes because the pacing is kept constant throughout and i dont see why theres an issue with the pacing being that way
its hardly flat its just a very honest straight flushed storytelling and it fits the themes that are underscored by the movie
alex murphy is a reluctant hero and hes ultimately a father and a husband whose personal agenda serves as his existential core
i like how these themes are teased out and zoomed in upon throughout the movie
also there are some absolutely delicious production details and cgis that are just absolutely feasts to the eye
not to mention the superb cast and the wonderful performances
i think this is a honest and loyal reboot that will appeal to fans of robocop who fell in love with the story precisely for the moralistic themes it explores
i just dont see why any other recent science fiction movie deserves more respect than this one
the story is fluent the characters are well built everyone has its own motive
yes film is more of a personal struggle journey of the main character and that is what i like
for the fans of action it is also good why when quite often there is it is good one
the effects are quality mastership
the most memorable scene is when murphy sees what he has become
for my regards it has some philosophical connotation to because it also concerns the influence of technology to the society
it clearly shows bads and goods
i recommend watching this movie for
i have watched the original robocop movies
this remake does not come close to any of them
many reviewers here comment to not compare it with the original robocop movies
what kind of nonsense it that
this is not a new and original story
it is a remake
would you not compare the next titanic movie or the next batman superman movies with the previous versions
of course you will
you cant just copy something and say it is not the same as original
if it is supposed to be similar to the original at least they could make this a better movie
but they did not
the whole movie was just about how robocop becomes robocop and gets his revenge
so much for the storyline
that was just the first 5 minutes of the original robocop
bad acting bad special effect
what a waste
a disgrace for robocop
it is a shame to make a mockery of a classic movie
i think this is a totally bad reboot like totall recall
and it was a huge insult to persian people  it show persian like taliban or some other crazy terrorists which is not right
that creepy city wasnt even similar to tehran
i hope this movie get more bad ratings
i mean they didnt even take a time to know what or where is iran
its right that iran has the wrong people as the leader or president or a lots of those politicians that doesnt worth that post but people are not like that and there is no terrorists in iran  at least we wont kill each other in cinema or school
lets look at the movie  if we just see it as an action movie it will be a ok movie with a lot of problems but as a reboot of robocop it was totally awful
this is a disgrace to the original at the time it was a groundbreaking and very shocking film with great actors very original and well done ideas and such an original style to it well this crap is exactly the opposite terrible story line very slow to start i would go as far as saying boring and for the actors in it got to give it to the director the whole film is just all terrible acting the overall very bad crime feel in detroit doesnt come across where are the crazy adverts where is the infamous bad guy and the setup to murphys story
all missing why mess with the story line from the original which was excellent anyway this is nothing short of an epic fail it just manages to scrap 1 star rating as robos hud view is quite cool but that is literally the only good thing i have to say i cant remember the last time i was so disappointed with a film please director dont do any more films a complete waste of what could of been a brilliant opportunity
i really am shocked at how rubbish this was
i had high hopes from the average score here
i was pleased when i heard the original theme tune at the beginning leading me to expect other loyalties to the original
then nothing no loyalties to the original or the comics
however i am good at getting over such things i can treat new remakes as individual films
i have to say though that they just didnt do very well here at all
most of the film was contained to the subject of his development more so his combat mode where by his cyborg side killed so many targets in so many seconds
it seemed to me that they made this film to make video games as that is all the story line seemed to revolve around
i am sorry as i really thought it might have been a good one
how about to study first and then make a movie
in iran people dont dress like arabs iranian people are iranian they are not arabs not that there is anything wrong with them but iranian are different their lives culture food and everything is just different
there are no suicide bombers in iran
we never had one and i hope we never will
how can you make a movie and show a nation like that to people who pay money to watch your stupid film
i am really sorry
how dare
so many people have the wrong idea about iran because of film like this
streets of tehran are nothing like you have shown
its just ridiculous
not watching this trash ever again
you should be ashamed of yourself
i am the original robocop fan not the 3rd movie though and i think the new robocop is really a not bad movie
its has a complex character development that i didnt expect and the story has many twists and turns that you are feeling concern and worry for the main character
the problem is there are many people enjoyused to michael bay and many money crapping hollywood directors bull st that when they are presented with a good movie with good plots good messages and talk about real issue in our society they complain that the movie has too little action or the story is too complicated that it hurts my brain this kind of st talk
and too many people compare this to the original movie with biased and prejudice that make them cannot look past the differences in the interpretation and presentation of robocop
please give this movie a chance
i had to add my 2 cents to the mix this movie sucks
it is so boring i started playing with my phone within 10 minutes
why does hollywood keep putting out this crap
this movie has no suspense like many others have said there is no villain elmer fudd made a better villain
the plot holes are ridiculous
why take the better parts of the movie and trash them and replace with boring no nonsense story line
the original had a way better plot and story this movie is just silly
part of the story that helped you came about the character was he didnt remember his family they thought he was dead
part of the plot was murphy gaining control through out the movie it moved the plot along
the evil corporation is not evil its boring
where is the gritty dirty city that was over run with corruption
pg13 rating really what was the point
depiction of iranians in this movie is almost a bias
i just wonder why directors in the states do the same blunders again and again
is there any conspiracy behind all of these boners to belittle iranians
ok your politicians have problems with ours why you insult our people in your movies and more than that why you insult your audiences by fooling them to watch these images
i lived around 30 years in iran and i witnessed that majority of tourists vising iran just get baffled how iran and iranians are totally different than what was in their imaginations
whats the role of media in aberration of innocent minds with these amusements
im recalling einstein desperately saying technological progress is like an axe in the hands of a pathological criminal
maniacs in both sides are ruining peoples life
dont make it worse than that please
i know some people say dont compare to the original but this is a remake so you have to compare to the original
the original was tongue in cheek violent funny a parody on politics
the new movie just failed on all those things
clichad and characters didnt generate anything
why movie makers agree to these poor remakes is beyond me
watch this if you want to but suggest you do so before the original
original is a far superior movie
like total recall remake again totally missed the tongue in cheek humour that made these such great films in the first place
and apparently i have to add another line to meet requirements for review
there is just no story in there
its so awful beyond believe
we watched it with a group of friends and most of them left the cinema after one hour
there is just no soul in this movie
it does not grab you like the first one
its even worse than the remake of the thing
for some reason all new movies are all about special effects and terrible acting
the stolen oneliners from the first robocop do not even make sense
how in the world could this be released
how long will this go on
all remakes are terrible just terrible
but this movie is by far the worst i have ever seen in my life
even my kid thought it was utterly boring
im off
i hope i can forget this extremely dull movie
it like a cheap episode of some kind of low budget series on tv
terrible really really really terrible
as an iranian i watched the opening part of the movie over and over im really confused here
if the movie tries to criticize the misleading role of the media then why does it contribute to creation of the false media forged impression of iranian people being extremely religious uncivilized poor and so on
do they really not know my people
or do they intentionally want to show them like that
dont they really know that iranian people dont wear arabic clothes and hats like what we see in this movie
dont they know iranian people have never committed a single suicide bombing in the worlds history
im wondering what the point is in degenerating my culture and how most of the movies benefit from this
one wonders why hollywood thinks bland will sell
the verhoeven version was far far better
you might as well have had uwe boll direct this movie as soon as you decided to cripple it with a pg rating and other terrible compromises
there were some reasonable action sequences but on the whole it just didnt flow
it wasnt edgy and therefore will be forgettable
there are a million great unused ideas out there yet hollywood seems to be fascinated with trotting out the violated corpses of achievements past because they are just to frightened these days to have an original thought
strangely despite playing it safe the number of movies that flop seems to be on the rise
not only is this movie sexist and extremely racist
it goes out of its way to establish the idea that united states is the best country the world will ever see
the absurdity of the claims and complete ignorance how history not matching with their fantasy of their history putting aside the movie subtly depicts eastern europeans as terrorists asians as intelligent working slaves of us and black people as all criminals
the protagonist is of course a white heterosexual slim american who has a gorgeous wife that he can have sex with anytime he wants because his wife his head over heels for him a young son who sees his father as a superhero a money crazy antagonist ceo and a side kick black coworker who gets shot in the end
all in all robocop introduces absolutely nothing new on the table and even has the audacity to praise americas chaotic justice on earth to be the future the only thing thats worthwhile seeing in this movie is the spectacular performance of abbie cornish
robocop
what the hell did that have to do with the original
robocop is my favourite film in my top ten of all time
the remake had nothing to do with it at all it was sleek aimed at kids like the disgraceful robocop3
the first was a brilliant take on the ferocious greed of the 80s satirical shocking and brutally honest
violent to the point of making me sick and i was shocked at the way they killed alex murphy taking off his hand and enjoying it and laughing
thats the bit that stuck with me
the new one is a polished repackaged dont open the packet toy compared to the battered millennium falcon you played with as a child
yeah some of us girls liked star wars too
favourite is not a spelling mistake its the english way of spelling it
i just watched the first scenes of the movie which took place in tehran and realized how careless the director was about tehran streets iranians persian speaking and appearance and etc
at least he could do some research or ask an expert about these things to make it more real
i realized that they just made something to sell out ticket
and when the movie ended i became sure that it was not worth watching
did not like it at all
just liked the special effects the colors and lights
and also i liked garry oldman but this movie phew pity
i hope i could see better movies of him
personally i prefer the old version of this movie
i watched paul verhoevens film as soon as it was released and i was impressed by the violence but also by the scripts intelligence
i confess that i was anxious to watch the new version of verhoevens film even because director josa padilha is my compatriot brazilian
however i was disappointed by the weak script the superficiality of the characters and the drastic changes of the original film
you may accuse me of being old fashioned but overcoming a classic lately has been an impossible mission
another example is the classic total recall also by verhoeven

first let me explain that i loved the original version which was advanced and ahead of its time
i cant watch this recent movie without comparing it to the original
the original movie is a cult classic and should have been left alone in my humble opinion
in this robocop universe i got the feeling that robocop wasnt needed as it was for instance in the original movies
in the original version the cops are out maned out gunned and overburdened with bureaucracy and legal tape to fight crime
in this i agree the special effects are awesome but the plot in lacking something substantial in the script
the were so many wasted opportunities in this movie and the right actors were playing the wrong parts
i think they concentrated too much on the special effects that they forgot about telling us a good story
its a really awful remake of the great classic robocup1987
just a waist of 100 million dollars
bad acting  terrible story line and disturbing interrupts of the host of a stupid show
frankly they should give a golden raspberry to it
the worst actor of the the film was the guy who played as raymond sellars he was just moving his hand so much during talking that you would have think he is a weather man
the family of the robocop played so icy and fake
and alex murphy in this film is not the charismatic robocop that we saw in the old movie
in the beginning of the film we see a part in tehran that is not related to the rest of the movie and gives a false impression of persian people like we are born as terrorists
sad to say that we actually turned this off about a half hour in
it was just so boring
the guy they chose to be the new robocop is completely uninteresting
hes so stonefaced with the dead eyes of a shark that the scenes of him trying to relate to his family made me wonder if he wasnt holding them hostage in some fashion
there was no sense of connection to his family his partner or his job if they wanted a machine that could feel they chose the wrong guy
the global police bit had potential but there was no real throughline or reason to care about any of these characters
almost kept watching just because michael keaton is awesome but everything surrounding him in this movie was lifeless and dull
this movie is just one of the worst movies i have ever seen
i could not find an interesting story out of it nothing
the actress is so bad she does not know how to express feelings
when she cry it is obvious it is fake
i hate it so much
the course of the movie is so boring and out of ideas you do not feel exited for the next bit or even for the end of the movie
it kind obvious what is going go and what killed the movie is when he killed the one who planed for his murder
after that i start believing ok that was a fast revenge
they killed the excitement out of the movie
the conspiracy theory in the movie could have been much bigger and more exciting
and lets be honest the guy does not have genitals or even skin how could he have a relationship after all of that that part makes me angry the guy is 90 machine he is not humane anymore
i was part of the generation who remembers those 80s movies that are becoming remade refashioned and rebooted
there was no need to remake evil dead nightmare on elm street or friday the
3th
so i was skeptical and had my mind made up to skip this movie because the original is already a good movie
im glad i didnt skip this one because it does something rare you dont really see in movies it actually entertains and keeps your attention
the story is the same a cop is shot and left for dead then rebuilt into a cyborg law man
i found this to actually stand on its own two feet with some clever special effects and action
joe kinnaman makes robocop human and his performance is compatible to peter weller
in my opinion had there not been an original film made in 1987 this movie would be okay on its own
there are some pokes at todays politicians american credit and consumerism too
this was a fun ride of a movie and before you judge a book by its cover you might be surprised at your self for liking this one
i loved the original and i also loved this one too
the visuals are completely stunning and i think it is an excellent reimagining of the story
it brings loads of new ideas and gives a welcome fresh lease of life adding new dimensions to an already brilliant character
michael keaton abbie cornish gary oldman michael k
williams and jackie earle hayley are all fantastic in this movie
nice to see michael keaton again
the cinematography is truly beautiful and some of the new scenes of robo travelling are are so brilliantly shot they are so pleasing to watch
a massive well done and big congratulations to all that were involved in the production of this movie
peter wellers robo is and will always be superb but joel kinnaman did an amazing job too
i really hope it does well enough so that there can be some sequels
for the older generation the generation wherein i belong we will prefer paul verhoevens robocop
at that time his movie was innovating and fresh
this version isnt bad though and for the generation that never saw the original one they will probably rate it a bit higher than i do
im just not a big fan of remakes unless theyre done way better
and thats rarely the case
joel kinnaman as robocop is okay though
the movie has the right amount of action and drama to keep you entertained
its a good scifi story
a story that you hope will never come through because the last thing we need is robots taking over the already decreasing job market
and robots deciding whats right or wrong isnt a future i want to live in
so this robocop is okay to watch once but if i had to chose i would watch the original instead
well the overall graphics was very awesome but there were a lot of flaws
first it would have been good if the robocop has some catchphrases or a good sense of humour
secondlythe robocop was not seen taking down bad guys and showing how awesome he really is
thirdly there was no actual bad guy that could match him no real villain
fourthly by the time the robocop had hit the streets more then half the movie was already gone and the robocop just had a dull environment surrounding him
the makers could have done better but however the movie still gets a six because there was some cool action
the robocop movie is still a good ones but dont keep your hopes up
compared to some other summer movies they are still above them
i cant understand why amaricans hate irainians
it not being scared but its funny to celebrate the winning of an imaginary war
i cant accept that people who says they are openminded can accept country can make a child a bomber
300argorobocop2014 and etc everywhere you see iranian in a film they are assassin and americans are angel
robots kills citizens but people are happy that the reporter is safe
at the beginning of that
you will see amaricans army captured iran and they kill a boy w ho has a knife and aim it to a iron body whit no warning
whats the aim off all these attacks to other countriesif its for people safetyyou are just killing them so you are the real threat
if you want your own benefit why you kill your own people by sending then to war zone
if you believe in human right you mustnt kill innocent peopleand if you dont believe in that you must not speak about it
the film was not fair at all
unfortunately this rebooted version of the 1980s classic robocop was the exact opposite in every way
in the original the plot and the characters were fantastic but the direction and effects were plagued with the typical 80s garbage that ruined so many potentially great films of that decade
this movie had decent effects and improved acting at least from abbie cornish who delivered a great performance and michael keaton but they ruined what made the plot fantastic
ultimately a great story with terrible acting and effects will always be better than a horrible story with fancy editing
overall i was very disappointed
slickly made remains reasonably faithful to the original story but wrong choices of actors mark it down
samuel jackson as the news caster is so wrongly castand michael keaton just doesnt come across a a billionaire  more an eccentric scientist and the leather clad immaculately made up even when hubby is on his death bedabbie cornish isnt convincing
in fact trouble shooter jackie earle haley is the best cast
it starts of pretty well in iraqor is it iranbut dithers as it moves on
also the special effects considering the excellent effects in the 1987 movie arent that outstanding 27 years later
all in all an entertaining action movie that isnt going to linger in your mind for too long
the movie starts on a strong note with samuel l jackson playing the pr puppet and viewers getting the impression that a large greedy corporation is willing to unleash drones on innocent people for law enforcement you get a good first impression with the shot in tehran
the suspense is well maintained for the first one hour
but then the plot collapses as robocop gets more interested in dissecting his own past and pursue those who have wronged him
i was left wondering if revenge makes a better plot than crime fighting
it is also confusing to keep track of who is dying and who is just getting stunned
i also could not figure out if the ceo was involved in the death of the human robocop
so all in all a pretty average film
i loved all the original robocop movies
all single one of them
if you are like me and compare the remakes with the originals you are not going to like this flick
with so many fx cgi and other endless possibilities of special effects how come the fx from the original movies were much entertaining than these
im not saying that they were better just more appropriated to the movie and to the scenes
someone thought about josa padilha to direct this movie because someone remember the favela storming police attacking scenes from tropa de elite
its reminds you when you watch some action scenes multi targeting and shooting bullets flying sequences
a little disappointing
a weak non original enough remake
ermmm i went to see robocops last saturday and ive really enjoyed the movie
i dont understand whats the whole wining around that
its a different movie a reboot not a remake
get over it
we cannot compare this one with the old one
i really love the old robocop but i also think that the new robocop is a good movie
lacks violence and more blood but its not a kiddy movie
i bet if jose pandilha got to choose to include violence he would that outcome is probably due to some pressures from the studios in order to have a more comercial version
resuming go and see robocop without having to compare with the old one
go and see like it was a new movie
and i wonder if theres anyone here thats brave enough to say that this movie is better than robocop 2 or 3
those yes
are shitty movies
i went to the theater and watched this movie
considering i never watched robocop before because i never really wanted to i decided to give the remake a shot
i fancy the story surrounding his injury was well done
the part of the story of him being built into robocop was outstretched
i think that part could have been cut down a little
the end with the guy of the corporation becoming the villain was not disappointing just perhaps a little misplaced because his character didnt seem like he would shoot the family just like that
i think that could have been done better
the fraction with samuel jackson talking that smack was funny and ridiculous
i gave it a b because the family drama was good the reason for his injury was good the political drama was good but i guess nothing was excellent or just sterling
thanks for reading
ill admit when i first heard about this film being remade i wasnt very thrilled
to be honest i was dreading it to tell the truth
but color me wrong
lol
this version of the title character was a refreshing take on said character
joel kinnaman did a great job as alex murphyrobocop
what really sold this film for me was how much heart it has
the filmmakers never take the audience for granted
you feel alex murphys pain and you sympathize with him
unlike in the 1987 film you dont really find out how his family is affected
in here its the opposite
im very glad the filmmakers did not go over the top with the violence
most importantly i was most appreciative of the time the filmmakers took to establish the characters
thats what will make me want to see this film a second time
i think paul verhoeven would be proud of what the filmmakers did here
i can imagine that the filmmakers will want to consider a sequel at some point
if they stick with the formula that made this film work theyll be just fine
robocop lives
its understandable the first part being slow and steady to give all proper meaning why robocop is being made and then action
but action and chase being done just one way by robocop and shown less was not good as film makers should have devoted more time showing the capabilities of robocop a lot more and i felt it was shown all too fast
loved some thrilling action scenes and good different story
as i am a big robocop indian fan so i will give one extra rating as film makers made the effort to bring him back after so long
so big thanks to them and would highly appreciate the second part very soon as there should be one for more different action to be done by him with more plotting and story with better looks of the robocop suit
the new robocop is a surprisingly good and entertaining scifi action thriller that appeals to the human heart by conveying emotions and the humanity side of murphy the main character who eventually becomes the titled cyborg law enforcer robocop
though the story will take expected turns and even if you know how the movie is going to end robocop is a must watch for some amazing graphics
though once can easily tag this an action or scifi movie one can not neglect emotional aspects of the film
joel kinnaman has played the robocop nicely balancing between human strength and machines emotions
yeah i get it its a reboot of a perfectly good 80s movie that nobody really wanted but its a really good one
though there is no suggestion towards end about robocop2 im sure there will a sequel soon
my rating  7
510
this director has no idea who is robocopall of the new cast has ruined the 1987 unique productioni am so disappointed to see the hero of my childhood movie that i was watching 60 times a month in this remakei wish i was the directori would have done better
the start has no clear story about the cop
big part of the movie especially in the middle of it was very boring
the end of the movie was so bad
you get out of the theatre feeling something was very missingsomething wasnt right
the movie will be making a very good profit for sure only because of its name and people got tricked thinking they are going to watch an interesting entertaining remake
also most of the people that they are going to watch it are the fans of the original movie and they will for sure be very disappointed
be sure all of the good reviews are from people that do not know who is peter weller and have not seen the great performance in the original robocop
not only the performance but the directing skills and the scenes sequence
the bottom line this remake needs a remake
i had low expectations for this reboot however i was pleasantly surprised
it has a strong cast full of talent
michael keaton gary oldman jackie earle haley and michael kenneth williams all have good to great moments in the film
the action is entertaining and the plot is easy to follow
the major hole in this movie is robocops back story
the movie is about a man that is being stripped of his emotion yet the director does little to establish why he is connected to his family
overall it is a good rainy day watch
i would watch a sequel if it came out
i do not agree with the harsh reviews i read on this site
true it does not have the grit and noir feel of the original however it is no worse than robocops iii

true it does not have the grit and noir feel of the original however it is no worse than robocops iii
this movie is the quintessential shoot em up of the modern age with a hefty dose of stealthy reversemoralizing
strong rightwing news style pathos and false intellectualism is interspersed with patriotic fervor in the news segments given by novak samuel l
jackson
this is that reversemoralizing i was talking about  a carefully crafted anti drone movie
this movie is the logical extension of the use of warfare drones abroad making it onto the streets of america
the case made against corporate corruption and graft interwoven with ineffectual or pocket politicians is strong here
but if youre just looking for a shoot em up  this should work well for you
and if that isnt enough at the very end we get to watch samuel l
jackson screaming bleeped out obscenities at the camera
all in all the perfect end to a movie like this
damn good movie cant understand how viewers give 1 star and beat it up
dont listen to them i watched robo 10 times and the remake follows true to the original story
a remake isnt supposed to be a exact remake where is the fun in that
in some ways its better than original
i feel this version is more dark and mysterious than its predecessor
acting and effects are great joel kinnaman plays the part so good
his version of murphy is smarter and more emotional than original murphy
also how can you go wrong with cast including gary oldman michael keaton and samuel jackson
ive seen new version couple times and plan on watching many more
give it a chance your next scifi saturday night movie
