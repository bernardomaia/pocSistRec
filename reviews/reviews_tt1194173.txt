"\nI have never written a review here, but I felt compelled to actually\nstep up and defend this movie.<br><br>The Bourne Legacy was everything I expected it to be. It couldn't be\ntoo close to the previous Bourne films, but had to be close enough to\nlet us know a storm is coming.<br><br>Bourne's presence throughout the film is what spins this story into\naction and I felt it was balanced perfectly. We all want Bourne, but\nthis is Aaron Cross's story. Renner and Weisz were great, but I think\nthe scripting has been derided by many as terrible. I had no issues\nwith anything and even felt compelled by Renner's character motivation.\nThis was someone yearning to be more, not someone who was already\nbetter than everyone else, but just couldn't remember.<br><br>Let's cross our fingers and hope we all get what we want and pair\nBourne and Cross in the next film.<br><br>There is so much more going on than just Jason Bourne and if we don't\nget to explore that then the franchise will be poorer for it!\n"
"\nOuch. I wish Greengrass directed this film, because to me it felt like\na mess. Had a good idea with a solid backing, but it failed to take\nadvantage of it. I like that they intertwined the story within the\nUltimatum storyline like you see in the preview as well as playing\nhomage to the original series, but the execution sucked not to mention\nthat the Bourne events had no influence on Cross' character - something\nthat \"Legacy\" would suggest. The storytelling felt disjointed, and the\naction sequences had way too much camera shake to enjoy them (the first\ntrilogy wasn't so bad). Other than Manila, and the solitude of Alaska,\nlocation is one trademark of the legacy that just wasn't there. In the\nfirst three films, the assassins didn't need to speak to have\npersonality and character - this film's assassin was just a ghost in\nyour memory.<br><br>Even though not directly stated, I think most people would understand\nby watching this film what MAY have actually happened to Jason Bourne.\nThe only way this film will have any more meaning is if they continue\nthe new trilogy.\n"
"\nGreat cast. Great acting. However, The entire film feels like the\nbeginning to a movie. You keep telling yourself, 'wow, the intro was\nlong now the movies really starting..oh nevermind'. ::Spoilers:: The\nentire goal of the protagonist is to acquire more of his regimented\nmedicine. The goal of his enemies is to kill him. There is no trying to\nget back at the CIA, no typical Bourne stuff. The Bourne series was\nunnecessarily reused and they really should have just started off\nfresher. Scenes were drawn out, there were only about 2 clever plays\nmade, and the main enemy never meets the prot. It's all very separated\nand remote. No connections are formed and we are not given the hope\nthat he seeks to solve the issues at hand. They also completely write\noff Bourne.. wouldn't he know Pamela gets framed and that the overhead\nis still controlling black ops groups? A lot of things were not well\nthought out for this movie and it was entertaining but disappointing.\n"
"\nI can't understand the negativity some people feel for this film. Its a\nreally exiting story, The cast are great, the stuntwork is great and I\nwant to see more films with these characters.<br><br>That is pretty much all I wanted to say but I suppose I have to say\nsomething else to meet the minimum ten lines.<br><br>OK Keremy Renner is a great new lead. I may actually prefer him to Matt\nDamon already and if he does another one I think that'll be a\ncertainty. He is more expressive than Damon, more convincing\nphysically, more likable.<br><br>Rachel Weisz is the only lead female in this films I even care about.\nShe can act! More than can be said about Damon's girlfriend or wife or\nwhatever it was that got killed at the earliest opportunity in the\nsecond film of the series. Certainly better than Julia \" I look 12\"\nStyles as a tacked on vapid love interest.<br><br>Norton was underused that is true,Keach was too. Why Scott Glenn was in\nthis I have no idea. He looks like the living dead and can barely\nspeak.<br><br>Motorbike chase was epic. I want a sequel.\n"
"\nI was really skeptical going in, but having seen it, I have to say it\nwas frigging AWESOME! Loved every second of it! SO worth the money!\nFinally something taking Bourne back in business! Bourne Ultimatum was\njust OK because of the constant stupid camera shaking that just made me\nmad so I did not enjoy that movie. The camera shaking was just too\nmuch. It made it very hard to follow the movie. This one tho was just\nsmooth and cool! Well done Tony! Having said that I would have liked\nthat Matt would have made at least a cameo Its sad and unprofessional\nfor Matt do take a stance like that. \"I will only do Bourne with Paul\"\nWhat are you twelve?\". Matt you are the coolest guy on earth, but Tony\nmade a better Bourne then Paul did with the last two.<br><br>I really hope Renner and Damon will be in the next Bourne and Tony\nGilroy directing!\n"
"\nThanks to the 2 heroes, I give a good mark though the script was a\nlabyrinth of complications between different US National Security\nServices and their different projects more or less secret, some of them\nmore secret within secrets because untellable, unacceptable. And when\none of those has to disappear, lots of dead people it means. Here is\nthe story of another run-for-his-life hero, Jeremy Renner! He surprised\nme this actor. He blows the screen from his very first appearance until\nthe last. And Mrs Weisz, the co-runner-for-her-life does well too as an\nevolving character, a woman scientist who goes from naive close to\nstupid terrified victim to a full grown resilient survivor, doing very\nwell with Mr Renner. Wow they are good! They SAVE the movie Let's hope\nthere will be a sequel with these two but with a MUCH IMPROVED script,\nplease. I declare myself a fan for Mr Renner (Please forgive my\nprobably curious use of English, my second language...)\n"
"\nSo I've taken enough theater classes to know that a movie should have\na, Plot, Climax, and a ENDING.<br><br>This movie has NONE of those. I'm a huge Bourne fan and was anxious to\nsee the Jeremy Renner try to take on the new role of the hero in this\nmovie. The acting in this movie was good, but the writers stunk! There\nwas NO PLOT, no CLIMAX, and NO ENDING. It was a huge disappointment to\nme and I would not recommend wasting your time or money on it. Although\nif you like movies that are two hours long with NOTHING going on in\nthem, then this might be the one for you. Another thing that upset me\nwas that Aron Cross seemed to have a small goal or no goal at all in\nthe ENTIRE movie! I'm not sure who directed this movie but they did an\nEXTREMELY poor job.\n"
"\nI really love theses kind of films where you have the agent running\naround like he's a fugitive wanted by the government so I was really\nexcited going into this movie<br><br>When I saw Bourne Legacy last month, I have to say a great film. Aaron\nCross is much better than Jason Bourne in my opinion. The casting were\nalso good. Jeremy Renner fitted the main role verywell and Rachel Weisz\nwas also great as a female supporting role. I hope that they both will\nstar again in the next sequel and the franchise in my opinion has\nfinally found their right replacement for Matt Damon<br><br>Lets hope that in the future, both Renner and Damon agree to team up\nand put a stop to the program once and for all\n"
"\nI had dragged my feet on seeing this film due to lukewarm reviews, but\nI was pleasantly surprised. The Bourne Legacy is much better than the\nprevious installment in the series, although die-hard fans might be\ndisappointed over the absence of Matt Damon and the relegation of\nsupporting characters played by David Strathairn and Joan Allen (and\nothers) to mere cameo appearances. However, the principal performers in\nthis film (Jeremy Renner, Rachel Weisz, and Edward Norton) infuse the\nfranchise with a welcome rush of new energy and considerable on-screen\ncharisma. The locations look great, and the action sequences are\ngenuinely exciting and impressive. The film begins somewhat slowly, but\nthis results in a degree of characterization that helps us invest in\nthe well-being of the hero and heroine, and the pace definitely picks\nup in the second half. The open-ended nature of the conclusion seems\ndesigned as a brief pause before a sequel; while the lack of narrative\nclosure will be frustrating for some viewers, I can hardly wait to see\nmore of these characters from these filmmakers.\n"
"\nWho is the sixth Alcom agent? Three were eliminated by additional\nvitamins and one had a missile shoved up his @$$. Leaving Cross and a\nmystery unaccounted for Alcom agent. Unless.. they lost count. Honestly\nthis didn't seem like a Bourne type story. Sure it had 'on the run'\ndrama like the others. But it felt more on the line like a junkie\ntrying to get their fix. 'Where are the chems?', 'You got any chems?'.\nDrugs, need drugs now!! Hahaha! Well my idea is the use of superweed.\nWhere the agents aren't so wired up and freaking out.<br><br>In all, I liked the way they pitted different agents from other\nprograms. Kind of like a secret agent UFC event. Alcom vs. Treadstone\nor Larx vs. Alcom. Who is the baddest of the bad? Instead of a caged\noctagon, the world is the ring. No rules, no submissions, no timed\nrounds, only winner is the one who walks, limps, crawls away alive with\nthe hot babe. Good stuff!!\n"
"\nWhat's this film got to do with Bourne? Not much, that's for sure.\nThere are some flashbacks to the previous films, some hints of a\nrelationship, but those are more confusing than helpful. The fourth\npart of the trilogy is almost like trying to attach a second tail to a\ndog. Or fifth wheel to a car. Or a... You get the point. Without the\nBourne name, it would have been yet another action thriller, the same\nas everything else. The plot is straightforward, get item A, go to\npoint B, fight bad guy C.<br><br>But does this make it a bad film then? Not really. It's still enjoyable\nentertainment for a night out in cinemas. The main actors are great,\nthings are happening, the pace is solid and entertainment wise you have\nno been short-changed. There is enough action and tension in the film,\nnot the least in how the secret government agency goes forth in its\ninformation gathering activities. The chase scene towards the end is a\nbit uninspired though - except for the very final part. Go watch it,\nbut don't expect it to be as good as the first Bourne film.\n"
"\nI happen to like the Bourne stories written by Eric van Lustbader, just\nas much as the original ones by Robert Ludlum, so I did not watch this\nmovie with the prejudice some might have. In interviews of Jeremy\nRenner, he explained what Gilroy got him to do in the frigid\nenvironment. It sealed it for me; anyone willing to go that extra mile\nfor a part (probably risking life) deserved to have his performance\nviewed. Granted, Damon IS Bourne; but Renner does not play Bourne, he\nplays Aaron Cross.<br><br>It's obvious Tony Gilroy knows his favourite character and does superb\nwork with action movies. I suspect there will be yet another sequel,\nLustbader wrote several, and if the ratings are still good, I'll go see\nit. I liked Rachel Weisz in this movie, I can't think of a performance\nby her I didn't like. I recommend it.\n"
"\nI have watched about 20 movies in 2012, this one is the best so far.\nMany negative comments were posted mostly from the fans of Bourne\nmovies, however I did not watch any Bourne movies because I did not\nlike their movie trailers. So, I can express my opinion without any\nprior attachment. This movie trailer though was surprisingly right on\nthe money. It has great actors, great ideas and great script, it has\naction, love and suspense. I can not understand why the score of this\nmovie is less than the score of Prometheus. This movie is a lot better\nthan total recall 2012, expendables 2, avengers, amazing spider man,\nmen in black 3, etc.\n"
"\nI have found the movie a bit slow compared to the previous trilogy and\nit seemed to me that there is like 30 min lacking as no action to\npunish the program's directors has been taken. Some parts of the movie\nare very slow and does not fit well with the constant action that we\nhave grown accustomed to when Greengrass was at the helm. I think the\nproducers should have in mind when tackling Bourne's movies that it is\ndirectly competing with James Bond, hence a bit more work is required.\nThe fighting scenes are really good although the villain's character is\nrather unimpressive save for his motorbike riding skills. Jeremy Rinner\nis an excellent replacement for Matt Damon.<br><br>One excellent thing about the movie is that it deals with mind control\nand various experiments that may (or may have not) been taken at\nvarious intelligence agencies about this. I think it deals with that\nsubject in a better way than the Manchurian candidate.\n"
"\nJeremy Renner is having an amazing year. With Mission Impossible Ghost\nProtocol, The Avengers and now effortlessly replacing Matt Damon as the\nlead in the Bourne series. Renner excels in them all. He is a better\nscreen fighter than Damon and much more engaging. To be honest I always\nfound Matt Damon's acting style a little \"dry\" for my taste.<br><br>The rest of the cast are all good with special mention of Rachel Weis\nas the Dr who becomes entangled in the deadly world of espionage.<br><br>Also for the first time since Identity you can see what is going on in\nthe action sequences, with the climactic motorbike scenes captivating.<br><br>Hopefully Renner, Weis and director Gilroy will return for another\ninstalment. Personally I can't wait.\n"
"\nI did not see any of the Bourne Movies prior to going into the theater\nand therefore did not know what to expect. BUT decided to give it a\nchance since one of my favorite actresses (Rachel Weisz) was among the\ncasting. I was impressed! I loved the action, the heart pounding chase\nscenes, the great story line of wanting to break free and develop a\nmind of your own kind of thing. After finishing this film I couldn't\nwait to get home and see the previous Bourne movies and now have become\na fan of the entire franchise. I thought the movie delivered from the\ndialogue to the action absolutely loved it!\nwww.kombinationkoutureco.com\n"
"\nPrepare for a short to the point review<br><br>Jeremy and Rachel seriously saved this movie from being awful. It's not\nso often you get to see a movie completely saved by the pure raw talent\nof its actors, who take your focus away from the fact that this movie\nis poorly written.<br><br>The action was mediocre at best, and this movie did not feel at all\nlike a Bourne film, nor did it feel like it had any connection\nwhatsoever to the first 3 films, except a photo of Jason Bourne flashed\non TV at some point.<br><br>This could have been so much better.\n"
"\nKinda slow and scattered in the uptake, and a couple \"yeah, right\"\naction elements, but they also kept from become cliché while pivoting\nthe franchise in an interesting direction. Looking forward to the next\none.<br><br>As with the previous movies in the Bourne series, I found myself asking\nwhether 'they can really do that'. In this case, though 'that' is more\nthan shady government organizations tracking and spying on people by\nquickly gathering a parsing audio / video / photographic data. No, in\nthis case, you'll be wondering whether scientists, and the governments\nthat fund them, will ever be able to do some things that are a bit more\npersonal in nature.<br><br>I'm already wondering if, in some ways, The Bourne Legacy is already\nour own.\n"
"\nAt the beginning of the movie I was a little lost when they referred to\nterms from previous movies in the Bourne series. I didn't know how much\nI was supposed to remember from those movies in order to enjoy this\none.<br><br>Turns out, very little. The main reason I was lost was because the plot\nwas not fully explained until later in the movie. If you don't like to\nbe temporarily lost, then read the rest of this paragraph for a hint on\nwhat's going on. Turns out the government is performing drug\nexperiments on live human subjects.<br><br>Most of the thrills of this movie come from the escapes and chases. And\nmost of those scenes are pretty good. However, there are too many cuts\nin the motorcycle chases, making them look dizzying and fake.<br><br>This movie can actually just stand on its own since it is not really\nrelated to the previous Bourne series. The \"Bourne\" name is used just\nfor marketing reason.\n"
"\nAs a breakout role for Mr Renner this movie is it,as an actioner,this\nmovie is the business-it burns the house down,blows the car up and then\nmoves faster than a speeding bullet through the plot in spectacular\nlocations.<br><br>The use of modern weaponry demonstrates that the legacy of Treadstone\nand it's latest model Alex usher in a new era of supersoldier.<br><br>Edward Nortons icy ruthless CIA character pits his intelligence against\nthe guts and true grit of a warrior /science experiment combo that\nbreaks out of the lab and goes into evasive action.<br><br>Cast your mind back affectionately to the original Bourne and this\nmovie has a different feel but manages to achieve originality with the\nrich plot line,locations,casting and directing that makes a good movie\nrewarding viewing.\n"
"\nI like to applaud Hollywood when they make a movie we can all enjoy.\nOur 12-year old is now \"hooked\" and wants to view the previous\n\"Bournes\".<br><br>The two main actors, Jeremy Runner and Rachel Weisz were excellent and\nshared the kind of chemistry that draws you in the minute they're on\nscreen together.<br><br>Story line was intriguing and the suspense built well with\nwell-photographed backdrops of Alaska and Manila, Phillippnes.<br><br>Supporting cast was just okay, with Edward Norton \"way too wimpy\" for\nhis powerful position. The fabulous actor, Albert Finney, had the\nsmallest cameo imaginable, and expected the film would make more of his\npresence. The same could be said about Joan Allen, who is also an\nexceptional actress, but hardly present. <br><br>The ending was perfect and definitely hinted at sequels where I hope\nsupporting cast will have the chance to shine. <br><br>We loved Matt Damon in the previous \"Bournes\", but think Jeremy Runner\nwas his equal!\n"
"\nUnlike some, I do really enjoyed this Renner/Bourne flic!<br><br>There are few flaws in this movie, and on the whole it is a delightful\nromp!<br><br>Rachel Weisz as the heroine, Jeremy Renner as Aaron Cross, the main\ncharacter, and Edward Norton as the opposition, is a powerful mix.<br><br>Really nice movie for us who love action movies. Enjoyed every minute\nof it, from the very first scene, to the last!<br><br>Amazing action by Rachel, and as good by Jeremy, and the wolves are not\nbad either!<br><br>A fresh approach to action movies, drastically different from the\nprevious Bourne flics, but they are too favourites of mine!\n"
"\nTaut, suspenseful, edge of seat...engaging...great\nacting...unpredictable...well directed...<br><br>This movie fills the bill for every Jason Bourne movie. It is almost as\nif some of the other user negative reviews are bitching because it\ndoesn't have Matt Damon in it. Really? Legacy continues the great\nseries without missing a beat and fulfills and expands the story line\nbeyond everything we have come to expect from previous Bournes.<br><br>Characters are completely engaging, and the plot is very credible. I am\nnever left feeling like any aspect is overblown or silly, the way so\nmany spy movies are. This is a rarity among movies, and one that should\nbe admired and respected.\n"
"\nThe lengths a man would go to get his drugs. Movie started out great,\nsimilar to the original Bourne trilogy. Good action and chase scenes.\nCasting of Jeremy Renner and Rachel Weisz were spot on. I'm a fan of\nRachel Weisz and plan on watching most of her films. Only gripe I have\nwith this film is the storyline. Renner's character, Aaron Cross, wants\nto stay alive and tracks down Weisz just to save his own behind. But he\ndoesn't want to just live, he wants to live with all of his\nenhancements by way of his medications. It's best explained with the\nbackstory of Aaron Cross. Before the super-soldier Outcome program, he\nhad an IQ of like 5 and as a result of the program and the medication\nhe takes, his IQ is significantly better. He runs out of his medication\nwhile he's out in the field training and to prevent himself from\nbecoming stupid again, he goes to great lengths to track down more\nmeds. In the process, he saves Weisz' life. The end. Great story...\nGood action flick for my dad who doesn't really understand complex plot\nlines and enjoys pure action.\n"
"\nI thoroughly enjoyed this movie! I loved the acting by all of the major\ncharacters, and the plot kept me interested. I felt that Mr Renner kept\nup the tradition of Mr Damon as the main protagonist. Ms Weise also\nmade a good \"love interest\" / costar.<br><br>The action sequences kept me on the edge of my seat. The movie had me\ninstantly checking for a sequel, as I had not heard of the film before.<br><br>I admit that I missed the first 15 minutes, but when I saw it in my\ncable guide, I immediately went to the film because of my love for the\nfirst 3 movies and the Ludlum books as well.<br><br>I would definitely recommend this film to all of my \"Action/Thriller\nGenre\" friends.\n"
"\nlet us just start with the fact that you can't compare it with the\nBourne trilogy .i know that most of Jason Bourne fans got disappointed\nwhen Matt Damon said that he won't be a part of what you may call the\nfourth installment of the franchises. you may have easily noticed that\nAaron cross(Jeremy renner) has this common factor with Jason\nBourne(Matt Damon) \"an agent vs an agency\" but the story takes\ndifferent turn here and just to be direct and clear i watched the\nentire Bourne trilogy and comparing this story with Bourne's story\ndoesn't do any favor for this movie. Jeremy renner does a very good job\nalso Rachel weisz ,great potentials and they did what it take to make\nthe Bourne legacy a good movie . as for the writing it didn't meet my\nexpectations as i thought the writers will put as much effort as they\ncan to make this movie a hit with the consideration that it didn't have\nthe original cast.All i can say that it's not as bad as some people\nclaim . the Bourne legacy was a good movie and i liked it .\n"
"\nBourne series is all about one guy, Matt Damon. Nevertheless Jeremy\nRenner is another bad ass and I understand they got a different story\nline in here. I got excited watching this film cos the chasing scenes\nwas shot in my beloved country(Pinas). I like the concept of getting\nAaron and the Doctor survived in this movie. I think Bourne Ultimatum\nis the last series but they tried to expand the series so there what\nhappens, the Legacy. Much more different now especially the cast but\nalmost the same story line. Chasing everywhere and in the end they\nwon't be able to catch simply because it is a BOURNE movie. Still a\ngreat movie but Bourne is always Matt Damon. Cheers to the great actors\nit did make the film a little interesting to watch even your not a\nBourne fan.\n"
"\nThe Bourne Legacy is an action film with a difference of a normal\nsingle fault, which has three great action film, part of a series from\nthe fact that the signature. The audience from time to time with\nunnecessary dialogs occasionally suffocates the movie manages to\nexperience the exciting times. However, the rest of the series as the\naffectation of his own films, this fourth ring, Greengrass and Damon\nwould be lying if I said I did not call Damon. Matt pair candlesticks,\naction fiction, everything was superb, but at least a few on the stage\nBourne could see. Film to considering separately not bad, but using the\nname of the bourne so I tried to make a premium compared. Bourne them\nhit the bottom of the trilogy, as well as the action is also a\nfantastic part of the screenplay and acting only a certain portion of\nthe film and gave most of the action sequences in the first three\nfilms. I've seen it say it's not a search of dejavu but different\nplayers really watched. Beautiful, bored in a movie that will be\nfollowed. End of film is a little more fuller, but still not bad.\n"
"\nNow I'm a massive fan of the 'Bourne series of films, part one I\nthought was rather average but the following two episodes were top\nnotch, hard assed intelligent thrillers, the films that shaped the\nlater day Bond movies (Casino Royale etc)<br><br>So when I read that there was to be a forth film in the series, without\nMatt Damon and Director Paul Greengrass, I had incredibly low\nexpectations, but I'm pleased to say this another gritty, intelligent\nfilm, Jeremy Renner (Hurt Locker, The Avengers, The Town) is excellent\nas you would expect, the movie zips along at a fine pace, I've got to\nadmit that the final 'chase scene' was rather bloated, but this doesn't\ndetract from what a fine entertaining thriller this is.\n"
"\nI started to see this movie not because of the IMDb scoring but for the\ntrailer, which was interesting.<br><br>The action was quite good, I had many moments of joy watching the movie\nand the story lines up good.<br><br>If this is a movie on IMDb under 7 and Skyfall with the worst\nscreenplay ever for James Bond is over 8, I start do doubt the scoring.<br><br>The actors got in their roles well and the action was good balanced, I\nfound the scene with the motorbikes quite boring because was too long\nand as a constant rider I could tell that normally one cannot do all\nthat.<br><br>I really give my whole 10 points to this .. and I am not an easy giver.\n"
"\nI felt bad for Jeremy Renner and Rachael Wiez because they did a great\njob acting in this movie and I feel they won't get the recognition they\ndeserved because the story was lacking. <br><br>Basically, there really wasn't an a strong point to the story. There\nwas nothing that inspired me about this movie. The main character\nwasn't trying to get back at the organization, or make the world a\nbetter place in any way, he was just trying to survive. Same with the\ngirl.<br><br>That being said, the acting WAS great. The main actors had great\nchemistry and Jeremy Renner was gorgeous as usual. I really felt a\nconnection to them and found myself on the edge of my seat (rare for\nme) rooting for them. <br><br>I watched it twice in the theatures (one of them was free for me) and I\nwill probably watch it again when it comes out on blue ray just because\nI love the characters.\n"
"\nThe story concerns an agent after the massive fallout created by Jason\nBourne's revelations. It has an impressive cast who are quite\nconvincing in their respective roles.<br><br>The story, even though related to the trilogy, did not have the\nstrength and the thrilling pace that made the series so popular. The\ntrilogy had Jason Bourne fight his way throughout the world and at the\nsame time come to terms with his own muddled past. There was also a\nfitting end to his story but the new one turned out to be a bit\npredictable. I did however feel that the story was faithful to Robert\nLudlum's style.<br><br>It does benefit from very strong performances by the lead stars. Jeremy\nRenner is very convincing and looks very impressive in the action\nsequences, as does Rachel Weisz. The movie also benefits from the\ncamera-work, compared to the shaky camera in the Greengrass movies.<br><br>I would say 7/10 for good action scenes and great performances by the\nleads.\n"
"\nI commend the whole of this installment of the Bourne series having\ngood storyline, good computer generated effects, and good\ncinematography.<br><br>Jeremy Renner, as the main character of the story, portrayed his role\nwell and is simply amazing. He did a very great job, and I consider the\nscene from Manila the best. The sound mixing and the cinematography was\nquite good to raise the tension on the part of the audience. Also, the\nscenes were good enough to balance the action-packed and the non-static\npart.<br><br>I also have appreciated the mixing of 26 tracks which are listed that\ncovered a total of almost 64 minutes. It has contributed a lot in\nmaking the action scenes more intense and flabbergasting.<br><br>However, I believe the storyline was not that substantial. They focused\nmore of the screen portrayals, visual effects, and camera tricks rather\nthan focusing on the most important part of a movie.<br><br>Overall, I like the total package, but wasn't sufficient enough.\n"
"\nI guess it does make sense, Jason Bourne could not have been the only\none, there where many. With Matt Damon gone from the role, the studio\ndecided to write a new character, who was part of the same program has\nJason Bourne, and put him in a similar predicament.<br><br>Now action scenes do not disappoint, and Jeremy Renner is a perfect\nchoice to replace Matt Damon, Renner has proved to be good actor, has\nwell as a awesome action star, and is solid in the role, so is Rachel\nWeisz has the doctor he is helping. And Edward Norton and Stacy Keach\nare also solid in there roles has head of the agency that is hunting\nthem.<br><br>The problem here is, that it focus's more on the agency and the people\nhunting them, then on it's main star, like Jeremy Renner is co starring\nin his own movie. It makes to many reference to Jason Bourne, to the\npoint I was wondering when he was gonna pop up. Although not terrible\nbut not has memorable has the other Bourne films.\n"
"\nYes it isn't Matt Damon, that's right. It's an attempt to prolong an\nexcellent series. Okay so let's watch the movie. I scanned the reviews\nbefore I saw the movie and went in thinking I'd be disappointed. After\nthe bloated Dark Night, and the slightly less bloated Total Recall I\nexpected to be checking my watch 90 minutes in as I did with those\nofferings, but when Bourne 4 ended I felt disappointed that it was\nending. It is very fast moving, the action is excellent, the script is\na brave attempt to weave the previous films into a new take on the\nseries and I didn't find it poor, clichéd or in any way offensive. <br><br>The acting was very good except for one scene where Rachel Weiz went\ndistractingly over the top but she was otherwise so good that that was\neasily forgiven.<br><br>What's wrong with the movie? I couldn't tell you. It went past like a\nfreight train, was very entertaining and what else can you ask for?\n"
"\nI was shocked to see some negative comments here about Bourne Legacy\nafter being fond of the first three. Many of them were\nbasically..different character therefore the film is no good. I find\nthis attitude confusing. Obviously there were others agents or assets\nin the CIA and their stories might echo or entwine or be influenced by\nJason Bourne's. <br><br>Having got this out of the way The Bourne Legacy was rather enjoyable.<br><br>Jeremy Rener is a good replacement for Matt Damon and he does the\nrequired heroics ,stunts and romancing in fine style.<br><br>Tony Gilroy once again writes and makes a good directing debut. The\nmotorcycle chase in Manila is unforgettable.\n"
"\nA very good first outing for Aaron Cross. It's a perfect extension to\nthe Bourne films with strong acting and a good pace which neatly and\nintelligently interweaves with the Bourne Ultimatum to deliver a good\nplot, script and action. <br><br>For all the reviewers that slam this film clearly you haven't seen the\ndark knight rises.. that is a perfect example of poor characters,\nsecond rate acting, ridiculous plot and dire-plodding pace.<br><br>Put Jason Bourne to the back of your mind and make room for Aaron Cross\nbefore you're to quick to judge.<br><br>Great Film!!!\n"
"\nIgnore the damon obsessives who spend all their time posting fake\nnegative reviews of this movie. The Bourne Legacy is superior to 90% of\nmodern action movies and better than much of Damon's Bourne trilogy.\nThere are several reasons for this: Jeremy Renner is a better actor\nthan Matt damon, rachel Wise is a much better actress than Julia Stiles\nor famka whoever, but most importantly Tony Gilroy has an overall\nvision for this franchise which is second to none. He knows exactly\nwhere this series is going and how to get it there.<br><br>his direction of the action scenes is better than Greengrass' too- at\nleast on a par with Doug Liman's. Better editing, better framing, less\nshakycam. he also gives Cross intelligent, resourceful, capable and\nmotivated opponents unlike braindead filler like the Expendables 2\nwhich provides its has been heroes with vast armies of dead meat to\nslaughter carelessly. Love this film, buying the DVD, waiting for\nBourne 5\n"
"\nI love this movie. It is incredibly suspenseful. The opening minutes\nare confusing but they serve as a great introduction to Jeremy Renner's\nnew character Aaron Cross. We are reminded of the ending to the\nprevious film in the series. <br><br>Things are aided by the introduction of Rachel Weisz. Her character is\nmenaced early on, only to be assisted by Cross. Renner and Cross give\nexceptional performances and support from Ed Norton, Stacy Keach and\nthe rest of the cast.<br><br>The writer and director Tony Gilroy does a fantastically assured job,\nratcheting up the tension to almost unbearable levels in places. The\nclimax of the movie is a stunning chase sequence which took my breath\naway.\n"
"\nThis movie rocks because of the sci-fi twist and is packed with action\nand romance. To boot, I got some good laugh-out loud moments. Pure\nenjoyment for a guy who has to be in love or have an adventure to be\nhappy. lol. The movie visits several locations and gives one a feel of\na man that is larger-than life. Go for entertainment and you will not\nbe disappointed. The subplots are a bit difficult to follow, but\noverall one does not need to have read the books to understand or enjoy\nthis movie. The book is always different than the movie. Both are\nunique, yet follow the the same themes. For example, the main\ncharacters are, well, according to Robert Ludlum not playing with a\nfull deck of cards. In the movie, love conquers all.\n"
"\nA pathetic attempt to revive one of the greatest spy movie series, The\nBourne Series, The Bourne Legacy fails dishearteningly to revive and\ncapture the thrill, drama and excitement of Jason Bourne travelling,\nhunted and hunting around the globe.....a hard-hitting black ops task-\nforce suddenly and inadvertently turns into a viral infection movie\nportrayed in a disgusting script, horrible sequences, hilarious\nbackground music and pathetic action melodrama. The tension, thrill,\nexcitement and excellent action sequences of the earlier Bourne movies\nwas all-tops-down lost in this new reboot. Aaron Cash never looked\ndeadly or an important CIA spy went wrong and the antagonist, LARX 3,\nthough was introduced at a top notch killing machine ultimately turned\ninto a comic punk kid in the way. I, personally being a huge fan of\nboth Matt Damon and Jeremy Renner, unbiasedly will give Matt Damon the\ndefinite edge.....one thing has been very clear from the movie that\nAaron Cash is no Jason Bourne and Tony Gilroy is no Paul\nGreengrass......What the hell was Tony Gilroy thinking????\n"
"\nIt might have received some patchy reviews at the time it premiered in\nthe Box Office and Jeremy Renner as Aaron Cross might be lacking Matt\nDamon's Jason Bourne instalment in the series of Bourne trilogy while\nBourne scriptwriter Tony Gilroy chooses to carry the can alone, directs\nin place of Paul Greengrass. Generally, the film plot got off with a\nsuicidal and messy start and was considered to be hard to follow but\nthen things really started to pick up smoothly as Renner delivers an\nexcellent performance as he searches the truth about himself while\ndodging bullets and explosives from the corrupt organisations he worked\nfor. There are some good levels of action here with stunts and getaway\nscenes and that's perhaps the good thing I can say about the Bourne\ntrilogy of films.\n"
"\nBeing intrigued and entertained enough from the Bourne Trilogy (and\nhaving bought the 'completed' set) I was a bit put off by the\nintroduction of another 'Bourne' movie, presuming it to be a lame\nattempt to capitalize more on the franchise. So much that I didn't\nbother to watch it - till now. I must say that I found everything about\nthis movie unexpected. The integration of this story with snippets of\nthe original (Ultimatum) was very well done. There is one thing I find\nin many movies, though, to be disappointing, believability. Its the\nsubtle things that a person may or may not do that makes a story\nconvincing. That the fine, technical details are NOT over-explained (to\nassure the watcher 'gets it') is laudable (I love looking details up\nlater on a subsequent viewing). When a filmmaker takes the effort to\nadd those little subtleties to a movie, I take special notice, and\nLegacy is full of them. (One of the things I loved about Haywire).\nRenner is a great branch from the Bourne character. This movie will be\nadded to my collection.\n"
"\nThe action of this film is not less than satisfying, unless you came\nfor Matt Damon. Although Jason Bourne's fighting would be more worth\nthe watch; Renner's character is a fine addition to the Bourne\nfranchise-plot, as he is the subject of a new conflict that sensibly is\na result of the same CIA-conflicts that arose from the three movies\nbefore.<br><br>With that in mind, with there being no plot-holes nor bad acting (when\none watches a second or third time), and with good ways that they tie\nin literal events of Bourne Ultimatum consistently with the goings- on\nin this one, it is wrong to say that The Bourne Legacy has caused the\nmuch-beloved series to \"decline\".<br><br>Bourne Ultimatum is indeed the high point of the series, but\nregardless, this film is a perfect example and option for a \"agent vs\nagency complications\" movie.\n"
"\nThe best action series i have ever watched in my whole life! not only\nfight and war, but intelligence games also and best acting ever by The\nHero.A good movie is one which we wish to see again and again. and\nthese are the ones. very well directed by the director and i simply\nloved the talented acting of Jason Bourne \"Matt Damon\". Actually this\nmovie is so much appraisable because every scene of it, looks real. i\nhave watched almost every movie (Hollywood and bollywood) but i believe\nthat i will never see such a fantastic movie again. one thing to share\n, is that whenever i search for movies i just enter these movies name\nand search for related movies list i swear :-)\n"
"\nThe opening scene is just studly. Jeremy Renner walks out of 45 degree\nwater...walks out of. There is a great little IMDb short on this scene\nworth viewing. Matt Damon owned this genre (the Richard Chamberlin\nBourne movie from the late 80's was really good)so Renner will always\nbe compared to Damon. He was the perfect choice.<br><br>This movie has a similar feel to Shooter for me. I can watch it a few\ntimes a year. Just satisfies. The only flaw was the most overrated\nactor now in Hollywood, Ed Norton. He along with James Woods are the\nboring actors who try to have more screen presence than they can. Dude\nhas no Q factor for me. Was amazing in his earlier movies and History\nX, but not in this role.\n"
"\nWhy I loved it:<br><br>Jeremy Renner is a fantastic actor. Renner seems like an adult version\nof Jason Bourne. The scenery is amazing. Action and tension is\noutstanding. Rachel Weisz has done something to her looks and it works.\nRachel Weisz is a great actress.(I was surprised) She grows as a\ncharacter in this show and in the end I was cheering her on. <br><br>I know I love this movie because I can watch it over and over again and\nnever am bored. <br><br>That's just me. <br><br>The introduction of multiple like characters to Bourne and Cross that I\nfound sympathetic and interesting makes me want to see more of them\nalso. <br><br>I want more!!!\n"
"\nThis is my first time signing up and rating a movie, but this movie is\ntruly worth it. Bourne Legacy is not just my favorite of all the\nseries, it is my all time favorite movie!!!! I can watch it over and\nover again! I never get enough of it, lol! It is suspenseful,\nthrilling, exciting, captivating, just amazing! I didn't want it to\nend! I absolutely love the storyline, and the actors make it seem so\nreal.<br><br>Jeremy Renner is flawless in every aspect of his role. All of his hard\nwork and dedication to perfect his part is articulated through his\nperformance. His commitment to his role has really paid off! I love the\nmovie, and I love him! He is awesome!!!!<br><br>I have to say it again, this is my all time favorite movie!!!! I can\nwatch it over and over again, and I will never get enough! I absolutely\nlove this movie and love Jeremy!!!!\n"
"\nI spent a very entertaining evening. I didn't expect such a fast paced\nthriller. I was never bored and it was a great cat and mouse chase. It\nhad many action elements. Especially the one of the drone was\ninteresting. I liked how many filming places has been involved here.\nThis I am expecting from great espionage movies as in Mission\nImpossible or James Bond series. Then the actors Jeremy Renner, Raquel\nWeisz and Edward Norton as the bad guy delivered all a solid\nperformance.<br><br>What I found irritating was the fact that Jason Bourne needed always\nmedicament. It was like the scenes when Terminator needed to sort out\nthe bullets of him. <br><br>Anyway, don't hear all the negative reviews and watch it. You won't\nregret it. <br><br>For these reasons it gets 8/10.\n"
"\nJust saw Jeremy in Legacy and really enjoyed the movie's story. I found\nhis action scenes better and just loved Rachel. Nothing complicated\nabout my review, just loved the story and the idea of trying to get his\nbody together. Do not like the idea of messing with genetic material to\nenhance humans or animals. All the species on the planet evolved over\nthousands of years and by changing things to quickly mother nature can\ncome back and harm you worse! Humans know just enough to destroy the\nworld and it is called \"surviving progress!\" We are killing off species\nby inventing compounds that should not exist and excavating oil and\ncoal that is toxic to living things. Stop being God! Loved the movie as\nentertainment! Jeremy you were Great!\n"
"\nPlease explain me how could the production of this movie cost\n125.000.000 USD?<br><br>-Poor screenplay (if the base of your story is one of the best\nespionage trilogies ever made before you should work out something\nbetter as only a bunch of clichés) <br><br>-Poor stunts (just compare with The Bourne Identity, Ultimatum and\nSupremacy) <br><br>-Poor acting or bad casting (e.g. Edward Norton. I really love his\nacting, but not here ) <br><br>-No suspense, no thrill, nothing<br><br>As a screenwriter in the previous Bourne movies Tony Gilroy was great.\nAs a director of this movie unfortunately completely failed.\n"
"\nI gave it a 5 only because the lead actors were so good and the plot\nwas reasonably good until it devolved into another silly\ncar/motorcycle/foot chase. Hey, you can do this once. Not every damn\nmovie. It's boring. The rest of the plot was plodding, but at least it\nhad some structure, albeit trite. Then bring in the big names Albert\nFinney (unknown for anyone under 40, probably)- Scott Glenn, Joan Allen\nfor their 2 minutes a piece to pretend it's a continuing saga. Then\nthey sail off into the sunset? Mon Dieu, Bond did that a hell of lot\nbetter. Everything was set up to keep the Senate from hearing about the\nsuper secret program yet we only get 3 minutes of testimony and that's\nit? The Gilroys kept the screenplay for themselves and what a colossal\nmistake that was. It stinks.\n"
"\nIf a franchise is as successful as the Bourne franchise is/was, it is\ninevitable that there will be a follow up. Even if everyone was saying\nthat the series was always meant to be trilogy. If you can overcome\nthat fact and are able not to hold a grudge against the producers or\nanyone else involved in the making of this, you might be able to enjoy\na fairly decent action thriller.<br><br>Jeremy Renner is the man when it comes to casting action roles of late.\nAfter his performance in \"Hurt Locker\" he did rise pretty fast. If the\nAvengers were incomplete, he might have gotten a bigger role in that\none too. You can see why he is such a wanted man (no pun intended) in\nthis movie too. Rachel Weisz has not that much to do, but her\nperformance does give the movie another gravitas. The action scenes are\nsuperb, but we expected that (especially if we watched the trailer).\nNice hints to the original movies too. Before you cry out, watch it is\nwhat I'm trying to say.\n"
"\nWow- what a superb film. Starts out with an interesting plot in which\nwe observe a Manchurian black operative survive against all odds in a\nfreezing climate. Then somehow they weave it into a great story about\nthe female lead waking up to the truth about the program and fighting\nthe bad guys with Renner. I think they were both fantastic because they\nstay low key. The motorcycle scenes are really incredible - suspense\nthroughout. I forgot all about Matt Damon 30 minutes into it. And I\nlike Matt. I highly recommend this film. Gotta watch it again so I can\nenjoy the martial arts- impressive. Bonus is the attachment/love\ninterest angle which develops and Renner is extremely easy on the eye.\n"
"\nI thought this was a good film. The government has a secret project\nthat is going on and that is enhancing soldiers with physical and\nmental pills. Well the government has decided they want to end the\nproject, so in order to do that they have to get rid of all involve.<br><br>Meanwhile, one of these soldiers, Aaron is hiding out in Alaska and is\nrunning out of pills. He meets another like him and witnesses his\nexecution and knows people are after him. In Maryland, some scientists\nare gunned down that were working on the project, with one surviver,\nMarta. So Aaron tracks her down, saves her, and is wanting her to get\nhim pills. She reveals a startling fact about his condition and then\nthey travel half way around the world to find the answer that Aaron\nneeds in order to survive.<br><br>FINAL VERDICT: I thought it had an entertaining plot and some good\naction. Check it out.\n"
"\nIf you loved the other ones, I see no reason to dislike this one at\nall. I thought it really refreshed the series and made the entire plot\nline deeper and clearer.<br><br>Full of action, tension, and clever twists.<br><br>I think people didn't like that the went a little heavy on the sci-fi\nplot angle and was heavy on special effects, but the series did that\ntwo films ago.<br><br>Great stunt work as you expect with every Bourne film.<br><br>Maybe people feel it is a little redundant with James Bond films these\ndays, I don't know. But I hope they make a sequel.\n"
"\nThis is an interesting view of the Bourne series, from another,\nparallel perspective. I had never seen Jeremy Renner before, but I\nthought his performance was excellent. I really grew to care for Aaron\nCross. Rachel Weisz is terrific and beautiful as always. The\ndrones/Hellfire missile sequences are scary as hell. I liked how a love\naffair grows out of the carnage that attends so much of the movie.\nRather better than the 6.7 rating that it has so far drawn. It\nseemingly sets the scene for Aaron Cross and Jason Bourne to team up to\nreally raise hell with some completely amoral Washington bureaucrats\nwho think nothing of killing American heroes to protect their own sorry\nasses. Bring it on!\n"
"\nThe reviews that slate this film confuse me. I can't understand the\nhate.<br><br>I thought Tony Gilroy was a much better director than Paul Greengrass.\nThankfully there was no shakycam. <br><br>Jeremy Renner was good in the role of Aaron Cross. Rachel Weisz was far\nbetter than Julia Stiles or Franke Polenta or whoever, Renner had real\nchemistry between them. Their relationship was well written, well\nplayed. I cared about them.<br><br>There was plenty of action. I particularly liked the action scene in\nthe house. The scene with the doctor in the lab on a rampage was one of\nthe most suspenseful things I've seen on film.<br><br>Will buy the DVD and hope for another film with Renner, Weisz and\nGreengrass.\n"
"\nIn the Bourne 4 it features a new protagonist Aeron cross aka Jeremy\nrenner. Although they were a lot of action scenes and chases the scenes\nwere choppy and confusing going all over the place unlike the other\nthree bournes that were intelligent fluent and acting is good. In this\nmovie the story was all over the place and didn't really connect much\nto other ones and the ending was horrible and it wasn't a cliff hanger\nunlike Matt Damon Bourne movies where he was shot of something no they\njust float off in a boat and I said what that's it for the many actions\nscenes it does not leave you satisfied at the end and is not very\nintellectually motivating unlike og Bourne movies. All in all it was\nokay ... I suggest watching it but you may not like it !\n"
"\nIts been a longtime since I saw the first 3 movies in this series. So\nwhen I saw The Bourne Legacy, it was like a fresh start with some parts\nconnected with previous movie in the series. Tony Gilroy who directed\nall Bourne movies has brought back the fast pace screenplay which keeps\nyou interested till climax. Story is not something new. Beautiful\nvisuals from Alaska to Philippines.<br><br>Jeremy Renner was good in Ghost Protocol and even better as the lead,\nAaron Cross. Brilliant action sequences, both fights and chase scenes.\nWish the chase sequence was more in length. Rachel Weisz is the damsel\nin distress and she is good doing her part. The film would have been\neven better if it had more action. The movie is overall worth a watch\nfor amazing action and performances by the lead pair. I would surely\nlike to watch the whole series again. Must watch.\n"
"\nBourne is regarded as a very good trilogy. Honestly i never really was\na fan of the first 3 films. They were enjoyable enough....maybe a\n6.5/10 as far as i am concerned ! Anyway after seeing the trailers for\nthe 2012 version i said...\"hey this looks nice, but will it even be as\ngood as the last ones\" ? after the first 30mn i understood that the\nBOURNE name was soiled...this movie was bad....yes BAD. what is this\nhype i read online ??? Story is poor, action is not interesting...and\nthe soundtrack is not memorable ! Believe me this should have been a\ndirect to Bluray movie at best...the only thing that saves this crap is\nthe good lead actor and a few action moments that are nice. If you have\nnot seen it, skip it, you are NOT missing a damn thing !\n"
"\nPeople who have watched Bourne series and expect the same kind of fast\npaced action and drama. This film will disappoint if you go with that\nthought. But if you watch the movie just to spend a good time and don't\nexpect much then its a good movie to watch once. The movie doesn't have\nthe fast pace and at the beginning it goes so slow that you wonder if\nthis movie title had 'Bourne' in it. There are some dialogues in the\nmovie which take the story nowhere, you wish they got to the point\ndirectly. The director of the movie is changed so should the title so\nthat people don't expect much from this movie. Jeremy Renner does a\ngood act and recently has come up as the new action hero.\n"
"\nFourth film in the \"Bourne\" series, initially based upon Robert\nLudlam's novels, goes a different route with new characters and a new\nleading man (Jeremy Renner in place of Matt Damon). Despite an\nendlessly complicated set-up, the plot is an intriguing one, with an\nagent for the Department of Defense--addicted to physical enhancement\ndrugs once supplied by the operatives--realizing he's become\nexpendable, eventually leaving the States with a female scientist in\nsearch of more medication in the Phillipines. Both Renner and Rachel\nWeisz give surprisingly strong, adept performances for a picture that\nessentially just wants to be a stunt-driven thriller. Director and\nco-writer Tony Gilroy does get the viewer's blood pumping with some\nover-the-top vehicle stunts in the final third, however his sense of\npacing flags in the talkier sections of the film, which are full of hot\nair but not much insight. **1/2 from ****\n"
"\nIgnore all the negative criticism , ' The Bourne Legacy ' is as good if\nnot better than the Matt Damon variety - the opening scenes are\nmagnificent and the story is intriguing - the action never lets up ,\ntaking time to introduce the characters nicely . Renner and Weizz\ncombine very well as the agent and scientist trying to get to the\nbottom of why everyone is trying to kill them exploring some great\nlocations along the way .<br><br>The Bourne Legacy gets a maximum score from me .\n"
"\nI haven't watched more than 5 minutes total of the three previous\nBourne movies so I couldn't care less whether this one does or doesn't\nstar Matt Damon or whether it continues the story properly. So no\nbiases. I just watched this movie. I see ''Improved'' ''humans'' who\nhave outlived their usefulness/become a menace. Different people are\ncalled in to shut them/the program down. Violent interactions result in\nmany dead. There's even a brief bit about 2/3 of the way through where\nEd Norton's character is watching tape of Renner's character being\nasked a series of questions. ''Is this a test?'' Renner's character\nasks. Renner is essential a Nexus-6 replicant. Ed Norton is a blade\nrunner. Everything else is window dressing. I give it a 5 b/c it's a\nhalf-decent adrenaline rush, but 15 minutes after it's over you won't\nremember a thing. All those moments will be lost in time, like tears in\nrain.\n"
"\nI like the Bourne series, but it has been some time since I've seen the\nearlier ones and this kind of needs that to get the whole plot and\nstoryline straight I think.<br><br>This is a good story, nicely packed with action, fights and surprises.\nIt fits into the others in the time line and some of it does beside the\nthird Bourne film as far as I can think. We do get introductions to\nsome more operatives, but also some new experiments and I do not know\nif I like that idea. It depends on why we are first hearing about them\nnow and if it will work with the whole story and franchise.<br><br>It will be interesting to see what happens next in these film and if we\nget to see Bourne in the next film, it's kind strange having a film\nwith the title but without the main person himself.\n"
"\nWell, I am a Bourne fan, but to be honest I was not expecting much\nabout this movie because I knew there was no point on making another\none, it has already ended in The Ultimatum, but yeah here is finally \"\nThe Bourne Legacy \". What to say, it is, of course, not a bad movie, it\nhas a good history, good acting and good action scenes. But there is\nsomething I really missed from The Bourne series, it was THE REALISM. I\nam a big fan of realism in movies since I watched Bourne, and when I\nheard this new \" Bourne \" will be about some experimental pills which\ngives him advantages such as speed, intelligence, etc. it ruined my\nhopes about this movie. More like a \" Super soldier \" as Bourne. Giving\nit a 6/10, due to Jeremmy Ranner and Rachel Weisz's acting. Quite\ndisappointing this new film for our trilogy, which has already lost its\noriginal Jason Bourne.\n"
"\nA waste of 2 hours and 41 minutes. Time which I'll never get back.<br><br>Although the genetically enhanced agents theme follow-up to the\noriginal Bourne series had promise, it fails to deliver.<br><br>The drug-addicted super agents are supposed to be better than human,\nbut you'll never see anything supporting that claim Yes, it has plenty\nof action, but not much thought was put to the story line and\nbackground of the characters. One walks away without ever caring about\nany of them.<br><br>A filler movie, intended to satisfy the desire for the public desire\nfor more Bourne movies. Kind-of like 'New Coke' was suppose to replace\nthe original Coke.\n"
"\ni personally liked the movie irrespective of any idea about direction\nor storyline. those who say it was poorly executed are just who are\nfollowing the critics blindly. its good to give reviews but you should\nwatch it without being biased(who is making). watch it twice or thrice\nto ensure you haven't missed the concept or else you would be like \"oh\nmy god i don't get it so this is a boring not worthy movie\". and stop\ncomparing it with others so in that way you may enjoy it. and my\nsuggestion please don't see the reviews given by critics. their opinion\nmay vary. we should not expect a perfect movie but go for an\nentertaining one.\n"
"\nThe Bourne series ended with the last instalment, and now comes a 135\nminute death rattle called \"The Bourne Legacy.\" It's a peculiar movie,\nboth over-plotted and under-plotted, encumbered by layers of detail and\nyet with no details invested in or developed. And it all but squanders\nJeremy Renner and Rachel Weisz, although with actors less appealing,\n\"The Bourne Legacy\" would be even worse.<br><br>The film is almost opaque in its storytelling. As the film starts,\nRenner is in a cold, woodland area, injecting himself with blood,\ntaking swims in freezing water and climbing mountains. We don't know\nwhy he's there, and we never quite find out. Meanwhile, Jason Bourne is\nin New York, apparently creating a stir, although we never see him. And\nthere's a journalist in London who is about to expose Operation\nTreadstone, or perhaps Blackbriar, and no one ever explains what these\nare, or what the difference is between them.<br><br>The assumption is that the audience has just seen the entire Bourne\ntrilogy this week and has committed each detail to memory.\n"
"\nWhen you watch the Bourne Trilogy to me those 3 movies were equal in\nsuspense and excitement. It's hard to come away with a sequel and have\nit be as good as the first one. Here, Jeremy Renner is really good in\nhis role but I'm not sold on Rachel Weisz. It's like she is trying too\nhard?? When you watch her and Renner in the car when they leave her\nburning house it's like she is forgetting her lines or something. Just\nnot very good acting. Anyway, the action scenes are really good but the\nstory isn't. It doesn't carry the same flair or interest like the first\n3 do. The movie is not awful but it's not great either. Good to see at\nleast once. It gets a 6 from me.\n"
"\nThe key to enjoying this film is to forget Jason Bourne. There is no\none that will replace Matt Damon, and there is no one that can replace\nRobert Ludlum's story that ended with The Bourne Ultimatum. Get it -\nUltimatum - Latin: THE LAST ONE.<br><br>We don't have Matt Damon and Julia Stiles, but we do have the fantastic\nRachel Wiesz; Scott Glen and David Strathairn are back; and Stacy\nKeach, Albert Finney, and Edward Norton join the team.<br><br>Frankly, I wasn't sure what was going on for a long while. Apparently,\nour hero Aaron Cross (Jeremy Renner) is looking for a pill of some\nsort.<br><br>Things start to get interesting after Dr. Marta Shearing's (Wiesz) lab\nis destroyed. Next they come after her. It is Cross that saves her and\nthe adventure begins.<br><br>Three chase scenes and lots of dead bodies later we seem to be heading\nfor a sequel.\n"
"\nIt's a very good movie, well worth watching. <br><br>But it's not what we've come to expect from a \"Bourne\" film, except for\nthe chase scenes. <br><br>Actually, I liked the fact that it was something different....<br><br>The acting was superb, especially Stacy Keach and Rachel Weisz. <br><br>Jeremy Renner was convincing in a very physically demanding role. <br><br>The plot made sense, though you have to accept some loopholes. <br><br>I also liked the fact that it takes place AT THE SAME TIME as THE\nBOURNE ULTIMATUM. <br><br>The fact that the title has little or nothing to do with the book of\nthe same name <br><br>doesn't bother me at all. They did the same thing with the Bond films. <br><br>I am eagerly awaiting the next in the series....<br><br>.\n"
"\nBourne is back and better than ever in the fourth movie installment of\nthe Bourne series. The Bourne Legacy is still the same gritty and\nviolent action that you came to expect. The only problem is... JASON\nBOURNE IS GONE!!! The good thing is that Jeremy Renner takes over the\nroll just as well as Matt Damon did. I'd say my favorite scene in the\nmovie was probably the end moter cycle scene because it was just so\nextensive and made you want to just fast forward to see what happens!\nBelieve it or not, this is actually probably my favorite Bourne movies\nbecause it gets a little old just to keep seeing Matt Damon in each\nmovie when it seems like each of the movie had their same plots, but\nthis one was better because it had a cast change. Not the best movie of\nthe 2012 Summer, but still a great action flick, that fans of Jason\nBourne have come to expect!! So GO SEE IT!!!\n"
"\nA 5 is generous. Overall The Bourne Legacy was slow when it should have\nbeen fast and fast when it should have been smart. Cross' motivation\nwas singular, almost animalistic - smart pills (movie over!) For one\nthing, it takes more brains and skill to disable than to kill. Early on\nwe are fed the idea that Mr Cross is of substandard intelligence\nwithout these little pills. Later we are told that if he survives being\ngiven a virus he won't need the pills anymore. The problem is that it's\ncoming from all directions and doesn't stay with an idea (at least a\ngood idea) long enough to make a connection, something to identify\nwith. Jeremy Renner was like the energizer bunny on meth. Rachel\nprovided the emotional connection and some stability. The only other\nthing I can say in a positive way was the relationship development\nbetween Dr Shearling and Cross. Go Matt!\n"
"\nI began with great expectation at the thought of spending the next 2\nhours in the presence of Renner and Weisz being directed by Gilroy -\nwithin 5 minutes I was concerned and at the end of the film very\ndisappointed.<br><br>Gilroy delivers moments of fast paced action only to seemingly lose\ninterest in the project or purposely slow the film down to recollect\nhis own thoughts on the next 10 mins. He spent the first ten minutes\ntrying to figure out the best way to introduce the new prodigy but as a\nBourne fan kick off was slow and dull.<br><br>No chemistry between main characters although Wiezs is awesome in her\nrole and delivers a performance way beyond her script - but not her.\nRenner is good, always is, but had no freedom to evolve as a superb\nassassin from a truly dire story - elimination of the project so kill\nall known subjects and his own battle to seek viral vaccination\n(something achieved unbelievably easily!)<br><br>The franchise is very much alive in the hands of Greengrass, this is\nGilroy so avoid.\n"
"\nI walked into the screening theatre with a bit of apprehension. I\nconfess I am a big Matt Damon fan. He did a tremendous job as Jason\nBourne in the previous three episodes. However Jeremy Renner is a\nrefreshingly pleasant surprise as the new agent. He is a great actor\nwho has tremendous screen presence and energy. Rachel Weisz as Dr.\nSnyder is outstanding. Ed Norton as Byer does not have too many lines\nbut his expressions show why he is such a great actor. The story is\nexcellent and so is Tony Gilroy's direction. The action scenes will\nkeep you at the edge of your seats. The finale on the streets of Manila\nis aligned with the previous three Bourne movies. The locations chosen\nare perfect. The cinematography is grabbing especially the scenes which\nwere shot in Alberta, Canada. The Bourne Legacy is a must see not only\nfor the Bourne fans but also for those who love a good story and good\naction movies. I am going to watch it again and pay for it when it is\nreleased in August. It's well worth it!\n"
"\nfor me,although this movie was decent,it didn't really feel like a\nBourne movie,mainly because the character of Jason Bourne isn't in\nit.that's not to say it's a bad movie,because it isn't.it just doesn't\nstack up to the three previous Bourne films in terms of action\ncharacterization and dialogue.the story was okay,but again not overly\ncompelling none of the actors can be blamed.they all put in good\nefforts.this film just had too big a pair of shoes to fill.Tony\nGilroy(Duplicity,Michael Clayton) directed and co-wrote the\nscreenplay.as far as I can recall,none of the characters or actors from\nthe three previous film appear in this,although I could be out to lunch\non that.for me,The Bourne Legacy is a 6/10\n"
"\nThe Bourne Identity the 4th and god i hope last of this continuation.\nThis movie has nothing to do with Bourne is basically Aaron Cross\nplayed by Jeremy Renner and Rachel Weisz trying to escape from some\npeople and Edward Norton trying his best Godfather Part III look since\nhe looks like he's 58 years old. The action is over the top, the acting\nis fine and then instead of actually trying to do something new with\nthe series they use half of the footage from the previous film damn\nthey are smart right? Nope. This is the Terminator Salvation of the\nBourne Franchise but there's one problem T4 was at least enjoyable this\none? Not so much. Let's just pretend that they never made a 4th movie\nand that the 4th movie is the upcoming 'Jason Bourne' one right? right.\n"
"\nThis movie seems to have been made to cash in on the success of the\nthree excellent Bourne movies.<br><br>Maybe for that reason it was put together so poorly I don't know, but\nit is just not a Bourne movie and should not have the title just\nbecause it makes references to Bourne and what happened at the end of\nthe Bourne Ultimatum.<br><br>Rachel Weisz is good but could not rescue this movie alone. The main\ncharacter Aaron Cross played by the awful Jeremy Renner just wasn't\nconvincing in any way. I see that they may have signed him for a sequel\nto this nonsense. That should kill off the Bourne franchise sadly.\n"
"\nThe movie starts off really well, but tends to get worse as it\nprogresses. The cinematography and acting is amazing. The film's plot\nis not as strong though, and their choice of location was\ndisappointing. Bourne movies seem to me more satisfying when filmed in\nEurope, or The States; any \"spy\" film shot in in Europe or The States\nis better due to the value it adds to the film. There seems to be more\nlocations and better landmarks in Europe. The film lacked location as\nwell. Some dialogues were off. I personally believe the movie could've\nbeen more detailed and had a better ending. Jeremy Renner's performance\nwas good. Robert Elswit did a great job as the director of photography.\nThe characters were not introduced very well and it would be hard for\nsome people to get locked onto the movie.\n"
"\nRachel Weisz (sp?) is not a great actor for the role she plays. Kind of\ngets annoying at a lot of times. The sad part is that the movie could\nnot follow the plot of the book (in which Jason Bourne was the main\ncharacter), because Matt Damon refused to be a part of the movie. Thus,\nthe plot is entirely different then the book. The book's plot was\nincredible and would have made a great movie, but I guess Damon was\nselfish and set them up for disappointment. Still an alright movie, but\nthe plot is a little unclear and Weisz acting sucks. It's just no match\nto the real Bourne Trilogy. Should you watch, do not have the\nexpectation that it will be as good as the first three movies. Because\nin my opinion those were easily 10/10 and this one was probably 5.5 or\n6 out of 10\n"
"\nSemi TMI alert.<br><br>Time (we're constantly reminded): during the far superior Bourne\nmovies- -numerous clips of which are provided. Meanwhile in another\npart of the Magic Kingdom of Evilonia, CIA mad scientists hope they'll\ncook up an army of Mutant X-Bournes by giving super-soldier serum to\nFlowers For Algernon wannabes. They mostly end up with 'roid-addicted,\noverly trusting and easily killed Mini-Bournes. But Jeremy Renner\nmisplaces his meds and soon goes Rogue Pseudo-Bourne, pursued by\nTerminator-Bourne. Back at CIA Ops HQ, Edward Norton and Stacy Keach\nexchange terse accusations and launch drone attacks.<br><br>The result is the BOURNE NON-ENTITY: an imitation lacking only the\nscript, story, direction, performances, editing, cinematography, stunt\ncoordination, fight choreography, design, integrity or vision of the\noriginals. One suspects the sequel will feature Spidey-Bourne &amp; Hulk-\nBourne vs Robo-Bourne.\n"
"\nThe inadequacy of this sequel to the Bourne Trilogy is not the absence\nof Jason Bourne, it is the rather common feel to the whole thing. The\nprevious pictures had a never been there atmosphere with a sharp battle\nbetween the forces of clandestine Government programs, a Shadow\nGovernment if you will, and the rogue amnesiac agent who finds that the\ntruth will set him free, but first it will make him angry.<br><br>The tension this created along with some use of modern\nquasi-groundbreaking close-up fight scene techniques are what made the\nseries so endearing. It was like an artificially programed Hyper-Bond\nwith \"Super-Soldier\" ruefulness. <br><br>The usually adroit Director/Writer Tony Gilroy seems to be misstepping\nhere and delivers a surprisingly dull and run of the mill Movie. The\naction, dialog, and zeitgeist is without one remarkable aspect. It is a\nmediocre affair that is quite a letdown and can be viewed as a plunge\nto pedestrian.\n"
"\nThis latest Bourne movie is a fast paced action packed movie with\nincredible chase scenes and clever situations and escapes. I thought\nthe actors were all decent and convincing in their roles. For those of\nyou that love fast paced action, violence, and fans of the Bourne movie\nseries I suspect you'll find this movie is everything you want and hope\nfor. But for those of us that would like a storyline that actually\nmakes sense and is moderately easy to follow, well then this one fails\nto deliver on those lines. When watching this I kept telling myself\nthat this will all make sense eventually, that the plot will come clear\nsoon, and that all the pieces will fit. Unfortunately I find those\nessential elements of movie making were not present in this one. There\nwas a lot to like about this movie, but there was also a lot to\ndislike. I wish the producers and script writers would of done a better\njob of plot development, had they done so this movie would rate way\nbetter than just mediocre.\n"
"\nAnother film, based (loosely) on the books, but without Jason Bourne\n(Matt Damon would make this movie, but as they exchanged the director,\nwho was to be the one of the original trilogy, he refused). <br><br>Basically the film deals with events that occur parallel to those\noccurring in The Bourne Ultimatum, where the Program Outcome, on which\nsuper-agents are created with chemical and genetic changes are\neliminated one by one - the protagonist this time is Aaron Cross,\ntrying to survive, helping a project scientist, persecuted in the files\nburning. <br><br>The film is a little slow in the start, but half an hour from the start\n, we have more action: the action, though not as engaging as the\noriginal movies is very good, but the dense and catchy plot that held\nthe original trilogy is lost in this side-story, that still leaves a\nhook for more sequences. Worth as it is a good action movie, but I gave\nit a 6,0 score because of the discontinuity in this spin-off of the\noriginal trilogy (which I loved).\n"
"\nWith Matt Damon, I mean... Jeremy Brenner is not bad, but Damon is more\nversatile. The plot here is weaker is well: too much emphasis on\nmedicine and conspiracy at the expense of thrilling chases or exciting\nevents (and e.g. chasing on the streets of Manila is visually\nimpressive, but too many clichés). The first 30 minutes or so, for\nexample, were very tardy and dull. Flashbacks/dreams are often\nconfusing, difficult to distinguish from the beginning. The ending is\ntoo sudden and \"open\".<br><br>Edvard Norton, Albert Finney and Rachel Weisz provided an additional\nvalue to the movie as well - thanks to actors I gave my 7 points. The\nBourne Legacy is OK for killing time, but do not expect a catchy\nexperience or maintaining the level of the preceding Bourne saga.\n"
"\nPlot line is this: Aaron Cross is another super-soldier, just like\nJason Bourne. The Treadstone program is going to be exposed and\npossibly shut down, so all people affiliated with the program\n(including Cross) are being wiped out. So, Cross needs his\nsuper-soldier drugs to stay alive, so he steals a plane and flies from\nAlaska to Chicago, then rescues one of the lab agents from sudden\ndeath, then they go to Manila to get him his fix. Throw in some\nimpossible high- speed chases and shoot-outs, hand-to-paw fights with\nwolves in the wilderness, innocent people being executed in a mass\nshooting, a weird conflict with another UNKNOWN super- soldier and\nyou've got this movie. <br><br>The story is wayyyy too complicated from the get-go, to the point where\nyou just had to stop thinking and \"enjoy\" the cartoonishness of this\nfilm. <br><br>I like Jeremy Renner as an actor, and thought he was exceptional in The\nHurt Locker and MI: Ghost Protocol, but this movie was not one of his\nbetter roles.\n"
"\nThe Bourne Legacy<br><br>The worst part of succeeding an assassin that just quit is that all of\nyour victims will scream their codename when you kill them.<br><br>Fortunately, the murderer in this action movie is so swift his\nsoubriquet won't even touch his target's lips.<br><br>Aaron (Jeremy Renner) is a government operative training up north when\nthe classified gene enhancement programs that created him are\npublicized.<br><br>To conceal his tracks, Aaron's boss (Edward Norton) orders all agents\neradicated - as well as the scientists working on the chemicals that\nkeep the killers calm.<br><br>Evading execution, Aaron and a surviving scientist (Rachel Weisz)\nsearch for the serum that will keep Aaron sane.<br><br>While it departs from the real-world ambiance of its predecessors, this\n4th installment drops loads of Intel on the top-secret programs and\ndollops on heaps of action.<br><br>Incidentally, the child of an assassin and a scientist would use a\nmicroscope on their rifle.

"\ni got this movie on amazon,and its actually a pretty good movie, better\nthan i expected. i thought it was going to be almost an \"off brand\" of\nthe other ones but id actually take this one over the others. but a few\ndays after i bought it , i downloaded apptrailers on my ipod,i found\nout i could of gotten it on apptrailers for free. When i entered the\npromo code ,under videos,\"hrvat11\" and got 2000 free points, which is\nenough for one movie. luckily they have a ton of different movies to\nchoose from so i got dark knight rises instead, but i think the code it\na holiday special, so it wont last forever.you guys really need to\ncheck out their movie section, its impressive to say the least. with\nthe code you get onew free, then you either have to earn more points or\nbuy the movies.\n"
"\nWhen they're sitting there on the boat and all of a sudden the movie\nended I was completely baffled. I don't know much about film but it\nfelt like we were maybe 1/2 through. I mean nothing really happened, he\njust met up with the doctor, got the stem cells and escaped to some\nislands. Literally NOTHING else happened. Some stuff about that woman\nreleasing classified documents but it didn't have any effect on the\nstoryline of the main actors! It's hard to explain but it didn't really\nfeel like the movie followed any coherent script. Yes yes, there were\nstuff that you had to think about to follow but it was mostly\nreferences to the previous movies. It didn't really build that much on\nthem.<br><br>Gave it 6/10 only for the good acting and OK directed individual\nscenes. Seriously... biggest anti-climax ever to a movie!\n"
"\nI've seen all the other Bourne movies- several times each. When I sat\ndown to watch this one, the first half of the movie just jumped around\nand felt like it was disjointed. Seemingly a forced attempt to bring\nall the movies together- which didn't work, by the way. I was so\nconfused, I got up and went to wash the dinner dishes. When I came\nback, my absence helped because it seemed to have launched into another\nact and more of it made sense- they let the current characters run with\nthe story instead of flipping back and forth. Overall, I didn't\nparticularly enjoy the movie. The actions scenes were too close in\nsimilarity to the other movies- not sure if this was done for overall\n\"feel\" or just laziness. Wasn't impressed.\n"
"\nThough The Bourne Legacy doesn't quite live up to the original Bourne\nTrilogy it is still an outstanding movie in its own right. For one,\nJeremy Renner does an absolutely phenomenal job. While I don't think\nthe character development or acting is necessarily up to par with Matt\nDamon, I think he more than legitimizes the film. I also thought that\nRachel Weisz did a solid job and Edward Norton provided a decent\nvillain for the movie. In addition to the acting and character\ndevelopment, the plot developed superbly. I thought making this film\ncoincide with the Bourne trilogy was genius. Honestly, the only\nelements of the movie I didn't enjoy were the general lack of action\nand the outlandish aspects of some of the action sequences. These two\npoor aspects coupled together to really hurt the movie because it would\nstart to drag but then when action would finally happen it would\nsometimes be silly. Still, this movie is definitely worth watching...\njust don't expect it to be as good as the first three.\n"
"\nthe long bla bla bla of the misguided critics of the script miss the\npoint of this Bourne movie. for that matter perhaps the point of\nmovies. movies tell stories through physical actions. the actors did\nnot redeem the script. it seemed obvious to me that the script was much\nbetter than the previous Bourne movies. i don't care about Jason\nBourne's personal identity crisis. this is a sociological thriller. the\nscript created a vacuum that made a simple eye brow flick and a deep\nlook of interest culminate in a gush of pure believable humanity.\nmaking the finale greater than the perfect action which preceded it.\nwhats unbelievable is the way these technocrat word-smiths dodge the\nbullet points of the story and the point of movies and acting.\n"
"\n*Story/Plot/Content - B+ <br><br>nice script still is Gilroy's hand manifest the whole story brought\nfrom the first to the third Bourne Series.<br><br>*Production/Execution - B+<br><br>great production like all Bourne movies,from one place to another\nespecially great action feed from Manila, Philippines.<br><br>*Acting - B+<br><br>Jeremy has the same intensity as Matt has, great moves and instinct,\nbut still I prefer Matt's approach with the movie and situations in the\nfilm.<br><br>*Direction/Editing/Score - B<br><br>Gilroy's lack intensity that Greengrass has in his two sequel of Bourne\nSeries. Same editing the scenes but the score is about as great as the\nlast Bourne.<br><br>*Entertainment/Enjoyable - A<br><br>hell yeah! it was enjoyable and entertaining. Adrenaline-punched all\nover especially in the climax scene.<br><br>OVERALL - B+ 7.8/10\n"
"\nJust watched this movie in New Zealand. The trailer got me interested.<br><br>No way this is a 7.3 rating though, I'd say more like a 6.3. 7.3 is\ngetting too close to something like Avatar (8.0).<br><br>This is still a good movie though. Well worth going to see. Plenty of\nfolks complaining about the story but ignore that if you want to simply\nenjoy a decent well-made action movie.<br><br>There's a few twists on the Bourne series that make it interesting\nenough. It could use a few more fight scenes, they've done a great job\non making these seem so realistic in previous movies.<br><br>But I'd say this sets up the Bourne series to continue on positively.\n"
"\nSometimes it is a good thing to step back and chill a minute. Even\nknowing the propensity for this director to use rapid-cutting\ntechniques didn't prepare me for the confusion and, well let's admit\nit, big fat headache it gave me while at the same time trying to focus\non the quivering hand-held camera. Yikes! Just 'cause you know how\ndoesn't mean you have to use all your tricks at the same time. This was\na good story that tied onto the Bourne mythos and rebooted the movie\nfranchise with actors who were terrific. Good action sequences and\nstunts also, so my advice to the director or directors of future Bourne\n(or will they be Cross?) flix is to trust the viewer to \"get\" the drama\nwithout adding in those cinematography gimmicks.\n"
"\nTHis movie reminded me of so many other chase movies. The thing that\nmade the first 3 Bourne movies stand out was, they were trying to get\nhim before he got them. THis movie lacked a number of other things that\nmade me just about walk out before the end. Firstly the intensity of\nthis Bourne movie - no where near the same as the others. Next - the\nfight scenes - choreography left wanting, too dark to see what was\ngoing on, could barely see one scene. Last - good movies have good 1 on\n1 good guy bad guy scenes, and a near death experience from one of\nthose for the good guy, lets just say you will be disappointed with the\nlast action/chase scene. Overall, it really missed the mark for anyone\nexpecting a good powerful movie from the Bourne stable. And Ed Norton\nwasn't the guy for the top job in my opinion. Doesn't have a voice that\ninstils fear, or command. 5/10.\n"
"\nThe Bourne legacy was a great addition to the Bourne franchise. Jeremy\nRenner does an excellent job as Aaron Cross and the whole cast do some\namazing acting. The only downside to this almost perfect film is that\nthe beginning is quite confusing (even if you have seen all 3 original\nfilms) and the ending lacks imagination. Although you may think this\nwould ruin the film, it certainly does not. Throughout the film there\nare some great fight scenes, epic chase scenes and scenes synonymous to\nthe Bourne series. Overall there is great acting and some memorable\naction scenes, which make this film what it is. It was an enjoyable\nfilm and i would be happy to see a sequel.\n"
"\nI will keep my review straight and to the point. Watch the first three\nfilms (as I did) then go watch The Bourne Legacy. The movie just\ndoesn't feel the same. No adrenaline, no amazing gun scenes (ok the\nhouse was decent), followed by the weakest ending I could imagine.\nReally? The guy on the bike was supposed to be the best agent they ever\nput into the field and yet he gets ousted by the doctor. Where is the\nagent on agent fight scenes? Where is the brink of death feeling and\nclose calls? No wonder Matt didn't want anything to do with this film.\nThe first Bourne film I almost fell asleep watching. What a\ndisappointment.\n"
"\nThere's nothing special about the film, just a replacement of\ncharacters from the original trilogy. In fact considering the length of\nthe film you'd expect it to pack a story that is complete in itself,\neven if it was just a part of a possible series to follow, but it\nseemed rather incomplete to me.<br><br>That apart Rachel Weisz does a good job in the film, but personally I\nlike Damon as Bourne much more than Renner as Aaron Cross. Also, there\nare some minor differences in the story line so it is not altogether\nboring. That along with some nice action sequences makes the film\nwatchable and a decent time-killer(if you can spare some) on the whole.\n"
