for the first time in many many years with this movie i was taken away from the problems in my life and went to a place where those things didnt register anymore
it was almost magical
i had to keep reminding myself about the bad things in real life but then a new robot vs monster battle happened and all the sudden that didnt matter any more
total escapism done with excellent design attention and detail
thank you gdt
you have to be an artist and a science fiction geek to appreciate this
i came out of the movie and realized all my problems were still there but i was also hearing the theme music in my head
got the dvd now and i escape that way
channel your inner six year old lean back and enjoy
this movie is one of the best i have seen in a long time
everything i can think of is incredible in this movie
from the incredible cgi effects to even the awesome soundtrack this movie does no wrong
the only negative thing about the movie is the length but with the amount of information and depth they put into the movie one is amazed by how short the movie is compared to what it could be
not once did i look at my watch and think when will this be over
like i do with most movies over 2 hours long
the fight scenes are very well done in this movie
you expect a fight scene between a 250 foot robot and a 300 foot monster to be cheesy and in your face but they arent
all of the technology is explained very well and the camera angles are ones that allow you to see everything going on
i highly recommend that everyone on this site go see this movie now
between the incredible visuals and the intense soundtrack you will almost be wishing this plot was real so you can hop in a jaeger and kick some kaiju ass
i was hopeful going in from a review i read but it could have gone bad
instead it went great
you know that the humans win  of course
instead of making up some twisted plot you get interesting side stories some surprise good acting good fights and an attempt at realism
the scientists were good for comedy without being annoying
i only recognized one actor so i saw some new people who were great like elba and kikuchi
a part of the opening is how so many countries worked together but there is no message that would serve no purpose but would be heavyhanded
i didnt see any of the transformers movies i will make a comparison to independence day
i had seen the trailer dozens of times and with each time i wanted to see the film more and more
it wasnt a let down
its absolutely stunning even the monsters are beautifulin their own gruesome way
the director guillermo del toro did a fantastic job
the acting and the effects are amazing
i loved the details that were put into the filmrust on the jaegerschipped paint on their jaeger suitsso on
my favourite jaeger is gypsy dangera bit too obviouseh
another thing i love about the film is the unique way of showing aliens
the aliens are obviously from another planet but they come trough a portal that is deep into the oceanthey are intelligent despite how they look and above all they clone themselves and send clones to do the dirty work
they are truly unique
i strongly recommend it to anyone who loves robots and monsters and the everlasting battle between good and evil
almost a great movieliked it really with the theme sets and the way soundtracks and directions fade in for the screenplay apart from the monster and robot thing may seem to be childish to some still the way the movie theme in 2020 how humans adapt to use technology wise as per the circumstances is well depicted
the way the action is choreographed is best even if its a robot fighting the fights seems like more human to a monster and it was stylish
movie rating as per my thoughts is perfectly 8
510
the storyline that makes the human world to be almost responding to a catastrophe even though its strange from normalthe movie is perfectly scripted
sometimes have felt that instead of creating this as a sequel let this movie remain as a legend or evergreen movie of all time and it perfectly deserves i guess
easily my most favorite movie in last few years
its like batman begins of big fighting robots movies
beats michael bays transformers trilogy on many levels
actually it beats most of the latest invasion scifi movies on many levels
the movement of the giant robots feels very real thanks to the excellent visualization and sound mixing
the main music theme is present everytime when its needed to build that feeling of justification and awesomeness and its epic presence is appreciated by the little boy in me watching the monumental scenes with eyes glued to the cinema canvas
its maybe not taking itself very seriously and characterization is quite flat but the threat still feels more serious than in movies with similar themes
i couldnt get rid of the wide cheshire cat grin on my face when i was driving back home
it was that good
thank you guillermo del toro
1010
this is an absolutely magnificent movie
i have seen hundreds of films and this movie is only the 6th that i have awarded a 1010 to
all this year i had been anticipating the release of snyders man of steel with pacific rim coming in at a distant 2nd for my most anticipated of 2013 list
not only was this movie better than man of steel but i am now prepared to say it is one of my favourite movies of all time
not being impressed by del toros hellboy i was a bit anxious when he was directing a movie about giant robots fighting aliens but my fears were aside with an impressive first trailer
ever since its release i have always considered transformers dark of the moon to contain the best action in any movie say what you will about michael bay but that has now been figuratively shat on by del toro proving that there is a healthy middle ground between heartpumping mindless action and the making of a great movie
giant robots fighting enormous aliens  its not just for methheads anymore
incredible film
took a chance on this actually stupid movie whereby you would have to be stupid to believe any of it
the premise that if you build a giant robot to fight a giant monster and then punch the monster like it was a title bout is ridiculous and an insult to your mind set
why spend billions to build these robots only to fire cannons at them from close range
the thought that you would power this giant robot with the thoughts of two separates minds is staggering
i found it to not be worth a tenth of the money spent to see the hype
i would call it godzilla vs transformers  for a saturday morning kid show
but to cough up 50
00 for 2 adults and 2 kids to see this movieis just not worth it
my opinion was not the only my wife and kids hated it too
omg the adrenaline is still pumping through me
pacific rim is beyond awesome
i was wide eyed open mouthed and trembling with excitement all the way though and i am gutted that right now im not with like minded folk because i really want to play kaiju and jaegers
i would be bam
bam
bam
and doing the moves and rolling around for hours
i am really envious im not a child because i wish i could be justified in having all the bedding toys so not only could i play at k amp js physically with my friends i could have fun for hours playing fights alone with my merchandise and maybe some pyjamas too
love it soooooo much
such a refreshing action movie
unlike many action movies nowadays that are based on well known comic books and books and we always know the story and the element of surprise is not really present
this movie however i went in with just seeing the trailer and omg hands down the best action movie i have seen in a long time
the story line was great it went into correct amount of depth and was not just action action action
it starts off with a great action scenes and then takes some time to build the plot
then it goes into awesome action scenes and also had a great ending
definitely worth watching in 3d
i know that this movie was filmed in 2d and converted to 3d for the theater
but because of all the large objects the 3d effect really made it seem like we were in the movie
also the soundtrack was amazing for pumping you up
totally loved it
an awesome film with stunning visuals
seeing those giant robots walking in the sea alone is worth tickets price
del toros passion and perfection speaks for itself
not in a single place you find the cgi or visuals lacking
cgi is so damn perfect which isnt a small feat given that its a film about giant robots fighting giant monsters
and man do these robots look beautiful and awesome
like a piece of art
and they are done so perfectly each and every movement every little detail has been given attention
these giant robots really put all what we have seen in transformers to shame
the action scenes are jawdropping and are so brilliantly choreographed without ever going over the top
its a pity that this film couldnt do well on box office while every other crap coming out every day makes tons and tons of money
i sincerely hope del toro gets to make a sequel
unlike some i had no problem with the high concept of the piece transformers vs godzilla
it had a lot of potential
and when the movie concentrates on what we are all here to see giant creatures and robots beating on each others with oil tankers and smashing through skyscrapers it is very successful
but when things get quiet
less so
too much time spent on top gun like fighter pilot shenanigans
not enough nuance in the characterizations
an ultra linear plot with few attempts to confound expectations
the acting isnt bad  and isnt required to be great in this sort of film  but it is nothing special either
sort of universally meh
good for a blu ray rental
i was pleasantly surprised by this film
when i first heard about machines fighting giant monsters i figured it would be ridiculous and it was
luckily it was a good kind of ridiculous
being a fan of movies like godzilla and an avid anime watcher helped me to pull together the various components of this film
i would have enjoyed it if they had put more time into explaining the development of the machines more
it felt like they rushed through that portion
if i had one main criticism it would be that the cheesiness level was very high
other than that and the occasional bad acting it was fun watching the high definition fight scenes and pretty cast
i can recite the lines in the trailer thats how much i looked forward to this movie
but i fell asleep while watching it literally
so disappointed
the comments made by people around me always start with horrible story and end up with perfect special effects though
truth to be told i can totally foresee that for nearly all action movies follow this trend
but i was wrong
there is no single twist surprising and the actress really cant act
whats wrong with her face
she does not know how to smile does she
then the robots
come on
these huge machines are unable to leave deep impression on audience
the fighting scenes are of great chaossea water buildings robots and monsters mix with each other so that i could only tell that something is moving in the screen
the finale eventually adds the last awful stroke
the only thing of this movie worth keeping is the theme song boosting work efficiency
i enjoyed this movie very much
the plot is well done and the acting very convincing
special effects very well made
2 hours of action
i cant wait for the 2nd part
great work of charlie and rinko i love rinko
she is beautiful here and personally i would like she to show some more skin because she has a great asian body very wheel toned and athletic
for me it seems like the movie was well think before its release
each scene has a purpose and is very enjoyable
i was forgetting the great acting of idris elba an english actor that i respect very much due to his performance in police series and in prometheus
excellent choice of actor in any case
even the doctor scientific technicians etc all they were very well chosen for this movie
i recommend you to see it if you are looking for well entertainment
congratulation to all the people who made possible this action movie
excellent movie
a must watch action packed thrilling and definitely a visual eye candy for the young generation
yeah certain flaws are there and its obvious
for many this movie isnt perfect and totally respect their opinions
but still can promise a 100 thrilling and action packed experience
individual performances are good enough for the movie but its the battle between the monsters and the hunters that will attract you
expected a bit more battles but still the special effects and story line is strong enough to get your attention
despite its flaws definitely a 10 on 10 movie for me
dont miss this movie as its worth watching at least once
i wish i could give this movie a lower rating
everything is terrible storyline acting cgi everything
do not waste your time
i wish i had not
i do not believe there was any forethought into the technical aspects of the movie
produced in an age of drones and wireless communication why would there be a need for manual pilots that actually have to run in place driving huge mechanisms to control movement
why would they feel when the machines arm is ripped off
why would this fight not be with nuclear weapons instead of trillion dollar bipedal robots
why would you need to drift two separate minds together to control one
ever heard of mechwarrior
kids play that crap in their basements on a controller with two sticks and six buttons
what a damn waste of time and imagination
i wanted to like it by the end i just wanted to say i finished it and now that i have i want my money back
at firstit makes feel it like the copycat of japan manga  eva evangellion zero
but at last i feel it had its own style to plot the movie
the director cleverly edited the ideas from eva and make it become its own movie
it makes me unbreathable from the beginning of the fight against the kaiju
the visual effect of the movie is also well done
the kaiju seem nice and real
the story line is also well plotted
i feel rei is alive when i see the role of mori appears in the movie
the beginning and the ending of the movie is well established
i cant believe that i see eva goes to the movie and no longer stay in the anime version
finally a well edited version of eva evangellion
hope the second episode will even better than first
great work masterpiece of scifiction fantasy movie
story
did you call it a story
i think it is just an excuse for marvelous giant robots vs giant monsters battles
pacific rim isnt really telling a storyhoweverits realizing our childhood dreams
when the japanese monster movies were hotmany kids must had dreamed of giant monsters
due to the limit of technology in the 90smonsters were no more than plastic toys destroying model cities with dumb movements
but i remember that my childhood friends and i talked about monster movies each time we played together and the fun pretending to be monsters smashing things and got punished for that
i guess boys have inborn interests in monsters
after seeing pacific rimi couldnt help crying
isnt it what we dreamed of when we were kids
giant monsters smashing a city to rubblegiant robots punching monsters with a fist bigger than a bus and hero saving the world again
all in oneall in almost realistic cg which gave me an illusion that monsters were alive and kicking
pacific rim is the best monster movies ive ever seen
please support the movie or monster movies will extinct
i really looked forward to this movie when it was announced
im glad it was worth it
i wont go into detail regarding the plot i would like to relate the feeling i had while watching this
saw it in 2d and it was a spectacle in its own accord
giant behemoths dealing punches superimposed over general population produces a feeling of wonder and awe that im sure del toro captured unerringly
adrenaline powered speeches and last minute heroics really made me feel like child again
i had the whole cinema cheer and boo at the screen on various occasions and the demographic was from 3 to 93 years of age
feeling is similar to ridley scotts gladiator through out
its what transformers and godzilla should have been
no better way of spending your afternoon than this
just go watch it
pacific rim is transformers on steroids meets godzillas father who is far more superior
the film has action that has never before seen its minblowing
the film is a visual mastery
the film is a slow and clichad in parts but this film is pure cinematic entertainment so you forget the few hiccups
the films story is about how how monster called kiagges come from the bottom of the ocean and are destroying the world
humans than create jaggars robot machines to combat the monsters
overall it a must watch for all who love action and sci fi films
also i recommend you watch the film in 3d because the film is way more appealing when you feel like you are in the battle
absolutely best action movie so far this year there is something different from other boring same old story movies like transformers iron man 3 franchises
not so good story and not so meaningful that where the alien came from and the actions taken from human world and how they are fighting them but start up action scenario no boring drama made movie something different and very excited that team play and showed whole world human technology power you probably accept that best movie so far human against alien second biggest monster movie as i remember after godzilla and soundtrack in every scenario matched so
after all hadnt time to think about root cause and other things watching the movie for 2 hours p
i must be honest
after watching this movie i felt bad for not watching it on the big screen
simply put this movie is filled with action packed awesomeness
if youre a scifi buff or anime buff or even a rpg buff youll love this movie even more
dont want to spoil the movie for anyone so i wont go into details but from beginning to end this movie had me in the edge of my seat
im not one to buy hard copies of movies because i dont like rewatching them since i already know whats going to happen
lets just say ill be ordering a blueray copy
plus i want to help support movies like this
oh forgot to mention if you like any of the mech assault games or even have interest in the upcoming titanfall game youll love this movie
but also if you like no bullshit action packed movies
this movie is what would happen if you gave an eightyearold one hundred million dollars and told him to make a film
nothing makes sense about this movie
the entire thing is ridiculous from plot holes to simple visual errors
but at the end of this movie you wont have that feeling of wasted time
its like watching a transformers movie that has a purpose
if you ever wanted to witness a lifesized actionfigure world with silly robots impossible technology watch this movie
all around family fun one of the few silly and pointless movies id allow my kids to watch
this is just good old fashioned entertainment
i didnt dislike this movie giant robots against giant monsters is a fun idea that isnt like anything else being done right now
but the dialog needed to be smarter
i think there is more going on with the characters than i picked up from one viewingi gotta believe del toro put in some layers you have to dig for
but on the surface it comes off like some of the sillier action movies of the early 80s
some notes for the sequel 1
hire a writer that speaks the language the film gets made in 2
get someone in there that understands color designmaybe you could sell some toys if everything wasnt all the same shade of bluegray 3
dont bother having the giant robots throw the giant monsters when theyre fighting in water
it doesnt hurt
show more damage
its cool when body parts break off
kthnx j
g
overall a good watch switch off brain and get the pop corn and the beers in
this is a typical american we can save the world dont worry action film
and yes the effects are spectacular and yes it is godzilla fighting transformers so should be every kid born before the 1990s dream film
if you like that sort of thing fill your boots
however there are a few minor niggles that confused me a little such as why do they stop building these giant machines and then build a wall
you have just seen these alien monsters walk through several very large steel buildings without breaking stride and then someone says lets build a wall to stop them no weapons are added to this wall its just a big wall
that seems very stupid if you ask me and i am proved correct when a wall is breached within 2 minutes
also where do they get all this steel titanium etc from
and why do the heads of the machines have to drop onto the body in such a spectacular way
poor script even poorer acting and no sense of direction throughout
the problem with this film is that the characters just arent believable and you need some credibility to pull off an action yarn like this
for all its faults cloverfield held my attention much more than this tired effort
i watched it with my 17 year old son who gave up on it about 13 of the way through
i must confess that i almost followed him as the first half has very little going for it as it tries desperately to make us care about the characters and little else
the two scientists are the least believable of all and i got seriously annoyed with the both of them
it picks up a little in the second half but not enough to pull you back in
all in all a tired boring noisy mess
im amazed that the film is so highly rated by others here
oh i almost forgot the cgi is passable but only just
its destined to be forgotten
it has a good score here on imdb but again it proved to be highly overrated
i gave it a 5 because it would have been much better and contains no serious logical mistakes
it looks like the creators wanted some easy money so they mixed everything together robots some fightings aliens etc
but
the story is poorly written and basically follows a well known and unbelievingly boring and predictable path
no surprises at all
its like nowadays no one really cares to write a good and exciting story they concentrate only on the cgi effects and they think the rest is not important
they copypaste it from other movies and thats it
apparently it looks working sadly
this was an overall great action scifi flick
i absolutely loved the cgi and fight scenes especially those underwater
highly recommended to anyone who likes a decent story line with mediocre character development
very little sexual nature to this film but loads of violence
my concern with the film and story is that there wasnt much detail spent in the early days of the jaegers or better yet the full stages of the kaiju
i believe that if pacific rim had been made into a television show perhaps even better if it happened now
showcasing each kaiju battle and follow around the crews of each jaeger that a lot more people could enjoy the wonderful idea behind the film and story itself
but hey its just an idea
the similarities between pacific rim and sharknado go far beyond their lithe telegenic screenplays and nuanced characterdriven plots
practically shakespearean in their worldviews and intricate family dynamics both movies will keep you on the edge of your seat as plot twists have you guessing right up until the end on the big who done it question
oh certainly firstrate special effects added to wellcrafted acting with so many layers of emotional depth youd think its respective sea creatures were pipelined straight from citizen kane or perhaps the godfather or maybe a bit of both
really whos to say which picture will garner the most golden globes or academy awards this year
my bets on ilms splendorous work in pacific rim although ive got to say sharknados sharks really projected tremendous amounts of fearinducing horror that werent quite the equal of the more animeinflected denizens of pacific rim
i suggest you see both films in a double feature and decide for yourself
i really loved charlie in green street hooligans
his charisma influenced the attention on the screen every time he was on
imho better than wood but this one
he wasnt good
he cant play relentless hero
its just not him
this movie has some great effects and decent back story but he cant at least for now play the main roles similar to these ones
loved charlie day and ron perlman but i like them in every movie though they seem too out of place
if this movie was shot in batman style it would have been much better
never the less it still worth to watch
at least once
del toro can create spectacular scenes but at least in this case not a good actors choice
its a well rounded movie it has great action hints of humor at the right moments and has a little bit of everything
unlike most movies i like the female main characters personality and how she is portrayed in the movie
i also like how shes asian
they dont over sexualize mako or the relationship between her and raleigh which i enjoyed a lot
i loved the relationship between the two how deeply they connected and how their relationship developed
they dont over emphasize things in the movie which i really liked
they give you just enough to be satisfactory and hint at the rest they dont overwhelm you with certain aspects of the movie
this movie isnt mind blowing life changing or touches your heart and pulls at its strings but overall it was enjoyable and entertaining
it was a nice movie to watch and nothing about it really frustrated me or made me want to change it
its like goldilocks and the three bears its the porridge thats not to hot and not to cold its just right
short and sweet this isnt romeo amp juliet war amp peace or any epic piece of fiction like those
it is a big budget smackdown
the battles in the cities around the world are pretty cool but i would have enjoyed a more international flavors to it
but thats just my opinion
transformersgodzilla mash up with shadows of japanese robot fighting stories
the jeagers robots themselves have plenty to look at on the big screen in some shots you get a good if quick look at the mechanics inside sort of like the brilliant work done on the first live action transformers movie
characters are light and not completely original but what is nowadays
good special effects and plenty of action
a few nice non action character scenes to remind you of the stakes
music is alright but not rousing
i give it 810
this movie was the worst movie
i have ever seen stone
i hated it so much that im going to write the worst review for it ever
it is not even worth mentioning
im just trying to write enough lines here now
i dont even care anymore
i hope this is enough
for fs sake
i wish i could just go on forever and ever
i wonder how much more long now i really dont feel like doing this anymore at all
taking way too long now
i wonder can
i speed this up anyhow
oh my god you are f with me aint ya
i need to write like this ten f lines what a f bull s is this this movie doesnt deserve more than one line if even that
could you please just let me go already i want to go back home
please i promise i wont tell anyone i just really want to go now i promise
i ill do anything just please can i go its hurting me please let me just go now
a visual treat i must say and a fairly good movie
seriously i expected something bigger from the director who made me believe that fairy tales could be serious in pans labyrinth
the movie certainly is bigger technically but falls behind novelty
everybody has known transformers battleship etc
and not again with this combats
ive seen these animated combats way before in 1998 when i played metal fatigue game
actors did a fair job sailing along the script and i disagree with the other reviewer who was telling that actors were bad
the first 10 minutes was excellent and i felt like m gonna see something like district 9 but the movie lost pace in the middle and got highly predictable something like a lunch with a good soup and a bad main course
the bottom line is that the movie is visually appealing with nicely written dialogs to match but falls behind any new essence
if you want some uber fantastic cgi action packed monster pounding rockets blasting loud booms and explosions then youll love this movie because it does that very well
if youre expecting a deep and well crafted story youll be a bit disappointed
the strong point of this movie is the struggle of the human race against all odds
the courage bravery and comradery that everyone has to go through to make it together
it displays a lot of inspirational moments and makes you remember who you are as a human being weak and fragile
we may not be much alone but together we can overcome anything
an inspirational action packed robots and aliens movie in summary
not a romantic or a movie filled with plots and twists
movie is obviously geared towards younger audiences
i dont even know where to start with pacific rim the story wasnt great but it was really cool the visuals are amazing
the monsters look really bad ass the acting is really good the fight scenes are shot really well like its not all shaky and crazy in your face like michael bays movies i spent most of this movie with my jaw on the floor i guess the only bad thing i can say about it is after the 1st part it takes awhile to start again watch it you wont be disappointed
but dont worry its not all mindless action like the plot isnt great but its cool enough to suck you in the only thing you need to know is its kinda long so if you dont like long movies dont see but its worth it
i was lucky to catch an advance screening of pacific rim amp i went into pacific rim excited ready to see giant robots take on 3000 ton monsters amp left completely satisfied
this movie turned out better than i expected pacific rim is the best summer movie so far
the action delivers whenever theres a kaijujaeger fight scene you wont be able to take your eyes off the screen
great visuals
good plot
solid acting
the character development is fair
pacific rim is overall a fungood time movie that will bring out the inner 9 year in ya
if youre going into pacific rim expecting an oscar worthy performance amp plot well sorry
guillermo del toro hit it out of the park with pacific rim amp as i mentioned the visuals are great so definitely give this one a look at in 3d amp if theres an imax near your area go for it
p
s stay for the after credits
do not do it
do not waste one second of your time watching this garbagecut the grass watch paint dry anything but if you do feel the inclination to watch you have been warned
bad acting clicha after clicha
no storylineno feel for the characters i thought i had been back transported back to the seventies b movie
words fail me as to how bad this movie is
how it gets the rating it has is beyond me
cant put any spoilers as you cant spoil it any more than just watching it
imagine the worst movies you have ever seen and put it to number 1
trying my hardest to say anything positive to say
maybe one good thing is you know what words are coming next before it is delivered
oh and the top gun scene lol if you watch it you will know what i mean
guillermo del toro has an amazing visual sense
his movies are beautiful to watch
however this was visually interesting but otherwise shallow and plot less
this felt like a live action version of neon genesis evangelion
the character were all 1 dimensional archetypes
other than fight scenes in cgi  which i didnt find that interesting theres not much to the film
there was not even an interesting backstory on the kaiju
their dinosaur form and adaptation to battles was kind of interesting but wasnt explored
the entire plot and ending was completely obvious you knew who would fall in love who would nobly sacrifice themselves who was going to die etc
i dont normally review films on this site but had to say just how bad this film is
what a total waste of money they blew on this piece of trash
it is filled with nothing but cheesy oneliners amp almost every movie clicha ever
if you havent seen it just think of power rangers with a bigger budget
all the characters were so typical and annoying and a lot of the movie didnt even make sense
one second the giant robots are deep underwater then they stand up and the water is only round their ankles
wtf
the drivers of the main robot are your stereotypical usa jarheads with an attitude and the russians amp japanese are so clichad too also they threw a classic nerdy british guy in there as the scientist
omfg this is probably the most unoriginal film ever
anyway in short it sucked
theres not much to say this movie is exactly what it poses for
oltimers that grew up watching mecha animes like me will love it
kids are just kids and will adore the fabulous action sequences
btw if you did not know what mecha isyou probably wont enjoy it as much
lots and lots of nerdy details that will get your attentionif you are a nerd of course something that essentially caught mine is that the romantic element in this flick is completely nonformulaic for hollywood but just makes perfect sense for animes
technically speaking actingdirectingquite good sfxmusicup to industry standards cgivery good plotstoryentertainingly silly
there is a 1530min period in the middle of the film that drags a bit but thats ok
enjoy
this movie is simply mind blowing it makes you feel like you are actually part of the action
and come on who doesnt want to see huge freaking robots collide with colossal kaiju
the fights are nothing exciting the collision between the jaegers and the kaiju are awesome
the story is nothing short of brilliant
the carefully thought out names and backgrounds of the jaegers and even their powers adds a another dimension of awesome
the movie brings out the inner nerd in most the others who would disagree all i have to say is this movie is boss end of story
this is a must watch
even though it is a happy ending
a sequel would be pure epicness
