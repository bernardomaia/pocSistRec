im not going to sugar coat it this movie stinks
after the gutbusting hilarity of the 2009 original this comedy franchise has been struck down with a severe case of sequelitis
the carboncopy second instalment was stale for the most part yet still managed a handful of laughs thanks to the general funniness of zach galifianakis socially demented alan this episode however is almost completely devoid of humour
the writing has become increasingly reliant on the natural charisma of the headlining star trio  with the plot here being laborious and woefully lazy  and the irritating chow ken jeong the weakest link in part one inexplicably gets even more screen time to screech and make our eardrums bleed
if it werent for an amusing set piece atop las vegas caesar palace hotel and a bestforlast gag during the end credits i wouldve given this the one star treatment
i was desperately hoping this series would regain some form and finish with a bang but unfortunately the wolfpacks last adventure barely makes a whimper
i decided to go and see this film as i am a fan of the first film in the franchise  the second was not enjoyable but i had hoped the conclusion would be a return to form
i was hugely disappointed by the lazy script cruel tasteless gags and the predictability of the film
i love comedies i have a sense of humour but i only laughed once or twice
the cruel animal death jokes killed the mood of the film
they were cheap and quite shocking
i know these films are supposed to be shocking but it is not clever or witty to make jokes out of serious issues like cockfighting  i didnt want to watch a rooster get slowly smothered by an imbecilic asian man
i wanted to enjoy a fun experience like i did with the first hangover film
mr chow is a hugely irritating monotonous character whose only purpose seems to be to hurl out nonsense at every opportunity
the hangover part iii will ruin the experience of the first film for you  if you want a film that is original and good fun  avoid this shameless grab for cash
i can honestly say this was a chore to watch

i am so disappointed
i absolutely loved the hangover parts 1 amp 2 and was so excited about the 3rd installment even going to see the midnight screening but was so let down
i still dont even understand what the writers were trying to do
were all the comedy writers in hollywood all sick at the exact same time this script was being written
worst of all no one was hungover
how can you name a movie the hangover when it involves no drinking stupidity or a hangover
the only part i can honestly say i loved was the short after wedding skit after the credits
that is the movie i wanted to watch along with everyone else in the cinema from what everyone started screaming at the screen
please make that into an 1 12 hour long film to regain the honor of a hangover movie coz what i watched was dismal at best
i could not believe how unfunny this movie was
i kept waiting for even a single joke to land
it was like they forgot what makes this kind of premise funny in the first place
it was truly awful and easily the worst movie of the year
the only laugh it got was when my wife and i both looked at each other and laughed that the movie was so unfunny
shame on you cast and director of the hangover iii
i want my money and time invested back
i texted all the people i love and care about and told them not to see this movie
this isnt even a rental
the title should never be mentioned in public ever again
the worst
as i am writing this i am still amazed how unfunny this movie was
it was like listening to a story from your grandma about how she went shopping at the grocery store
boring
i thought this movie was 2nd best possibly 1st in the trilogy
i hear the term no hangover thats why it sucked or it was lazy or unfunny but it was a serious dramacomedy the hangover series has a deep story in 3 it all comes together the movie was great i have no clue why people hate it but i recommend it
its a good time
also the hangover part 3 had a lot of original things from the first one so when people say it what out of plot or unoriginal then there solly mistaken great movie though i hate all the hate on it doesnt deserve the hate it was well done
it even had done good at the box office and some decent reviews so are these hate reviews all from one spam mer or
did anyone actually get drunk in the movie
why so many gratuitous killings
the only similarity between this rag and the previous hangover movies is the actors
just an awful movie
dont even rent this thing when its released
i expected more from the chow character but was greatly disappointed
alan
what happened to this character
actually none of the characters were as developed as the last movies
this is a major problem because we came to see the third installment hoping for a continuation of the previous two and were totally let down
the best parts of this movie must be in the blooper scenes or on the cutting room floor
as id mentioned dont even waste your time renting this when its released or buying it for that matter
this movie was not a bad movie at all
if you are willing to kick back for an afternoon and enjoy a flick this is the one
there is not a whole lot of expectations for this movie
yes the first one was great and the second  which wasnt bad either even though it was a copy and pastebarley made it through
this one takes on a whole new journey that gave a decent conclusion and we get more in depth with the characters
this movie still had decent comedy and a good story with references from the first 2
even chow has more screen time and we get one more wake up scene at the end with another misfortune
just watch it and dont expect too much
i thoroughly enjoyed this movie
while it was not as good as the first it still was a very funny and enjoyable movie
if you like the hangover series you will like this film
zach galafinakis once again stole the show and mr chow was also brilliant
again i do not know why there are so many negative reviews
of course this is no oscar winner but it was still a great comedy movie in my opinion
i enjoyed it a lot and have watched it several times since first seeing it
do not listen to all of these negative reviews go and watch it
i have come on imdb so many times to check a movie and see all then negative reviews and almost pass on watching a movie
dont let this happen with hangovver 3
excellent film

the wolf pack is back
this time they are going in to take care of one of their own alan zack galifianakis
he seems to have a lot of evil in his life and they want him to realize that he needs to cleanse himself of his life of drugs bad decisions and bad company
all is well until mr
chow ken jeong appears back on the scene
this time he is a man on the run and this makes for another mayhem adventure
lots of actions pack scenes where the gang gets close to the edge and back
doug even sparks a new love interest in cassie melissa mccarthy
lots of funny scenes and low brow references that have become a hallmark of the hangover series there is even a bit of a teaser for a continuing of the series in the end credits so stay tuned
could there be a hangover iv
who knows but for this one the wolf pack boys are back in town
well as a good cinema fan i get very disappointed with the part iii
part i and ii were really great excellent original and they deserved a big 10 for elevated the comedy films to a new and higher level of quality
but part iii thats nothing to do with the truly essence of hangover film concept
for me the best scene of this part iii is after the first credits in the end
can you believe in that
thats a scene truly hangover
im sorry to the producers but the rest of the film is bad with only a few little things of the genuine hangover because there werent no surprise scenes it was very forced jokes
they could keep the same story and do a better end with this team
okay first of all
i dont understand all the negative comments
people complained that the second movie was basically the same exact thing as the first
now you have people complain that its different
you cant have it both ways
that being said yes it was better than the second but by no means better than the first
instead of flash forwarding to after the hangover and retracing their steps the wolf pack go on a more traditional beginning to end journey
it wasnt predictable chow made sure of that it had some pretty dark contenthumor hello its rated r but most importantly it was funny
i was laughing literally the entire movie
appearances by john goodman and melissa mccarthy were just the icing on the cake
all in all  go see itrent itbuy it
whatever
and p
s
there is an actual hangover moment genuine to its predecessors  but you have to wait until after the credits to catch it
i felt the first one was good by the third movie they ran out of gas and ideas and just milked very lazy work on behalf of the writers
not worth watching in theaters best to wait until it comes out in dvd there was no creativity even the second was better
the movie did not provide any fresh or new ideas it lacked a good plot and it when it ended i said to myself this is it
i was expecting more out of the movie
it seems like they just rushed to get it done and finished and collected a pay check no passion in the movie at all
the first was was the greatest and the second one was pretty good but the third one bombed completely
look up phoning it in in the dictionary and the definition will now be not caring a bit about the quality of your work as in he writers and actors in hangover iii
this flick was worse than bad
not only was it completely unfunny unless a decapitated giraffe or killing dogs makes you giggle  which also makes you a psychopath it was offensive and stupid
the only reason i went was to see glimpses of my home town of las vegas
what a complete waste of time and money
avoid this piece of crap
the actors should be ashamed of themselves for agreeing to participate in this exploitive piece of excrement
it is only going to hurt their future careers i certainly will not go out of my way to see any of them in anything again
pu
what a stinker
the plot fits the hangover title but not because the events occurred due to a wild party but due to the events from the original
i love the performance of john goodman
the very last scene was the most funny part
asides from those two points the movie fell flat
there were no laughoutloud moments and some of the jokes fell flat i
e
decapitation
did bradley cooper even want to do this movie
he acted as if he was just going through the motions
melissa mccarthy is showing up everywhere so i understand why they added her to the movie but she didnt add anything to it
the movie focused way too much on chow portrayed by ken jeong and not the wolfpack
if you were bruised from part ii and are debating whether to go to the theater or wait for it to be available at home i recommend you wait to watch it at home
there are too many movies out or coming out that are worth the ticket price
so i just came from seeing the 1030am showing at arden fair and i gotta say all i could think about was walking out and having a cigarette
yes the movie had its few funny lines but nothing like the 1st or 2nd that were full of comedy
not a bad movie meaning ive seen worse but not the cant catch my breath comedy ive come to expect from the trilogy
the actors did great as always but the storyline did too much and made the funny guys almost extras to a poor movie
im sure many will run off to see this movie as i did but if i knew then what i know now id wait for it to come out to the redbox for 1 seriously
the upside since a refund isnt an option is im hoping walmart lowers the dvd price of ho2 to 5 to complete my collection since im clearly not interested in buying 3
your welcome in advance lol
noseriously

i thought that the hangover iii was a really good movie
from my opinion there were many scenes that were really funny
some people claim that there are inappropriate scenes where sex and drugs are involved but from just hearing the name hangover that should not be a surprise
if you enjoy comedies i would recommend you to watch this movie
i would not say it is one of the best and funniest movie i have ever seen but it is sure one of my top 10 on my list
however it lacks the charm that made the first hangover movie so good
this movie would be a perfect movie to watch when you are ridiculous hangover and feel to relax and watch a really good and funny movie
when i saw this movie i was excited to see it the hangover part 3yeah
you would think right
but when i saw it was humorless no plot and last but no least no hangover it was just trying to get money from chow who was even goofier in this one haha
i mean i think they could of done it a lot better
bradley cooper didnt seem happy to be in this movie at all
the acting was ok you could say
the plot was all over the place and like i said sadly no hangover just a completely pointless plot
it couldve been better about 100
the audience wants to see a hangover not something else of course that is why its called the hangover
the scenes couldve been better as well as the set and the scene where they were sneaking into the penthouse with the light flickering on and off and the way the camera was displayed was like what
do not waste your hard earned money on this load of garbage
just because you enjoyed the first movie does not mean this one is worth seeing
honestly dont even see it out of curiosity you will have wasted your time
all the remotely funny parts are blatantly shown in the trailer and the rest of the movie is a somewhat serious gold heist in which nothing is funny
i gave this movie a 5 because at least the production value was good and todd phillips at least tried to veer off from the original two scripts
i have seen some terrible movies in my day so i reserve my godawful rating for godawful movies
but um dont see this movie
its garbage wrapped in lies
endowed when selected to be shown in the buff than then the men in something such as boogie nights or forgetting sarah marshall
dont the guys that hang out in the hangover series have any self respect
what kind of message do they think they are sending to the worldwhich accounts for more than half of the eyes on the screen for any u
s
flickwhen they denigrate american manhood in such a fashion
perhaps it would not be so bad if such a bon mot came out during the first five or ten minutes of a feature
but when it the very last image of the entire film that the audience is left with it is underlined with an importance that otherwise might not be attached to it
further when such a joke from mother nature involves one of the five main characters it carries a lot more weight with the rest of the universe than if it was just some extras lame inch
with all of the potential threats currently facing america we cannot afford to let our guard down as the hangover people do
wholl have the last laugh now
i made the huge mistake of getting my hopes high for this movie
i waited the whole time to see a humorous scene where i could laugh like the other parts of hangover but instead it ended with a very disappointing note
maybe i had my hopes too much for this sequel
its not a comedy movie but instead its genre should be drama
the only positive part about the movie is mr
chow ken jeong
he just stole the show from the wolf pack totally
if there is a hint of smile in your face after seeing the movie is because of this guy
i wonder what would happen if his role wasnt characterized properly
overall my rating is very low for this movie because hangover was one of my favorite movies of all time
lets face it
there was never any for sequels for this concept
part 2 proved it and in part 3 they seem to accept it by announcing they quit
the movie revolves around thrills and action which work to a small extent by themselves has its funny parts but never really goes anywhere rather it goes downhill and by the end i wasnt expecting anything good so i wont say it let me down
i personally feel the chow was a bit overdone here
dont know the idea but it never really worked for me
dont go by the hangover title
its a misfit
just average thriller with a little humor here and there
at best worth a watch on tv if you got nothing else to do on a weekend
else skip this one
wow
what a delight
fun
fun
fun
laugh after laugh this on the heels of the huge disappointment from man of steel
the story is such a farce but the lines and acting are just pure adult humor
and we can sure use some of that in this crazy world today
compared to due date which i likedcause rd jr
is just too irresistible for me this is ongoing hilarious
and the comedy timing was so keen by all the actors
i loved it
wanted to stay and it again
i would go see it again next week but i think id better save  for the dvd and be sure to get digital copy for my itunes library
i have the help and due date in itunes which is so great when your on an airline and try to watch some dumb movie on a 8in screen from 15ft awayi can watch something i like right in front of me
thank you hangover iii
if youre a fan of this series
youll surely gonna relate to it amp find really funny
movie has its moments where youll laugh out loud
an its a fun flick to with with friends
and it has nostalgic value
perfect end to a series
a heartfelt movie made professionally amp it really has soul amp it has its own value
which make it more likable
when youre drunk or high man you cant miss this one

the hangover part iii in my opinion was wronged in criticism was massacred for no reason  the film is much higher than the second film second only to the first  the plot tried to be different and in fact is quite different from other films they do not have a hangover this film and doug back to being a key part  chow still have more prominence in the plot and along with alan are the characters that steals the show  they both are the funniest characters in the film  the soundtrack is good  the cast is the same the direction is already better than the second film  i found the 30 minutes very good early  after the film of a fallen  and the last moments of the film are very good in my opinion  the hangover part iii is better than its predecessor  and is second only pro first film with a simple script a little different from the others  i thought this movie was massacred by the critics without deserves
note 7
8
alan stu and phil are set yet again to save doug by finding mr chow
so there are three things about this movie that i really didnt like
first there was the same plot about doug missing
damn that guy must have played only for a few minutes at the beginning and at the end to every movie
secondly there were no jokes
maybe the third hangover was not meant to be a comedy because it was more like an action gangster movie which is not necessarily bad but its the third movie of a successful comedy series why change that
and finally there was no hangover
why call it that and then replace it with a whole new storyline
that doesnt make sense
so the movie mainly concentrates on alan and his character another puzzle to solve that will never be solved as the movie never goes deep enough to actually deal with its characters
so 4 out of 10
the film is really loved by millions
it does not often happen
many people watched the film there is a great desire to continue it
and despite the fact that the creators are not in a hurry to shoot a sequel
many people continue to ask them about it in different ways
many people remember the feeling of pleasure at watching and people want to experience it again
the film carries a sea of positive energy here and fun
the film is not over and another part needs to be done
always with their favorite characters
hold a vote for a good movie
and suddenly we hear the filmmakers
vote for the hangover 4
we are sure to hear it

i believe that haters missed the scene after credit
it was so awesome
grab a dvd guys
the main theme has indeed changed a lot
however there are adventures as the old movies
but there was no hangoverbut here was super cool scenes in the movie
the caesars palace scene was one of the best scenes in the movietotally hilarious
the scene which the boy get shades is legendary
i loved this movie
all characters were funny
the movie deserves at least a 6
8
its cool and haters who missed the post credit scene
it would be better if you grab a unrated dvd and watch that scene
the movie name is the hangover but the problem is that there wasnt any hangover in the movie and thats what makes this one a lot less funny than the previous two
it was not as good as the first
he had high expectations for this movie but when i went to the cinema to see it hoping for more do not say that was not good but i missed most of history argument
the film film still managed to get the whole room to laugh not to mention the actors that are a spectacle
but i was curious to know what happened at the end
the actors are comic where during the whole movie make us laugh the story is very basic but not counting on it makes us laugh chinese is a mesh which makes us laugh so stupid and i am just writing all gibberish to fill sausage because it is ten lines need to be able to pass it if it has some connection
because at this point i could write ten lines
