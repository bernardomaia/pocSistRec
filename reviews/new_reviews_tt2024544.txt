i just saw this at lff
it is a brilliant piece of cinema
clearly its central theme is slavery and the depravity human nature can so easily reach but it has many other small moments that trigger thoughts about wider issues  the role of religion being one for example
it is violent and in some respects awful to watch but this is the story of solomon northup told truthfully
there is nothing saccharine about the way steve mcqueen presents this and that is what makes it so astonishing
you cry because what you witness is truly terrible not because the violins are out and the directors tugging on your heart strings
all the acting is first rate as is the score by hans zimmer
this really should be essential viewing for everyone old enough to understand it
before i started reading reviews on imdb i actually thought the cinema was a form of entertainment
now i realise i was totally wrong
a silly comedy like meet the fockers or legally blonde is condemned as a complete waste of time
i want my life back but a film lasting two and a half hours which shows a man kidnapped into slaverybeaten half to death and then rescued is considered worthy of 5 stars
if i had gone to the cinema alone i would have left after 15 minutes
what sort of people can enjoy watching other people being beaten senseless for two and a half hours
the only thing that kept me awake was the hope that the slaves would rise up and cut those nasty white throats
no such luck
the slave was rescued
a weak ending to to a weak pointless film
the movie was a dreadful racist piece of propaganda from victim nation
the whipping scenes from billy budd or master and commander were more to the narrative point than any of the gratuitous beating meted out in 12 years
the premise that white people are inherently ignorant and evil and black people are mistreated saints is a blatant attack on the 100 years of civil rights progress in this nation
how could the average rating for this film be an 8
5 which is higher than citizen kane paths of glory m lawrence of arabia amadeus 2001a space odyssey or the bridge on the river kwai
we walked out after 15 minutes
i recall doing the same after watching kevin spacey jerking off at the onset of another academy award darling american beauty
no
this is not oscar caliber material sorry
so we have this virtuoso violinist that is kidnapped enslaved and tortured
good story
but what the heck is mcqueen doing
minutes pass with images of trees and landscapes
remember tree of lifeprobably not
not to mention the lifeless performance by our protagonist
i do like him as an actor but he pales in comparison to the supporting cast
yes fassbender is good but darn that paul dano is something else
watch out for him in the future
see there will be blood
the topic of slavery is of course a terrible chapter in our history but the movie is simply not up to the task of relaying this emotion
its rare that a movie lives up to its hype even rarer that the hype is transcended by the actual achievement
12 years a slave does both
aided by powerful performances and cinematography director mcqueen exposes the barbarity of dehumanisation of treating people as property
reviews focus on the brutality on display and its true that the film is not easy to watch with its powerful juxtaposition of sublime scenery and human degradation
but to me the final scene is the most powerful of all we are party to the kind of raw emotion that in the hands of lesser artists could easily descend into tawdriness or sentimentality
here as in the rest of the film it is raised up high as high as cinematic art can go
i put off watching this movie when it came out because of the hype
now its calmed down a bit i wanted to see what all the fuss was about
i wasnt expecting the film to be incredibly boring
i struggled to keep any interest whatsoever in any of the very turgid story telling
i remember watching roots many years ago and being captivated by the emotional drama
this film was so childishly written and presented that any emotional impact was entirely lost
it had a littlehouseontheprairie simplicity that grated in every scene
i half expected pa to appear playing his fiddle along with the main character
pas emotional depth would have fitted right in with this dreadful movie
chiwetelu ejiofor seemed as bemused by this film as i was
he was wooden but then he had very little to get stuck into with northup
he had no emotional connection with any other character in the film and i really couldnt care less whether he lived or died
i wasted hours watching this that i cant get back
im only glad i didnt pay for it
thiis film won oscarsrated 8
3 and listed in imdb top 250
so i have some expectations in this film and guest appearances by bradd pitt and cumberbatch increased them
but finally i felt cheated
no doubt acting is amazing
each actor gave their best performances
especially hero ejiofor
he is amazing
and oscar winner nupita too gave her best
none of the actors will disappoint you
but what i felt is there is a lot of unnecessary violenceblacks may be threat ed in such a ways those days but is it necessary to show whites sadism against blacks in that way
ok coming to takingi felt like this story took place just10 years back
not a great art used
and camera most of the times stared at hero for long times which made this film unbearably bore
runtime is 2 plus hours and climax made this film totally worst
i am highly disappointed with film
we decided to see 12 years a slave after it won the academys best picture award
i cannot express how disappointed we were
neither the directing the acting nor the story itself were even close to best picture quality
it was slow wooden and full of clichas
chiwetel ejiofors acting was nothing special i got tired of his perpetually pained expression filling the screen
why didnt he age or grow thinner
did they have to portray all slave owners as sadistic
and that final scene was so painfully stiff and staged it seemed as though the director and screen writer just ran out of energy
we were just glad to see it end
clearly this weak film was honored for political reasons not artistic
shame on the academy
the most overrated movie of 2013
the movie shows you the psychological horror of slavery with the protagonist not really taking a part in anything
there is no lesson to be learned here just showing how horrible things were for african americans at the time
feels very forced and tedious and five minutes in it you will know exactly whats gonna happen
unimaginative or creative at all
i think the director wanted to say feel pain cause i said so
i wont take the time to build characters or weave an interesting narrative
the movie says lets paint everything with a big general brushwhich is ok for action movies but not for a historical drama
just watched this true story of slavery with my movie theatreworking friend
it depicts the abduction of soloman northup chiwetel ejiofor from his family in new york state to the bayous of louisiana my home state where he is made a slave
director steve mcqueen does a fine job depicting how harrowing the experience is and provides catharsis when the ending comes
he also does a nice job of providing some background of other fellow slaves like that of the doomed patsy
if anyone who paid to see this expected to watch brad pitt in a big role they must have been disappointed to see him in only a couple of scenes but he does well in those and i have to assume most of the public was enthralled by the story to not even care by that point
anyway i highly recommend 12 years a slave if you want to be challenged as a viewer by the way someone is depicted as the main character is here
oh and nice shots of the louisiana locations
the film was powerful and a goog cast but i give it only a 4 there were things that bothered me
there were too many times the camera left a scene to another while audio from the previous scene were still playing
although being taken and in slavery for 12 years we never got a sense of time passing
he never mentioned today is my birthday or it was x years i was taken and sold into slavery at 90 minutes i think it would have been a good film at 134 minutes it was torture to watch
it was a good cast and super acting i thought the scenes of whipping and beatings were going to be difficult to watch i did not find them disturbing
this is a terrible film for many reasons and i could go on at length about the oversimplified characterisation the tellussomethingwedontknow of the story and the dismal terance mallickstyle extremely lengthy lingering shots must equal something profound but none of those things would really matter its only a film right
except that this nonsense will be viewed by some people as a true reflection of us society
for godsake this ridiculous depiction of how the northern states of the us was an idyllic utopia for black people and only the nasty evil south was racist is not even true now in 2014
never mind how much this distorts the reality of the early 19th century
you can go to phildelphia get on a bus see the black homeless lying in the street see how still america has not made amends for the abomination that was slavery
race riots and the fight for equality and end to racism were late 20th century events  and yet this disgraceful garbage sets out to rewrite history and paint the northen states of the usa in an absurdly egalitarian light
this film made my eyes bleed it was that bad
if you have been alive for more than 10 minutes you will know how bad slavery was and all this film does is re iterates what everyone already knows
theres no plot storyline character development nothing
i am baffled how anybody can like seeing a black man get beaten for 2 hours and say that its a good viewing disgusting
i had hugely high expectations of this film due to the media hyping it up to being the best movie ever made but quite frankly it was one of the worst films i have ever seen
no surprise either that brad pitt helped direct it and he turned up an hour before the end to become the hero
overall a hugely disappointing movie and i would not this to my worst enemy
same old story
poor black people exploited by white man
how many hundreds of thousands times or million times we need to repeat
nothing new
painfully slow
i hate when oscar is given because of politics
definitely dont deserve oscars not to mention imdb score
reflecting on the obama era in a symposium on 12 years a slave mcqueen said the problem is when hes not the president anymore will these films still exist
thats hardly the problem
the problem comes when we go to these movies have a good cry and imagine that through some kind of hollywood magic they will bring about change
look at the rubberband effect from the night of the inauguration of barack obama to today
there was this enormous sense of finally
well finally what
finally we have a black man in the white house who at least on some level has an understanding of the black experience in america
but that in no way makes this a postracial society
its amazing how a movie like this could win so much oscarsi donti cant even guess whythe movie is the worst ever to meam thinking maybe it might be because of of that actor but i dont just get itas for me its a moviemovies like this e
g american hustle amp all lord of the rings dont deserve a spot here on imdbbut theres a saying that a mans food is another mans poison
but why would a movie like this get top ratings it amaze me a lottoo much but if anybody could explain am good with thatits really a tiring movie its a very tiring movie and i really wanna know whats great about it
got a problem with that contact me via twitter iamowomizz
was really looking forward to this having read critics reviews
however while there is no doubt this depicts the terrible practices of slavery it is a horrid way to spend a saturday night  and to what effect
steve mcqueen the director not the great actor whose fame he is possibly benefiting fromundoubtedly knows how to create emotion in the crudest of ways using scenes which would abhor any fair person
however there is very little signs of skillful film making just a formulaic hitting of peoples emotional and moral buttons
we came out feeling drained like after the worst day in 10 years at work or worse
would not recommend friends pay to feel the same
can not imagine a mental state where someone would see this and feel better
advice avoid  please let me know if anyone felt different after seeing
i found this movie about as realistic as a muffets movie
every slave seemed to have an oxford education which made it hard to believe
dont waste your money or time
i can not believe it is up for an oscar when there were so many better movies out there
i still can not get over all of the great reviews i have read concerning this movie am i the only person that got this
i saw this with two friends that had the same feelings as myself and if you look at the top movies at the theater right now you will see it is not even in the top five
this should tell you what the people really think of it
so if you must go see it but keep an open mind and think for yourselves
it doesnt seem very real
i was hoping for much more  sadlyweve seen it all before
since the brilliant and aweinspiring rootsnothing in this genre has been at all special and 12 years a slave is no exception
as unexciting as it is predictablethis movie gives us nothing new and just retreads old ground
weve seen enough of preemancipation stories
we know what a terrible time slaves in america had without constant reminders like this
black folk have enough reason to hate white folk without stirring up hackneyed old stories
if you can watch this the whole way through without falling asleep waiting for something exciting to happen then good for you
giving this movie top marks just because of feelings of guiltif you are white or because of solidarity and mutual hatred of the slavers if you are black is a naive decision
this boring piece of americana will soon be forgotten
as the song goes
tell me the same old story
the amazing true story of a man being abused because he is black
look if you do not like violence in movie then i do not see why you would like this one just because it really happened
this make the texas chainsaw massacre
if you dont like looking at blood and gore
then you dont like looking and blood a gore period
why should it matter if it happened
this movie does not deserve 8
1 it is awful
it is boring
and it is hard to watch
it has no entertainment value
it is junk
it is very badly written
the actor wasted there talent being in this movie
just because it is based on true story does not make it good
this is one of the worst movies ever
do not see it
dont get me wrong i feel very sorry for the man who wrote the book
for me being only 15 years old i thought this film would be boring like any other documentary
however this movie was extremely well put together and it kept me engaged throughout the entire two hours
i especially like how michael fassbender played his role in this movie
he showed so much emotion and it was believable
also i like how brad pitt was portrayed as some sort of charming hero
benedict cumberbatch was a very favorable character as always
chiwetel was very exceptional at playing his role
he also showed a mass amount of emotion which made the film once again believable
however the ending was sort of cheesy and i didnt know who was who
anyways im definitely watching this and buying it when it comes out on dvd
this movie was a big disappointment and after seeing it we didnt think it deserved the oscar for best picture
too many pointless silences when they could have spent the time developing the characters and their relationships with each other
what about solomons family
the whites in the movie over acted and it was like watching a high school play
the accents were ridiculous especially brad pitts one note overdone southern accent when he supposed to be canadian
his dialog with michael fassbenders slave owner character was absurd and unrealistic
his hero stand would not have been tolerated
frankly i came away from this finding it hard to believe this was actually written by a slave
too many pieces dont fit together of a survivors account
this is the first review ive ever posted but i saw this last night with a friend and we were both pretty disappointed
this is nowhere near the caliber of a color purple
the story felt somewhat disjointed and i just didnt feel most of the characters
michael fassbender was excellent
the girl who played patsy was quite good but her part was really not big enough to warrant an oscar
chiwetel who i like a lot just didnt quite get the ball past the goal line
the complexity of emotion that one would expect from his character wasnt quite flushed out
the final scene felt restrained and unrealistic to me
i cannot believe that this won best picture
my advice  save your money and wait until it comes out on cable
i hate to disagree with most of humankind but i did not like this film
i understand that it was based on a true story but dud the characters have to be so onedimensional
the plot line is predictable and i could recite most of the dialog before it was spoken
i think the worst aspect of this film was the direction
if he were still alive robert altman could have given some sage advice to the director
his scenes went on forever and he seemed not to know when enough was enough
short cuts would have been wise
i did make it to the end of the movie but i dont really know how
good thing i rented it from netflix and saved myself several dollars and some time
too bad hopefully this years crop of oscars contenders will be an improvement
12 years a slave is one of those movies on the borderline between big budget and just plain boring
while the intentions may have been good the only thing i came away with was the idea that even slavery was something that could be overcome with a lot of hard work and some unbelievable luck its ejiofors lackluster performance and the ridiculously lavish look and feel of the movie that undermines whatever serious message or insights the filmmakers may have had in mind
not once during the course of the movie did i believe what i was seeing it has an almost overfed television quality to it not unlike django unchained for instance
the hype turns out to have been just that
ok i accepted pulp fiction losing and brokeback mountain losing
but for 12 years a slave to win
i ask that the academy to start letting the general public to start voting
what a travesty the academy has always while out of touch
got caught up in period pieces
the wolf of wall street easy clean winner american hustle runner up dallas buyers club even better than this
first and foremost for those including the academy that dont know 20 bull whip strikes will not leave that on your back as a mark try at least 200 which never happened
the movie preys on our conscience but it does a poor storytelling
it was a horrible thing that happened but we know this its boring in general the story has been told before ever heard of roots
my former favorite actor brad pitt who produced and so cleverly inserted himself into hero in this film has been dismissed for using a period piece to win best picture
the film is a joke it was purposely only made to win best picture and you academy fell for it again
i could not believe the extent to which this film was honoured at the 2014 oscars
i found its directorial handling to be flat and pedestrian and even boring in parts
the film consisted of scene after scene without conveying any real sense of movement tension and development in the story as a key illumination to the american history of slavery in the years leading to the american civil war and the eventual emancipation of slaves in the united states of america
contrary to received wisdom i found chiwetel ejiofors performance as solomon wooden in the extreme  as though he was sleepwalking throughout unlike his brilliant performance in kinky boots
ms lupita nyongo ran away with the film with her heartrending performance as patsey
after watching 12 years a slave with my family we all agreed that this film is a must see for any american
while it is awfully sad and hard to watch at times it is rightfully so
as george santayana once saidthose who cannot learn from history are doomed to repeat it
its important for people to understand that slavery is part of our american history or else we may be doomed to repeat such atrocities
this movie transcends time and is able to bring the viewer back to a time and place that most history text books would like to skip over
part way through the movie i even realized that i was instinctively scared when a white person showed up on screen
this is the kind of experience everyone needs to even begin to understand what antebellum america may have been like for a slave
im gonna give this movie a 5 because i am really on the fence about the whole movie and how i should rate it and now i will explain why
this movie in an artistic format was a goddamn masterpiece and deserves a 10 for the realism and emotional power and art but when it comes to being an actual movie this sucked
now im not trying to say that because i encourage slavery i am saying this because at the end this movie was all based off of a stupid book and there was no point to the whole story considering the people who put the man in slavery never got charged or caught or anything
so basically my question is what was the point
this was the worst thing i have ever seen in my life well maybe not as bad as worlds greatest dad with robin williams but still
how can hollywood even let this through
they completely wasted amazing actors and ruined a good book this should have stayed in the pages instead of staying on the screen for a damn good reason
alright by saying this movie has no action of course this kinda movie wont really have the same action as a movie about super heroes
but there was literally nothing interesting about this movie it was very slow paced with only a couple of good scenes
although the movie was incredibly well filmed and had great scenery landscapes and everything from that aspect was very well taken care of
but the story as a whole didnt really seem appealing
the ending was kinda random as well wanted to see more indepth background of the slave owners maybe other slaves but it was only centered around solomon which is fine but for a movie that long it gets a little bit too boring and hard to sitthrough
the story could have been way more diverse hence making the movie more complex and so straight forward after watching it you literally have nothing to think about just like
meh a cool movie
the cinematography is great a pretty meaningful artsy long shots a but this film could have been so much more
i live in bristol a town built on slavery both black and before that white which struggles to come to understand its past and the way people behaved a this film simply didnt engage on that level
i didnt feel any great empathy for any of the characters their motivations werent explored at any depth it didnt really raise even the most obvious questions of the way people behaved beyond the most superficial level
and yet it has been really warmly received a maybe its the power of political correctness or could it be a commentary on a nation that still hasnt yet the maturity to come to terms with its roots
id give it a miss
i am going to be short and sweet with this review and say that this movie is absolutely awful
i decided to watch this movie because of all the hype and attention that was brought upon this movie
unfortunately what i got was poor plot little character development and scenes that made you want to leave the room
lets be honest it is not necessary to incorporate a 5 minute scene of ejiofor staring into the distance
it is absolutely 100 boring and left me appalled on how this won best picture
the only reason why i gave this film a 3 was because of the superb acting by lupita nyongo who gave the movie a small dose of hope but it didnt last very long
ultimately i will never watch this movie ever again and i am utterly shocked that this won best picture
movies like captain phillips and dallas buyers club should have earned more recognition for their accomplishments not this
if you havent seen the soloist and django unchained then you might enjoy this film
the title could be as easy as 1 year a slave
when i was watching the film  the 12 years were not there no matter how boring were the repetitive scenes
the plot is weak
performance of the main character lacks in character development equal from start till end
instead of picking a violin not so far from a cello like in the soloist the character could have any other instrument maybe jazz instruments to be more plausible and really show the afroamerican important contribution to music and culture
that would add more life to the character and film
lots of unnecessary scenes
predictable ending
would not see this film again
12 years a slave is a powerful picture on the challenging struggle of reallife freeslave solomon northup who was kidnapped and put back to the horrors of slavery
chiwetel ejiofors name will be pronounced numerous times during movie awards season for his riveting starring performance as northrup
in fact the whole movie was freed from lousy acting with other impressive performances most notably from michael fassbender as the villainous slaveowner edwin epps sarah paulson as his horror storyesque sister mistress epps and lupita nyongo as the tortured slave patsey
director steve mcqueens work here will propel him to elite auteur status
but believe it or not john ridleys screenplay was a bit too detached for my taste
nevertheless break the chains and witness for yourself the gripping 12 years a slave
excellent
this type of slave movie has been done so many times before
in my opinion the movies roots and django unchained conveyed the message so much better
the main actors in this particular film werent convincing and neither was brad pits cameo appearance
it really was a waste of time and i personally found it disappointing
i am surprised to see that the rating was so high here on imdb
am i missing something here
it fails to connect and falls flat compared to the two aforementioned predecessors
really
dont bother
i really cant understand why it won so many awards
perhaps it was due to guilt or something
in all honesty how many slavewhipping movies does a person really need to see
i get it
it was very wrong to own and mistreat slaves
i promise i will never do it
i thought the trailer looked good and i was wrong
as soon as play was pressed my attention was never caught
i was bored and playing on my phone instead of watching
it did not seem like a 12 year span
i do not see the hype over this  maybe only because these things really happened
but there have been better movies
and what the heck are these people freaking out about lupita for
she didnt even do much
why wasnt the main guy given so much credit to
im so confused about this
i think the hype was undeserving because it wasnt that good
i dont mean to sound hateful or that i didnt care about slaves because that is far from the truth
i just didnt like this movie
or the hype it was given
or the hype lupita was given
glad i didnt go pay money to see this in theaters
great pacing and amazingly deep performances help to elevate this movie through some of the hardest scenes you will and should ever have to watch
once again the time we live in has proved its benefits with fearless acting direction and story telling
no dancing on tiptoes except in the literal sense nothing is taboo and all or more than in years pastof the sins of man are faced
chiwetel ejiofor gave such a great performance and the women were all very solid
the direction and set design is all fantastic and everything is made to feel very real and very painful
i would recommend this film to anyone there are some tough to take scenes in here of physical abuse and some graphically violent scenes through out but it is true and real and people should know and never forget
i enjoyed this movie quite a bit but you must remember that this sort of thing is still going on in the world and not so far from you
if you see something wrong speak up
i agree with the last reviewer i thought the movie was slow and awkward in the flashbacks
it totally omitted any sense of the long years solomon spent in slavery and how he reconciled himself to it
there was no surprise with the sadism and inhumanity as far as i am concerned moreover it added nothing new to the already tragic picture of slavery in america
it would be more interesting to understand how humanity was able to deal with slavery and why it produced such extraordinary sadism in the white population
the lack of decency was finally resolved with the arrival of brad pitt i found that casting troubling as well
this film is a beautifully crafted and harrowing tale
it is to me an important film for all white people to see i am a white person myself
the emotions portrayed in this film are those that all white people should absorb and then reflect on the fact that oppression is still a strong ugly force in our lives
i have seen solomons expressions in the faces of the young black men i have known
we do not live in a postracial society
i strongly encourage people to watch this film and reflect on your white privilege
i cannot imagine what it would be like to see this as a black person and my only dissatisfaction with this film is that our society requires the pain and distress of people of color to educate white people
in 12 years a slave 2013 we are introduced to the story of solomon northup a black and free new york violinist who is abducted during a tour in washington and sold as a slave to a louisiana plantation brutally portraying which took place in the southern united states around 1840
it is a cruel film with the spectator and will make you suffer practically from beginning to end leaving you discredited by seeing so much barbarism being made by the human being but at the same time hypnotizes you with so much beauty in the frames the lighting and the outstanding performances of chiwetel ejiofor lupita nyongo and michael fassbender is certainly one of the best films of this decade and for me the best in portraying slavery it is surely a must see for anyone who likes cinema
a well made but flawed movie
my main gripe with it is the dialogue
i imagine it is authentic but the problem is that i could only catch about half of what was said
chiwetel is great as the main character but when one can only follow parts of any conversation it spoils the effect of those parts of the script
it must have been a difficult task for the actors to treat each other so appallingly even given they were only acting
it really is not a film that one can be said to enjoy it is more a question of appreciating it
steve mcqueen took on a difficult and even controversial subject in this film and it was never going to be a blockbuster
it has been honoured more for the subject and the bravery it took to make it than for its quality
this movie had a positive impact towards me because it made me realize the cruelty of others to enslave people to do the hard work for them no matter what was it about and the irony that today we are still fighting for this kind of stuff i mean human rights
it is impressive by the story of a man who struggles to keep his identity and dignity in a period when slavery was like a dice game and you didnt know where life would bring you after
the life of the main character is like an odyssey with good and very very bad times but i think this is all about life in the end to be smashed and moved backward and then to get up and move even forward
such a beautiful movie and a well told story
the cinematography transported the viewer in every scene
the camera work the acting and the story was very powerful
the story of injustice and triumph over evil came through
the passion the actors bought to the characters made you feel exactly what the director wanted you to feel
it was hard to not think you were there
it made you never want to see anything like this happen to anyone
bravo
steve mcqueens twelve years a slave is not exactly a bad film but i confess to a certain disappointment in it
mcqueens earlier movies shame and especially hunger were raw visceral portrayals of life under a certain sort of inescapably grim reality
but twelve years a slave while it contains many horrific moments is basically full hollywood with emotional background music underscoring the emotions were meant to feel and a narrative that stresses the possibility of the individual triumphing against evil and misfortune through strength of character alone
of course this is a common solution because depicting unameliorated misery could make for a grim movie the audience prefers the shaswhank redemption to a story ending in prison suicide or schindlers list to a drama actually set in the camps
but mcqueen has previously skirted the thin line between truth and unwatchability with considerable skill this outing though made with a much bigger budget is a less ambitious effort
this movie was a great 134 minutes of my life but its tough to say that because of the topic of the movie which is slavery and the graphic violence of the slaves getting whipped and almost hung to death
its just amazing to think that with the treatment that solomon or platt went through for 12 years and separated from his family at the kidnapping and still fought through it for so long to get freed
the amount of courage that it takes and will to live to just take 100 lashes a week and basically be bullied severely every day for being black for 12 years is astounding most of us dont have it
overall a great film 2 thumbs up
solomon northrup was a man living in upstate new york in 1841 who was abducted by slave traders and brought south to work on various plantations
chiwetel ejiofor is spectacular in the lead role and deserving of an oscar for best actor
the whippings and horrible conditions of the slaves is almost too much to watch
this is a long and draining experience for the entire two hours and fifteen minute running time
the entire cast is exceptional but be prepared to be emotionally exhausted in the end
director mcqueen has a keen eye for detail but sometimes lingers a bit longer then necessary at times
his previous efforts hunger and shame were guilty of similar excesses
overall 12 years a slave is mcqueens best film
i am an australian bored and alone more than i would like sometimes i turn to escape a bit with films imprisoned in other ways perhaps
it was midnight i got up and looked at facebook then bits and pieces i had 12 years a slave it has moved me forward as if pushed me from behind and slapped me in the face
now it is morning i started the film near midnight alone it held me like speaking right into me i was not afraid of the self confrontation as the clock passed 0100am i really engaged in a way that i could not have known
now i have learnt and experienced and want to make more of me for my daughter who is 9
slavery and exploitation are written into capitalism now it is perhaps worth meditating on that
this is not a film it is a testament to life as we all seek enlightenment
12 years a slave is one of the most devastating dramas ive seen in a while having some truly astonishing performances by the cast involved
its certainly a hard watch at times and steve mcqueen really captured the brutality and sheer horror of slavery
there are several well known actors here and i must say that even though some of them had short appearances they were still quite memorable
whether you feel disgusted by despicable characters or feel relieved by seeing others with compassion and who respect human rights there is always a strong sense of realism that transports you to this period of time
everyones immersed in their roles to such a high degree which just made me speechless
chiwetel ejiofor gives the performance of a lifetime with michael fassbender and lupita nyongo being just as impressive
steve mcqueen is a director to keep a close eye on and he brings us another emotionally wrenching journey with 12 years a slave one of 2013s best films
lets begin this movie is probably exactly what could have been made out of a book like that
its a movie that makes you think and his bad and good moments i liked this movie of course
it was good it had all the element a drama and history drama needed
the director was good and the actors couldnt be better
it lets you see the life of a man captured and the released after 12 years
to be honest movies like his has been done before dont get me wrong it was reallllly well made
but i am so tired of depressing movies about like even the holocaust it seems like if you do a movie about this you are guaranteed to be in the high leagues of oscars
in 1841 solomon northup is a free africanamerican man working as a violinist living with his wife and two children in saratoga springs new york
two white men brown and hamilton offer him shortterm employment as a musician if he will travel with them to washington d
c
however once they arrive the duo drug northup and conspire to deliver him to a slave pen
northup is later shipped to new orleans along with others who have been detained against their will
a slave trader named freeman gives northup the identity of platt a runaway slave from georgia and sells him and another slave patsey to plantation owner william ford
due to tension between northup and another plantation worker ford sells him to another slave owner named edwin epps
in the process northup attempts to explain that he is actually a free man but to no avail
the fact that this movie won three oscars should be a reason to watch it
it took me bout 2 years to watch this movie in full
movies like this usually leave me very unsettled
i kept pausing it and coming back to it a few months later
there is hardly any fillers for music in this film
the director makes sure that we can hear everything and i feel that is why it is so chilling
the actors and actresses did a phenomenal job
i felt the pain in every sentence
i believe everyone can agree when saying that the scene with lupita being whipped was the most heart wrenching scene
i dont want to spoil any of the movie but all i will say is be prepared and just realize that this is history played out on a screen
based on the 1853 novel by ex slave and freeman solomon northup
this pre american civil war exposure of slavery 150 years ago in the united states
requires a very strong heart and a stronger stomach for violence
this is without question one of the most important but also the most gut wrenching emotionally packed films ever to obtain the best picture oscar
an amazing piece of artistic cinema both horrible and entertaining
how can that be so
all performances are truly stunning while the craft involved is simply breath taking
a truly amazing film
brilliant cinema
directed with extreme brilliance by brit former artist steve mcqueen and with a sensational cast who deliver astonishing performances from the already famous and the soon to be alike this is a very important film every one shoud see
the film 12 years a slave was a highly detailed film accurately depicting the horrors of slavery and the injustice that befell many people
the brutal whippings and physical violence that was given out of pure spite to those who for the most part did nothing that could possibly warrant the receiving of these punishments
the story of solomon was a great tale of a man beating the conditions that he was wrongfully put into
solomon managed to escaped the inhumane things that he was put into by staying alive and not giving up hope that one day he would be freed
this film opens ones eyes to the sin of slavery and makes one realize how bad slavery was
even though these horrors controlled many plantation owners people like bass proved that people can still be kind hearted even when their life is at stake
12 years a slave was a magnificent example of what slavery was like in past history
based off a true story of solomon northup a free black man that was sold to slavery he has to face a multitude of irrationality and abuse
as a slave he now has to face the horrors of slavery for the hardest 12 years of his life
the film demonstrates these horrors with much emphasis on the process of demoralization of every single slave especially solomon
horrors as in the straight brutality and cruelty of slavery without out any boundaries
solomons struggles along with the other slaves and owners hes encounter represents humanitys evil in the world
evil that no man has to ever face throughout their lifetime
so if you really want to see slavery in its true colors and notice these horrors it is highly suggested to watch this film that might change your perspective on this evil
the story told is one of brilliant execution
how the life of someone can dramatically change within a few seconds just because the of the time and because of the slavery at the time
the excellent portrayal by m
fassbender and b
cumberbatch of ranch owners shows the hardship of labour and slavery
even the remorse shown by benedicts character was flattened by what could happen if he went soft on his slaves
the story shows how much pain he goes through and the eventuality of meeting brad pitts character was heartwarming to know that someone out there was looking down solemnly onto him
the ending was very basic but was what the film needed with a happy reunion of the family once more
i think this movie is a movie everyone needs to see
it shows the brutal truth of americas history that so many people want to ignore or not realize it was as deplorable as it really was
for over 200 years black people were treated as nonhuman objects to be abused and taken advantage of until they died
this movie is an amazingly well written and produced film with an outstanding cast
it makes you feel so many things anger fear disgust sadness and pain
it was at times quite difficult to watch but i think thats what its purpose was
it was so moving yet painful to watch especially being a black woman
knowing that this is what my ancestors actually went through tears me apart and angers me
however i did enjoy this film very much
in 2013 there were many great movies and yes 12 years slave was one of them which showed slavery in a way never saw but in that year it was obvious that the best movie of that year was not 12 years slave
i do not wanna defend gravity which was the best in that year but still even american hustle was a better movie
yes lupita nyongos act was absolutely brilliant but still the title of a best picture is for the best production of that year not the movie that had more impact on the people
you could do a better job with this production get a better costume design set production and etc
in movies like this the score has the first impact on audience
they could do a better job
i am not saying that i could but i am saying that if they just put a little bit more effort on this movie they could get a brilliant job but they didnt
instead you could not get a better job with more effort on gravity or american hustle
the title of the best picture should belong to the best production and for sure this movie was the 3rd of that year in my opinion
this movie was a beautifully rendered piece of history
showing how solomon northup was thrown into the life of a slave from a life of which had both comfort and the opportunity that showed itself everyday the opportunity to live
throughout his struggles soloman never gives up hope and thats an important lesson for us all
he trusted few and although he tried regularly failed to keep his head down and mouth shut
finally his faith and devotion to being free again pays off bringing him home to what he once had 12 years later
symbolism used in this movie was subtle however beyond amazing
when he hangs from the rope when one man decides that he can take his life however wrong he is time passes slowly for the viewer showing just how unimaginably long it is for solomon having to take the slow way around one day at a time
the film tells the true story of salomon north who plays him chiwetel agiofor black talented violinist who was kidnapped and sold into slavery in the united states before the civil war
the film is very interesting and important to see this film because this film tells about an event that everyone should know more or less what happened to him the film has only one drawback too long and film excerpts that could give them the film is based on a true story and exciting african american man living in new york with his wife and two children and is sold into slavery in the american south excellent game of cast film 12 years a slave won an oscar for best film and justice i would recommend this movie
the opening scenes of this movie left me completely shocked
it does not ease its viewers into the content instead it fully immersed them into the violence and hatred that went hand in hand with slavery
the movie begins with him already in slavery and within the first half hour we watch as solomon is deceived and drugged into slavery and beaten
we watch as he is nearly hanged as he is traded from a kinder master to one so despicable he is known as a slave breaker
the movie follows his dark journey marvelously and displays it amazingly
i can not remember the last time i watched a historical film as interesting or as captivating as this one
my eyes were glued to the screen and i could not tear myself away from the movie
this film delivered a difficult topic without beating around the bush and for that it should be applauded

prior to watching 12 years a slave i figured i knew what to expect
talking about slavery in history you hear over and over again about the brutal past of those persecuted by their race
however listening is not the same as experiencing
12 years a slave embarks the audience alongside solomons journey from being a free african man kidnapped and sold into slavery and experiencing the cruelty faced upon him
with talented and sympathetic actors portraying the lives of those who unfortunately fell victim to the bitter side of humanity makes this biographical film come to life
its safe to say that 12 years a slave has not only captured my attention but my empathy and heart with high hopes that the future will learn from history and every individual can live in pure peace

it was very difficult for me to watch this movie because of the brutality of the way people were treated
however the movie portrayed the times very well and gave me a better understanding and appreciation of how the slaves were treated in those times
it was an awful thing slavery and the way this movie so accurately showed what these people went through for many years was incredible
furthermore it is an amazing thing that there were people like the character bass played by brad pitt who saw how truly awful it was that the african americans were being treated this way and did what they could to help them
i would most definitely recommend this movie to people because the acting was fantastic and the story line was accurate
beware this movie is not for the faint of heart because there are some very graphic scenes
this is a great movie that shows how unfair and cruel slavery was to those that were affected by it
solomon was a free black man who was kidnapped and forced into slavery
although he is eventually freed thank you brad pitt solomon had to endure some horrible treatment at the hands of his masters like whippings beatings living in horrible conditions working in the hot southern summer for hours on end being called horrible names and being dehumanized
this movie does have a bit of nudity and sexual content
my main problem with this movie is that its hard to tell when and where the events occur
after saying the year and area in the beginning saratoga ny 1841 you never know when things are happening afterwords
all we know is that the movie takes place from 18411853 and is in the southern united states
all in all i really enjoyed this movie
this one of my favorite movies of all time
i will not be marking spoilers in between so read at your own risk
12 years a slave was good movie
the struggles of solomon northup played by chiwetel ejiofor and patsey played by lupita nyongo made feel gutted for them
especially patsey when solomon leaves the plantation towards the end of the movie
but it did not deserve the awards that it got
lupita nyongo deserved her oscar but not the movie
felt like people were pressured to give it an oscar just because of being afraid they might be classified as racists otherwise
anyway more about the movie great acting from the whole cast
fassbender paulson and even bennedict cumberbatch in his cameo brilliantly portrayed the helplessness of his character
