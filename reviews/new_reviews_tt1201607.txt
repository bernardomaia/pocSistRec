even though i consider myself to be a huge hp fan i never thought i would actually give a movie from this series straight 10 out of 10
just saw the movie today and the word epic is almost an understatement
this movie really lives up to the promises that have been made
further more it is in my opinion at least the movie that stays most loyal to the book
i did miss some scenes from the book yet nothing relevant was left out
i dont want to give out any spoilers cause i dont want to ruin it for you but if you have read the book it will be very easy to follow and if not  well i think it still makes sense most of the time
i highly recommend you to watch it whether youre a fan or not
1010
this movie could not do any better it ended the harry potter series with a bang
it is a good balance from the first part of the deathly hallows
the first part was more of a drama while part two was action packed left and right
this may be my favorite movie of the series though all of them are equally amazing
i have read the books and there are definitely major changes in the movie but i find they fit perfectly well with the story even if it isnt the original plot
even for those who havent read the books why wouldnt you
it is equally enjoyable
this movie along with the rest in the series will be loved for years and years to come
they went for dramatic visuals and effects rather than follow a good storyline
lots of changes to the books and scenes added for cinematic view
they do not care about the books or the storyline as long as it looks good and they can get in 3d shots
you also wont see a more anti climatic end to a film ever
after a decade of movies they finally kill the most dark evil wizard of all time and nobody gives a monkeys
well done david yates for ruining the harry potter franchise
you directed 4 movies and ruined everyone of them
order of the phoenix was the longest book but the shortest movie
half blood prince was butchered beyond recognition
deathly hallows part 1 was dragged out too long and was boring
lets hope you do not get a chance to ruin anymore movies
in some cases it is unfair to compare a movie to the book from which it was adopted but when you split a movie into two parts to get as much of the story onto the screen i see no excuse for a bad adaptation
after waiting years for this finale and after reading all the books i was sure nothing could be bad about this until i started watching that is
the first half hour  hour or so is not only quite accurate but also really good but as the battle of hogwats begins everything go downhill
it is all just a blur of people running around screaming and shouting inaudible curses at each other until all the character you should care about but cant in this mess are dead and not even after the battle has ended do we get to see what happened to all the people we worried about and that at least i felt sorry for while reading the book
i really trust imdb for movie rating but for this one
no
thats just impossible too much fanboy
have you just read the book
everything is different from the book its a terrible movie and its definitely not worth the 810 that people give
the first 7 movies were really decent like 710 not perfect but still really enjoyable but this one is just bad
it feel rushed and the ending is terrible because they changed everything
i dont get why people love this one so much its just not good at all
there so so much better movie that came out in 2011 and they dont have as much place as this one
im disappointed and i hope that eventually the rating will be corrected
i think this movie is worth a 510
i thought for the final film it was a huge let down
i havent read the books so im just seeing it from film perspective certain scenes that you would expect to see in the film werent like deaths or certain main characters rons brother and the length of those scenes we did see were really short so had no emotion e
g the death of snape bellatrix
the fight and the death of voldemort should have been much longer considering we have been waiting more than 8 years to see that happen
the battle scenes were short too and it jumped from calm to fighting really quickly
there was hardly any build up
and when harry goes to heaven or what ever that was
was just plain silly
the worst of all
daniel radcliffe was so wooden and boring to watch
i did like the bit where we saw snapes memories that was well done
think the film was more of a money maker than a film to signify the end of an era
the movie does not cover most of the important plots of other characters
the movie only only tells the story of harry potter whereas the other character are far more interesting but the movie leaves their story out completely
it is not just this movie but the whole series was not made well
they have spent too much time trying to show harrys emotions instead of showing more about the magical world
primarily the movie is shot for kids and not for mature adults unlike the books
the special effects are good but was highly disappointed by the story
the movie might be worth watching for the people who havent read the book but i would recommend everyone to read the books instead of seeing this movie
of course one day the harry potter movie saga would come to an end also because the main performers are becoming older and sooner or later would not be able to act the characters of the children student wizards
with the books by j
k
rowling its different since they have no images
i must begin to say that i have not seen part one therefore what i am saying here must be read having that in mind
this movie favours violent action and a lot of destruction to the detriment of the poetry of magics we have seen for instance in the h
p
and the prisoner of azkaban movie
however we must recognize that the special visual effects are unbeatable thrilling and of excellent quality
the story is not very rich and original in terms of suspense but we can be properly entertained while watching all the adventurous scenes
one last word to the final scenes that reestablish the above mentioned poetry
what 8
5 for this movie seriously
common guys are everyone in this world are harry fans
movie is not bad it has its moments we all know how it ends
i heard its a epicexcellent and frankly i am fed up this movie or the whole series lost steam a long time ago
if u r extreme potter fan and u even dream harry then it will good other then that theres nothing much to see in this one
theres nothing new in this one all parts are covered by previous parts
tell me one person in this world who dont know that harry will defeat the dark lord but the way yates should portray the film should have been better
ya i watched the film as it ends the series
i will not deny the fact that i saw most harry movies and liked some of them
i follow imdb
been following it for the last two or three years if a movie is rated 78 or above i would run to theater or buy a dvd but fans giving movies like this 9 or 10 disappoints me a lot
i suggest watch the movie only if u love harry series other then that prefer captain america or horrible bosses or transfomers 3
this movie the 2 parts is an absolute disgrace
it does not respect the book it does not respect the world of harry potter
its just a big joke they decided to cut half of the book including some important scenes but they also decided to change what happens and when it happens
they added stuff and made some impossible things possible in the movie
in the end its a movie showing off all you can do special effectwise they focused on that and chose the scenes they would do from the books based on whether they would allow theme to show off or not and left big chunks of the story
i reread the book just before and its just a shocking movie in the end
i can not believe jk rowling said yes to that
she must really like money
but its not like its a new thing in the harry potter series
half of the movies are lame disrespectful to the original world and focused on minor parts while leaving important story parts left abandoned
im a big harry potter fan since the first movie it gave me thrills and excitement
it was so sad that this is the end of the movie series
daniel made an incredible job in portraying harry potter
rupert is so funny he made ron weasley a great man
emma as hermoine is the best
she did an amazing job in every movie especially in this movie where she gave 200 of her effort
the sounds and the visual are great
the effects are so amazing every scene is worth the watch
the other cast is great as well as the main characters
everything in the movie was magnificent
the directors producers and every staff made a wonderful job
if i were you i will watch it in cinemas and buy a dvd
it will never get old even you watch it 50 times
harry potter and the deathly hallows part 2 is a great movie as such
high on action and great acting performances  everybody should give it a try and not discard it by saying who cares  im not a harry potter fan or its kids stuff
dont miss something for such lame reasons
give the movie a try and there is a good chance of yours falling in love with the movie
i might also suggest  the movie is good as a solo movie as well
the story is apparent once you are 10 minutes in the movie  so no need to care a lot about its being a part 2 movie although if u catch up with the story so far it will only help you enjoy the movie more
do see it in 3d for full experience  it had nicer effect on me than when i saw it in 2d the first time around
it was an amazing title for an amazing book
even though i was a fan of the lord of the rings and i never was actually into harry potter i believed in the power of this author and this masterpiece after reading the book
extraordinary work of character development relations and creativity
extraordinary work of humour  fantasy and imagination
the power of mankind in terms of how different could it be from other creatures in expansion of such beautiful artworks was observable within this book
oh should i write about the movie here
well i have to confess like this it was just the best way of spoiling such an amazing novel
well i watched this last night and left the cinema feeling a but underwhelmed
its seems to be me like they lashed this movie together knowing full well that it was always going to be a sellout
if you have bothered with the last movies then you find yourself wanting to just get to the end
its hard to pick 1 particular scene out but to me it didnt flow well and the script was very wish wash
i could give examples but i dont want to give anything away to those who have not seen the movie
i never found myself once feeling sad that it was the final movie
it failed badly to get the hairs tingling and the lump in the throat effect most sagas have
very disappointing but hey this is just my opinion
see for yourself
i would wait for the dvd tho
i think  harry potter and the deathly hallows part 2  was better than part 1
whatever i didnt quit enjoy it because  1 there were no dialogue in this movie just actions  if we count how many time they spoke in this movie it will be less than 10 minutes
2 i dont know why this movie is so dark i saw it twice in cinema and on my pc and i barely could see anything
3 i didnt like when they make them came after 19 years i thought it was just for reading and not to see it made me lose the spirit of voldemorts death
4 i think it was a bad idea that they made the movie on two parts it should have been only one part in 3 or 4 hours like  lord of the rings  it would so much better
some people may ask why i gave it 910 and i will answer it is just harry potter i read the all the seven books 3 times i saw the movies thousands of times i saw 4 of them in the cinema i am a huge fan of all the actors and at last i thanks j
k
rowling
sorry for my terrible grammar
well im a little late on the review but i am a huge fan of harry potter
all the actors bring there a game for this final movie
all these actors give groundbreaking performances in making this the final movie
the movie definitely executed the main points of the movie and made it feel so real and touching
harry potter fans and non harry potter will definitely love this movie
i was given the advantage to go to the midnight showing and the whole theater was in complete silence the whole movie and you could even hear and see people shedding tears
it is an awesome movie and it really does justice for the end of harry potter
i have read all the books and seen all the movies and this one has to be the best movie
i knew what was gonna happen and still had me on the edge of my seat and i suggest this movie to everyone
it will not be a waste of your money
great movie great people great ending
harry potter will live on forever
this was a great great movie my son says his favorite 8 movies are the harry potter it was a great ending even with the sad deaths it was epicawesomeperfect endingand one of the best fantasy films ever usually the endings arent good but this was awesome
definitely the best movie of the year a must see for all ages the best of the potter films great movie no disappointing parts at all a great movie its one of the coolest movie battles ever a perfect ending and will not disappoint anyone its a greatgreat movie its awesome you will love it no matter who you are it will make you see films in a whole new way it should never get a bad review
i never thought id see the day where there is a movie that makes me laugh cry and scream all at the same time
the harry potter series is one that has touched the hearts of millions of people on this earth and i am one out of those millions
the film harry potter and the deathly hallow part 2 is truly epic
joe rowling created a world that touched the hearts of millions and david yates brought that onto the screen for all to see
even though there were many liberties taken by the director it didnt even effect the grade of quality
the plot of thick the effects were topnotch the music out outstanding and the cast had the great chemistry that makes you fall with love with their work
overall the final installation of the harry potter series truly head up to its expectations
i watched it eight times in theaters i own it on dvd and the soundtrack is next on my list
if you are looking for a movie that fulfills expectations and you can watch again and againa pick up harry potter and the deathly hallows part 2
i love this movie and the whole series to death
amazing close to the series could of have more but amazing
only big thing i hated was the romance
ginny was annoying and harry and hermoine are perfect together
but aside that amazing movie
hope to see a 18 movie collection
if you have not seen this movie and you are just the little of an harry potter fan see this movie
i didnt get to see this movie till today and after i wished to see it at premiere
the best movie and the series and the best series of movies and books
long live harry potter
we will all miss you harry potter
thank you j

rowling
epic
hp7part 2 the wait for every hp movie was long and this one seemed even longer as this is where it all ends
but the wait was worth it
probably the best of harry potter series
yes harry is back one last time and in a way which we all waited for so long
the movie works like magic especially in 3d
and this was my first 3d experience also loved every bit of it
it had everything we want in hp series thrill action magic fun smile overall it may be said that the movie was good
the directionthe special effects were brilliantly executed
the acting was good too
the children have grown so much
hop every one also enjoyed like me
it was great i am a fan it was cool i thought it was great harry potter is great it was a good movie it was scary it was really scary it was cool you will like it a lot it was one of the best movies of 2011 i liked it a lot you will like it too it was just a good movie
it was great it was cool it was great and it was great i loved it a lot harry potter and the deathly hallows part 2 was just a really good movie it was enjoy able to enjoy harry potter movie are good it was a really really good movie you will ilk it too it was a great movie i am glad it is a pg 13 movie there was action violence and just a good movie to enjoy it was good it was just a great movie it was long it was great it was a great movie i liked it a lot it was really really great i thought it was good harry potter rocks it was not funny but good it rocks it was really really long for a pg 13 it was a really good movie
it was cool it was a good 3d movie i saw it ad it was a great movie it was cool it was not funny but it was a good movie to see it was a blast
i went to this at midnight and it was super worth it
between mrs
wesleys special line and the fighting it was just like the book
you should go see it if you havent
it was an epic ending to an epic series and i dont know if there will anything as epic ever again
i begin reading these a while back and now i own all the movies and books plus a tee shirt
i never imagined i could be so hooked
so if you are a fan or youre looking for a movie to see i recommend harry potter and the deathly hallows part 2
the ending death was epic along with the sadness of losing tonks one of the wesley twins and many more
so sit back relax and enjoy it
it will last for generations to come
what a remarkable film deathly hallows 2 wasit is definitely mesmerizing but i wish there was more war sequencesotherwise i am completely satisfied with what the film had to offer
the film was strong in all sectors not to forget the performances from the veterans like maggie smith and alan rickmansimply outshown the rest of the cast
the film is full of edgeofthe seat moments and keeps you glued to the screen throughout the duration of the two hours
it is very difficult to direct a warfilm and david yates does deliver given the fact that he had to tell a story running in the background at the same time
voldemorts weakness princes tale kingcross are worth mentioning and so is the pale white dragon locked in the underworld
there couldnt have been a better ending to the series
it was emotional and deserves a bestpicture nomination at the oscars
this is the last film of the worldwide franchise
if they had to make the film in a way like this then one film was better than making two films
david heyman is an amazing producer but david yates a completely fowl director
he ruined the fifth sixth and seventh film and so he did with the eight film
he cut of everything
the beginning was very good but the battle was quiet miserable
most of the things was shown in the trailer  what happened in the battle and there was too much harry in the film
ron and hermione even didnt appear much and the stupid david yates deleted many things from the memory of snape
the dead scene of fred was also omitted
arianas story gone
duel of hermione ginny and luna with bellatrix gone
and the battle of harry amp voldemort though they made it a bit longer it was still disappointing
there was no one to see and and thus what is the proof that voldy is dead
the film was good and enjoyable but i think a lot more could be expected from this film
throughout the series every movie had something missing
of course every movie had parts that were cut because they simple didnt have time to show everything
all of that has always bugged me until this
this movie was everything the book couldnt be
while it did have to cut out parts that really were important it said everything it had to say
it finished everything that had to be finished
this movie tied up all the loose ends and it did this with a flourish
the action was at the amazing pace that only that 8th instalment of a long series could provide without disregarding the story
still a two hour movie of just thrills would have been a bit too much and it certainly provided some breaks
emotional scenes like neville coming full circle showed that as much as the series was about magic none of us could wield it was also about character that the best of us could aspire to
it was breathtaking
it was triumphant
it was to the fans to the books to harry potter and all the faithful at hogwarts justice
for the 100235th timethe movie isnt supposed to be exactly like the book
if inception was based on a bookand they had changed some plots from the bookpeople will still go crazysaying that the movie sucked because it wasnt exactly like the book
the movie was intense
the musiccinematography everything was just
perfect
this moviewas the best in the series
princes tale was portrayed so beautifullyits hard not to cry during this scenei dont wanna spoil anything
the cast gave their bestespeciallyalan rickman
they did go out with a bang
its emotionalaction packedepic and funny at times
a perfect send offone could wish for
long live harry potter
imho 1010 it was a great movie
this is what all had been waiting
the end is here and it comes with a big bang
this is the best installment of the series excluding prisoner of azkaban
finally its harry vs voldemort
with the beginning only its quite understandable that all were gonna watch is a lot of action
the direction great the script is written pretty well and i just loved the screenplay
its stunning visually and the effects are commendable
one more thing is that you will find your heart pacing as more and more time passes
definitely all you think is that its gonna end now
i watched in 3d and didnt find much use of 3d except 23 good scenes
so its moreover kind of same if you watch in 2d
the truths when unfold delivers a shock to us
although the ending scenes dont fit well but the climax is superb and it couldnt have ended better
just loved it but sadly the series is over now
after seeing this movie in fake 3d at my local amc theater in nj i enjoyed this fitting end to the highest grossing movie franchise of all time
it begins where part 1 left off when voldemort opens up dumbledores grave and raises his wand into the air with a lightning bolt into the air
harry potter is on a mission to kill voldemort and those who obey him
ralph fiennes character voldemort lies about harry potter being dead which shows his excellence in acting then harry potter comes back to life and defeats voldemort
there is a great flashback scene and an epilogue set 19 years after the events of the movie
whether you see it in 3d 2d or imax 3d hp7
2 completes the circle
by far one of the best endings to a series it wasnt flawless but it wasnt horrid much like goblet of fire which took out too much of the book and added hardly anything
this movie is my all time favorite potter movie well until fantastic beasts and where to find them comes out that looks so good that it might get close to this amazing movie
i love how they brought this story together mostly stayed true to the book and just amazing acting
emma daniel and rupert just blew me away as did all the other actors especially alan r
hope i get blown away by the spinoff that i mentioned before
j
k
rowling i thank you for making this awesome story and allowing the movies to be made
well it all end then
harry potter won the war against the evil and saved the world
well lets start with my bad comment about it
so voldamort finally got harry potter and did the death spell on him which he thinks that it did not kill harry when he was young and he knows that harry is the only one who can have a chance vs him so after doing the spell which did not kill harry the last timehe sends a follower of him to see if harry died
like he is just like 5 meters away from harry and he has been searching for him for so long and in the end he does not bother enough to see by himself if he died
sigh
anyway i loved almost everything else about the movie
it is good but could have been better
i totally liked it
the complete series of harry potter is awesome
it needed a awesome ending
the final part of this series should be like this
hp8 deserved to be the final part of hp series because of its awesome direction
acting is awesome
casting is awesome
story is awesome
music is awesome
action is awesome
direction is awesome
everything is just awesome
i totally liked it
the complete series of harry potter is awesome
it needed a awesome ending
the final part of this series should be like this
hp8 deserved to be the final part of hp series because of its awesome direction
acting is awesome
casting is awesome
story is awesome
music is awesome
action is awesome

everything is just awesome
a mustsee end to the series of the magical harry potter world
i recommend it to all ages all genders and all expectations
this grand finale starts off where part 1 of deathly hallows finished with harry crouching besides dobbys grave
it is showing how the good is weak and evil are getting stronger but harry ron and hermione are determined to hunt down the remaining horcruxes
after a heartstopping trip to the bank the threesome go to hogwarts for the final battle
many innocent lives are taken with some main characters getting killed
daniel radcliffe and rupert grint make an excellent job portraying their lifelong characters and though its emmas best film she still lacks the chirisma from my point of view
the movie ends really well but id have liked more of a bang at the end so the viewer could have been left wondering what was going to happen next
is the movie end
no
please direct more parts of harry potter like
with some miracles dumbledore comes back and harry teach some subjects in hog warts
like this type of story please direct more parts
and the all parts of harry potter which i was seen on my computer is great i love harry potter and i want that direct more parts of this movie and direct it until the director not died plz

an amazing and epic cinematic conclusion to the harry potter series
of course the books were far superior in every way but these last couple of movies really did do an amazing job capturing the meaning behind every scene which the earlier films couldnt quite do
the acting continued to improve in every film as did the development of the overall story arc and characters
i also felt like this was the best movie in terms of not needing to have read the books in order to fully engage in the story
overall i am very glad that i was able to complete the book series and films
this entire process has been an enjoyable one and that is the ultimate point of all mediums of entertainment isnt it
to enjoy it
thats always been my belief and this story was absolutely captivating
i cant wait until the next time i can make it to universal studios to check out what ive heard is an amazing job at recreating the environment
thank you j
k
rowling for providing premium entertainment for my mind
the movie is epic enough said
we all know how much harry potter means to us we share our childhood to this bespectacled wizard boy
there are so many scenes including the one from the room of requirement which justifies its post 3d conversion
all i want to say is  this is the last time u would ever see potter on the big screen unless a few generations from now when another big movie franchise gets the opportunity to film a remake if at all
dont be choosy to settle for a 2d version
who knows when something as epic as popular and as equally loved character will ever greet the big screen
have fun
ive watched the movie in a 3d version
during the movie i noticed that quite often you see a sort of schiller like theater setting in layers appearing on the screen
first layer is sharp other layers are often not sharp
in photography terms we call this the depth of field
i actually havent given 3d a lot of thought since it came available but seeing the deathly hallows i realized that when you watch a 3d movie you want a high level of dept of field
in that case most layers will be sharp giving you a good 3d experience of the movie like looking through a window
lots of detail become visible
as the deathly hallows dont often use a high dof i cant recommend the 3d version as an extra feature to the movie experience often its rather annoying to watch this version compared to the 2d movie
im not a diehard fan of harry porter im not even a fan of harry porter series
but i have watched three harry porter movies
they are all ok for me
im impressed by the first movieharry potter and the philosophers stone
when i heard the news of harry potter and the deathly hallows part 2 recordbreaking weekend box offices worldwide i think i should watch it as soon as possible
i watched today i have to admit that deathly hallows part 2 is the bestplotted mostentertained one compared to its previous series movies
however its not as good as the ratings here imho someone might say im being biased but if you look at those top 50 movies which got the same ratings i dont think this movie stand a chance to be equally great as the others
im out of words to describe this masterpiece
sadly after 10 amazing years we say goodbye to characters we have grown to love like relatives
first of all id like to congratulate david yates for directing this in the best possible way he could and for making one of the most spectacular finales ever seen on screen
danielrupert and emma shine as always but alan rickman is very deserving of an oscar for his performance which completely stole the show
the score is greatthe script is great very good twists for those who didnt read all of the books and the action scenes are fantastic
overall this film created a bar and reached it with great style and i think it could be capable of getting an oscar nod for best picture and more than capable of being an unforgettable blockbuster
so to finish it all off id like to say ronhermoineharry you will be missed
the film was epic
i am a huge fan and arrived at the theater at noon dressed up in anticipation
however nothing could have prepared me for this
it was incredible
enjoy and savor it
you will not be disappointed in a single performance
the kids have grown so much over the years and alan rickman gives one of the performances of his career
very very rarely do you gerecieve the opportunity to witness the total completion of something that you have loved for more than 10 years
especially on screen
while many tears were dropped it is a feeling of completeness
those who worked on it should be more than proud as it was an honor to watch
had i not read the book i probably would have loved this movie
in the beginning it follows the book well even if the pacing is kind of uneven
however when the battle begins it starts to slowly stop using what was already well written in the book
the part that really got me upset was after harry died
1
he doesnt hide under the invisibility cloak and reappear later
2
they drag out the snake killing but thankfully neville still kills it in the end
3
voldemort and harry do not get the epic showdown in the great hall
instead they fight everywhere and the elder wand explanation is dragged out
all in all the movie was very disappointing because of how much of the end they replaced
its like they took the major plot points and threw the book out the window
i loved it
it was a great ending
but i kind of hoped harry and hermione would have gotten together please dont argue because even jk rowling acknowledged that she made a mistake
no i havent read the books
so unlike the books fans i can tell that this whole series is worth watching and is a masterpiece
this is how you end a franchise
this and the halfblood prince will always be my favorite harry potter films
the story does come to an end so well and you get to see so many characters grow and be stronger
there is so much energy in this film and i believe so many actors cared about how it was going to end as much as the fans did
harry potter will always be an icon a classic and a brilliant book series by such a powerful and intelligent women known as j
k
rowling
spoiler warning i loved it when hermione and ron kissed the whole theatre clapped and i loved when neville killed nagini
aaah
it was so epic
loove it and will always love it
great ending to the series i thought it was quite good but they missed some crucial bits out and altered quite a few bits it was quite entertaining i think that the battle scenes and stunts where done quite well
i found the scene in pensive the best part
i think is not as good as fantastic beasts is because the visuals are more up to date and there is not much to be disappointed with because the book fantastic beasts does not have an actual plot
however i think it is one of the best out of the hp series and to be honest i dont think another director could have done as good a job as david yates and the rest of the film crew
