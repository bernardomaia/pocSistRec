"\nThe natural landscape and some of the scenes are overwhelming and\nspectacular! The camera-work is so immersive, you believe are a part of\nHugh Glass' journey through the wilderness and back to civilization.\nAlso with great performances not only by DiCaprio, but also Hardy, as\nthe unsympathetic fellow fur trapper leaving Glass behind. <br><br>Story-wise, it is a bit thin for a 156 min picture. Glass' quest for\nvengeance is sometimes lost as he utters few words about his drive and\nis being more or less, chased himself. The story arc of the Indians\nquest for their daughter felt a bit out of place and strange. We also\nget to see the fur trappers p.o.v. that left Glass behind and the\nCaptain way ahead of them. Which in my opinion takes a little bit of\nthe magic of Glass' total perilous journey.<br><br>All my stars goes to the beauty, production value and performances\nalone! Regardless, this is one of those overlong movies one like, but\nwould not sit out for another viewing!\n"
"\nI was hoping for something a bit more interesting than Hollywood's\nstandard approach to cowboys and indians, especially as the film seems\nto have been critically acclaimed and Leo is a great actor. <br><br>The quality of the camera-work is excellent and the bear mauling scene\nvery accomplished if that is the right way to describe such a visceral\nfew minutes. But oh the plot. If you try to take it seriously it fails\nutterly. As an Indiana Jones caper it lacks wit. Too often you say 'I\nknow he'd be dead from hypothermia/blood loss etc etc in any possible\nworld but I'll just keep watching in case something interesting\nhappens'. You ride your horse over a 150 foot drop, fall into a tree,\nand survive. You travel downstream in an icy river in your fur coat and\ndon't drown/freeze. You manage to light a fire even when you are\n9/10ths dead, there are no branches and you're flint went a few scenes\nago. What a relief when the baddie is finally left to his fate, but\nthen you realise you've just wasted 2 hours of your life.\n"
"\nI cannot believe how many people think this is a good movie....watching\na guy struggle to survive for 2 hours ...come on people..I know there\nare not many good movies being made but my word....so many things are\nunbelievable...the bear attack, carrying a near dead guy out of the\nwilderness up a mountain...going over a cliff on a horse and not\ngetting hurt...spending long periods of time in freezing cold\nwater.....surviving extreme cold overnight inside a dead horse...my god\nthe list is endless....and for Leo's so called acting don't get me\nstarted...a lot of crawling and moaning and groaning....the whole thing\nwas a letdown and really a waste of time...also tell the director to\nback the camera up a bit on those facial close-ups...they were also\nridiculous...trust me save your money and go see The Hateful Eight.\n"
"\nWhat a waste of a night. Spoiler alert! Here is the whole movie in 30\nseconds.<br><br>A guy almost dies, a guy walks, a guy builds a fire, the guy almost\ndies again, walks some more, goes for a swim, builds a fire, almost\ndies, goes for a swim again, builds a fire, makes it back safely, goes\nback out again, finds a fire, almost dies, makes someone else go for a\nswim. Looks into the camera deeply. The end.<br><br>Best supporting actor to the bear. My life would have been better had\nyou finished the job.<br><br>I'm pretty sure this script was two pages long, and they turned it into\na 2.5 hour movie. The closed captioning graphic artist had more words\nthan any one else in the movie.\n"
"\n\"The Revenant\" is probably the most beautiful movie I have seen for a\nlong time. This is not only due to the incredible locations, but also\nto the excellent (and by excellent I mean excellent) camera-work.\nFrequently I was just blown away by the sheer beauty of the rough\nterrain of Canada and how it was captured by the crew. However, there\nare a few drawbacks. Mainly the story (it is a very simple revenge\nstory line) and the dialog (it is basically not existent :D).<br><br>When I first left the movie I was still blown away by all the great\nthings I mentioned above (I was thinking about a 10/10 rating), but the\nlonger I was outside the movie the more I recognized that \"The\nRevenant\" is a film that is incredible entertaining whilst sitting in\nthe cinema, but also a movie I quickly forgot about when being at home\nagain.<br><br>Still, the movie is definitely a must-see. Your money is well invested!\n"
"\nIn real life, Hugh Glass was mauled by a grizzly &amp; left for dead, but\nmanaged to drag himself back to a frontier outpost. The cinematic\nhandling of the story in Revenant, however, is straight out of Cormac\nMcCarthy: heavy-handed with funereal music &amp; gray-scale tones\nthroughout, creating an overall impression that the sun rarely ever\nshone in those mountains in those times. Just watching it becomes a\ntest of endurance. Cold, colorless, dismal, stark, bleak, brutal,\ndispiriting &amp; ultimately pointless. Perhaps that was how these men\nactually lived their lives? Maybe that's the point? If there is one?<br><br>At the end of the film, we're left not even knowing whether Glass,\nafter exacting vengeance on the man who killed his son, lives or dies\nhimself. Or perhaps that doesn't matter? Perhaps none of it matters?\nPtui! Worst film I've watched since Deadman.\n"
"\nUnbelievable bad movie!<br><br>I mean come on, i watched Titanic, and the same guy dies of Hypotermia\nin 5 minutes of cold water!!!<br><br>***spoiler*** Now he not only sleeps on the snow while totally ruined\nand left to death after a bear attack, he crawls for miles, take swims\nin a river with snow and ice around, get outside, sleeps a bit more\nthen make a fire from a spark, on the snow, then kill some, then fall\noff the cliff with a horse and then he shows that he knows how Han Solo\nsaved Luke on planet Hoth from dying.<br><br>It could be such a good movie if bear killed him at the start. Or at\nleast i wouldn't have wasted so much time watching it...\n"
"\nUtter, utter, utter, utter, waste of 2.5 hours of my life. One of the\nmost boring films I've seen. Unintelligible dialogue and no real story.\nLeonardo Di Caprio is a fine actor and should have been given an Oscar\nfor Wolf of Wall Street instead of this tripe, where he hardly has to\nact. OK, the conditions were harsh, but not as harsh as having to sit\nin a cinema and watch this. Tom Hardy was mumbling, as ever, and seemed\nto be a baddie for the sake of it. After an hour I was looking round\nthe cinema to see if anyone else was as bored as I was. Di Caprio's\ncharacter, Glass, is mauled, constantly frozen and wet, starved,\ndehydrated, witnesses (in his delirium) his son being murdered and\nrides off a cliff and yet I didn't really sense the suffering. Bilge.\n"
"\nRevenant was the worst movie I've ever seen. If you want to pay $7 to\nwatch almost 3 hours of Leonardo DiCaprio sleeping and breathing\nheavily in the snow, it's the perfect movie for you.<br><br>It was also really inaccurate as the dude Leo was playing was somehow\nvery literate and wrote in present day English. This would not have\nbeen the case. it was really unnecessary to have this detail in it. <br><br>The only enjoyable part for me was the symbolism of Leo's rebirth as he\nwas coming out of the horse that he was in due to the weather. <br><br>I am only writing the last two things because i can't upload the first\nparagraph unless i have 10 lines. <br><br>But seriously. Do not waste your money on this movie. Pirate it if you\nreally wanna see it, but even then, it isn't even worth the time.\n"
"\nIt is a travesty. The scenery shots are boring and carelessly tacked on\nto create a disparity between the violence and serenity of nature I\nassume but it's really badly done. I think it's supposed to be arty? If\nyou watch the trailer, google some pics of Canadian landscape and\nyoutube that scene from star wars with the tauntaun you have basically\nwatched the movie. Don't waste your money. It is soulless Oscar fodder\nand brings nothing new to cinema so if you want to watch the same old\nstory of a guy surviving against all odds because revenge and manpain\nare powerful driving forces, go for it. You'll probably enjoy it. If\nyou want to watch something with beautiful editing or scenery or\ncostume design, there are way better films out there that do all of\nthis a lot better and have a more original storyline/progressive way of\nshowing that storyline. I found it very dull and Leo does not deserve\nan Oscar. Maybe Tom Hardy does. But Mad Max was better so he should win\nit for that.\n"
"\nShot using all natural light, The Revenant is one of the most gorgeous\nfilms you will ever see. Leonardo Dicaprio deserves his first Oscar for\nhis incredibly dedicated performance, easily the best of his career and\nTom Hardy gives an Oscar worthy performance for his role as the\nhaunting beast John Fitzgerald. The first act of the film was\ndefinitely the most impressive. With stunning visuals and flawlessly\ncrafted intense action scenes, I felt like I was watching real footage\nfrom the 1820's! Then the vast snowy wilderness kicked in, the majority\nof the time it was breathtaking. But at times The Revenant got a little\nlost in the wilderness and sometimes felt a bit repetitive, it's still\nan unpredictable and suspenseful adventure with many surprises. It's no\ndoubt one of the years best films.\n"
"\nOne of, if not the worst, movies if ever seen. wanted to leave after 30\nminutes, but stuck it out for thirty more, hoping it would get better.\nWhen it became obvious that Glass would survive and get his revenge\nafter another hour and a half of boring action, we left. Plot is boring\nand obvious. Wish I could get my price of admission back. Sadly a big\nwaste of time and money. Is this the best the film industry can do?\nHopefully not. Would not recommend this to anyone. Actually am\nembarrassed to admit I stuck it out for as long as I did. Terrible!\nTerrible! Terrible! Spoiler alert? Really? Plot is so obvious! Dialog\nis stupid. Character development non-existent. etc., etc., etc\n"
"\nDon't listen to what anyone says about this movie. It's bad... I liked\nall the actors playing in this movie, I'm a real fan of all leonardo\ndicaprio's movies. I loved Tom Hardy In \"peaky blinders\". And I like\nthe performance of Will poulter in \"we are the millers\" and \"maze\nrunner\". Like always they didn't disappoint. <br><br>On the other hand this movie is depressing aaaalll the way. I don't say\nevery movie should have a happy ending. But at least give us a reason\nto watch this movie besides beautiful panorama shots of the\nenvironment. The build up to action is to slow and when the action\nfinally comes it's banal. No captain would go after a deserter alone\nwith a wounded man! <br><br>Without spoiling any further about the movie. I thought it sucked\nreally bad and I want the world to know about it! yours sincerely a\nmoviefanat who made an account on IMDb just to trash this movie.\n"
"\nIf ever there was a case of style over substance, The Revenant is it.\nVisually stunning, yes, but films have always been about more than\nthat. If something nice to look at is what you want, go and stare at a\npainting or a photo for 2 and a half hours.<br><br>This isn't a bad film in the way that Adam Sandler films are bad, it's\na bad film because there is nothing (bar the visuals) to enjoy. It is\nso unrelentingly grim, with zero character development, It left me\nasking, am I meant to care? As the film opens with the slaughter of\nhalf the group, it's a pretty brutal scene, but with no impact, as we\nweren't even introduced to them. This serves as a recurring problem\nthroughout the running time.<br><br>The only thing interesting thing about this movie is that it serves as\na metaphor for DiCaprio's own struggle to earn an Oscar. His character\ngoes through so much Hell to survive, has everything thrown at him, and\nits' almost like Leo is pleading to the Academy - 'Look, look! See what\nI'm willing to put myself though?!'To be fair, it paid off in that\nrespect.\n"
"\nThis is, simply put, one of the most sadistic films I've ever seen.<br><br>I read the novel, \"Lord Grizzly,\" by Frederick Manfred, when I was in\nhigh school. It told the story of Hugh Glass and it was a good novel.<br><br>Years later, Richard Harris starred in \"Man in the Wilderness,\" also\nbased on the Hugh Glass story. It wasn't a great movie, but it wasn't\nbad.<br><br>\"The Revenant\" is a terrible movie.<br><br>It's extremely violent at the beginning; extremely boring in the\nmiddle; and extremely brutal at the end. <br><br>George Lucas has said the secret to making a great movie is: Have a\ngreat opening, a great ending and try not to screw up the middle.<br><br>The director of \"The Revenant\" failed on all three counts. <br><br>This is why I don't pay any attention to Academy Award nominations any\nmore.\n"
"\nMay contain spoilers. I'm sorry Hollywood but life threatening\ninjuries(shattered bones, severed major veins/arteries and\nsmashed/slashed tendons) don't just 'heal-up' by themselves. This and\nthis alone made me give up on reverent shortly after he and his horse\nwent over the cliff. Early on when DiCaprio 'cauterized' the deep\nwounds on his neck with fire I told my buddies that I'll bet he'll be\nwalking soon.....without a cane. Well I was right! Miraculously his\nbusted up foot and hand were healed in a couple days. I told them when\nI shattered my femur I should have crawled through the bushes, waded\nacross the stream and crawled thru the woods behind my property for a\nfew days and I could've came out strutting like nothing had happened.\nBut I don't live in Hollywood-land where life threatening injuries\nsimply disappear. Additionally, no one can swim in freezing water\nwithout inducing hypothermia....cheeez!!! Suggestion: When this movie\ncomes out on television you'd be better off watching Gilligan's Island\nreruns.\n"
"\nI guess society has reached the point where everyone is living in a\nvirtual fantasy world. There is little grasp on reality anymore,\nespecially in film - when a truly good story is represented in this\ncompletely fantasized and revolting manner. The only likely reality in\nthis film is that he was mauled by a bear. That's where reality and\nfantasy end! We stayed until the last 10 minutes before we could not\ntake another second of this sickening stench of a film. Be warned, if\nyou have a healthy dose of common sense, you'll hate this film - and\nyourself for paying to see it. <br><br>Now I see that I have to write 10 lines about this wretched film in\norder for them to publish it. Great! Unfortunately I do not have\nanymore to say...\n"
"\nBoring movie. No plot. Waste of my time and money. Got sucked in by\nsome of the reviews. Even the scenery added to the misery of the whole\nmovie. A person groaning for an hour and half is not my idea of\ninteresting. The only interesting part is where Leo's character gets\nmauled by a bear. Then back to the snoozefest. I can't believe people\nactually enjoyed watching this pathetic movie. Worst movie that I\nwatched in 2015. <br><br>I still can't believe Leo and Tom Hardy were nominated for Academy\nAwards for this. By the end of half hour of listening to his groaning,\nI wished the bear had had him for dinner.<br><br>None of the characters were likable or relatable. Takes a lot more than\nstunning cinematography to get me excited about a movie. You need plot,\ngreat acting, character development, narrative, believability etc and\nthese were all sadly lacking and that made me angry. If I wanted to\nwatch beautiful scenery I can walk outside or watch National Geographic\nchannel. It was very over-rated and over-hyped.\n"
"\nThere is a giant flaw in current major Hollywood productions; the\nessential art of telling a good story.<br><br>We desperately need writers who can produce strong screenplays with\nplots that develop and hold our interest throughout a film. And we need\ndirectors and editors who are able to seamlessly weave together a story\nthrough film. We do not need a bunch of scenes tacked together and\ncalled a movie.<br><br>The Revenant being hailed as a great film is a travesty to movie-\nmaking. It's a movie without a story, something far too common these\ndays in Hollywood.\n"
"\nAnd some good acting and great cinematography, but HIGHLY overrated. It\nshould be cut in half and it would still drag. The spirituals visions\ndon't really add much and at times make it difficult to follow what is\ngoing on. But then the plot is so predictable you know what is going to\nhappen before it does, so you really just sit back and look at nice\nscenery and some good acting without needing to follow the story\nbecause you know exactly what will happen all the time. Anything the\nleast bit bloody is dragged out.<br><br>If you liked \"There Will be Blood\" (another predictable pointless\nmovie, you will like this one. Personally I found both to boring and\npoorly done.\n"
"\nIf this wasn't such a fantastic piece of storytelling, I would be\ninterrupting every three minutes to ask \"how the hell did they make\nthat shot?\" Even if you know a lot about special effects, this film\nwill have you scratching your head all the time.<br><br>There are shots that start as close ups, go super wide, half way up a\nmountain and then close to something else miles away. There are\ninteractions with animals like the bear, shot in a way that defies any\ncinematographic, animal training, prop, or other trick you can think\nof.<br><br>I can't wait to see some sort of \"making of\" that will allow me to\nsleep at night when I understand how they did it all. Instead of that\njerky, overdone, getting us all motion sick, hand-held camera, there is\na wide angle system which sucks you into the action in a way we haven't\nsee before.<br><br>It doesn't matter if you don't like DiCaprio or dislike \"that type\" of\nmovies. This is an awesome piece of work, worth watching regardless\nsimply for the technical artistry.\n"
"\nThe movie was simply put too monotonous/boring in my humble opinion.\nSometimes less is more but in this particular case it would have been\nbetter if we actually got to see something else than Leo walking around\nin the snow. The story was also not very compelling which makes me\ndoubt why so many people seem to think that this was a \"great movie\". I\ncan sum up the entire movie in two convoluted sentences: Leo plays a\nperson who is part of a small group of frontiersmen who are at war with\nthe natives. Leo gets attacked by a bear, almost dies, remains crippled\ndue to the attack for the majority of the movie, watches his son\ngetting killed by a fellow frontiersman while being unable to do\nanything about it, gets left behind in the wilderness to die (by the\naforementioned traitor), seeks revenge, gets revenge, end of the movie. <br><br>It was pretty disappointing and totally predictable (the end, that is).\n"
"\nDespite my best efforts, I failed to notice any acting happening in\nthis film. Lying on the ground and moaning is hardly a stirring\nartistic feat.<br><br>OK, we get it, bears are scary, and getting mauled by one would be a\nvery unfun experience. Yes, we get it, winter is cold and being stuck\noutside in winter isn't fun. Yes, we can see that the instinct of\nself-preservation is strong. Well, welcome to class Mamalia. And yes,\nwe all now that revenge motivates people to perform crazy feats of\nstrength.<br><br>The landscape shots were beautiful, and the plot was half (well, OK,\n1/3) believable. That's about it.\n"
"\nSlow and boring! <br><br>It's basically 2+ hours of watching a half-dead guy crawl through the\nsnow. <br><br>A waste of time.<br><br>It was humorous when after being mauled by a grizzly bear and receiving\nno medical attention, he manages to escape into class 5 rapids without\ndrowning. <br><br>He's wearing 200 pounds of clothes but manages to stay afloat through\nall of that. <br><br>Okay.\n"
"\nI have never seen Leonardo DiCaprio in any below-the-average movie so I\nhad high expectations watching it. What a shock! The most boring movie\nI can remember having watched. How can it have 8,2 rating with so many\nnegative reviews? It should have been between 4,5 and 5,5 stars without\nany doubts.How can people be excited about it? Seriously, I have never\nwritten any reviews ever before all these years I have this account in\nIMDb but l just couldn't stand it. I had to say it and warn others. It\nwas that disappointing.<br><br>Boring plot, scenario inexistent, too much violence and that ridiculous\nscene with the bear... all mixed with a direction the cherry on the top\nof the cake. A direction that could even make someone who just got an\necstasy pill to fall asleep after few minutes. <br><br>Don't waste your money like most people say here.\n"
"\nThis film should have been edited down by forty minutes. We got the\nmessage of man vs. man vs. nature very quickly. Nature is beautiful but\ncruel, and man in his natural, lawless state is more cruel than that.\nSure, the photography is beautiful, and the actors are props, not much\ndifferent than the CG bear. The only character shown in closeup was\nGlass/DiCaprio; all the others are blurry, bearded faces given sparse,\nbarely articulate dialogue. The Indian-language words are accompanied\nby subtitles, but so should have been the words spoken in English. And\nyou could hardly write a spoiler, because there is a resolution to only\npart of the main character's adventure.\n"
"\nI heard of this movie before i went to see it.. and as everyone said it\nis a great film I where really looking forward to see it (especially as\nthe trailer is quite good).<br><br>Well after I have watched it now, I have to say this movie is one of\nthe worst I have ever seen! It is unbelievable long (the boring way of\nlong) and there are more logical errors than in all movies I have\nwatched before combined. This features superhuman strengths, sudden\nchanges in depletion level and more.<br><br>Everyone who knows a little bit about survival and bush-crafting will\nhave the strong desire to leave the cinema instantly.<br><br>So from my side: Don't waste your time, don't watch this one\n"
"\nI personally found this movie to be boring. Definitely one of the most\nboring movies I've ever seen. Yes, it looks good visually, but that's\nall it has going for it. Even when something was happening, nothing\nhappened. They easily could have cut an hour out and it still would\nhave been boring, but at least it would have been so long and drawn\nout. I feel that this is probably one of those movies that people will\nclaim to like because it's the popular thing to do. But seriously, how\nmany times can look at CG trees and still be amazed at how real they\nlook? In the end, this was two and a half hours of my life that I'll\nnever get back.\n"
"\n*warning may contain spoilers*<br><br>I really do not understand the good reviews. I had to stop 3 quarters\ninto this joke of a movie. No story. Bunch of killings. The star\ncharacter (Dicaprio) has more souls than a cat. He gets mauled by a\nbear yet can walk, talk, and survive. He survives with drenched clothes\nin the freezing wilderness. He Flys off a cliff, and you guessed it,\nstill lives. <br><br>I love Leo, and no words can describe my utter disappointment. The\nstory is non existent, only killing and killing and killing. One native\nAmerican looking for his daughter, one white man looking for revenge\nmaybe? Or just trying to survive, and another white crook who killed\nhis son. <br><br>Spare yourself, unless nice shots and graphics is all you care about !\n"
"\nImmediately forgettable, because no emotional connection is established\nbetween the characters and audience. As you are watching, you find\nyourself asking \"Why isn't this working?\" and, as you walk out of the\ntheater, you're still wondering \"Why?\" One answer is the characters are\nsingle dimensional; another, the editing is confused, chopped. A third,\nscenes of nature, the outdoors, environment, locale, etc that should be\nintegral to the emotions, but are not evocative, and seem to have been\nfilmed, then interspersed periodically for no reason and to little\neffect. David Lean could use the locale to tell the story. This\ndirector cannot or does not. Im sorry to say these things, because I\nwas really looking forward to the movie.\n"
"\nLeonardo DiCaprio is basically just screaming at this point in life.\nThe movie stunk. I think people forgot that movies are supposed to be\nenjoyable. Even though things keep happening, with Indians and fighting\nand killing, I didn't give a darn about the movie or anyone anyone in\nit. I kept looking at the time. Which dragged on and on.<br><br>This movie didn't have 5 minutes of story, let alone 2.5 hours. There's\none cool scene, and it lasts 3 seconds. Coolish.<br><br>Don't believe the trailer. They hyped this garbage up, and put in a\nplot, but there is none; just like with The Grey. You want to see it\nbecause of Leonardo Dicaprio. Do yourself a favor and cry yourself to\nsleep instead.\n"
"\nAfter all the praises about this film, I took time to watch all of it.\nIt was basically a film about how beautiful winter scenes and weather\ncan be. Other than the nature scenes, I found this boring, distracting,\nstupid to the point idiotic in certain circumstances, also where Hardy\ncan hardly be understood and his character is ridiculous, and the fact\nthat Leo's character did not die of hypothermia. You have to watch the\nmovie to see what I am talking about The jest of this movie is the\nstory of a man's survival in the wilderness. I will say that the bear\nscenes were astounding graphic and very realistic to the point that it\nwas amazing that he even survived the attack. If you want to watch it,\nbe my guest but I will not watch it again. And I would recommend to my\nfriends not to waste their time on this movie. The film I would\nrecommend watching is \" Man in the Wilderness\" 1971, staring Richard\nHarris and John Huston, who was also the director This film is so much\nbetter\n"
"\nNonsense! There was more hope.Cheap, worthless Leo, a bad filmmaker.\nThe film is artificially adjusted to receive an Oscar. Very\ndisappointed Leonardo Di Caprio play. The role did not Oscar. Many plot\nblunders. For example, a horse gutted, and when he left not cut off\nfrom her meat. He does not know that horses eat or a fastidious ?! The\nmain actor played very simple. So would any mediocre actor played. And\nit is not the role of the father. He looks too young. Well played by\nanother actor - the role of the villain in terms of dramatic games. The\nsecond time is not particularly want to watch this movie. The second\ntime is not particularly want to watch this movie. Many artificial,\nunreal, tense rescue the protagonist. Suddenly, there was some kind of\nlone Indian. He eats raw meat sitting next to the three fires!\n"
"\nThe book is interesting, but not great. The film though, glacial and no\nwhere near great. Scenes are too long, too similar, too insignificant. <br><br>The lack of dialogue is... sharp? Were it not that it makes for a truly\nbland experience in combination with the production. Di Caprio is\nsolid, as ever, but I haven't got a scooby about his character. The\nother characters, apart from the anti- hero are completely\nuninteresting. <br><br>I need ten lines to review this. I don't need them. I need ten lines to\nreview this. I don't need them. I need ten lines to review this. I\ndon't need them.<br><br>This is the most uneventful Hollywood film since... I don't know, a\nlong time?<br><br>I genuinely can't recommend this film, sorry.<br><br>The final conclusion - tried too hard to be interesting.\n"
"\nHonestly I think I just watched a dude crawl in snow for 2 hours trying\nto kill another dude, with minimum words said!!, the performances where\nepic by both Tom &amp; Leo!!!, there is no doubt in that, but the plot is\njust so boring, there is nothing interesting about the story other than\nhow the hell Glass survived, I wanted to leave in the first like 10\nmins, but I always hoped that it would get better but it didn't, the\ntrailer does'nt reflect the movie well, because from the trailer the\nmovie seems epic, but really the movie is just boring boring boring, it\ngot all the acclaim for the wonderful performances and the amount of\nwork done in the field of cinematography, they focused on that much but\nforgot to focus on evolving the story and the characters, I didn't\nemotionally connect with the movie what so ever, I am very\ndisappointed.\n"
"\nThe Revenant is just a remake of the 1972 movie Jeremiah Johnson\nstarring Robert Redford??? Hollywood can't seem to come up with any new\nideas. Now just making remakes under a different title... or am I\nmissing something? Sure in the 2015 version the cinematography is\nbetter and the fight scenes more gruesome but the story line is still\nthe same.<br><br>And for not doing any of his stunts DiCaprio is nominated for an Oscar\nfor looking wild thanks for the great makeup artists. Now that's\nHollywood today. My oh my how things have changed. Yesteryear, the\nOscars celebrated talent now it is just political\n"
"\nBoy, I had a difficult time watching this movie. It is just to much of\nthe same thing and the same emotion. Dicaprio had an easy time learning\nhis lines, because not many words came out of his mouth, a lot of\ngrunting instead that gets annoying quite quickly. There was a lot of\nlaughter amongst the audience, not because the movie is funny, but is\nis at many times over the top and highly unlikely. Yes the nature is\nbeautiful but I'd rather watch an episode of BBC earth, that is a lot\nmore uplifting. Overall the movie was quite disappointing. I don't get\nthe praise at all. The script can be summarized in one page, and that\nis not a good thing.\n"
"\nI don't get it! How can this movie be rated 8.2? Yes the filming and\nvisual effects were stunning, but the movie was flat out boring. The\nstory is old and over played and the entire movie seemed like a cross\nbetween Castaway and Payback. <br><br>DiCaprio's character gets attacked by a bear, buried alive, rides a\nhorse off of a cliff, careens down a freezing river and gets stabbed,\nbut still survives. Wow, how exciting.<br><br>And to think that he can even be nominated by an academy award is\namazing. He grunted through the entire film and when he finally could\nspeak, he did a bad impression of Marlin Brando in the Godfather.<br><br>Don't waste your money or time (lots of time) on this movie.\n"
"\nThere is almost nothing good to say about this film. It was painful to\nwatch, slow, no joy or any good feelings, and just plain boring after a\nwhile. I cannot understand why it got so many awards. Even the nature\nscenes which were beautiful were impossible to enjoy because of the\nfeeling of dread hanging over every scene.<br><br>The last hour was predictable. I dreaded what was to come, holding out\nhope that it would not be a long drawn out ending to an exhausting\nfilm. Unfortunately, the pain was drawn out. Like a bad dream that\nwould not end.<br><br>It is worse than a waste of my money, it ruined my evening and will\nmake me feel awful for days. Avoid this film.\n"
"\nAbsolute highlight was the pictures of beautiful landscapes. <br><br>As for the film, i don't understand how anyone can be nominated for an\nOscar if they don't have a script. Crawling around on the floor should\nnot be enough for any award. I can only assume somebody noticed\nDiCaprio should really have had an Oscar by now so decided to give him\none for this - speechless.<br><br>Massive dose of Hollywood fantasy as surviving being killed by a hungry\nbear, floating half an hour in freezing water and not being shot by one\nof fifty Indians while shooting a self loading flintlock pistol back at\nthem just about sums up the film. <br><br>No story, no words, no good. Save your money and your time and don't\nbelieve the hype!\n"
"\nCould it be that you can let one miracle pass but not dozens? Is it\nbecause of all those great actors that don't make any difference at all\n(lots of grunting and mumbling beards)? Or the utter predictability of\nthe story? Maybe I just can't take the never-ending hunger for revenge\nanymore, a subject Hollywood just keeps revisiting - over and over.<br><br>Looks like all it takes to win prizes is some nice visuals, a few good\nnames, professional production. Add a few scenes from American history\n(maybe some are actually a bit historically correct).<br><br>During the movie I could not force myself to stop thinking about the\nterrible cold and hypothermia and how he makes these fires being fully\nsoaked. There are so many miracles, I cannot just shake those off and\nbelieve what happens next.<br><br>I feared it would be something like this, gave it the benefit of the\ndoubt, no luck. Still 3 out of 10 - but not for having a good time\nwatching it.\n"
"\nWhatever may be the rating, the one thing all should agree is \"There is\nno story\"<br><br>One side it was absolutely realistic, showing real blood, real light,\nflesh, death arrows. OK great<br><br>Other side, its absolutely ridiculous. A guy who was cut open from head\nto toe, swims across freezing water, eats and sleeps, no infection, no\ndisease and stays strong enough to take revenge.<br><br>Come on, what kind of story is this? I literally puked in many scene.\nreally do you have to show that much blood and flesh in a movie which\nhas a top cast like Di caprio?? It is not a war movie and the violence\nis not at all necessary in this movie.<br><br>The crew suddenly vanished once for all and Tom hardy just escapes\nevery one.Seriously, are all other soldiers that lame to let a single\nman escape ??<br><br>Serious disaster. Not a good movie to watch with family.If you get to\nsee the rated version DVD, 25% of the movie will be gone in censor.\n"
"\nAwful movie. The worst one i watched this year...(so far). I can't\nimagine how sick and perverted someone must be to make such a crappy\nand repulsive film?! Average scenario, flat dialogues, no acting game\nat all....just rivers of blood everywhere. Too much for my taste, and\nalso for the tastes of many people in the cinema theater - today half\nof them just left after the first disgusting scene ....and they were so\nmany of them! What was the idea of the movie - some kind of exotic\npunishment for the audience?! I think \"The Revenant\" is appropriate for\npeople who love blood, aggression and killings, but it is not for\nmentally sane people. Watching this movie was totally waste of my time.\n"
"\nWhat was all the hype about regarding this colossal miserable film?<br><br>The film starts off too brutal for me with the Indians on the rampage,\nkilling off many of the traders.<br><br>Am still wondering why Leonardo Di Caprio won the best actor Oscar for\nthis film? He gave many other much better performances in other films.\nThe choice was ridiculous.<br><br>The one shining spot of this horrible film was the supporting\nperformance by Tom Hardy as the villain, who justified his evil ways by\nway of religion.<br><br>This basically comes down to revenge and it's amazing that DiCaprio\ncould ever survive the mauling by that bear to regain the stamina\nneeded to track down Hardy, who had killed his son in the interim.<br><br>Yes, the scenery is unusual but it best reflects the mood of the entire\nfilm.\n"
"\nThis film ranks as one of the very worst films I've ever seen, It's\ndown there with Birdman, Blair Witch and the that piece of tripe about\nEva Peron with Madonna in it. I've walked out of films better than all\nof the above.... seriously folks, don't waste your lives on this\nunmitigated garbage. I thought the Bear was brilliant, the snow was\npretty etc. The dialogue seemed to be predominately unintelligible\nmumbling (no I'm not deaf or hard of hearing), continuity was rubbish\ntoo, i.e. beard growth, ability to light fires, immunity from the\neffects of cold. , all in all I couldn't 'Bear' it, I think the beast\nwas trying to do us all a favour by attempting to kill the main\ncharacter, Just my opinion of course, no offense meant.\n"
"\nThe best thing I can say is that this movie was beautiful, a real feast\nfor the eyes. Every shot was truly breathtaking. You could tell that he\nwas using all natural light and it really payed off. <br><br>As far as plot and substance, I personally I felt like I had to wade\nthrough A LOT of unnecessary gore to get to a highly unsatisfactory\nending. Not to say I don't like gore, I have been known to like my fair\nshare of bloody dramas. Its just that this film just seemed to be\n\"beating a dead horse\" so to speak, amongst other things to that poor\ndead horse. The ending (which I wont get into) was just.... a let down!\nat least to me. If I'm going to feel that uncomfortable during a movie\nI want to feel validated at the end.\n"
"\nAnother Indian/Good - White man/Bad movie. Too long. Too draggy. Too\npolitically correct. Why was the Indian kid such a little bitch? Why\nwas he screaming like that? The bad bad white guy had a real point\nthere. The French were bad. The Angloes were bad. They drove off the\nSpaniards, apparently. Good thing we can all turn to the noble savage\nfor instructions on clean, upright living. I thought it was really\npathetic that they had to mention how many hours went into the making\nof the movie, like they're supposed to get kudos and awards based on\neffort instead of outcome. After floating down a river a few times,\nsleeping in a makeshift sweat lodge, sleeping in a horse carcass for no\nreal reason, writing graffiti in an pseudo-igloo, digging, climbing,\nfalling, cauterizing, baking, freezing, puking, crawling, the sob\nprobably died of tetanus. How long can you watch this sort of thing and\ncontinue to be entertained? Three hours...nope. Oh, I know, this guy is\nsupposed to be just so sympathetic based on the fact that he's almost\nan Indian that we're all riveted. Nope.\n"
"\nIf what you would want to see in a movie is beautiful cinematography\nhung in an Ansel Adams frame, this is the movie for you. If you want\ngritty historical movie with ample gore, this is the movie for you. If\nyou want a realistic plot and realistic survival situations, you may\nwant to pick another movie. Some of the implausible survival situations\nsucks you right out of the movie, willing suspension of disbelief\nblown, while you try to get back into the movie. If this happened only\nonce, perhaps I could be more forgiving, but all I could think of was\nDiCaprio jumping up and saying \"it's just a flesh wound!\" It got\ncomical and ridiculous. Be sure you can forgive many mistakes before\nyou go see the movie.\n"
"\nFirstly I've given the film a four for the opening scene and the bear\nattack and that's about it . The only part of the film worth watching\nis the first ten minutes . The rest of it is basically di caprio\nrolling around in pain and surfering. <br><br>Visually the film is nice , but we also need to be entertained and this\nfilm just didn't do it. I also can't understand why di caprio got an\nOscar for this, he's acted much better in many films. I'm not saying he\nacted bad I'm a great fan of his , but the film didn't use di caprios\nacting abilities at all , he just has to look in pain the whole time\nand that was it . <br><br>The way the movie was hyped I really was expecting a masterpiece but\nit's far from it , not much dialogue , no action and it gets very\nboring just watching scene after scene of pretty much the same thing.\nWaste of time watching it on my opinion.\n"
"\nThe Revenant is beautifully shot, but the story is poorly told. one\nhour into the movie I still had no care for any of the characters.\nwhich makes it extremely dull for me to get through. It is like\nwatching a documentary without introduction, narration or storyline.\nother than the cinematography i have nothing positive to say about this\nfilm. I cannot understand why this movie get so much appraise. it\nshould have been edited down to a 30min shortfilm and not be two hours\nand thirtysix minutes long.this is two hours and thirtysix minutes of\ncompletely wasted time i cannot get back. You can ask me why I use my\ntime writing about it. answers is...So you have a chance to avoid\nwasting time on this movie.\n"
"\nWell acted and well photographed, yet unfocused, as it is told from\nmultiple perspectives (DiCaprio's, Hardy's, and the Native Americans) ,\nwhile I think Hardy's character was much more interesting and\nconflicted than DiCaprio's. <br><br>Film turns DiCaprio's character into a sort of wilderness superhero,\nable to survive being mauled by a bear (twice) , hypothermia, near\ndrowning, and, in the film's best scene, a fall from a great height\nwhile on horseback. However, its dramatic effect is largely negated by\nthe fact that the scene was shown in the trailer. Even worse, by that\npoint in time, we are positive he will survive, considering all he has\nalready lived through. <br><br>There's a difference between resilience, being determined to survive,\nand being an indestructible (and unrelateable) superhero.\n"
"\nImagine a cross between Jeremiah Johnson, Get Carter and Superman and\nyou have The Revenant (sounds pretty good). This is basically an old\nfashioned revenge saga. Now I know it's a remake of the superior Man In\nThe Wilderness starring the late great Richard Harris but it really did\nget a bit carried away with itself.<br><br>The filming is great and the huge landscapes are the real stars of the\nshow. The problem, as in so many movies these days, is one of\nplausibility. Without giving too much away our hero (DiCaprio) survives\nnot one, not two, not three but about 7 brushes with CERTAIN death. <br><br>Colossal loss of blood, wet clothes in a sub zero environment,\nstrangling, smothering, , falling off a cliff, drowning, knives, guns,\nIndians, baddies, gangrene..................the list goes on and on and\nall that was really missing was a red cape, a kiss curl and a cameo\nperformance from Stan Lee.<br><br>Awards should go to the technical folk and it must've been a tough\nshoot for the cast but when you boil it all down there's a lot more\ngravy than meat and potatoes.\n"
"\nJust to say a little, I watch a lot of movies. I know when a movie is\ntechnically sound and when a script is mediocre. I was excited about\ngoing to see this movie. Everything seemed interesting, DiCaprio, Tom\nHardy, Alejandro as director. However, this movie was not engaging\nthroughout the movie. The first 35 minutes of the movie are good, then\naround the second act, it gets crucially dull, then the last 35 minutes\nare good, but the plot of the script of this movie is not intriguing.\nThe movie could have been shorter and it would have been better in my\nopinion. The characters were very flat, however, Tom Hardy's character\nwas by far the most multi-dimensional and characteristic. The\ncinematography was astonishing in every aspect, the acting was great,\nbut the story was monotonous and slow paced. I would not recommend this\nmovie.\n"
"\nThis films exposes Leonardo DiCaprio as a mediocre actor. Never at any\npoint is the viewer able to get past his awkward over-acting and be\ndrawn into the film. DiCaprio was entirely miscast in this role. He\nstill looks too young to have a teenage son and the makeup and hair in\nthis film doesn't change that perception. None of it is convincing. He\neven manages to make the real stunts look fake. Aside from that, the\nfilm is terribly slow and isn't over when you want it to be. It's\ngratuitous to a comical level in its violence, which cheapens it and\nmakes it gimmicky. I actually laughed during the film's climax because\nit was so absurd. Tom Hardy stole this movie however. Watch this movie\nfor his performance because everything else will let you down, from the\nacting to the plot and the dialogue. Even the bear phoned it in. Ugh,\nthis movie was so disappointing and it bothers me that so many people\nloved it.\n"
"\nVery long movie for a thin story! A lot of closeup violence without\nmoving the story forward. Father motivated by revenge but why is the\ncommander of the base so eager to put his life in danger for a \"scouts\"\nloss.<br><br>Closeup filming with wide angle lens to the point where it just becomes\ntiresome. I wonder how many times the actors bumped their heads into\nthe camera lens.<br><br>High point of movie is Bear-Mauling Scene after this fast forward\nbutton is your friend! No loss if you don't watch this movie.<br><br>Similar to The Soldier, Leo and Kurt Russel hardly speaks in the movie.\n"
"\nOne goes to the movies, usually, to be entertained &amp; escape reality...\nThis movie was so gory and graphic that it provided neither an escape\nfrom reality nor entertainment. Some of the scenes are stomach turning.\nThe plot is predictable which makes the drawn out length of this\nhorrible movie completely pointless -- the story could've been told in\n30 mins. (tops). The acting was pretty mediocre .... Not much acting to\nbe done aside from dragging oneself along on the ground and breathing\nheavy through half the movie.<br><br>I honestly couldn't see any reason for the high rating this movie has\non this site nor understand the whole Oscar \"buzz\" over it... Truly one\nof the worst movies I've seen in a while.<br><br>To sum up... Don't waste your time. Or if you choose to waste it, make\nsure you're not eating while you watch... UGH!<br><br>I'd give this long-winded bit of trash a negative rating if possible.\n"
"\nI HATED this movie... There aren't very many movies I can say that\nabout either. I couldn't understand a single word the southerners were\nsaying.. They had subtitles for all the other languages, I feel like I\nneeded it for English as well. That's not even the worst part about\nit.. Everything was so random and just one thing after another, nothing\nseemed to make sense! For some reason I have to give 10 lines, but try\nnot to give anything away.. I hate how movies, this one as well,\nglorify rape. I hate how they show animals getting shot point blank.\nThis guy gets shot, he lives, he gets mauled by a bear, lives, gets\nburied alive, lives, goes over a waterfall, lives.. I finally walked\nout after the rape scene and wish I could get my money and time back.\nIt's 2.5 hours of worthless trash.\n"
"\nThis film and is awful. The worst film I've ever seen in my whole life.\nWhat is it even about? Leonardo crawling about the snow after being\nattacked by a bear and getting his son killed. Crawling about injured\nhalf dying like a smack head from drumchapel shopping centre eating\ncreatures and raw fish. Then miraculously gets strength to fight back\nand kill people to get revenge for his sons death that he caused in the\nfirst place. Nah tom hardy should have gutted him like the pikey he is\nand left him not even bothered to finish him never mind be kind enough\nto dig him a grave. I was looking forward to this film and am so\ndisgusted I wish bear grylls would jump out a tree and rip leonardos\nface off hope tom hardy finishes the job. Leonardo should have just let\nthe bear finish him and then his son would not have died. I have a new\nending.......leonardo is attacked by the bear and everyone else just\neats him and lives happily ever after x\n"
"\nHere comes 3 hours movie in 10 sentences:<br><br>SPOILER ALERT: <br><br>Plot: There is some fight between Indians and Americans. Leonardo got\ninto the fight. He also get attacked and wounded by the bear. His\nfriends left him alone. His son got killed. He somehow survives, eating\nbones,leaves and fishes. He can make fire when ever he wants, never\nmind, if snowing or he just came out of river. Then he met other\nIndian, who helped him. But this Indian got killed by French guys. Then\nLeonardo's horse got killed and has to sleep inside his horse. Then\nspring comes, and he comes out of the dead horse. Then they found him.\nThen he chased the guy, who killed his son. And that's pretty much all.\n"
"\nIt should win an Academy Award for realistic looking cinematography. I\nkept thinking this was going to eventually be a great movie because it\nlooked so good.<br><br>After awhile I realized it was a tired old script: Cowboys and Indians;\nkidnapped daughter; killed son; Revenge; Blood and guts and suffering;\nLeo is the only one who has a GPS in his head.<br><br>There was no need to waste so much talent and money making this film.\nYou could watch a medical surgery flick or attend a hospital's\nEmergency Room on a Saturday night and achieved the same result.<br><br>This is line #10 which is required. I've run out material.\n"
"\nAwesome movie, that will surely get many Oscar awards for best actor\n(Leonardo DiCaprio), supporting actor (Tom Hardy), cinematography and\nmakeup, best director and best picture, possibly costume design and\nediting. The bear attack scene is monumental and memorable, I do not\nremember having seen a bear attack described so well in all its\nwildness in any film or documentary. The many landscapes of wild nature\nare very beautiful! Leonardo DiCaprio's wounds and tormented face are\nso well rendered, I do not know how one can lose the Oscar for makeup.\nThroughout the film, Leo plays absolutely brilliant, with Tom Hardy\nalso excellent. The movie is very well built in details, it has\nmemorable scenes (like the one when jumping on the horse from the cliff\nand surviving in the freezing night that followed) and depicts very\nwell the struggle to survive in harsh natural conditions in frontier\nareas in those times. Awesome cinema experience for a viewer -\ncongratulations to the whole film crew for a job well done!\n"
"\nI don't understand all the praise for this film. It was just basically\n2+ hours of Leonardo DiCaprio being put through a survival course. <br><br>His backstory was some low level, basic Disney plot (although even\nDisney would frown that at backstory by today's standards). &amp; the main\nplot was just dull &amp; uninteresting.\n"
"\nLet me start by saying that I thought Leonardo DiCaprio was terrific in\nthis film and well deserved his Oscar for the role. However, there is\nso little plot in the movie, and some really, really improbable\nsituations where his character is rescued and/or escapes that my\noverall feeling was one of real disappointment. Tom Hardy spends most\nof the movie talking like he's got a mouthful of hardtack and even when\nyou can clearly understand him, isn't really saying much. The director,\nto me at least, seemed to understand how little plot and story there\nactually is in the movie by using scenes of a river or clouds as links\nbetween scenes and then lingering and lingering on those scenes of a\nriver or clouds. There is also gore aplenty to help stretch out the\nrunning time. Aside from DiCaprio, the praise heaped on this movie\nmystifies me.\n"
"\nAn enthralling story, with fabulous scenery and brilliantly acted -\nDiCaprio's Oscar was totally deserved. To counter this, the film could\nhave been at least half-an-hour shorter (possibly more) with several\ndrawn-out scenes which did nothing to enhance the tale and were\nmeaningless in terms of character development. The intense and\nenthralling finale was totally ruined by a constant high-pitched and\nextremely irritating whistle, only to be replaced by some maniac\nbanging on a piece of sheet metal which left me on edge and unable to\ndevote full attention to the thrilling denouement. I was left feeling\nthat I had wasted 2 1/2 hours of my life watching a film which I could\nhave enjoyed so much more.\n"
"\nStunning scenery and visually beautiful throughout... but I can\nexperience that, and so much more, by taking a trip to a local nature\nreserve. At least there I don't have to experience such lousy\nstorytelling, poor dialogue and highly improbable events.<br><br>The 'plot' is repetitive and predictable, with holes the size of\ncraters. Never before have I seen a man make such a miraculous recovery\n- from being on his death bed and unable to move, to swimming through\nice cold rivers within the space of a few scenes.<br><br>The film grows more and more ridiculous with every passing scene. At\nleast there are some pretty snow covered mountains to look at... until\nthe snow magically disappears.\n"
"\nA supposedly smart pelt trapper manages to do so many things that would\nhave killed him in reality. Like taking a long swim in a freezing\nriver, walks up to a pack of wolfs consuming a bison without any\nweapons and stands in the freezing river while filling his canteen with\nwater. <br><br>I.e. the script is typical Hollywood drivel. <br><br>Visually its very well done and the sound design is also very well\ndone. <br><br>Once again Hollywood manages to green light a movie based on a shitty\nscript and leaves otherwise competent movie makers to fix it in post.\n"
"\nThis film is the worst!!!!!! I caught this when I was on a movie binge.\nI was super excited to see it because of the surrounding buzz. The film\nis trash. Leo received a pity Oscar because of the internet. His\nperformance is about the same as it ever was. I would look to Tom Hardy\nas the films saving grace, but just another generic role in a based on\ntrue story film. I ended up finding myself fast forwarding through\nparts of Leo's overacting. Pure trash manufactured for the masses and\nsomething to fill out the award shows. I'm not gonna waste anymore time\non it and you shouldn't ether. If you're a Tom Hardy fan I suggest\n\"Bronson\" or \"Locke\". They will be a much better ride than this flat\ngeneric film.\n"
"\nRevenant is way overrated!!! This movie is unrelentingly grim and\nlacking any point. Leo di Caprio didn't do much that could be called\n'acting'. Grimacing, moaning, yowling, grunting...maybe 10 lines of\ndialogue, most if it in Pawnee (supposedly) Jim Hardy really deserved\nan award...something better than an Oscar, for his incredible\ncharacterization of Fitzgerald, the evil antagonist...he stole the show\nfor me. If I ever watch it again, it will be for the incredible beauty\nof the cinematography, and Jim Hardy's performance. I still love\nInarritu's work, but his 'mystical' touches didn't work in this film,\nso this was not his best.\n"
"\nHow many times do I have to tell people this film is a rip-off of the\nexcellent 1971 (John Huston directed film) \"Man in the Wilderness\"\nstarring Richard Harris?<br><br>Indeed the plot has been ripped entirely from the original authors\n(Jack DeWitt) screenplay, by the wholly unscrupulous Michael Punks\n(apparently an ambassador to the W.T.O. in Geneva), then made to a\nscreenplay by the extremely ignorant Mark L. Smith and Alejandro G.\nInarritu.<br><br>What a bunch of plagiarist bastards!!!<br><br>Equally ignorant is the whole of the Hollywood \"machine\" for\nperpetuating the nonsense around this film along with the Oscar awarded\nfor the \"originality\".<br><br>Perhaps if DeWitt had not died in April 1981 (and the remaining family\nsurvived/realised) this resultant Hollywood trash nonsense may not have\nthen come about?<br><br>I await comments, or IMDb wiping this critique\n"
"\nWell ...... you'd think that by now I would not fall for the 8.0 review\non IMDb but once again we commit ourselves to being tortured by the\nmost dullest and pointless film that I've seen in a while for 2.5 hours\nof our lives, trying to make out any kind of dialogue over the most\nnasty noisy background of what sounds like wee wee trickling into a\nurinal or the screech of a thousand nails across a blackboard. Was\nthere any point in watching it, I'm none the wiser the only reason I've\ngiven it two stars is for the scenery cause if that wasn't in it then\ns@@t me ..... how these pieces of dung get nominated for Oscars is\nbeyond me. I'd rather spend 2 and a half hours watching my sons\nanimations using those connecting plastic bricks (rolls eyes) at least\nthere is a flipping story and far more entertainment. Whoever has rated\nthis film 8.0 is deluded. A total utter pile of depressing horse manure\nwhich you could watch 10 minutes of and experience the same thing! X\n"
"\nRambo is more realistic than this. No more words needed. It spoils the\nscenery. It spoils the acting. And speaking of acting. Why Leo gets an\nOscar for this movie is unclear to me, especially considering his\ncharacter doesn't appear to be the main one either. There are so many\nother great films where he deserved an Oscar for. This is not one of\nthem.<br><br>I still can't get over the incredibly unrealistic story portrayed here.\nDo they really expect the audience to just believe in everything? This\ncould have been so much better. Think of the Last of the Mohicans. Now\nthat's a great movie!<br><br>Don't bother with this 2:36h movie.\n"
"\nI walked out of this movie about 2/3 of the way through. As a\nhistorian, I was looking forward to this film. The true account of Hugh\nGlass is an incredible survival story. Unfortunately, most of the story\nis a pure fabrication, and there is a strong political slant attached.\nWhile I have a great deal of sympathy for Native Americans, it is\nobvious that the makers of this film went above and beyond to vilify\nfrontiersmen. Furthermore, there were incidents in the movie in which\nGlass came across as nearly being a super hero. What a shame. There is\nsome decent acting and good cinematography, but the story is just too,\ntoo lame.\n"
"\nIt is well played.. Leonardo Dicaprio does an awesome job as always!\nThis movie is very well directed. However, the plot is too boring.\nThere are so many interesting, wonderful stories about Native\nAmericans. Why such a boring story? It was too long. <br><br>I wish the scenario was more interesting. For this kind of story I\nexpected more adventure since it is not a pure art film. The scenario\nwas so predictable and monotone.. There was nothing surprising in the\nmovie.. If Leonardo was not in the movie, I would never be able to\nwatch the complete movie..<br><br>Maybe my expectation was so high..\n"
"\nProbably the most pointless, if not stupidest, movie I have wasted time\non this year. <br><br>All I saw was: the bear was ramming into, slapping, gnawing at Leo's\nface, neck, body, hands and legs. At one time it was literally CHEWING\nhis hand and leg. However, in that freezing weather, without any\nmedication, proper care or food, after being choked and put through the\nmental anguish of seeing his son killed right in front of his eyes, he\nmanaged to make it all the way to his first meal. <br><br>The rest of the movie was, like everyone said, nothing.<br><br>I saw Leo was PLAYING PITIFUL to be considered for an Oscar! This is\nPA.THE.TIC.\n"
"\nI'm going to give this a 10, it's deserved. Marvelously captured and\nvery authentic depiction of a story about betrayal that aims to stay as\nclose to the truth as possible and the Indians are not made into the\ngood or the bad guys, none of the usual Hollywood cliché's, I love\nthat.<br><br>°Minor Spoiler Alert°<br><br>Whether it's realistic to assume a man would be able to hunt down his\nfoe after barely surviving a bear in the midst of winter is\nquestionable, nonetheless I absolutely loved it. Make sure you can\nstomach the grim display of the realities of survival but once you\nsaddle you're good to go. I'm still letting the images sink in, so I\ndon't have much to say except, make sure you see this movie ..\n"
"\nStar studded cast but the movie leaves too little to be desired. The\nrevenge was too little, too late. The film definitely not Oscar worthy.\nThe film begins with a 1823 quasi-military hunting party of trappers\nand hunters hunting for pelts in the unsettled wilderness of the\nLouisiana Purchase under the command of their Captain, Andrew Henry .\nHostility from the Native American Arikara Indians leads to an ambush\nof the hunting party. Only about half of the hunters manage to escape\non one of their rafts, salvaging as much as they can while still under\nfire from the attacking Arikara. Henry leads the escaping party,\nknowing that they are still being pursued by the Pawnee. The party is\nfurther slowed down when Hugh Glass , one of the experienced hunters,\nstumbles on a mother grizzly bear and her cubs while he is separated\nfrom the rest of the party.\n"
"\nReally now, beside the landscape and the performance of Tom Hardy,\neverything else was boring. I do not understand why and how this movie\nwas selected for so many Oscar nominations.<br><br>The story is more than predictable, Caprio acting is limited as his\ncharacter has its limitation (I do not want to write spoilers), the\nrest of the team, beside Tom Hardy which in my opinion was great, are\nbelow average.<br><br>I consider this movie the best candidate for Rotten Tomatoes, not at\nall for the Oscar statue. Even if Caprio made some sacrifices in order\nto perform (temperatures, eating, etc.), I do not consider that the\nOscar nominations should be awarded for such reasons.<br><br>This movie was equal to boring time for me.\n"
"\ntotal man vs wild show. not a good movie. total 2 hour 30 min. you can\nskip 2 hour easily and sleep in this time. only interesting thing\nDiCaprio tried his best to survive these tough(impossible) situations\nfor an Oscar.<br><br>make up and acting was good. but this move lack depth. it tried to show\na past event but added lot of impossible and imaginary things. these\nfactors destroyed the simplicity of this movie. again, it's not worth\nwatching. better watch another movie in this time period.<br><br>this will be a great episode of \"remote survival\" in national\ngeographic channel.\n"
"\nI think this movie is really overrated.<br><br>The photography is great and the acting is good (i liked the Tom Hardy\nperformance, and I liked the Di Caprio one too, although I think he did\nbetter performances in other movies).<br><br>The plot is really inconsistent and not coherent at all, I do not want\nto spoiler it but the first part of the movie is well built and\nbelievable, the second part feels fake, the behaviour of the captain\nhas no sense and the final sequence remember more a super heroes movie\nthan a \"true story\" one...<br><br>I don't wonder at all that the second part of the movie (and of the\nbook), the revenge one, totally divert from the real fact that inspired\nthe book.\n"
"\nThis movie sounded familiar. So did a little research and surprise!\nIt's a knock-off from a movie from 1971. It's not an original story and\nthe original was much better. Check it out yourself.<br><br>http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0067388/ MAN IN THE WILDERNESS 1971.<br><br>Quoted from the movie: <br><br>\"In the early 1800's, a group of fur trappers and Indian traders are\nreturning with their goods to civilization and are making a desperate\nattempt to beat the oncoming winter. When guide Zachary Bass is injured\nin a bear attack, they decide he's a goner and leave him behind to die.\nWhen he recovers instead, he swears revenge on them and tracks them and\ntheir paranoiac expedition leader down. - Written by Alfred Jingle\"\n"
"\nOkay, this is a really good action film, but it's too gory and\npredictable. Fitzgerald is an irredeemable bad guy. The entire scenario\nwas too good to be true. Leonardo DiCaprio was terrific in acting the\npart but his character had not 9 but 10 lives in this movie. How is it\npossible for a person near death to survive so many ordeals? The one\nwith jumping off a cliff and surviving the fall when still very much\nnot in great shape is remarkable and unbelievable to me. Of course, I\nknew the fate of the captain at the end before viewing the last scenes\nand DiCaprio's trick to get Fitzgerald at the end was used in a\nprevious movie. This flick reminded me of the one with Robert Redford\nin Jeremiah Johnson. Tom Hardy played Fitzgerald very well, but it was\ndifficult at times for me to understand what he was saying.\n"
"\nI cannot believe this move got awards. It is from 18th century and in\nthe middle of NOWHERE - in the snow mountains with horses.<br><br>There is no chemistry or any attempt to do character-building, bonding\nbetween father and son and the whole story makes NO sense. Except for\nthe bear attack (with poor graphics), there is nothing really worth\nmentioning in this movie.<br><br>If you want to watch it, be prepared for raw some content - eating raw\nmeat, animals, fish and swimming in snow water and WET throughout. Also\none person biting off another's ear and spitting out it.<br><br>I watched this by mistake. I wasn't paying attention and thought it was\nAllegiant that is not released yet. So I ended up wasting 2.6 hours of\nmy life that I can never get back.\n"
"\nFirst of all, if Di Caprio would get the Oscar with this movie, that\nwould be a real shock to me.<br><br>The movie starts quite energetic and attracts the audience,\nnevertheless when the story starts, it is too slow, quite boring and\nnon realistic. when I watched the movie, I have remembered the road\nrunner that never dies. You must watch the movie without conscious to\nenjoy. Many scenes and actions are out of nature.<br><br>Also it is too long, well one can suppose to see good panoramic scenes\nnevertheless they are not included. I really spent my 3 hours for\nalmost nothing.<br><br>Simply it was a sample of bad story telling and scene directing for me.\n"
"\nLoosely based on the life of 19th century frontiersman Hugh Glass, The\nRevenant is a brutal yet visually stunning western with one of Leonardo\nDiCaprio's best performances yet. The film follows Glass after he is\nmauled by a bear and left for dead by his fellow fur traders. One of\nthe frontiersmen, John Fitzgerald, kills his son, and Glass voyages\nover 200 miles to exact revenge on him. The Revenant is one of the most\nviolent movies I've seen from 2015, although the incredible scenery and\ncinematography also make it one of the most astonishing movies to look\nat. It combines some intense, difficult-to-watch scenes with amazing\nscenery which makes it one of the most beautiful violent films I've\nseen. Leo's committed and demanding performance is certainly one of the\nbest of his career especially because of the lack of the dialog in the\nfilm. The 156- minute running time, relentless brutality and limited\ndialog does take a bit of a commitment to finish, but The Revenant is a\nmasterfully directed film that makes the most of its subject matter's\nintriguing story.\n"
"\nThe short summary of the movie above basically is the movie. \"A\nfrontiersman on a fur trading expedition in the 1820s fights for\nsurvival after being mauled by a bear and left for dead by members of\nhis own hunting team.\" And then he comes back and gets his revenge. And\nthey drag this on for 2 and a half hours. No wonder there are so many\nshots of they sky. Best actor? For what? Eating raw liver? Is that all\nit takes to get best actor thesedays? No interesting dialogue or\nconfrontation. This is just a bad movie. Bad directing. Acting wasn't\nbad but certainly wasn't Oscar worthy... or maybe it is worth it since\nOscar is worth garbage thesedays.\n"
"\nYeah, a Hollywood actor can survive the mauling by a huge bear. Can\nsurvive being buried half-dead in freezing temperatures. Can survive\nalone and half dead and wounded in freezing temperatures without food\nand weapons, swimming in freezing cold water, surviving in wet clothes\nin freezing temperatures . Miraculously this Hollywood actor can\nsuddenly run when necessary while he limped just a second ago. Though\nfinally arriving at a safe spot still half dead , he is immediately\nable to go out again and fight his enemy. Half of the movie I closed my\neyes because I had no desire to watch the gore fest, the beautiful\nscenery with stolen Ansel Adams images did not make up for the rest. I\nshould have followed my initial instinct. After watching a preview I\nthought that this was not a movie for me and I was right. Never again\nwill I fall for the hype. Unbelievable.. Disgusting blood orgy.\n"
"\nDon't get me wrong because I've given this movie such low rating. I've\nalways loved DiCaprio's performance. Prior to release, when I read the\nsynopsis and bit googling about Hugh Glass, I started eagerly waiting\nfor the movie. However after watching all I could think was, even if\nthis movie wasn't ever made, nobody would've cared. The problem is not\nwith the acting or direction, cinematography etc. I just don't think it\nwas needed to be made as there's nothing great about it. Now I know\nthere are plenty of movies out there, which we don't care about. But\nwhen Leonardo DiCaprio is starring in a movie, it's like you must watch\nit and enjoy. All this movie's about is survival (which isn't\nhighlighted as I'd hoped for) and revenge. The problem is that these 2\nthings are sort of ignored by the director. We see lots of Red Indians,\nFrench bla bla!! Its hard to explain, perhaps someone with a better\ncommand of language can explain better after watching.\n"
"\nThis movie was so awesome that it actually convinced me of writing my\nfirst review. Let's start with the good: very nice winter scenery with\ntop notch acting from Leonard DiCaprio. There's also lots of action\nscenes, but did not find myself caring too much about the outcome. The\nbad: very slow paced story about Chuck Norris crawling in the snow in\nthe 1800's. First 2 hours are about Glass surviving a bear maul attack,\nbeing left for dead in a frozen forest with no water or food, survives\nbeing dragged in a freezing river for miles, survives falling on a\nhorse of a cliff, etc. Come on, really? Then the revenge part takes\nabout 20 minutes: the bad guy flees an army fort with all the money,\nand only 2 people go after him. Really? I was so bored I actually\nnoticed the sound track being really weird: it sounded like a broken\ndripping faucet and it left me wondering if that's really a sound that\ncan be heard in a frozen forest during winter. Anyway, to sum it up,\nI'm really disappointed for wasting 2.5 hours to see this.\n"
"\n\"Contains spoiler\" It was expected from this movie, in my opinion, that\ndoesn't contain a revenge story and rather contain one based on coping\nwith nature and more survival. Furthermore, The dream scenes of the\nmain character were awful and they did not create a good relation with\nthe atmosphere of the movie. If it wasn't for these defects, I would\ngive this movie a 10. Though, the tow main actors did play their role\nskillfully and dialogues were brilliant, the movie could include more\ncaptures of the spectacular landscapes and thoughtfully conversations.\n"
"\nI tried, really tried to get into this show. But it just didn't work\nfor me. I'm not a movie student or buff by any means. Yeah, the special\neffects were excellent &amp; the mood was appropriately (?) somber, dark\nand bleak.<br><br>But a great deal of the dialog was unintelligible, esp from Hardy &amp;\nDiCaprio...and the show was mainly about them! Also, some the editing\nwas wacky enough to spoil the timing and mood of the scenes. The young\nactor near the end who played the officer really didn't fit in. The\nelectronic music soundtrack was OK for awhile, but some of it was\noverused.<br><br>All in all, a weak production.\n"
"\nI mean, I wasn't upset that I watched this movie, but I didn't see\nanything special, other than a bear.<br><br>Tom Hardy was once again hard to understand, and seems to be trying to\nbecome the most famous actor for mumbles and grunts.<br><br>They took a legend, filled in the gaps, added some Hollywood flair and\na lot of gore... what exactly is rated 8 out of 10 about it? I don't\nsee how this movie is so appealing to the masses. There is little\nacting, other than the portrayal of pain. There is so little to the\nlegend that Hollywood had to add in a twist to make the story less\nboring, and add in a second series of emotions for Leonardo Dicaprio to\ndisplay.<br><br>Nevertheless, The Revenant, was decent, but by no means great.\n"
"\nLet's face it: everything Leo did in this movie I could have done. Eat\nraw meat, raw fish? No prob. Crawl inside a (fake) dead horse? Brave\nbad weather? What did he do that the average actor couldn't do? I\nliterally laughed out loud when he swung his wobbly arm trying to chop\na branch with a tomahawk. You see the muscles confused when called upon\nto do this manual labor. Toss him upon a pile of supermodels and he's a\nnatural, but grab a shovel? Which end? Compare Leo with Spencer Tracy\nor Steve McQueen, two actors from real life. They worked, served in the\nmilitary, etc. When they do things, I believe they are doing things.\nLeo's Oscar lowers the standard of acting excellence to whoever can\nbear extreme conditions when they're otherwise used to yachts, caviar,\nand Wolf of Wall St. living. Inarritu worked around this for the sake\nof the DiCaprio brand, but imagine Keaton spitting and screeching his\nway through Birdman. Are you saying he would have won? Let me put it to\nyou this way, and then I'll thank you for your time: Leo Dicaprio\ncannot act.\n"
"\nLeonardo DiCaprio and Tom Hardy star in this 2015 drama based on the\nnovel and inspired by true events. This takes place in the 1800's and\nDiCaprio (Titanic) plays Hugh Glass, a frontiersman who leads a hunting\nexpedition. Soon, Glass is injured by a bear and left for dead by one\nof his men, John Fitzgerald (Hardy) who not only betrays him, but\nmurders his son. Glass struggles to survive the wilderness while\nregaining his strength and health to find Fitzgerald. This is a great\nfilm with suspenseful and heartfelt moments, DiCaprio definitely gives\nan Oscar-worthy performance and there's beautiful, remote settings. The\nfilm also shares similarities with \"The Grey,\" \"Deliverance\" and \"Cast\nAway.\" I recommend this.\n"
"\nDon't even half to watch the full movie to know how terrible it is.\nLooking at the trailer it seems almost unrecognizable from the book\n(which i happened to read in two days). The main idea of the story was\nhim being a ruthless fighter but it changed the whole prospective and\nadded in characters of all sorts that weren't needed. First of all he\ndoes not even have a son and his girlfriend (not wife) died while at\nsea who was not at all aboriginal. This was supposed to be based on a\nreal mans story and they totally disregarded that and changed his\nhistory. They most likely used this to add a love interest or some sort\nof positive ethnicity image (since a lot of the natives were portrayed\nas bad) it was unnecessary and just sad. It took away the whole idea of\nproving himself to the people that left him to die. Not surviving only\nto get revenge for his son and wife. It erased the whole meaning and i\nsuggest giving a book a try. Its a whole lot better then this s**t.\n"

"\nI normally like these type of movies ,love survivorman , yet this was\nan awful movie IMO and way too unrealistic. The fact that Leonardo got\nnominated for this and Will Smith didn't shows what those old white\nguys like.They remind me of the NFL back room old white guys just\nwanting to keep rolling in the money whatever the cost.Last year Selma\nwas ignored and specifically David Oyelowo.<br><br>The phoney part of the Revenant ,besides the bear , to me was when he\nwas in the freezing water with huge heavy coats on, didn't sink and\ndidn't freeze and after getting out had no dry clothes or a fire. And\nhow many grunts and groans were in this script for him.\n"
"\nwow just wasted 2.5 hours on watching this... was inclined to stop 20\nminutes in, but sucked it up. this movie tries too hard to be too many\ndifferent genres slyly and to use all the techniques film has to the\ndirector's disposal. but no. this won best Oscar? its a plain-as-day\nexample of Hollywood Illuminati control fodder. Leo is a bad actor wow.\nto be honest, would of liked to of seen a young Shatner because he is\nan actor. and this isn't a nature documentary; this isn't a horror\nfilm, don't use cameras and audio like it is and you are a desperate\nfreshman film student showing his 'chops'. and whoever wrote this or\ndirected this.... its BAD. in not so many words, historical and natural\ninaccuracies throughout, cliché and failed homages, and it takes a lot\nmore skill to 'break the fourth wall' (as is popular now) than was put\ninto this piece of bullshit - 3/10\n"
"\nThe beginning is OK, but the rest is crap. A man is mutilated by a\ngrizzly bear and evil men let him lye 'dying' and almost buried. But he\nsoon very fast recovers unexpectually and can do everything in the\nwilderness. i expected to see an interesting and exiting movie but it\nturned out to be exceptional bad and boring - one of the worst movies I\nhave ever experienced. How in the world can this ridiculous unwillingly\nfunny movie get so good reviews ..? Sudently he stands up and walks and\ntalks and crawles along this lengthy movie. I can see a purpose in this\nfilm but, my god it is weitten in capital letters\". I did not feel\nanything about him, just laughing at this rediculess and unsatisfiing\nmovie. What a turn off.\n"
"\nContains spoiler.....In short, the movie was great on scenery, acting\nand cinematography, but short on realism.<br><br>I was a wilderness medicine instructor in the West for 10 years, thus\nis was incredulous that the characters, including Leo suffered no cold\ninjury. In those wet conditions, Trench Foot, Freeze injury to hands\nand feet as well as hypothermia from brief immersion in the rivers\nwould have taken most out.<br><br>More over the nature of the bear wounds would have led to sepsis and\ndeath in short order.<br><br>The story was pure fantasy but beautiful and dramatic.<br><br>dr. rick\n"
"\nI really like Leo and he does give a fine performance in this average\nmovie but the ever annoying Tom (I can do Ameeericannn accents) Hardy\nreally racks me off. So if you want a treat the check out ... Man in\nthe Wilderness (1971) .....In the early 1800's, a group of fur trappers\nand Indian traders are returning with their goods to civilization and\nare making a desperate attempt to beat the oncoming winter. When guide\nZachary Bass is injured in a bear attack, they decide he's a goner and\nleave him behind to die. When he recovers instead, he swears revenge on\nthem and tracks them and their paranoiac expedition leader down. This\nstory line SOUNDS FAMILIAR. Richard Harris and John Huston brilliant\n...\n"
"\nSorry for the ones who loved the film, but here is somebody who did not\nlike it at all. In the end it's just a typical you hit me bad but I\nwill get you in the end wrapped up in beautiful cold landscapes and\nsome historical background. I like Leonardo a lot as an actor but that\ndoes not mean that all his films are good. In this one when if you daze\naway for a moment (not difficult with those long scenes..) you wake up\nand you could think you are watching First Blood... I expected\nsomething much more epic, not a simple revenge story.. by the way was\nit really necessary to kill that bear?? Was she not just protecting her\nbaby bears? Is it really so necessary to show us so much violence,\ndon't we see already enough on the news?.... I am not sure if we really\nneed those kind of film directors...\n"
"\nThis is a story of a trapper in the 1800's who is double crossed, left\nfor dead and has to find his way out of the rugged wilderness.<br><br>The film opens with a great action scene. All the action in the film is\ntop notch, edge of the seat.<br><br>The scenery is stunningly beautiful and the characters are quickly\nfleshed out.<br><br>I didn't really feel the harshness of the environment, people wander\nout of freezing streams with hardly a shiver and force march for miles\nlike they are strolling around the park.<br><br>Leonardo gives a great performance and I did really care about the\ncharacter and I was rooting for him. However, he take a massive amount\nof physical punishment. This goes on to such an extent that I became\ndesensitised to the character's pain by about half way through and\nreally stopped caring when he was winged for the the umpteenth time.<br><br>A good adventure film, a bit low on action for such a long film. Not\nreally my cup of tea.\n"
"\n\"The Revenant\" opens with two absolutely jaw dropping scenes, the\nsecond arguably topping the first. They alone are worth the price of\nadmission.<br><br>The first is an extraordinary battle scene that feels like it was\nfilmed in one take. The camera puts you there, on the spot, in the\nmidst of the carnage. It makes you feel as though what it is allowing\nyou to see is really going on all around you, not around it.<br><br>The second scene is impossible to speak of without using hyperbole. It\nis unlike anything I have seen before. Yes, I am talking about the bear\nattack scene, easily the greatest film moment of 2015, and one of the\ngreatest scenes of any film made in the new millennium so far. This\nwill surely top the list of \"how the HELL did they do THAT?\" moments in\nmovie history.<br><br>The rest of the movie is solid, but not quite up to that standard, but\nthat standard is so high, this shouldn't be taken as a negative.<br><br>The performances by DiCaprio, Hardy and Gleason and also top notch, and\nensure that the movie is never just about its set-pieces.\n"
"\nI have seen movies with Di Caprio far better than that...good acting by\nLeo but a boring boring movie...anyway Leo has become a much better\nactor than what he was in his beginning, there is no doubt about\nthat...nice plots (i like nature) and violence scenes...OK...not for an\nOscar definitely...but as always...not always the best getting the\nOscar...they owe Leo an Oscar...and they should have given it\nearlier...that is why this movie gave him an Oscar...just for\nthat...same story with Julia Roberts...i really got disappointed...an\naverage of 8 for a boring movie like that is strange...Heightful 8 is\nmuch better with a better plot...\n"
"\nThe natural landscape and some of the scenes are overwhelming and\nspectacular! The camera-work is so immersive, you believe are a part of\nHugh Glass' journey through the wilderness and back to civilization.\nAlso with great performances not only by DiCaprio, but also Hardy, as\nthe unsympathetic fellow fur trapper leaving Glass behind. <br><br>Story-wise, it is a bit thin for a 156 min picture. Glass' quest for\nvengeance is sometimes lost as he utters few words about his drive and\nis being more or less, chased himself. The story arc of the Indians\nquest for their daughter felt a bit out of place and strange. We also\nget to see the fur trappers p.o.v. that left Glass behind and the\nCaptain way ahead of them. Which in my opinion takes a little bit of\nthe magic of Glass' total perilous journey.<br><br>All my stars goes to the beauty, production value and performances\nalone! Regardless, this is one of those overlong movies one like, but\nwould not sit out for another viewing!\n"
"\nI was hoping for something a bit more interesting than Hollywood's\nstandard approach to cowboys and indians, especially as the film seems\nto have been critically acclaimed and Leo is a great actor. <br><br>The quality of the camera-work is excellent and the bear mauling scene\nvery accomplished if that is the right way to describe such a visceral\nfew minutes. But oh the plot. If you try to take it seriously it fails\nutterly. As an Indiana Jones caper it lacks wit. Too often you say 'I\nknow he'd be dead from hypothermia/blood loss etc etc in any possible\nworld but I'll just keep watching in case something interesting\nhappens'. You ride your horse over a 150 foot drop, fall into a tree,\nand survive. You travel downstream in an icy river in your fur coat and\ndon't drown/freeze. You manage to light a fire even when you are\n9/10ths dead, there are no branches and you're flint went a few scenes\nago. What a relief when the baddie is finally left to his fate, but\nthen you realise you've just wasted 2 hours of your life.\n"
"\nI cannot believe how many people think this is a good movie....watching\na guy struggle to survive for 2 hours ...come on people..I know there\nare not many good movies being made but my word....so many things are\nunbelievable...the bear attack, carrying a near dead guy out of the\nwilderness up a mountain...going over a cliff on a horse and not\ngetting hurt...spending long periods of time in freezing cold\nwater.....surviving extreme cold overnight inside a dead horse...my god\nthe list is endless....and for Leo's so called acting don't get me\nstarted...a lot of crawling and moaning and groaning....the whole thing\nwas a letdown and really a waste of time...also tell the director to\nback the camera up a bit on those facial close-ups...they were also\nridiculous...trust me save your money and go see The Hateful Eight.\n"
"\nWhat a waste of a night. Spoiler alert! Here is the whole movie in 30\nseconds.<br><br>A guy almost dies, a guy walks, a guy builds a fire, the guy almost\ndies again, walks some more, goes for a swim, builds a fire, almost\ndies, goes for a swim again, builds a fire, makes it back safely, goes\nback out again, finds a fire, almost dies, makes someone else go for a\nswim. Looks into the camera deeply. The end.<br><br>Best supporting actor to the bear. My life would have been better had\nyou finished the job.<br><br>I'm pretty sure this script was two pages long, and they turned it into\na 2.5 hour movie.

"\n\"The Revenant\" is probably the most beautiful movie I have seen for a\nlong time. This is not only due to the incredible locations, but also\nto the excellent (and by excellent I mean excellent) camera-work.\nFrequently I was just blown away by the sheer beauty of the rough\nterrain of Canada and how it was captured by the crew. However, there\nare a few drawbacks. Mainly the story (it is a very simple revenge\nstory line) and the dialog (it is basically not existent :D).<br><br>When I first left the movie I was still blown away by all the great\nthings I mentioned above (I was thinking about a 10/10 rating), but the\nlonger I was outside the movie the more I recognized that \"The\nRevenant\" is a film that is incredible entertaining whilst sitting in\nthe cinema, but also a movie I quickly forgot about when being at home\nagain.<br><br>Still, the movie is definitely a must-see. Your money is well invested!\n"
"\nIn real life, Hugh Glass was mauled by a grizzly &amp; left for dead, but\nmanaged to drag himself back to a frontier outpost. The cinematic\nhandling of the story in Revenant, however, is straight out of Cormac\nMcCarthy: heavy-handed with funereal music &amp; gray-scale tones\nthroughout, creating an overall impression that the sun rarely ever\nshone in those mountains in those times. Just watching it becomes a\ntest of endurance. Cold, colorless, dismal, stark, bleak, brutal,\ndispiriting &amp; ultimately pointless. Perhaps that was how these men\nactually lived their lives? Maybe that's the point? If there is one?<br><br>At the end of the film, we're left not even knowing whether Glass,\nafter exacting vengeance on the man who killed his son, lives or dies\nhimself. Or perhaps that doesn't matter? Perhaps none of it matters?\nPtui! Worst film I've watched since Deadman.\n"
"\nUnbelievable bad movie!<br><br>I mean come on, i watched Titanic, and the same guy dies of Hypotermia\nin 5 minutes of cold water!!!<br><br>***spoiler*** Now he not only sleeps on the snow while totally ruined\nand left to death after a bear attack, he crawls for miles, take swims\nin a river with snow and ice around, get outside, sleeps a bit more\nthen make a fire from a spark, on the snow, then kill some, then fall\noff the cliff with a horse and then he shows that he knows how Han Solo\nsaved Luke on planet Hoth from dying.<br><br>It could be such a good movie if bear killed him at the start. Or at\nleast i wouldn't have wasted so much time watching it...\n"
"\nUtter, utter, utter, utter, waste of 2.5 hours of my life. One of the\nmost boring films I've seen. Unintelligible dialogue and no real story.\nLeonardo Di Caprio is a fine actor and should have been given an Oscar\nfor Wolf of Wall Street instead of this tripe, where he hardly has to\nact. OK, the conditions were harsh, but not as harsh as having to sit\nin a cinema and watch this. Tom Hardy was mumbling, as ever, and seemed\nto be a baddie for the sake of it. After an hour I was looking round\nthe cinema to see if anyone else was as bored as I was. Di Caprio's\ncharacter, Glass, is mauled, constantly frozen and wet, starved,\ndehydrated, witnesses (in his delirium) his son being murdered and\nrides off a cliff and yet I didn't really sense the suffering. Bilge.\n"
"\nRevenant was the worst movie I've ever seen. If you want to pay $7 to\nwatch almost 3 hours of Leonardo DiCaprio sleeping and breathing\nheavily in the snow, it's the perfect movie for you.<br><br>It was also really inaccurate as the dude Leo was playing was somehow\nvery literate and wrote in present day English. This would not have\nbeen the case. it was really unnecessary to have this detail in it. <br><br>The only enjoyable part for me was the symbolism of Leo's rebirth as he\nwas coming out of the horse that he was in due to the weather. <br><br>I am only writing the last two things because i can't upload the first\nparagraph unless i have 10 lines. <br><br>But seriously. Do not waste your money on this movie. Pirate it if you\nreally wanna see it, but even then, it isn't even worth the time.\n"
"\nIt is a travesty. The scenery shots are boring and carelessly tacked on\nto create a disparity between the violence and serenity of nature I\nassume but it's really badly done. I think it's supposed to be arty? If\nyou watch the trailer, google some pics of Canadian landscape and\nyoutube that scene from star wars with the tauntaun you have basically\nwatched the movie. Don't waste your money. It is soulless Oscar fodder\nand brings nothing new to cinema so if you want to watch the same old\nstory of a guy surviving against all odds because revenge and manpain\nare powerful driving forces, go for it. You'll probably enjoy it. If\nyou want to watch something with beautiful editing or scenery or\ncostume design, there are way better films out there that do all of\nthis a lot better and have a more original storyline/progressive way of\nshowing that storyline. I found it very dull and Leo does not deserve\nan Oscar. Maybe Tom Hardy does. But Mad Max was better so he should win\nit for that.\n"
"\nShot using all natural light, The Revenant is one of the most gorgeous\nfilms you will ever see. Leonardo Dicaprio deserves his first Oscar for\nhis incredibly dedicated performance, easily the best of his career and\nTom Hardy gives an Oscar worthy performance for his role as the\nhaunting beast John Fitzgerald. The first act of the film was\ndefinitely the most impressive. With stunning visuals and flawlessly\ncrafted intense action scenes, I felt like I was watching real footage\nfrom the 1820's! Then the vast snowy wilderness kicked in, the majority\nof the time it was breathtaking. But at times The Revenant got a little\nlost in the wilderness and sometimes felt a bit repetitive, it's still\nan unpredictable and suspenseful adventure with many surprises. It's no\ndoubt one of the years best films.\n"
"\nOne of, if not the worst, movies if ever seen. wanted to leave after 30\nminutes, but stuck it out for thirty more, hoping it would get better.\nWhen it became obvious that Glass would survive and get his revenge\nafter another hour and a half of boring action, we left. Plot is boring\nand obvious. Wish I could get my price of admission back. Sadly a big\nwaste of time and money. Is this the best the film industry can do?\nHopefully not. Would not recommend this to anyone. Actually am\nembarrassed to admit I stuck it out for as long as I did. Terrible!\nTerrible! Terrible! Spoiler alert? Really? Plot is so obvious! Dialog\nis stupid. Character development non-existent. etc., etc., etc\n"
"\nDon't listen to what anyone says about this movie. It's bad... I liked\nall the actors playing in this movie, I'm a real fan of all leonardo\ndicaprio's movies. I loved Tom Hardy In \"peaky blinders\". And I like\nthe performance of Will poulter in \"we are the millers\" and \"maze\nrunner\". Like always they didn't disappoint. <br><br>On the other hand this movie is depressing aaaalll the way. I don't say\nevery movie should have a happy ending. But at least give us a reason\nto watch this movie besides beautiful panorama shots of the\nenvironment. The build up to action is to slow and when the action\nfinally comes it's banal. No captain would go after a deserter alone\nwith a wounded man! <br><br>Without spoiling any further about the movie. I thought it sucked\nreally bad and I want the world to know about it! yours sincerely a\nmoviefanat who made an account on IMDb just to trash this movie.\n"
"\nIf ever there was a case of style over substance, The Revenant is it.\nVisually stunning, yes, but films have always been about more than\nthat. If something nice to look at is what you want, go and stare at a\npainting or a photo for 2 and a half hours.<br><br>This isn't a bad film in the way that Adam Sandler films are bad, it's\na bad film because there is nothing (bar the visuals) to enjoy. It is\nso unrelentingly grim, with zero character development, It left me\nasking, am I meant to care? As the film opens with the slaughter of\nhalf the group, it's a pretty brutal scene, but with no impact, as we\nweren't even introduced to them. This serves as a recurring problem\nthroughout the running time.<br><br>The only thing interesting thing about this movie is that it serves as\na metaphor for DiCaprio's own struggle to earn an Oscar. His character\ngoes through so much Hell to survive, has everything thrown at him, and\nits' almost like Leo is pleading to the Academy - 'Look, look! See what\nI'm willing to put myself though?!'To be fair, it paid off in that\nrespect.\n"
"\nThis is, simply put, one of the most sadistic films I've ever seen.<br><br>I read the novel, \"Lord Grizzly,\" by Frederick Manfred, when I was in\nhigh school. It told the story of Hugh Glass and it was a good novel.<br><br>Years later, Richard Harris starred in \"Man in the Wilderness,\" also\nbased on the Hugh Glass story. It wasn't a great movie, but it wasn't\nbad.<br><br>\"The Revenant\" is a terrible movie.<br><br>It's extremely violent at the beginning; extremely boring in the\nmiddle; and extremely brutal at the end. <br><br>George Lucas has said the secret to making a great movie is: Have a\ngreat opening, a great ending and try not to screw up the middle.<br><br>The director of \"The Revenant\" failed on all three counts. <br><br>This is why I don't pay any attention to Academy Award nominations any\nmore.\n"
"\nMay contain spoilers. I'm sorry Hollywood but life threatening\ninjuries(shattered bones, severed major veins/arteries and\nsmashed/slashed tendons) don't just 'heal-up' by themselves. This and\nthis alone made me give up on reverent shortly after he and his horse\nwent over the cliff. Early on when DiCaprio 'cauterized' the deep\nwounds on his neck with fire I told my buddies that I'll bet he'll be\nwalking soon.....without a cane. Well I was right! Miraculously his\nbusted up foot and hand were healed in a couple days. I told them when\nI shattered my femur I should have crawled through the bushes, waded\nacross the stream and crawled thru the woods behind my property for a\nfew days and I could've came out strutting like nothing had happened.\nBut I don't live in Hollywood-land where life threatening injuries\nsimply disappear. Additionally, no one can swim in freezing water\nwithout inducing hypothermia....cheeez!!! Suggestion: When this movie\ncomes out on television you'd be better off watching Gilligan's Island\nreruns.\n"
"\nI guess society has reached the point where everyone is living in a\nvirtual fantasy world. There is little grasp on reality anymore,\nespecially in film - when a truly good story is represented in this\ncompletely fantasized and revolting manner. The only likely reality in\nthis film is that he was mauled by a bear. That's where reality and\nfantasy end! We stayed until the last 10 minutes before we could not\ntake another second of this sickening stench of a film. Be warned, if\nyou have a healthy dose of common sense, you'll hate this film - and\nyourself for paying to see it. <br><br>Now I see that I have to write 10 lines about this wretched film in\norder for them to publish it. Great! Unfortunately I do not have\nanymore to say...\n"
"\nBoring movie. No plot. Waste of my time and money. Got sucked in by\nsome of the reviews. Even the scenery added to the misery of the whole\nmovie. A person groaning for an hour and half is not my idea of\ninteresting. The only interesting part is where Leo's character gets\nmauled by a bear. Then back to the snoozefest. I can't believe people\nactually enjoyed watching this pathetic movie. Worst movie that I\nwatched in 2015. <br><br>I still can't believe Leo and Tom Hardy were nominated for Academy\nAwards for this. By the end of half hour of listening to his groaning,\nI wished the bear had had him for dinner.<br><br>None of the characters were likable or relatable. Takes a lot more than\nstunning cinematography to get me excited about a movie. You need plot,\ngreat acting, character development, narrative, believability etc and\nthese were all sadly lacking and that made me angry. If I wanted to\nwatch beautiful scenery I can walk outside or watch National Geographic\nchannel. It was very over-rated and over-hyped.\n"
"\nThere is a giant flaw in current major Hollywood productions; the\nessential art of telling a good story.<br><br>We desperately need writers who can produce strong screenplays with\nplots that develop and hold our interest throughout a film. And we need\ndirectors and editors who are able to seamlessly weave together a story\nthrough film. We do not need a bunch of scenes tacked together and\ncalled a movie.<br><br>The Revenant being hailed as a great film is a travesty to movie-\nmaking. It's a movie without a story, something far too common these\ndays in Hollywood.\n"
"\nAnd some good acting and great cinematography, but HIGHLY overrated. It\nshould be cut in half and it would still drag. The spirituals visions\ndon't really add much and at times make it difficult to follow what is\ngoing on. But then the plot is so predictable you know what is going to\nhappen before it does, so you really just sit back and look at nice\nscenery and some good acting without needing to follow the story\nbecause you know exactly what will happen all the time. Anything the\nleast bit bloody is dragged out.<br><br>If you liked \"There Will be Blood\" (another predictable pointless\nmovie, you will like this one. Personally I found both to boring and\npoorly done.\n"
"\nIf this wasn't such a fantastic piece of storytelling, I would be\ninterrupting every three minutes to ask \"how the hell did they make\nthat shot?\" Even if you know a lot about special effects, this film\nwill have you scratching your head all the time.<br><br>There are shots that start as close ups, go super wide, half way up a\nmountain and then close to something else miles away. There are\ninteractions with animals like the bear, shot in a way that defies any\ncinematographic, animal training, prop, or other trick you can think\nof.<br><br>I can't wait to see some sort of \"making of\" that will allow me to\nsleep at night when I understand how they did it all. Instead of that\njerky, overdone, getting us all motion sick, hand-held camera, there is\na wide angle system which sucks you into the action in a way we haven't\nsee before.<br><br>It doesn't matter if you don't like DiCaprio or dislike \"that type\" of\nmovies. This is an awesome piece of work, worth watching regardless\nsimply for the technical artistry.\n"
"\nThe movie was simply put too monotonous/boring in my humble opinion.\nSometimes less is more but in this particular case it would have been\nbetter if we actually got to see something else than Leo walking around\nin the snow. The story was also not very compelling which makes me\ndoubt why so many people seem to think that this was a \"great movie\". I\ncan sum up the entire movie in two convoluted sentences: Leo plays a\nperson who is part of a small group of frontiersmen who are at war with\nthe natives. Leo gets attacked by a bear, almost dies, remains crippled\ndue to the attack for the majority of the movie, watches his son\ngetting killed by a fellow frontiersman while being unable to do\nanything about it, gets left behind in the wilderness to die (by the\naforementioned traitor), seeks revenge, gets revenge, end of the movie. <br><br>It was pretty disappointing and totally predictable (the end, that is).\n"
"\nDespite my best efforts, I failed to notice any acting happening in\nthis film. Lying on the ground and moaning is hardly a stirring\nartistic feat.<br><br>OK, we get it, bears are scary, and getting mauled by one would be a\nvery unfun experience. Yes, we get it, winter is cold and being stuck\noutside in winter isn't fun. Yes, we can see that the instinct of\nself-preservation is strong. Well, welcome to class Mamalia. And yes,\nwe all now that revenge motivates people to perform crazy feats of\nstrength.<br><br>The landscape shots were beautiful, and the plot was half (well, OK,\n1/3) believable. That's about it.\n"
"\nSlow and boring! <br><br>It's basically 2+ hours of watching a half-dead guy crawl through the\nsnow. <br><br>A waste of time.<br><br>It was humorous when after being mauled by a grizzly bear and receiving\nno medical attention, he manages to escape into class 5 rapids without\ndrowning. <br><br>He's wearing 200 pounds of clothes but manages to stay afloat through\nall of that. <br><br>Okay.\n"
"\nI have never seen Leonardo DiCaprio in any below-the-average movie so I\nhad high expectations watching it. What a shock! The most boring movie\nI can remember having watched. How can it have 8,2 rating with so many\nnegative reviews? It should have been between 4,5 and 5,5 stars without\nany doubts.How can people be excited about it? Seriously, I have never\nwritten any reviews ever before all these years I have this account in\nIMDb but l just couldn't stand it. I had to say it and warn others. It\nwas that disappointing.<br><br>Boring plot, scenario inexistent, too much violence and that ridiculous\nscene with the bear... all mixed with a direction the cherry on the top\nof the cake. A direction that could even make someone who just got an\necstasy pill to fall asleep after few minutes. <br><br>Don't waste your money like most people say here.\n"
"\nThis film should have been edited down by forty minutes. We got the\nmessage of man vs. man vs. nature very quickly. Nature is beautiful but\ncruel, and man in his natural, lawless state is more cruel than that.\nSure, the photography is beautiful, and the actors are props, not much\ndifferent than the CG bear. The only character shown in closeup was\nGlass/DiCaprio; all the others are blurry, bearded faces given sparse,\nbarely articulate dialogue. The Indian-language words are accompanied\nby subtitles, but so should have been the words spoken in English. And\nyou could hardly write a spoiler, because there is a resolution to only\npart of the main character's adventure.\n"
"\nI heard of this movie before i went to see it.. and as everyone said it\nis a great film I where really looking forward to see it (especially as\nthe trailer is quite good).<br><br>Well after I have watched it now, I have to say this movie is one of\nthe worst I have ever seen! It is unbelievable long (the boring way of\nlong) and there are more logical errors than in all movies I have\nwatched before combined. This features superhuman strengths, sudden\nchanges in depletion level and more.<br><br>Everyone who knows a little bit about survival and bush-crafting will\nhave the strong desire to leave the cinema instantly.<br><br>So from my side: Don't waste your time, don't watch this one\n"
"\nI personally found this movie to be boring. Definitely one of the most\nboring movies I've ever seen. Yes, it looks good visually, but that's\nall it has going for it. Even when something was happening, nothing\nhappened. They easily could have cut an hour out and it still would\nhave been boring, but at least it would have been so long and drawn\nout. I feel that this is probably one of those movies that people will\nclaim to like because it's the popular thing to do. But seriously, how\nmany times can look at CG trees and still be amazed at how real they\nlook? In the end, this was two and a half hours of my life that I'll\nnever get back.\n"
"\n*warning may contain spoilers*<br><br>I really do not understand the good reviews. I had to stop 3 quarters\ninto this joke of a movie. No story. Bunch of killings. The star\ncharacter (Dicaprio) has more souls than a cat. He gets mauled by a\nbear yet can walk, talk, and survive. He survives with drenched clothes\nin the freezing wilderness. He Flys off a cliff, and you guessed it,\nstill lives. <br><br>I love Leo, and no words can describe my utter disappointment. The\nstory is non existent, only killing and killing and killing. One native\nAmerican looking for his daughter, one white man looking for revenge\nmaybe? Or just trying to survive, and another white crook who killed\nhis son. <br><br>Spare yourself, unless nice shots and graphics is all you care about !\n"
"\nImmediately forgettable, because no emotional connection is established\nbetween the characters and audience. As you are watching, you find\nyourself asking \"Why isn't this working?\" and, as you walk out of the\ntheater, you're still wondering \"Why?\" One answer is the characters are\nsingle dimensional; another, the editing is confused, chopped. A third,\nscenes of nature, the outdoors, environment, locale, etc that should be\nintegral to the emotions, but are not evocative, and seem to have been\nfilmed, then interspersed periodically for no reason and to little\neffect. David Lean could use the locale to tell the story. This\ndirector cannot or does not. Im sorry to say these things, because I\nwas really looking forward to the movie.\n"
"\nLeonardo DiCaprio is basically just screaming at this point in life.\nThe movie stunk. I think people forgot that movies are supposed to be\nenjoyable. Even though things keep happening, with Indians and fighting\nand killing, I didn't give a darn about the movie or anyone anyone in\nit. I kept looking at the time. Which dragged on and on.<br><br>This movie didn't have 5 minutes of story, let alone 2.5 hours. There's\none cool scene, and it lasts 3 seconds. Coolish.<br><br>Don't believe the trailer. They hyped this garbage up, and put in a\nplot, but there is none; just like with The Grey. You want to see it\nbecause of Leonardo Dicaprio. Do yourself a favor and cry yourself to\nsleep instead.\n"
"\nAfter all the praises about this film, I took time to watch all of it.\nIt was basically a film about how beautiful winter scenes and weather\ncan be. Other than the nature scenes, I found this boring, distracting,\nstupid to the point idiotic in certain circumstances, also where Hardy\ncan hardly be understood and his character is ridiculous, and the fact\nthat Leo's character did not die of hypothermia. You have to watch the\nmovie to see what I am talking about The jest of this movie is the\nstory of a man's survival in the wilderness. I will say that the bear\nscenes were astounding graphic and very realistic to the point that it\nwas amazing that he even survived the attack. If you want to watch it,\nbe my guest but I will not watch it again. And I would recommend to my\nfriends not to waste their time on this movie. The film I would\nrecommend watching is \" Man in the Wilderness\" 1971, staring Richard\nHarris and John Huston, who was also the director This film is so much\nbetter\n"
"\nNonsense! There was more hope.Cheap, worthless Leo, a bad filmmaker.\nThe film is artificially adjusted to receive an Oscar. Very\ndisappointed Leonardo Di Caprio play. The role did not Oscar. Many plot\nblunders. For example, a horse gutted, and when he left not cut off\nfrom her meat. He does not know that horses eat or a fastidious ?! The\nmain actor played very simple. So would any mediocre actor played. And\nit is not the role of the father. He looks too young. Well played by\nanother actor - the role of the villain in terms of dramatic games. The\nsecond time is not particularly want to watch this movie. The second\ntime is not particularly want to watch this movie. Many artificial,\nunreal, tense rescue the protagonist. Suddenly, there was some kind of\nlone Indian. He eats raw meat sitting next to the three fires!\n"
"\nThe book is interesting, but not great. The film though, glacial and no\nwhere near great. Scenes are too long, too similar, too insignificant. <br><br>The lack of dialogue is... sharp? Were it not that it makes for a truly\nbland experience in combination with the production. Di Caprio is\nsolid, as ever, but I haven't got a scooby about his character. The\nother characters, apart from the anti- hero are completely\nuninteresting. <br><br>I need ten lines to review this. I don't need them. I need ten lines to\nreview this. I don't need them. I need ten lines to review this. I\ndon't need them.<br><br>This is the most uneventful Hollywood film since... I don't know, a\nlong time?<br><br>I genuinely can't recommend this film, sorry.<br><br>The final conclusion - tried too hard to be interesting.\n"
"\nHonestly I think I just watched a dude crawl in snow for 2 hours trying\nto kill another dude, with minimum words said!!, the performances where\nepic by both Tom &amp; Leo!!!, there is no doubt in that, but the plot is\njust so boring, there is nothing interesting about the story other than\nhow the hell Glass survived, I wanted to leave in the first like 10\nmins, but I always hoped that it would get better but it didn't, the\ntrailer does'nt reflect the movie well, because from the trailer the\nmovie seems epic, but really the movie is just boring boring boring, it\ngot all the acclaim for the wonderful performances and the amount of\nwork done in the field of cinematography, they focused on that much but\nforgot to focus on evolving the story and the characters, I didn't\nemotionally connect with the movie what so ever, I am very\ndisappointed.\n"
"\nThe Revenant is just a remake of the 1972 movie Jeremiah Johnson\nstarring Robert Redford??? Hollywood can't seem to come up with any new\nideas. Now just making remakes under a different title... or am I\nmissing something? Sure in the 2015 version the cinematography is\nbetter and the fight scenes more gruesome but the story line is still\nthe same.<br><br>And for not doing any of his stunts DiCaprio is nominated for an Oscar\nfor looking wild thanks for the great makeup artists. Now that's\nHollywood today. My oh my how things have changed. Yesteryear, the\nOscars celebrated talent now it is just political\n"
"\nBoy, I had a difficult time watching this movie. It is just to much of\nthe same thing and the same emotion. Dicaprio had an easy time learning\nhis lines, because not many words came out of his mouth, a lot of\ngrunting instead that gets annoying quite quickly. There was a lot of\nlaughter amongst the audience, not because the movie is funny, but is\nis at many times over the top and highly unlikely. Yes the nature is\nbeautiful but I'd rather watch an episode of BBC earth, that is a lot\nmore uplifting. Overall the movie was quite disappointing. I don't get\nthe praise at all. The script can be summarized in one page, and that\nis not a good thing.\n"
"\nI don't get it! How can this movie be rated 8.2? Yes the filming and\nvisual effects were stunning, but the movie was flat out boring. The\nstory is old and over played and the entire movie seemed like a cross\nbetween Castaway and Payback. <br><br>DiCaprio's character gets attacked by a bear, buried alive, rides a\nhorse off of a cliff, careens down a freezing river and gets stabbed,\nbut still survives. Wow, how exciting.<br><br>And to think that he can even be nominated by an academy award is\namazing. He grunted through the entire film and when he finally could\nspeak, he did a bad impression of Marlin Brando in the Godfather.<br><br>Don't waste your money or time (lots of time) on this movie.\n"
"\nThere is almost nothing good to say about this film. It was painful to\nwatch, slow, no joy or any good feelings, and just plain boring after a\nwhile. I cannot understand why it got so many awards. Even the nature\nscenes which were beautiful were impossible to enjoy because of the\nfeeling of dread hanging over every scene.<br><br>The last hour was predictable. I dreaded what was to come, holding out\nhope that it would not be a long drawn out ending to an exhausting\nfilm. Unfortunately, the pain was drawn out. Like a bad dream that\nwould not end.<br><br>It is worse than a waste of my money, it ruined my evening and will\nmake me feel awful for days. Avoid this film.\n"
"\nAbsolute highlight was the pictures of beautiful landscapes. <br><br>As for the film, i don't understand how anyone can be nominated for an\nOscar if they don't have a script. Crawling around on the floor should\nnot be enough for any award. I can only assume somebody noticed\nDiCaprio should really have had an Oscar by now so decided to give him\none for this - speechless.<br><br>Massive dose of Hollywood fantasy as surviving being killed by a hungry\nbear, floating half an hour in freezing water and not being shot by one\nof fifty Indians while shooting a self loading flintlock pistol back at\nthem just about sums up the film. <br><br>No story, no words, no good. Save your money and your time and don't\nbelieve the hype!\n"
"\nCould it be that you can let one miracle pass but not dozens? Is it\nbecause of all those great actors that don't make any difference at all\n(lots of grunting and mumbling beards)? Or the utter predictability of\nthe story? Maybe I just can't take the never-ending hunger for revenge\nanymore, a subject Hollywood just keeps revisiting - over and over.<br><br>Looks like all it takes to win prizes is some nice visuals, a few good\nnames, professional production. Add a few scenes from American history\n(maybe some are actually a bit historically correct).<br><br>During the movie I could not force myself to stop thinking about the\nterrible cold and hypothermia and how he makes these fires being fully\nsoaked. There are so many miracles, I cannot just shake those off and\nbelieve what happens next.<br><br>I feared it would be something like this, gave it the benefit of the\ndoubt, no luck. Still 3 out of 10 - but not for having a good time\nwatching it.\n"
"\nWhatever may be the rating, the one thing all should agree is \"There is\nno story\"<br><br>One side it was absolutely realistic, showing real blood, real light,\nflesh, death arrows. OK great<br><br>Other side, its absolutely ridiculous. A guy who was cut open from head\nto toe, swims across freezing water, eats and sleeps, no infection, no\ndisease and stays strong enough to take revenge.<br><br>Come on, what kind of story is this? I literally puked in many scene.\nreally do you have to show that much blood and flesh in a movie which\nhas a top cast like Di caprio?? It is not a war movie and the violence\nis not at all necessary in this movie.<br><br>The crew suddenly vanished once for all and Tom hardy just escapes\nevery one.Seriously, are all other soldiers that lame to let a single\nman escape ??<br><br>Serious disaster. Not a good movie to watch with family.If you get to\nsee the rated version DVD, 25% of the movie will be gone in censor.\n"
"\nAwful movie. The worst one i watched this year...(so far). I can't\nimagine how sick and perverted someone must be to make such a crappy\nand repulsive film?! Average scenario, flat dialogues, no acting game\nat all....just rivers of blood everywhere. Too much for my taste, and\nalso for the tastes of many people in the cinema theater - today half\nof them just left after the first disgusting scene ....and they were so\nmany of them! What was the idea of the movie - some kind of exotic\npunishment for the audience?! I think \"The Revenant\" is appropriate for\npeople who love blood, aggression and killings, but it is not for\nmentally sane people. Watching this movie was totally waste of my time.\n"
"\nWhat was all the hype about regarding this colossal miserable film?<br><br>The film starts off too brutal for me with the Indians on the rampage,\nkilling off many of the traders.<br><br>Am still wondering why Leonardo Di Caprio won the best actor Oscar for\nthis film? He gave many other much better performances in other films.\nThe choice was ridiculous.<br><br>The one shining spot of this horrible film was the supporting\nperformance by Tom Hardy as the villain, who justified his evil ways by\nway of religion.<br><br>This basically comes down to revenge and it's amazing that DiCaprio\ncould ever survive the mauling by that bear to regain the stamina\nneeded to track down Hardy, who had killed his son in the interim.<br><br>Yes, the scenery is unusual but it best reflects the mood of the entire\nfilm.\n"
"\nThis film ranks as one of the very worst films I've ever seen, It's\ndown there with Birdman, Blair Witch and the that piece of tripe about\nEva Peron with Madonna in it. I've walked out of films better than all\nof the above.... seriously folks, don't waste your lives on this\nunmitigated garbage. I thought the Bear was brilliant, the snow was\npretty etc. The dialogue seemed to be predominately unintelligible\nmumbling (no I'm not deaf or hard of hearing), continuity was rubbish\ntoo, i.e. beard growth, ability to light fires, immunity from the\neffects of cold. , all in all I couldn't 'Bear' it, I think the beast\nwas trying to do us all a favour by attempting to kill the main\ncharacter, Just my opinion of course, no offense meant.\n"
"\nThe best thing I can say is that this movie was beautiful, a real feast\nfor the eyes. Every shot was truly breathtaking. You could tell that he\nwas using all natural light and it really payed off. <br><br>As far as plot and substance, I personally I felt like I had to wade\nthrough A LOT of unnecessary gore to get to a highly unsatisfactory\nending. Not to say I don't like gore, I have been known to like my fair\nshare of bloody dramas. Its just that this film just seemed to be\n\"beating a dead horse\" so to speak, amongst other things to that poor\ndead horse. The ending (which I wont get into) was just.... a let down!\nat least to me. If I'm going to feel that uncomfortable during a movie\nI want to feel validated at the end.\n"
"\nAnother Indian/Good - White man/Bad movie. Too long. Too draggy. Too\npolitically correct. Why was the Indian kid such a little bitch? Why\nwas he screaming like that? The bad bad white guy had a real point\nthere. The French were bad. The Angloes were bad. They drove off the\nSpaniards, apparently. Good thing we can all turn to the noble savage\nfor instructions on clean, upright living. I thought it was really\npathetic that they had to mention how many hours went into the making\nof the movie, like they're supposed to get kudos and awards based on\neffort instead of outcome. After floating down a river a few times,\nsleeping in a makeshift sweat lodge, sleeping in a horse carcass for no\nreal reason, writing graffiti in an pseudo-igloo, digging, climbing,\nfalling, cauterizing, baking, freezing, puking, crawling, the sob\nprobably died of tetanus. How long can you watch this sort of thing and\ncontinue to be entertained? Three hours...nope. Oh, I know, this guy is\nsupposed to be just so sympathetic based on the fact that he's almost\nan Indian that we're all riveted. Nope.\n"
"\nIf what you would want to see in a movie is beautiful cinematography\nhung in an Ansel Adams frame, this is the movie for you. If you want\ngritty historical movie with ample gore, this is the movie for you. If\nyou want a realistic plot and realistic survival situations, you may\nwant to pick another movie. Some of the implausible survival situations\nsucks you right out of the movie, willing suspension of disbelief\nblown, while you try to get back into the movie. If this happened only\nonce, perhaps I could be more forgiving, but all I could think of was\nDiCaprio jumping up and saying \"it's just a flesh wound!\" It got\ncomical and ridiculous. Be sure you can forgive many mistakes before\nyou go see the movie.\n"
"\nFirstly I've given the film a four for the opening scene and the bear\nattack and that's about it . The only part of the film worth watching\nis the first ten minutes . The rest of it is basically di caprio\nrolling around in pain and surfering. <br><br>Visually the film is nice , but we also need to be entertained and this\nfilm just didn't do it. I also can't understand why di caprio got an\nOscar for this, he's acted much better in many films. I'm not saying he\nacted bad I'm a great fan of his , but the film didn't use di caprios\nacting abilities at all , he just has to look in pain the whole time\nand that was it . <br><br>The way the movie was hyped I really was expecting a masterpiece but\nit's far from it , not much dialogue , no action and it gets very\nboring just watching scene after scene of pretty much the same thing.\nWaste of time watching it on my opinion.\n"
"\nThe Revenant is beautifully shot, but the story is poorly told. one\nhour into the movie I still had no care for any of the characters.\nwhich makes it extremely dull for me to get through. It is like\nwatching a documentary without introduction, narration or storyline.\nother than the cinematography i have nothing positive to say about this\nfilm. I cannot understand why this movie get so much appraise. it\nshould have been edited down to a 30min shortfilm and not be two hours\nand thirtysix minutes long.this is two hours and thirtysix minutes of\ncompletely wasted time i cannot get back. You can ask me why I use my\ntime writing about it. answers is...So you have a chance to avoid\nwasting time on this movie.\n"
"\nWell acted and well photographed, yet unfocused, as it is told from\nmultiple perspectives (DiCaprio's, Hardy's, and the Native Americans) ,\nwhile I think Hardy's character was much more interesting and\nconflicted than DiCaprio's. <br><br>Film turns DiCaprio's character into a sort of wilderness superhero,\nable to survive being mauled by a bear (twice) , hypothermia, near\ndrowning, and, in the film's best scene, a fall from a great height\nwhile on horseback. However, its dramatic effect is largely negated by\nthe fact that the scene was shown in the trailer. Even worse, by that\npoint in time, we are positive he will survive, considering all he has\nalready lived through. <br><br>There's a difference between resilience, being determined to survive,\nand being an indestructible (and unrelateable) superhero.\n"
"\nImagine a cross between Jeremiah Johnson, Get Carter and Superman and\nyou have The Revenant (sounds pretty good). This is basically an old\nfashioned revenge saga. Now I know it's a remake of the superior Man In\nThe Wilderness starring the late great Richard Harris but it really did\nget a bit carried away with itself.<br><br>The filming is great and the huge landscapes are the real stars of the\nshow. The problem, as in so many movies these days, is one of\nplausibility. Without giving too much away our hero (DiCaprio) survives\nnot one, not two, not three but about 7 brushes with CERTAIN death. <br><br>Colossal loss of blood, wet clothes in a sub zero environment,\nstrangling, smothering, , falling off a cliff, drowning, knives, guns,\nIndians, baddies, gangrene..................the list goes on and on and\nall that was really missing was a red cape, a kiss curl and a cameo\nperformance from Stan Lee.<br><br>Awards should go to the technical folk and it must've been a tough\nshoot for the cast but when you boil it all down there's a lot more\ngravy than meat and potatoes.\n"
"\nJust to say a little, I watch a lot of movies. I know when a movie is\ntechnically sound and when a script is mediocre. I was excited about\ngoing to see this movie. Everything seemed interesting, DiCaprio, Tom\nHardy, Alejandro as director. However, this movie was not engaging\nthroughout the movie. The first 35 minutes of the movie are good, then\naround the second act, it gets crucially dull, then the last 35 minutes\nare good, but the plot of the script of this movie is not intriguing.\nThe movie could have been shorter and it would have been better in my\nopinion. The characters were very flat, however, Tom Hardy's character\nwas by far the most multi-dimensional and characteristic. The\ncinematography was astonishing in every aspect, the acting was great,\nbut the story was monotonous and slow paced. I would not recommend this\nmovie.\n"
"\nThis films exposes Leonardo DiCaprio as a mediocre actor. Never at any\npoint is the viewer able to get past his awkward over-acting and be\ndrawn into the film. DiCaprio was entirely miscast in this role. He\nstill looks too young to have a teenage son and the makeup and hair in\nthis film doesn't change that perception. None of it is convincing. He\neven manages to make the real stunts look fake. Aside from that, the\nfilm is terribly slow and isn't over when you want it to be. It's\ngratuitous to a comical level in its violence, which cheapens it and\nmakes it gimmicky. I actually laughed during the film's climax because\nit was so absurd. Tom Hardy stole this movie however. Watch this movie\nfor his performance because everything else will let you down, from the\nacting to the plot and the dialogue. Even the bear phoned it in. Ugh,\nthis movie was so disappointing and it bothers me that so many people\nloved it.\n"
"\nVery long movie for a thin story! A lot of closeup violence without\nmoving the story forward. Father motivated by revenge but why is the\ncommander of the base so eager to put his life in danger for a \"scouts\"\nloss.<br><br>Closeup filming with wide angle lens to the point where it just becomes\ntiresome. I wonder how many times the actors bumped their heads into\nthe camera lens.<br><br>High point of movie is Bear-Mauling Scene after this fast forward\nbutton is your friend! No loss if you don't watch this movie.<br><br>Similar to The Soldier, Leo and Kurt Russel hardly speaks in the movie.\n"
"\nOne goes to the movies, usually, to be entertained &amp; escape reality...\nThis movie was so gory and graphic that it provided neither an escape\nfrom reality nor entertainment. Some of the scenes are stomach turning.\nThe plot is predictable which makes the drawn out length of this\nhorrible movie completely pointless -- the story could've been told in\n30 mins. (tops). The acting was pretty mediocre .... Not much acting to\nbe done aside from dragging oneself along on the ground and breathing\nheavy through half the movie.<br><br>I honestly couldn't see any reason for the high rating this movie has\non this site nor understand the whole Oscar \"buzz\" over it... Truly one\nof the worst movies I've seen in a while.<br><br>To sum up... Don't waste your time. Or if you choose to waste it, make\nsure you're not eating while you watch... UGH!<br><br>I'd give this long-winded bit of trash a negative rating if possible.\n"
"\nI HATED this movie... There aren't very many movies I can say that\nabout either. I couldn't understand a single word the southerners were\nsaying.. They had subtitles for all the other languages, I feel like I\nneeded it for English as well. That's not even the worst part about\nit.. Everything was so random and just one thing after another, nothing\nseemed to make sense! For some reason I have to give 10 lines, but try\nnot to give anything away.. I hate how movies, this one as well,\nglorify rape. I hate how they show animals getting shot point blank.\nThis guy gets shot, he lives, he gets mauled by a bear, lives, gets\nburied alive, lives, goes over a waterfall, lives.. I finally walked\nout after the rape scene and wish I could get my money and time back.\nIt's 2.5 hours of worthless trash.\n"
"\nThis film and is awful. The worst film I've ever seen in my whole life.\nWhat is it even about? Leonardo crawling about the snow after being\nattacked by a bear and getting his son killed. Crawling about injured\nhalf dying like a smack head from drumchapel shopping centre eating\ncreatures and raw fish. Then miraculously gets strength to fight back\nand kill people to get revenge for his sons death that he caused in the\nfirst place. Nah tom hardy should have gutted him like the pikey he is\nand left him not even bothered to finish him never mind be kind enough\nto dig him a grave. I was looking forward to this film and am so\ndisgusted I wish bear grylls would jump out a tree and rip leonardos\nface off hope tom hardy finishes the job. Leonardo should have just let\nthe bear finish him and then his son would not have died. I have a new\nending.......leonardo is attacked by the bear and everyone else just\neats him and lives happily ever after x\n"
"\nHere comes 3 hours movie in 10 sentences:<br><br>SPOILER ALERT: <br><br>Plot: There is some fight between Indians and Americans. Leonardo got\ninto the fight. He also get attacked and wounded by the bear. His\nfriends left him alone. His son got killed. He somehow survives, eating\nbones,leaves and fishes. He can make fire when ever he wants, never\nmind, if snowing or he just came out of river. Then he met other\nIndian, who helped him. But this Indian got killed by French guys. Then\nLeonardo's horse got killed and has to sleep inside his horse. Then\nspring comes, and he comes out of the dead horse. Then they found him.\nThen he chased the guy, who killed his son. And that's pretty much all.\n"
"\nIt should win an Academy Award for realistic looking cinematography. I\nkept thinking this was going to eventually be a great movie because it\nlooked so good.<br><br>After awhile I realized it was a tired old script: Cowboys and Indians;\nkidnapped daughter; killed son; Revenge; Blood and guts and suffering;\nLeo is the only one who has a GPS in his head.<br><br>There was no need to waste so much talent and money making this film.\nYou could watch a medical surgery flick or attend a hospital's\nEmergency Room on a Saturday night and achieved the same result.<br><br>This is line #10 which is required. I've run out material.\n"
"\nAwesome movie, that will surely get many Oscar awards for best actor\n(Leonardo DiCaprio), supporting actor (Tom Hardy), cinematography and\nmakeup, best director and best picture, possibly costume design and\nediting. The bear attack scene is monumental and memorable, I do not\nremember having seen a bear attack described so well in all its\nwildness in any film or documentary. The many landscapes of wild nature\nare very beautiful! Leonardo DiCaprio's wounds and tormented face are\nso well rendered, I do not know how one can lose the Oscar for makeup.\nThroughout the film, Leo plays absolutely brilliant, with Tom Hardy\nalso excellent. The movie is very well built in details, it has\nmemorable scenes (like the one when jumping on the horse from the cliff\nand surviving in the freezing night that followed) and depicts very\nwell the struggle to survive in harsh natural conditions in frontier\nareas in those times. Awesome cinema experience for a viewer -\ncongratulations to the whole film crew for a job well done!\n"
"\nI don't understand all the praise for this film. It was just basically\n2+ hours of Leonardo DiCaprio being put through a survival course. <br><br>His backstory was some low level, basic Disney plot (although even\nDisney would frown that at backstory by today's standards). &amp; the main\nplot was just dull &amp; uninteresting.\n"
"\nLet me start by saying that I thought Leonardo DiCaprio was terrific in\nthis film and well deserved his Oscar for the role. However, there is\nso little plot in the movie, and some really, really improbable\nsituations where his character is rescued and/or escapes that my\noverall feeling was one of real disappointment. Tom Hardy spends most\nof the movie talking like he's got a mouthful of hardtack and even when\nyou can clearly understand him, isn't really saying much. The director,\nto me at least, seemed to understand how little plot and story there\nactually is in the movie by using scenes of a river or clouds as links\nbetween scenes and then lingering and lingering on those scenes of a\nriver or clouds. There is also gore aplenty to help stretch out the\nrunning time. Aside from DiCaprio, the praise heaped on this movie\nmystifies me.\n"
"\nAn enthralling story, with fabulous scenery and brilliantly acted -\nDiCaprio's Oscar was totally deserved. To counter this, the film could\nhave been at least half-an-hour shorter (possibly more) with several\ndrawn-out scenes which did nothing to enhance the tale and were\nmeaningless in terms of character development. The intense and\nenthralling finale was totally ruined by a constant high-pitched and\nextremely irritating whistle, only to be replaced by some maniac\nbanging on a piece of sheet metal which left me on edge and unable to\ndevote full attention to the thrilling denouement. I was left feeling\nthat I had wasted 2 1/2 hours of my life watching a film which I could\nhave enjoyed so much more.\n"
"\nStunning scenery and visually beautiful throughout... but I can\nexperience that, and so much more, by taking a trip to a local nature\nreserve. At least there I don't have to experience such lousy\nstorytelling, poor dialogue and highly improbable events.<br><br>The 'plot' is repetitive and predictable, with holes the size of\ncraters. Never before have I seen a man make such a miraculous recovery\n- from being on his death bed and unable to move, to swimming through\nice cold rivers within the space of a few scenes.<br><br>The film grows more and more ridiculous with every passing scene. At\nleast there are some pretty snow covered mountains to look at... until\nthe snow magically disappears.\n"
"\nA supposedly smart pelt trapper manages to do so many things that would\nhave killed him in reality. Like taking a long swim in a freezing\nriver, walks up to a pack of wolfs consuming a bison without any\nweapons and stands in the freezing river while filling his canteen with\nwater. <br><br>I.e. the script is typical Hollywood drivel. <br><br>Visually its very well done and the sound design is also very well\ndone. <br><br>Once again Hollywood manages to green light a movie based on a shitty\nscript and leaves otherwise competent movie makers to fix it in post.\n"
"\nThis film is the worst!!!!!! I caught this when I was on a movie binge.\nI was super excited to see it because of the surrounding buzz. The film\nis trash. Leo received a pity Oscar because of the internet. His\nperformance is about the same as it ever was. I would look to Tom Hardy\nas the films saving grace, but just another generic role in a based on\ntrue story film. I ended up finding myself fast forwarding through\nparts of Leo's overacting. Pure trash manufactured for the masses and\nsomething to fill out the award shows. I'm not gonna waste anymore time\non it and you shouldn't ether. If you're a Tom Hardy fan I suggest\n\"Bronson\" or \"Locke\". They will be a much better ride than this flat\ngeneric film.\n"
"\nRevenant is way overrated!!! This movie is unrelentingly grim and\nlacking any point. Leo di Caprio didn't do much that could be called\n'acting'. Grimacing, moaning, yowling, grunting...maybe 10 lines of\ndialogue, most if it in Pawnee (supposedly) Jim Hardy really deserved\nan award...something better than an Oscar, for his incredible\ncharacterization of Fitzgerald, the evil antagonist...he stole the show\nfor me. If I ever watch it again, it will be for the incredible beauty\nof the cinematography, and Jim Hardy's performance. I still love\nInarritu's work, but his 'mystical' touches didn't work in this film,\nso this was not his best.\n"
"\nHow many times do I have to tell people this film is a rip-off of the\nexcellent 1971 (John Huston directed film) \"Man in the Wilderness\"\nstarring Richard Harris?<br><br>Indeed the plot has been ripped entirely from the original authors\n(Jack DeWitt) screenplay, by the wholly unscrupulous Michael Punks\n(apparently an ambassador to the W.T.O. in Geneva), then made to a\nscreenplay by the extremely ignorant Mark L. Smith and Alejandro G.\nInarritu.<br><br>What a bunch of plagiarist bastards!!!<br><br>Equally ignorant is the whole of the Hollywood \"machine\" for\nperpetuating the nonsense around this film along with the Oscar awarded\nfor the \"originality\".<br><br>Perhaps if DeWitt had not died in April 1981 (and the remaining family\nsurvived/realised) this resultant Hollywood trash nonsense may not have\nthen come about?<br><br>I await comments, or IMDb wiping this critique\n"
"\nWell ...... you'd think that by now I would not fall for the 8.0 review\non IMDb but once again we commit ourselves to being tortured by the\nmost dullest and pointless film that I've seen in a while for 2.5 hours\nof our lives, trying to make out any kind of dialogue over the most\nnasty noisy background of what sounds like wee wee trickling into a\nurinal or the screech of a thousand nails across a blackboard. Was\nthere any point in watching it, I'm none the wiser the only reason I've\ngiven it two stars is for the scenery cause if that wasn't in it then\ns@@t me ..... how these pieces of dung get nominated for Oscars is\nbeyond me. I'd rather spend 2 and a half hours watching my sons\nanimations using those connecting plastic bricks (rolls eyes) at least\nthere is a flipping story and far more entertainment. Whoever has rated\nthis film 8.0 is deluded. A total utter pile of depressing horse manure\nwhich you could watch 10 minutes of and experience the same thing! X\n"
"\nRambo is more realistic than this. No more words needed. It spoils the\nscenery. It spoils the acting. And speaking of acting. Why Leo gets an\nOscar for this movie is unclear to me, especially considering his\ncharacter doesn't appear to be the main one either. There are so many\nother great films where he deserved an Oscar for. This is not one of\nthem.<br><br>I still can't get over the incredibly unrealistic story portrayed here.\nDo they really expect the audience to just believe in everything? This\ncould have been so much better. Think of the Last of the Mohicans. Now\nthat's a great movie!<br><br>Don't bother with this 2:36h movie.\n"
"\nI walked out of this movie about 2/3 of the way through. As a\nhistorian, I was looking forward to this film. The true account of Hugh\nGlass is an incredible survival story. Unfortunately, most of the story\nis a pure fabrication, and there is a strong political slant attached.\nWhile I have a great deal of sympathy for Native Americans, it is\nobvious that the makers of this film went above and beyond to vilify\nfrontiersmen. Furthermore, there were incidents in the movie in which\nGlass came across as nearly being a super hero. What a shame. There is\nsome decent acting and good cinematography, but the story is just too,\ntoo lame.\n"
"\nIt is well played.. Leonardo Dicaprio does an awesome job as always!\nThis movie is very well directed. However, the plot is too boring.\nThere are so many interesting, wonderful stories about Native\nAmericans. Why such a boring story? It was too long. <br><br>I wish the scenario was more interesting. For this kind of story I\nexpected more adventure since it is not a pure art film. The scenario\nwas so predictable and monotone.. There was nothing surprising in the\nmovie.. If Leonardo was not in the movie, I would never be able to\nwatch the complete movie..<br><br>Maybe my expectation was so high..\n"
"\nProbably the most pointless, if not stupidest, movie I have wasted time\non this year. <br><br>All I saw was: the bear was ramming into, slapping, gnawing at Leo's\nface, neck, body, hands and legs. At one time it was literally CHEWING\nhis hand and leg. However, in that freezing weather, without any\nmedication, proper care or food, after being choked and put through the\nmental anguish of seeing his son killed right in front of his eyes, he\nmanaged to make it all the way to his first meal. <br><br>The rest of the movie was, like everyone said, nothing.<br><br>I saw Leo was PLAYING PITIFUL to be considered for an Oscar! This is\nPA.THE.TIC.\n"
"\nI'm going to give this a 10, it's deserved. Marvelously captured and\nvery authentic depiction of a story about betrayal that aims to stay as\nclose to the truth as possible and the Indians are not made into the\ngood or the bad guys, none of the usual Hollywood cliché's, I love\nthat.<br><br>°Minor Spoiler Alert°<br><br>Whether it's realistic to assume a man would be able to hunt down his\nfoe after barely surviving a bear in the midst of winter is\nquestionable, nonetheless I absolutely loved it. Make sure you can\nstomach the grim display of the realities of survival but once you\nsaddle you're good to go. I'm still letting the images sink in, so I\ndon't have much to say except, make sure you see this movie ..\n"
"\nStar studded cast but the movie leaves too little to be desired. The\nrevenge was too little, too late. The film definitely not Oscar worthy.\nThe film begins with a 1823 quasi-military hunting party of trappers\nand hunters hunting for pelts in the unsettled wilderness of the\nLouisiana Purchase under the command of their Captain, Andrew Henry .\nHostility from the Native American Arikara Indians leads to an ambush\nof the hunting party. Only about half of the hunters manage to escape\non one of their rafts, salvaging as much as they can while still under\nfire from the attacking Arikara. Henry leads the escaping party,\nknowing that they are still being pursued by the Pawnee. The party is\nfurther slowed down when Hugh Glass , one of the experienced hunters,\nstumbles on a mother grizzly bear and her cubs while he is separated\nfrom the rest of the party.\n"
"\nReally now, beside the landscape and the performance of Tom Hardy,\neverything else was boring. I do not understand why and how this movie\nwas selected for so many Oscar nominations.<br><br>The story is more than predictable, Caprio acting is limited as his\ncharacter has its limitation (I do not want to write spoilers), the\nrest of the team, beside Tom Hardy which in my opinion was great, are\nbelow average.<br><br>I consider this movie the best candidate for Rotten Tomatoes, not at\nall for the Oscar statue. Even if Caprio made some sacrifices in order\nto perform (temperatures, eating, etc.), I do not consider that the\nOscar nominations should be awarded for such reasons.<br><br>This movie was equal to boring time for me.\n"
"\ntotal man vs wild show. not a good movie. total 2 hour 30 min. you can\nskip 2 hour easily and sleep in this time. only interesting thing\nDiCaprio tried his best to survive these tough(impossible) situations\nfor an Oscar.<br><br>make up and acting was good. but this move lack depth. it tried to show\na past event but added lot of impossible and imaginary things. these\nfactors destroyed the simplicity of this movie. again, it's not worth\nwatching. better watch another movie in this time period.<br><br>this will be a great episode of \"remote survival\" in national\ngeographic channel.\n"
"\nI think this movie is really overrated.<br><br>The photography is great and the acting is good (i liked the Tom Hardy\nperformance, and I liked the Di Caprio one too, although I think he did\nbetter performances in other movies).<br><br>The plot is really inconsistent and not coherent at all, I do not want\nto spoiler it but the first part of the movie is well built and\nbelievable, the second part feels fake, the behaviour of the captain\nhas no sense and the final sequence remember more a super heroes movie\nthan a \"true story\" one...<br><br>I don't wonder at all that the second part of the movie (and of the\nbook), the revenge one, totally divert from the real fact that inspired\nthe book.\n"
"\nThis movie sounded familiar. So did a little research and surprise!\nIt's a knock-off from a movie from 1971. It's not an original story and\nthe original was much better. Check it out yourself.<br><br>http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0067388/ MAN IN THE WILDERNESS 1971.<br><br>Quoted from the movie: <br><br>\"In the early 1800's, a group of fur trappers and Indian traders are\nreturning with their goods to civilization and are making a desperate\nattempt to beat the oncoming winter. When guide Zachary Bass is injured\nin a bear attack, they decide he's a goner and leave him behind to die.\nWhen he recovers instead, he swears revenge on them and tracks them and\ntheir paranoiac expedition leader down. - Written by Alfred Jingle\"\n"
"\nOkay, this is a really good action film, but it's too gory and\npredictable. Fitzgerald is an irredeemable bad guy. The entire scenario\nwas too good to be true. Leonardo DiCaprio was terrific in acting the\npart but his character had not 9 but 10 lives in this movie. How is it\npossible for a person near death to survive so many ordeals? The one\nwith jumping off a cliff and surviving the fall when still very much\nnot in great shape is remarkable and unbelievable to me. Of course, I\nknew the fate of the captain at the end before viewing the last scenes\nand DiCaprio's trick to get Fitzgerald at the end was used in a\nprevious movie. This flick reminded me of the one with Robert Redford\nin Jeremiah Johnson. Tom Hardy played Fitzgerald very well, but it was\ndifficult at times for me to understand what he was saying.\n"
"\nI cannot believe this move got awards. It is from 18th century and in\nthe middle of NOWHERE - in the snow mountains with horses.<br><br>There is no chemistry or any attempt to do character-building, bonding\nbetween father and son and the whole story makes NO sense. Except for\nthe bear attack (with poor graphics), there is nothing really worth\nmentioning in this movie.<br><br>If you want to watch it, be prepared for raw some content - eating raw\nmeat, animals, fish and swimming in snow water and WET throughout. Also\none person biting off another's ear and spitting out it.<br><br>I watched this by mistake. I wasn't paying attention and thought it was\nAllegiant that is not released yet. So I ended up wasting 2.6 hours of\nmy life that I can never get back.\n"
"\nFirst of all, if Di Caprio would get the Oscar with this movie, that\nwould be a real shock to me.<br><br>The movie starts quite energetic and attracts the audience,\nnevertheless when the story starts, it is too slow, quite boring and\nnon realistic. when I watched the movie, I have remembered the road\nrunner that never dies. You must watch the movie without conscious to\nenjoy. Many scenes and actions are out of nature.<br><br>Also it is too long, well one can suppose to see good panoramic scenes\nnevertheless they are not included. I really spent my 3 hours for\nalmost nothing.<br><br>Simply it was a sample of bad story telling and scene directing for me.\n"
"\nLoosely based on the life of 19th century frontiersman Hugh Glass, The\nRevenant is a brutal yet visually stunning western with one of Leonardo\nDiCaprio's best performances yet. The film follows Glass after he is\nmauled by a bear and left for dead by his fellow fur traders. One of\nthe frontiersmen, John Fitzgerald, kills his son, and Glass voyages\nover 200 miles to exact revenge on him. The Revenant is one of the most\nviolent movies I've seen from 2015, although the incredible scenery and\ncinematography also make it one of the most astonishing movies to look\nat. It combines some intense, difficult-to-watch scenes with amazing\nscenery which makes it one of the most beautiful violent films I've\nseen. Leo's committed and demanding performance is certainly one of the\nbest of his career especially because of the lack of the dialog in the\nfilm. The 156- minute running time, relentless brutality and limited\ndialog does take a bit of a commitment to finish, but The Revenant is a\nmasterfully directed film that makes the most of its subject matter's\nintriguing story.\n"
"\nThe short summary of the movie above basically is the movie. \"A\nfrontiersman on a fur trading expedition in the 1820s fights for\nsurvival after being mauled by a bear and left for dead by members of\nhis own hunting team.\" And then he comes back and gets his revenge. And\nthey drag this on for 2 and a half hours. No wonder there are so many\nshots of they sky. Best actor? For what? Eating raw liver? Is that all\nit takes to get best actor thesedays? No interesting dialogue or\nconfrontation. This is just a bad movie. Bad directing. Acting wasn't\nbad but certainly wasn't Oscar worthy... or maybe it is worth it since\nOscar is worth garbage thesedays.\n"
"\nYeah, a Hollywood actor can survive the mauling by a huge bear. Can\nsurvive being buried half-dead in freezing temperatures. Can survive\nalone and half dead and wounded in freezing temperatures without food\nand weapons, swimming in freezing cold water, surviving in wet clothes\nin freezing temperatures . Miraculously this Hollywood actor can\nsuddenly run when necessary while he limped just a second ago. Though\nfinally arriving at a safe spot still half dead , he is immediately\nable to go out again and fight his enemy. Half of the movie I closed my\neyes because I had no desire to watch the gore fest, the beautiful\nscenery with stolen Ansel Adams images did not make up for the rest. I\nshould have followed my initial instinct. After watching a preview I\nthought that this was not a movie for me and I was right. Never again\nwill I fall for the hype. Unbelievable.. Disgusting blood orgy.\n"
"\nDon't get me wrong because I've given this movie such low rating. I've\nalways loved DiCaprio's performance. Prior to release, when I read the\nsynopsis and bit googling about Hugh Glass, I started eagerly waiting\nfor the movie. However after watching all I could think was, even if\nthis movie wasn't ever made, nobody would've cared. The problem is not\nwith the acting or direction, cinematography etc. I just don't think it\nwas needed to be made as there's nothing great about it. Now I know\nthere are plenty of movies out there, which we don't care about. But\nwhen Leonardo DiCaprio is starring in a movie, it's like you must watch\nit and enjoy. All this movie's about is survival (which isn't\nhighlighted as I'd hoped for) and revenge. The problem is that these 2\nthings are sort of ignored by the director. We see lots of Red Indians,\nFrench bla bla!! Its hard to explain, perhaps someone with a better\ncommand of language can explain better after watching.\n"
"\nThis movie was so awesome that it actually convinced me of writing my\nfirst review. Let's start with the good: very nice winter scenery with\ntop notch acting from Leonard DiCaprio. There's also lots of action\nscenes, but did not find myself caring too much about the outcome. The\nbad: very slow paced story about Chuck Norris crawling in the snow in\nthe 1800's. First 2 hours are about Glass surviving a bear maul attack,\nbeing left for dead in a frozen forest with no water or food, survives\nbeing dragged in a freezing river for miles, survives falling on a\nhorse of a cliff, etc. Come on, really? Then the revenge part takes\nabout 20 minutes: the bad guy flees an army fort with all the money,\nand only 2 people go after him. Really? I was so bored I actually\nnoticed the sound track being really weird: it sounded like a broken\ndripping faucet and it left me wondering if that's really a sound that\ncan be heard in a frozen forest during winter. Anyway, to sum it up,\nI'm really disappointed for wasting 2.5 hours to see this.\n"
"\n\"Contains spoiler\" It was expected from this movie, in my opinion, that\ndoesn't contain a revenge story and rather contain one based on coping\nwith nature and more survival. Furthermore, The dream scenes of the\nmain character were awful and they did not create a good relation with\nthe atmosphere of the movie. If it wasn't for these defects, I would\ngive this movie a 10. Though, the tow main actors did play their role\nskillfully and dialogues were brilliant, the movie could include more\ncaptures of the spectacular landscapes and thoughtfully conversations.\n"
"\nI tried, really tried to get into this show. But it just didn't work\nfor me. I'm not a movie student or buff by any means. Yeah, the special\neffects were excellent &amp; the mood was appropriately (?) somber, dark\nand bleak.<br><br>But a great deal of the dialog was unintelligible, esp from Hardy &amp;\nDiCaprio...and the show was mainly about them! Also, some the editing\nwas wacky enough to spoil the timing and mood of the scenes. The young\nactor near the end who played the officer really didn't fit in. The\nelectronic music soundtrack was OK for awhile, but some of it was\noverused.<br><br>All in all, a weak production.\n"
"\nI mean, I wasn't upset that I watched this movie, but I didn't see\nanything special, other than a bear.<br><br>Tom Hardy was once again hard to understand, and seems to be trying to\nbecome the most famous actor for mumbles and grunts.<br><br>They took a legend, filled in the gaps, added some Hollywood flair and\na lot of gore... what exactly is rated 8 out of 10 about it? I don't\nsee how this movie is so appealing to the masses. There is little\nacting, other than the portrayal of pain. There is so little to the\nlegend that Hollywood had to add in a twist to make the story less\nboring, and add in a second series of emotions for Leonardo Dicaprio to\ndisplay.<br><br>Nevertheless, The Revenant, was decent, but by no means great.\n"
"\nLet's face it: everything Leo did in this movie I could have done. Eat\nraw meat, raw fish? No prob. Crawl inside a (fake) dead horse? Brave\nbad weather? What did he do that the average actor couldn't do? I\nliterally laughed out loud when he swung his wobbly arm trying to chop\na branch with a tomahawk. You see the muscles confused when called upon\nto do this manual labor. Toss him upon a pile of supermodels and he's a\nnatural, but grab a shovel? Which end? Compare Leo with Spencer Tracy\nor Steve McQueen, two actors from real life. They worked, served in the\nmilitary, etc. When they do things, I believe they are doing things.\nLeo's Oscar lowers the standard of acting excellence to whoever can\nbear extreme conditions when they're otherwise used to yachts, caviar,\nand Wolf of Wall St. living. Inarritu worked around this for the sake\nof the DiCaprio brand, but imagine Keaton spitting and screeching his\nway through Birdman. Are you saying he would have won? Let me put it to\nyou this way, and then I'll thank you for your time: Leo Dicaprio\ncannot act.\n"
"\nLeonardo DiCaprio and Tom Hardy star in this 2015 drama based on the\nnovel and inspired by true events. This takes place in the 1800's and\nDiCaprio (Titanic) plays Hugh Glass, a frontiersman who leads a hunting\nexpedition. Soon, Glass is injured by a bear and left for dead by one\nof his men, John Fitzgerald (Hardy) who not only betrays him, but\nmurders his son. Glass struggles to survive the wilderness while\nregaining his strength and health to find Fitzgerald. This is a great\nfilm with suspenseful and heartfelt moments, DiCaprio definitely gives\nan Oscar-worthy performance and there's beautiful, remote settings. The\nfilm also shares similarities with \"The Grey,\" \"Deliverance\" and \"Cast\nAway.\" I recommend this.\n"
"\nDon't even half to watch the full movie to know how terrible it is.\nLooking at the trailer it seems almost unrecognizable from the book\n(which i happened to read in two days). The main idea of the story was\nhim being a ruthless fighter but it changed the whole prospective and\nadded in characters of all sorts that weren't needed. First of all he\ndoes not even have a son and his girlfriend (not wife) died while at\nsea who was not at all aboriginal. This was supposed to be based on a\nreal mans story and they totally disregarded that and changed his\nhistory. They most likely used this to add a love interest or some sort\nof positive ethnicity image (since a lot of the natives were portrayed\nas bad) it was unnecessary and just sad. It took away the whole idea of\nproving himself to the people that left him to die. Not surviving only\nto get revenge for his son and wife. It erased the whole meaning and i\nsuggest giving a book a try. Its a whole lot better then this s**t.\n"
"\nThe Revenant<br><br>When attacked by a bear remember to always roll into a ball so it\ndoesn't have to chew you as much.<br><br>The victim in this drama, unfortunately, chose to starfish.<br><br>Hunting up north, a group of trappers (Tom Hardy, Domhnall Gleeson,\nWill Poulter) are engaged by natives and forced into the wilderness\nwhere a Grizzly mauls their guide, Hugh Glass (Leonardo DiCaprio).<br><br>Left for dead, Glass endures his injuries and pursues those who\nbetrayed him. Along the way, he frees a native girl from her\nFrench-Canadian captors.<br><br>One of the most gripping tales of wilderness survival, this fact-based\naccount of frontier justice is beautifully shot and brutally told by\ndirector Alejandro G. Iñárritu.<br><br>But its DiCaprio's performance, supplemented by Hardy's, which really\nbrings the humanity to this indescribable tale.<br><br>However, due to this incident European socialites had to wait an extra\nmonth to get their beaver felt top hats. <br><br>Green Light<br><br>vidiotreviews.blogspot.ca\n"
"\nI normally like these type of movies ,love survivorman , yet this was\nan awful movie IMO and way too unrealistic. The fact that Leonardo got\nnominated for this and Will Smith didn't shows what those old white\nguys like.They remind me of the NFL back room old white guys just\nwanting to keep rolling in the money whatever the cost.Last year Selma\nwas ignored and specifically David Oyelowo.<br><br>The phoney part of the Revenant ,besides the bear , to me was when he\nwas in the freezing water with huge heavy coats on, didn't sink and\ndidn't freeze and after getting out had no dry clothes or a fire. And\nhow many grunts and groans were in this script for him.\n"
"\nwow just wasted 2.5 hours on watching this... was inclined to stop 20\nminutes in, but sucked it up. this movie tries too hard to be too many\ndifferent genres slyly and to use all the techniques film has to the\ndirector's disposal. but no. this won best Oscar? its a plain-as-day\nexample of Hollywood Illuminati control fodder. Leo is a bad actor wow.\nto be honest, would of liked to of seen a young Shatner because he is\nan actor. and this isn't a nature documentary; this isn't a horror\nfilm, don't use cameras and audio like it is and you are a desperate\nfreshman film student showing his 'chops'. and whoever wrote this or\ndirected this.... its BAD. in not so many words, historical and natural\ninaccuracies throughout, cliché and failed homages, and it takes a lot\nmore skill to 'break the fourth wall' (as is popular now) than was put\ninto this piece of bullshit - 3/10\n"
"\nThe beginning is OK, but the rest is crap. A man is mutilated by a\ngrizzly bear and evil men let him lye 'dying' and almost buried. But he\nsoon very fast recovers unexpectually and can do everything in the\nwilderness. i expected to see an interesting and exiting movie but it\nturned out to be exceptional bad and boring - one of the worst movies I\nhave ever experienced. How in the world can this ridiculous unwillingly\nfunny movie get so good reviews ..? Sudently he stands up and walks and\ntalks and crawles along this lengthy movie. I can see a purpose in this\nfilm but, my god it is weitten in capital letters\". I did not feel\nanything about him, just laughing at this rediculess and unsatisfiing\nmovie. What a turn off.\n"
"\nContains spoiler.....In short, the movie was great on scenery, acting\nand cinematography, but short on realism.<br><br>I was a wilderness medicine instructor in the West for 10 years, thus\nis was incredulous that the characters, including Leo suffered no cold\ninjury. In those wet conditions, Trench Foot, Freeze injury to hands\nand feet as well as hypothermia from brief immersion in the rivers\nwould have taken most out.<br><br>More over the nature of the bear wounds would have led to sepsis and\ndeath in short order.<br><br>The story was pure fantasy but beautiful and dramatic.<br><br>dr. rick\n"
"\nI really like Leo and he does give a fine performance in this average\nmovie but the ever annoying Tom (I can do Ameeericannn accents) Hardy\nreally racks me off. So if you want a treat the check out ... Man in\nthe Wilderness (1971) .....In the early 1800's, a group of fur trappers\nand Indian traders are returning with their goods to civilization and\nare making a desperate attempt to beat the oncoming winter. When guide\nZachary Bass is injured in a bear attack, they decide he's a goner and\nleave him behind to die. When he recovers instead, he swears revenge on\nthem and tracks them and their paranoiac expedition leader down. This\nstory line SOUNDS FAMILIAR. Richard Harris and John Huston brilliant\n...\n"
"\nSorry for the ones who loved the film, but here is somebody who did not\nlike it at all. In the end it's just a typical you hit me bad but I\nwill get you in the end wrapped up in beautiful cold landscapes and\nsome historical background. I like Leonardo a lot as an actor but that\ndoes not mean that all his films are good. In this one when if you daze\naway for a moment (not difficult with those long scenes..) you wake up\nand you could think you are watching First Blood... I expected\nsomething much more epic, not a simple revenge story.. by the way was\nit really necessary to kill that bear?? Was she not just protecting her\nbaby bears? Is it really so necessary to show us so much violence,\ndon't we see already enough on the news?.... I am not sure if we really\nneed those kind of film directors...\n"
"\nThis is a story of a trapper in the 1800's who is double crossed, left\nfor dead and has to find his way out of the rugged wilderness.<br><br>The film opens with a great action scene. All the action in the film is\ntop notch, edge of the seat.<br><br>The scenery is stunningly beautiful and the characters are quickly\nfleshed out.<br><br>I didn't really feel the harshness of the environment, people wander\nout of freezing streams with hardly a shiver and force march for miles\nlike they are strolling around the park.<br><br>Leonardo gives a great performance and I did really care about the\ncharacter and I was rooting for him. However, he take a massive amount\nof physical punishment. This goes on to such an extent that I became\ndesensitised to the character's pain by about half way through and\nreally stopped caring when he was winged for the the umpteenth time.<br><br>A good adventure film, a bit low on action for such a long film. Not\nreally my cup of tea.\n"
"\n\"The Revenant\" opens with two absolutely jaw dropping scenes, the\nsecond arguably topping the first. They alone are worth the price of\nadmission.<br><br>The first is an extraordinary battle scene that feels like it was\nfilmed in one take. The camera puts you there, on the spot, in the\nmidst of the carnage. It makes you feel as though what it is allowing\nyou to see is really going on all around you, not around it.<br><br>The second scene is impossible to speak of without using hyperbole. It\nis unlike anything I have seen before. Yes, I am talking about the bear\nattack scene, easily the greatest film moment of 2015, and one of the\ngreatest scenes of any film made in the new millennium so far. This\nwill surely top the list of \"how the HELL did they do THAT?\" moments in\nmovie history.<br><br>The rest of the movie is solid, but not quite up to that standard, but\nthat standard is so high, this shouldn't be taken as a negative.<br><br>The performances by DiCaprio, Hardy and Gleason and also top notch, and\nensure that the movie is never just about its set-pieces.\n"
"\nI have seen movies with Di Caprio far better than that...good acting by\nLeo but a boring boring movie...anyway Leo has become a much better\nactor than what he was in his beginning, there is no doubt about\nthat...nice plots (i like nature) and violence scenes...OK...not for an\nOscar definitely...but as always...not always the best getting the\nOscar...they owe Leo an Oscar...and they should have given it\nearlier...that is why this movie gave him an Oscar...just for\nthat...same story with Julia Roberts...i really got disappointed...an\naverage of 8 for a boring movie like that is strange...Heightful 8 is\nmuch better with a better plot...\n"
