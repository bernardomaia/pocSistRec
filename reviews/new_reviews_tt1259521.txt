this is the absolute worst movie that i have ever seen in my life
the acting and the plot were absolutely awful
the people who gave it an 8
1 rating out of 10 are completely insane
dont waste your time and money on this outrageously stupid and awful movie
the movie is basically about a bunch of stupid teenagers who decide to go on a camping trip to a friends cousins camp when randomly a bunch of zombies begin to attack everyone
the only thing that is truly keeping my attention while watching this movie was the fact that chris hemsworth was in it
this movie is the most pointless thing i have ever seen in my entire life
snakes on a plane was a much better movie than this
seriously dont waste your time or your money
the official trailer for this movie should actually be considered a teaser trailer since it only contains 14th of what the movie is really about
the story was really bad although it was original i must say
this movie shouldnt be considered a horror movie but actually a comedy
if you are looking for a good laugh this movie is the one to watch but if you got the impression this movie in fact was going to be a horror movie as many of us thoughtexpect a huge disappointment therefore  do not go and pay for this film it is not worth your money
perhaps if this movie was displayed as the typical scary movie series then this movie would with no doubt receive ten stars
save your self ten bucks or watch another movie
overall this film is not anything to jump about at
the story line seems unique and almost engaging when you hear about it but when you watch it it becomes a different matter
joss whedon has tried to mix comedy and horror in a way that just does not work although there are some comedic moments the film is still not quite a 10 out of 10
however the start was intriguing as you thought of the predictable story there was a twist
although this twist was something different putting it at the start of the film spoilt the sense of anticipation of what was going to happen because it was all fairly predictable
as the film went on the outcome became more and more predictable until the end when there was a twist which was so unrealistic that it made the film look stupid
in summarythe film was not anything special and in fact i wanted it to end as quick as possible the acting it self wasnt that bad but the story line prevented it from being anything special
i am writing this review to help those who fall into the trap of seeing a rating of 7
9 and thinking this film must have some redeeming qualities
believe me it doesnt
it is ridiculous and abysmal
the scary thing is the sort of individual that enjoys this film is the same individual that states scream is original
some may find this deeply disturbing but i would be quite happy to live in a world without films such as scream there i said it
there was only one scene that i found funny and it was when mr athlete decided to ride his bike into a force field of some sort
i began thinking something worth while was going to happen but this moment never came
since this movie was shot in 2009 but not released until 2012 i can only imagine that the only it was released at all was to capitalize on the success of thor starring chris hemsworth and the impending release of the avengers
it cant be a coincidence that both movies were directed by mr
whedon
cabin in the woods is a hodgepodge of clichad imperiled teens stuck in a remote location getting knocked off one by one and seemingly science fiction elements
the movie tries and fails to duplicate the successful combination of snark and fright that scream pulled off so well but the script is so poor that near the end when a slumming sigourney weaver makes an appearance she utters a line so ridiculous that its amazing she could say it with a straight face
as bad as most of the movie is the ending is worse than anything came before
amazingly this movie has been receiving fairly decent reviews
ive never seen a movie like this before
it is awful not worth a minute to watch if there is a point like zero or 10000000 i can give that as a vote
just bloodstupid story no acting no directing at all i gave 7usd for this movie but i dont go if it is for free at all i dont understand how it makes this point  imdb is not worth to relay on any more i went with two friends of mine and we told each other not to tell anyone that weve come to see this movie
it is a secret
i have never go out from cinema before movies end but for this movie i need to get some air
watching the second part was like a torture for all of us
there were 7 people in the saloon and all of us had same opinion
this movie is the worst movie ever
seriously
i never wrote a review for any movie in my life and if i take so much effort to register in imdb and post this review you can clearly understand how frustrated i am after watching this stupid movie
i believe these movie makers have found a way to tweak the system by posting bunch of positive reviews and make a really pathetic movie look like an amazing one
if you have lot of money to waste try to throw it in dust bin
i believe there is much greater good accomplished with your money that way than paying to watch this movie or watch it in any other way
more importantly you dont support an idiotic movie company to make even more pathetic movies like this
ive never been so disappointed by a horror movie
usually you know first hand what youre getting cheesy gory traumatizing
i thought that because of the reviews of the movie and of course friends telling me to see it that it would be decent
its beyond clicha
everything in it has been done
there are thoughtless plot twists
and the ending is pretty much resolved by deus ex machina
literally
the graphics are neat but not up to the standards of a true horror film
the suspense is contrived
i suppose if youre 12 and youve never seen a horror movie before you might enjoy it
but im 27 and i have no time for such useless movies
ok here it goes
i was bored one night and my friend suggested my this movie
he highly recommended watching it
he told me it was something different than a regular horrorthrillersuspense movie
it was a night i will never forget
it began ok but towards the end it became so pathetic that i was watching it just for the sake of telling people that i have watched this movie and how awful it is
it sure was different but it was not good different
if you havent watched this movie then do not i repeat do not watch it
why
because it sucks
unless you are one of those who enjoy watching things wayyy far from what makes sense do not watch it
the end was just stupid
i signed up for imdb just to say that this movie sucked
this girl named kymberly recommended this movie to me
i will never take a recommendation from her again
this movie was a heaping pile of cat doodoo
the plot twist was atrocious and the women casted had no bodies
seriously like a pair of skeletons on screen
the creepy girls looked better
i will say the blonde had nice tits though
i was gonna type blond but kymberly recommended i spell it blonde
to summarize dont watch this hack of a horror movie also dont listen to anyone who spells their name with a y instead of an i
the end
ok maybe the review isnt over since i need a minimum of 10 lines
so ill also tell you how to make papa johns garlic sauce
butter and garlic powder and put it in the microwave bam you got papa sauce
this film contains pretty much everyones fear and portrays them in a very dark comedic way
the plot is about 5 teens who go camping in a forest in a cabin
one by one this company used these elevators to deliver these monsters and beasts to this cabin to kill all of them
the film was very creative in how the monsters were portrayed and how real they looked and the scene with all the elevators was very original
however it was pretty much a typical horror film as it was predictable in the fact of when the people would die but it was original with the creativity of how the people died
overall i did not enjoy this film as i found it boring and i would not recommend this film to anyone
worst movie iv seen in a while
it dont know what it wants to be a horror or thriller or mystery
so it fails as all of those
its just a mashed up movie of mostly stinking manure
it starts out ok and then gradually just gets worse and worse until you wish you are the one being in the movie being killed
how it has a 7 in grade here in imdb has to be because of young people that dont know a good movie from their bowel movement yesterday
nothing is really explained it has lots of lose ends that never gets tied up and it is very bad
please avoid this movie for your own good
never thought joss whedon would write something so bad
if i could give it 0 stars i would
far too silly and exaggerated to be even vaguely scary
it became ridiculous by about 30 minutes in at the latest and lost my interest completely
if youre looking for a good plausible and truly frightening film look elsewhere
this is meant to be satirical horror  unfortunately all that it manages to be is a big joke and a bad one at that
i kept waiting for an explanation of what was meant to be scary and what the point of it all was but this never came
at the end one is left with more questions than answers and the most burning question is how to get ones 94 minutes back to watch something of better quality
im a huge fan of horror movies any movies really i watch whatever but this was just terrible
i gave it a 2 only because the beginning was alright but once the zombies were coming out of their graves from undergroundi kind of started to worry
but even that wouldve been better than what this movie turned out to be
at first i didnt really understand what was going on but once i knew i wish i hadnt found out evil gods
really
what a letdown
no idea how this got so many good reviews
i honestly think the devil inside was better than this and i was even bored to death through that
id rather watch that like 10 more times than watch this again
i am very sorry i really looked forward to see this movie today however whatever the director there had in mind is just shocking and doesnt even have to do the slightest with a good horror movie
the setting basically is like in many horror movies the one dies behind the other in the survival chain of the characters
there was no special ideas behind their deaths just pure slaughter in the darkness
any old school nightmare on elm streets movie was more inspiring
even the acting wasnt good at all
until now this movie would get a 4 from me what makes it even worse is the end
to have a total chaos with a variety of creatures below the house next to the end of the world scenario is just plain uninspiring
to have a ritual to stop the gods coming while having a whole army already killed during this doesnt make sense either
i am very sorry but it was the worst movie i have seen 2013
maybe even the actors cannot do much for this however really dont want to see more
how can it be rated with 71
not sure if cabin in the woods was supposed to be an horror movie or an comedysatire movie
yet it fails both ways
as an movie expert i must say that in this film the only derivation from horror its the word to describe it horrible
unless youre a 13 year boy with a lot of swag and yolo this picture wont mean anything to you
in spite of having an original different plot from the other horror movies it just goes bananas
and im just assuming that this was not supposed to be a comedy because if it was the word horrible isnt enough
the zombies the unicorns clowns wolves
its more cheesy than the cheesecake factory
the good thing about this movie is the runtime
if you dont want to see a movie that will take you 2 hours in front of the screen and make you think or discuss ideas after it this is the movie for you
pure lame cheesy hollywood entertainment right in your face
how many reviews have we seen where the reviewer says
are we talking about the same movie
well thats what im thinking
first thing my daughter said after the movie was how could anyone pay for this movie to be made
thats a good question
its amusing that i couldnt add a spoiler if i wanted because theres nothing to spoil
shame that people go by the numerical rating
what an upside down world this is when a piece of junk like this actually gets a rating similar to movies like titanic the departed or lord of the rings
the only reason i gave this above a 1 is the scene in which they realize where they really are
and did we really need that thing she did with the wolf
well im going to a good movie tomorrow night to get this bad taste out of my mouth
this review is going to be short
this was one of the worst movies i have watched
the transitions from thriller to cheap comedy were so annoying
you start with bloody killings and suddenly you are watching jokes that are not funny and you are lead to scenes that you dont even watch in home made movies
and then the ending was what gave the final strike though
i understand that this was not going for the same old thriller in the woods but where on earth did that come from
just no
save your time and money for another one
i just dont understand why there is this high score in imdb lots of people are saying that its the best movies they have seen
well sorry but what i watched was a really bad movie that made me think more than 5 times that i wasted my time
this review has so many spoilers ill get blacklisted no matter how many times i state that
with that being said this film was awful
it was one of 2 movies ive walked out on and got my money back from
spoiler alert
this film is not a horror film
its a comedy masked as a horror film
spoiler alert again
the whole plot revolves around men in black characters watching and manipulating teens from some computer base far far away from it all
last spoiler alert
none of the goofy mib scenes are in any trailer ive seen for this film making that almost false advertising
stay away
it is a parody on horror films that is so bad youll wonder if you walked into the wrong theater
i mean
seriously
is this supposed to be a movie
it is definitely the worst thing i have seen so far
a completely waste of time and money
during it i fell asleep twice and i almost thought i was dying
the so called jokes really killed me  they were as terrible as the acting and i just didnt get the whole point of this crap
while i was desperately searching for the exit of the theater it finally came to an end and that was the moment i realized how stupid i had became after watching this ridiculous film
to sum up i would like to warn youdo not see this thing
ever
p
scould someone please explain to me why does it have such a high rating
because i really dont understand
110 as negative rating doesnt appear to the options
read a review in the daily telegraph saying that this film is up there in the same category as the sixth sense usual suspects and memento which are all favorites of mine
that made me go see it at the cinema and what a disappointment
its a good film but totally different genre and is more like scream meets friday the 13th
must admit that it started with promise but as soon as the zombies appeared i realized it was going to go downhill from there and it sure did
there is some clever ideas and it is not something that should be written here as it gives away the premise of the film but the whole thing was unbelievable and in places unbelievably bad
the acting is acceptable but not great and the story ends up being quite ridiculous
all in all something worth watching on cable but not worthy of the cinema ticket price
can i give a negative rate
please
i honestly dont know what the hell is going on with these people giving 9 and 10 rates to this movie because it is absolutely awful
the storyline is ridiculous and the characters are so clicha
fortunately i didnt pay to see this movie otherwise id be even more chocked
and i honestly dont understand how this thing is rated almost with 8
how is that possible
if the viewers continue rating this as a good movie we will see it in the top 250 of imdb
do you think it is that good
the film couldve been better if the writerdirector explored more the concept of the human sacrifice and the sources of that religion
but they didnt
i really have no idea why people like this kind of bad cinema
imdb is losing its credibility clearly
cabin in the woods was probably the worst movie i have ever seen
i found it very difficult to stay awake
after waking up for the third time i realized the movie wasnt going to get any better
each time i woke up i was watching a completely different movie
i wasnt impressed with the typical zombie horror film to begin with
ive seen movies like this millions of times with the same outcome
everyone dies
i started to wonder how this movies was jammed together when i saw the college kids drive through a bridge that somehow put them in another realm with a forcefield
that combined with a lot of random monstersweed as an inluential part of the moviea swat teamand some form of earth god who destroys the world because some girl doesnt die makes the perfect senseless movie
after watching i felt that someone had put aliens the even stephens movie and saw in a blender
worst movie ever
two stars because i did finish it regrettably
i understood the point loud and clear but to regard this film as some kind of intricate genrestraddling masterpiece of cinematic renaissance is insulting on so many levels
the cabin in the woods is pure convoluted junk
its as if they couldnt come up with one good solid plot with which to drive the movie
so they utilize a caterwaul of plots which are halfbaked and mostly stolen
worse yet the subplots that they actually came up with on their own reach a level of cheesiness that surpasses all but the guiltiest of cheesy 80s horror
aside from the story the script is fundamentally generic and blatantly melodramatic
the special effects look great but everything else about this film is a godawful mess
when i first saw the previews for this i thought that good horror movies were finally being made again
but i stand corrected
this movie was horrible
i went to see this for my birthday and was not impressed
the story plot sounds good while reading it but when you see it the movie plain out sucks
it was a waste of money and time
everything was very cheesy from the cabin just mysteriously having a underground laboratory to the cheesy zombies
this movie would have been a lot better if it werent for the laboratory doctors making it seem so ridiculous as a sacrafice for the demons
there was only one good part of the whole movie and that was when they were in the elevator looking at the 4 different monsters
all the rest of the nightmare creatures were baloney
from a manmermaid to a unicorn
and when you think it cant get any worse it does
there was way more blood in the scene while they were waiting in the lab while the creatures attacked than there was in the whole movie
in other words dont waste your time
too much is not enough for this twisted tale of disgusting horror and despair
are our minds so warped that we find this nonsense entertaining
they should pay you to watch this one
lets see ah yes they had to save the directors role for surprise sigourney weaver
and its too bad bradley whitford cant find decent roles for his acting talent
what really gets my goat is that movie critics who are supposed to be discriminating gave this movie high marks
you suckered me in
i hope i dont have nightmares over this but of course im too sophisticated for that arent i
or perhaps were all too damned naive
it was terrible
gory bloody and gross
it was very clicha and you could expect when the scary parts were going to happen
it was very predictable
there was nothing good about the movie
i hated it
it wasnt even scary it was just downright disgusting
i thought it was terrible and i couldnt wait for it to be over
it was cheesy and looked fake
its an hour and a half of my life i will never get back
it all looked extremely fake and awful that a lot of the time we were just laughing
if you like rooms literally filled with fake blood then this is the movie for you
i personally thought it was gross cheesy and bad
dont waste your money
its was entertaining but after i watched i was really surprised to find such a high rating on imdb
where the hell did sigourney weaver come from
you cant just drop in characters like that
i learned that in 6th grade english
it bad story telling
and what was with the clown white mask people and unicorn
that was kind of lame
there really isnt much more to say
it was different entertaining but not mind blowing or revolutionary
it just makes me wonder where all these high rating come from
they could be fake
it could just be one of those films that you either love or hate
personally i think that movies like the evil dead series were much better
seeing the trailer you would think this would be an awesome horror flick
but think again
i went into the theater excited for the movie
even in the first 5 minutes its stupid and not exactly about the teens going to the cabin
its not exactly what you expect it to be its totally different
i admit the movie does have funny parts but it is not scary nor gory
i was sitting in my seat praying for the movie to end
i almost walked out but i figured after paying for it i might as well of stayed there to see the ending
i thought it couldnt get worse but then it did
i was very disappointed in this film
seriouslyone of the worst movies i have seen please do not waste your money
i believe all these glowing reviews must be fan boys of joss whedons who were in a movie theater where they pumped in some drugs to convince them all that it was a great movie
game changer
horror at its finest
surprise guest appearance at the end
bfd
so randomly stupid no wonder it was made four years ago and never released
i love a good intelligent scary movie but this was none of the three perhaps two jumps in the entire showing the rest was tongue in cheek humor that made absolutely no sense if the end game was to appease the elder gods who need sacrifice
senseless and vapid
i wish i would have stayed home and watched the nhl playoffs
and i hate hockey
a watched this film yesterday
first i saw this film in imdb
point is 7
i thought film is good but now i dont understand why people loved this film
absolutely awful
film is so unnecessary scenario is disgrace
in the begening of this film i said  ouww this film looks good  but in the end of this film i sweared 100 times
totally wasting time
af you want to watch horror film absolutely you dont think this film
editing is so simple
every kind of monsters are shown for frighten but this thing is not scary just ridiculous
i am still not understand why people high rated for this film
it is so funny
an my opinion 3 point enough for this film hmmmm maybe 3 is much
so im a huge horror buff
from the classics to the deep dirty world of foreign snuff i always enjoy a great fear inducing film as much as the next obscenely curious horror fiend
however this movie sucked
my less horror enthused associates werent even upset at the fact that i could narrate this movie without ever having seen it before anything could occur
it wasnt funny or satirical
it literally shows as a horror attempt gone horribly wrong
the ending is simply ridiculous and not in a funny way just in a wtf were they thinking kinda way
if the writersdirectors wanted to be snarky they should have done a better job
they definitely did not get that point across
the movie doesnt really portray itself as a darkbleak comedy
if they were serious with this attempt then they still failed
overall this is a shitty movie
especially for its time
go watch sinister instead
i do not get the idea why people would make a movie so worthless
its story is senseless and extremely lame to say the least
its primary purpose is to show gore gore that is done by nonhumans monsters if you will
like your usual mediocre gory horror movies the cast is all enticing with youthful goodlooking actors and actresses
in this movie though the acting was fair enough
the movie writers wanted to make a movie that combines technology with oldfashioned backwoods zombies
they thought it was a brilliant idea
all it did was an utter waste of resources
maybe thats what they wanted after all since the movie was all about that futility
first off i have no clue why this movie is so highly regarded
i mean im still wondering how that got so out of hand so quickly
ill admit this movie started off pretty good had my attention had an unique storyplot going on then out of no where i completely lost interest
it had nothing to do with the actors as i thought they all played their roles to the best of their abilities other than one very annoying voice
another thing this movie had going ok was the special effectsgraphics
the problem is how the movie ended
that seems to be very common now days especially in the horror genre
directorswriters get going and going and totally wind up off the deep end
i give this movie 4 out of 10rent it
well after such an extended and unnecessary build up i finally saw this film
it has come and gone without a whimper and ive watched many far superior films since
so where to start
remember the twist in the crying game
and thinking hang on wheres the twist
i knew that girls a guy
or hearing how you should not read or watch anything to do with this film
theres good reason for that
this film started in a predictable manner struck something partly interesting along the way by accident
and finished as a film that has lost plot normally does
remember lost
so similar
so no huge story usual antics and only 1 creative scene
the rest is filler loose ideas and dead ends
really quite a terrible mess of a film given 510 only for people who have lived in a cave and found a video tv and a chair
see it only to say ive seen it
just awful
neither funny nor scary
terrible effects poor acting and overall just a terrible and boring film
i use imdb a lot for films but for horror films its really been letting me down recently
i dontunderstand what people see in this film
if you watch it you will be wasting 90 mins of your life
ive had more fun sitting on a plane next to an obese person on a 10hr flight than this
this movie is less interesting than watching paint dry and a lot less original
ive seen some terrible and dull and unoriginal films in my time but this just caps the lot
how it got good scores on the movie review sites is beyond me
makes the scary movie franchise amazing
avoid
i bought this dvd not to be scared but for gore
i was very disappointed
the dvd case had 3 different reviews each giving 5 stars so i got my hopes up
although there was a lot of blood it didnt feel like there was a lot of gore
unfortunately it was basically a cross between the hunger games final destiantion and friday 13th
dont get me wrong theyre all great films but the combination isnt
it all seemed a bit too cheesy for my liking and whilst the storyline had the potential to be great it wasnt told in the best way
in my opinion the best thing about it was chris hemsworth
to be upfront the only thing i did not like about this movie is the last 5 minutes
its got good suspense action thrills etc
if the movie would have just been the people taking bets about who survives thated been cool
but instead they had to throw in the ancient god stuff and that just ruined it for me
i do like how what monster they face is decided by what they pick up first in the basement
some pros are good storyline until the end quite suspenseful the high guy really is funny pretty girls
the cons the only one to me is the ending
i have not bought this movie since its release nor do i plan to
i would watch it again but only if it came on tv basically if it didnt cost me anything
the movie had a lot of potential but they just didnt deliver the ending i was hoping for
i guess in the end its all up to personal preference
what a waste of time
i suggest people whore planning to watch this movie please dont go by the rating it has got
this is such a trash movie you will always repent for
i found this movie very boring and amateurish
maybe small kids will get frightened seeing this but i bet a grown up will find this movie very laughable
wonder how come people like joss whedon ended up producing this trash
you will get to see a lot of zombies and creatures and high amount of gore
but the question is what for
there is no strong story
completely illogic plot
unnecessary special effects
overall a complete let down
watch it at your own risk
the movie is really gonna test your patience
big time
no offense meant but this is probably the worst movie i ve ever seen in my life
may be because i had expectations about this movie after going through the imdb reviews
but omg this movie turned out to be the most overrated movie on imdb
sorry guys
it has a craziest storyline you can think off from the way the movie starts and moves you would get an impression this will turn out to be just another friday 13th kinda movie but then the absurdity starts and you will be like can somebody even think like that
theres lot of blood n killings less thrilling
no comedy no fun
huh
well all in all i dint like this movie not even a bit
quite frankly after the lengthy slow beginning and awkward mid section it got to the point where after the elevator scenemy girlfriend and i had a small discussion and agreed
we walked out
we couldnt take it any longer
i posted that reference on my bbm and i had 2 friends write back and say didnt you read my status update on saturday
an absolute nightmare of a movie
yes thats right that night i had nightmares of me throwing away 20 bills
how it went from 7
9 to 8
2 in one night is beyond me
i gave it a 3 only because it had comedy tossed in
yuk
maybe im missing the point but honestly i never walk into a movie with any expectations
that way im never disappointed but this one did my head in
its excruciating to watch
and im not talking like a cheap b movie excruciating im talking about we tried so hard but failed to hit the nail on the head excruciating
with all due respect to those who enjoyed the film i give you all the credit in the world for sitting through that painful flick
should have had a splif before we went in
this is the truth and only but the truth imdb and hollywood last 5 years are pure garbage trust me this is the only truth absolute garbage
they even paying personnel to write fake reviews for absolute garbage movies i dont understand why this is happening but its time to start watch my friends bollywood movies are way better  this movie is garbage as a thousand movies i have watched last 5 years so dont try to find why and where just big names just fake scenarios without ideas and this industry gets your money out of your pocket and selling you trash ancient gods
oh
my god
i feel like retard monkey in the cage that world government gives bananas to forget that we are slaves working for 300 euros per month  hollywood you make mind experiments now
after cocla cola microscoft and gogle and fbook now hollywood
wtf
oh yes i know it started from 40s not just now this are real mind trash experiments  better if you dont have strong will dont watch them it produces permanent damage to your brain
there are no words to express how amazing this movie was
what one would assume would be a typical horror clicha is actually treated to one of the most creative movies ive ever seen
although most people could expect what the movie contained from the previews as i did they will still be blow away by this movie
not from the acting or directing or anything like that but from the pure originality of the movie
the last horror movie i remember seeing that was this original inventive and down right badass was scream and with a equally satisfying deliverance of its gritty gory grisly and tongue in cheek attitude
anyone who goes to see this movie will surely get their moneys worth and then some
the cabin in the woods revolves around two stories there are the main characters who go to the cabin and wound up getting attacked by monsters and a group of mysterious business men who seem to be controlling the whole thing
overall the movie seemed like it was just going to be a fun campy horror movie and in the first act it was
the setup was perfect and it got me really excited for what was going to come but when the monsters show up it was vastly underwhelming but thats not the worst part
the worst part is the third act which is so different from the rest of the movie it gave me a headache
in the last twenty minutes i ended up tapping my foot waiting it to be done so i could continue on with my life
if youre a horror fan then i recommend you stay away from this one
this movie is badly written
good actors wasted there talent being in this awful movie
it is an awful ending
they took stuff from just about every horror story in the world
this movie is not scary
it is just stupid
i can believe people like this movie
it is so stupid and point less
you have to be under 10 to get scared of it
if it supposed to be funny it is not
if it is supposed to be scary it is not
do not wast your time
do not wast your money
do not see this awful movie
this one of the worst horror movies ever made
do not see it
it is crap
i am running out of lines and i dont know what less to say
this movie is pooh pooh
the cabin in the woods is not clever enough to be satire and not scary enough to be a horror film
i think that to make this a properly satirical movie it should have been presented as a normal horror movie until stoner boy discovers the camera
the opening scene with richard jenkins can say there but all the intercutting between the cabin and hq removes what little tension the movie has
the way its currently presented you know how its going to end or at least i did
now dont get me wrong its pretty original but that doesnt mean its a masterpiece
its a joke
richard jenkins and co
were the only worthwhile part of the movie
seeing people whose job is to kill others make the most of their duties was very reminiscent of the hunger games
but i will say that at least they tried to have some funny parts
my favorite was the death of chris hemsworth obviously
but yeah hugely overrated movie
this movie was probably the dumbest movie ive ever seen
the jumpscares were so obvious and does not really classify as a horror movie to me
everything in this movie was predictable and had absolutely no originality
i was pretty much bored throughout the whole entire movie
nothing actually made sense
where some characters should have died they didnt and when some of them should be ok they instantly died
it just seemed like they were trying to make fun of another movie
also the they should have named the movie something else
this movie was a waste of my time and im so glad i didnt spend money to watch this in the cinema
i watched this movie just because of its high rating
but i got to say this movie is one of the lamest ive ever seen
does not scare you and if at some point if it does somehow manages to give you chills than its gone by some stupid science fiction crap
too much gore and violence makes it boring to watch
the story fails to provide any real sense of attachment at all
characters tries to hold their ground but there is just not anything in the story
it just fails to provide any justice to the genre
if you are a core horror fan then there is nothing for you in this movie
you might wanna skip this one
its like hunger games on a bad day
too stupid to watch
ill start with the obviousas anyone can tell from the commercials there is a cabin in the woods some teens go there stuff happens but it seems that there are people controlling what sort of stuff happens
and that part is goodit is an original twist
but from there the much awaited premier was a poorly acted poorly lit festival of boredom and clichas
i hoped that towards the end something might change and it didthere was an interesting twist for close to 15 seconds before it too became boring and predictable
dont waste your time with this one
and i say this as a big fan of joss whedons other work
but if i had been in the theater with him while watching this i would have taken my dvd of firefly and beat him to death with it
oh man
this was bad
im not even sure why i gave it a 2  that was generous
i know horror movies can tend to be lame
but some can be good the paranormal activity series the exorcist the rite
but this one was just awful
i saw it only as a slam to the corporate world  such a typical view from hollywood
but come on a bunch of guys in white shirts and black ties killing people for  what
that is never really made clear other than a bunch of other corporations worldwide compete for some unknown prize
while celebrating deaths etc with office pools etc
i dont know
didnt make it to the end of this one
all i saw in this movie was the political message and it ticked me off
i dont want politics either left or right when i watch a movie
i just want to be entertained
and the only scary part in this movie  i agree with another reviewer  was the creepy guy at the gas station
pass on this one folks even if you are an anarchist
its still bad lol
this movie was a huge disappointment
how could this possibly be rated a 7
4
dont get me wrong its watchable if you dont have nothing better to do
me personally i would prefer washing two days worth of dishes than wasting 90mins of my time on this
why did i even rate it a 6 i asked myself
effort
although an unsuccessful effort
this is the type of movie you naively carry your girlfriend to watch and afterwards feel totally embarrassed by your poor choice in movies
in fact when i first watched this i fell asleep
leaving my girlfriend to bear the horror
i bet she would like to suck my toes rather than watch this again
so i awoke to my girlfriends terrible reviews
i watched it again so that i could give it a fair chance and came to one conclusion
only a complete nincompoop or someone who is being paid will rate this a 7 or above
i felt guilty even rating this a 6
i made the awful mistake that so many before me had done
i rented this movie based on imdb reviews
this is a different kind of horror film they said
this movie will make you think they said
no
absolutely none of the above
in all there are several hilarious scenes in this movie simply because of the awful makeup cgi or unbelievable nature of the plot
there are a few times where youll loudly remark oh come on
there isnt even that much blood in the human body
youll know what i mean if you watch this film and i dont recommend that at all
stay away
510 simply because the acting was decent and because of sigourney weaver
at first glance this would be the perfect horror movie5 kids alone in a cabin in the woods when sinister things start to occur and people start dying
perfect right
and the movie seems that way that is until right when its about to actually get scary the movie is interrupted with a cheesy subplot that destroys everything scary about it
if the ending is ignored this could be an actually great scary movie to watch with your friends but all of that is thrown away with a downward slide of corny cheesy stupidly planned garbage that fails to horrify anyone
the end of this movie is so frustratingly corny the whole movie is thrown away and you find yourself sitting on the couch thinking well that was a wast of my time
if you enjoy corny movies featuring the monsters of your childhood nightmares then this is the movie for you
i havent left any comment here for a while but i was so irritated by a very high imdb rate for this movie that i had to leave my own mark
first of all the the movie genre is like searching itself through the whole movie
the director wasnt sure is he going to make a horror thriller sf or comedy so it looks like he is experimenting with the genre through the movie phases never achieving one whole
then the idea of a horror in a controlled environment is kind of eliminating the horror atmosphere and it is very poorly executed
also i found the acting of the five pretty pale
worst thing from my point of view in this movie is that all this is connected into the very boring melting pot where no real plot and no movie dynamics leads you until the end of the movie which i couldnt wait to come
