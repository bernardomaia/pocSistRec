"\nThe Place Beyond The Pines was a magnificent third feature from\ndirector Derek Cianfrance. The performances were outstanding and it was\na great story. The three act structure was executed brilliantly and\nwere all tied together in a very satisfying way.<br><br>The opening tracking shot was absolutely brilliant and did a great job\nestablishing Ryan Gosling's character without any dialogue. The\nsoundtrack, by Mike Patton, was impeccable and did a great job\ncapturing the tone of the film.<br><br>The story of the film is really well told and does a great job dealing\nwith multiple genres. This film will appeal to anyone who wants to\nwatch captivating performances, intense drama, and a great story! I\nhighly recommend it!\n"
"\nIn an attempt to give away as little as possible about this film,\nobviously so that you can enjoy all of the phases as I was able to do,\nI would like to simply highlight my opinion about this movie. It was a\ngreat film and was very entertaining. I'd recommend you take a chance\nand go see this film. Expect some theatrical diversity and in the end\nit all comes back full circle.<br><br>I have nothing negative to say. The acting was mature and accurate.\nEach character was playing a role that suited their own set of talents\nsuperbly.<br><br>Try not to read too many reviews and just go and see this movie. You\nwill not be disappointed.\n"
"\nThe Place Beyond The Pines tells a unique, compelling story in a way\nthat I have never seen before. This movie kept me interested from start\nto finish. It is far from traditional storytelling. The story is split\ninto three sections all very different from each other. I enjoyed each\nsection of the movie almost equally, but the first hour of the movie is\ndefinitely the strongest. The movie may be slow to some, but I was\ninvested in the story from start to finish. This is the best I've seen\nRyan Gosling and Bradley Cooper, no doubt. There are no bad\nperformances but Cooper and Gosling's stand out the most. Dane Dehaan\nplays an important role and does a great job of it. Dehaan is\ndefinitely a rising star. The tone of this movie is incredible, and I\nwould recommend it to anyone who enjoys a good drama. It is the best\nmovie I have seen this year, and with the breakthrough performances\nthroughout, this is a movie you're not going to want to miss.\n"
"\nI'm beginning to think that any film containing Ryan Gosling is going\nto be garbage! Before watching this film, I promised that I wouldn't\ncompare it to the silent musical he featured in prior; Driven. I should\nhave known better.<br><br>The Place behind the Pines jumps from 1 year later to 15 years later\nand still leads you to a dead end. Just when you think this movie is\nabout Gosling robbing banks to support his son, it makes a left turn\nand now we are thrown into a movie involving corrupt cops. As stated\nbefore, the movie then jumps 15 years a head in time to a screen play\nyou could find on the Lifetime channel involving a father and his\nrebellious son. When the story tries to make it's explosive twist to\nbring all the stories together, you are left thinking; who cares and\nwhat does it matter.... Once the final, riding off into the sunset,\nscene displayed, I realized that I was sitting there with my mouth\nopen. Why? If you want to waste a good 2 hours of your life, by all\nmeans- check this movie out. As for me, I could have done my laundry.\n"
"\nThis movie has excellent cinematography and great camera work and\nfamous actors. that is it. I wish i could talk to the director and just\nfigure out what the hell he was thinking. The first story of Ryan\ngosling as the bank robber was excellent.(the first 45 minutes) the\nsecond story of Bradley Cooper exposing corruption within his police\ndepartment was decent, the idea certainly had potential. And the last\nstory of their two kids meeting had little potential but still could\nhave been an alright movie. When all three are combined, it is nothing\nbut irrelevant wasted potential. Ultimately this movie dies with Lives\nand Dies by Ryan Gosling. I walked out of the theater angry that i was\nso manipulated by a near perfect movie trailer. The idea of Ryan\nGosling as a bank robber is now wasted and Bradley cooper as a good cop\namong bad cops is ruined. And for the record, there is no \"Place Beyond\nthe Pines\" it has nothing at all to do with the movie, its just a good\nmarketing title to manipulate people into wasting their money on this\ndisappointment of a movie.\n"
"\nThe first section holds promise of a tense thriller as Ryan Gosling\ngets addicted to robbing banks and using his motorbike riding skills to\nescape at high speed until...... The second section focuses on Bradley\nCooper's cop, hailed as a hero but who finds it a mixed blessing\ncarrying both danger but also opportunities worth exploiting. Once the\nheadline appears on screen 'Fifteen Years later', we are in the third\nsection and it's here that the film completely falls apart. The story\nbecomes melodramatic and utterly predictable; the coincidences and plot\ncontrivances are just ridiculous.To make matters worse we are served up\na load of cod-psychology about fathers and sons. If only the director\nhad stuck to making a solid thriller without all the pretentious\novertones, this would've been a really good movie.\n"
"\nSince I like Mr Ryan Gosling as an actor, I went out with friends to\nwatch \"The Place Beyond the Pines\". In this movie, Mr Gosling is\nquickly killed, leaving Bradley Cooper (not a favourite for me) to\nfinish the long remainder of the action. This immediately put me off. I\ncould not watch the movie to the end. The two leading characters\n(Gosling and Cooper) meet in a police chase only for a few minutes, in\nwhich Mr Gosling is shot dead. To my mind, this felt like a 'cheat' a\n'trick'... since I did not know about it beforehand. So, if you - like\nme - want to see Mr. Gosling, I suggest you give this one the skip. Mr\nGosling has several good movies worth watching, excluding this one, of\ncourse.\n"
"\nLuke's downwards spiral and Cross's guilty conscience were compelling,\nand the lack of contrast between the two made it an interesting\ncommentary on the media's and people's tendency to force situations\ninto a right vs wrong, black and white mould. Luke being a bank robber\nwith semi-noble intentions who simply couldn't accept that he'd\ncouldn't have the life he wanted with his son and son's mother, vs\nAvery Cross being an ambitious cop who doubts his supposed heroism and\nalmost lets himself go down the path of corruption, really makes you\nquestion who to root for and whether \"rooting for\" someone is the right\nway to go. The story of their sons, however, is hard to enjoy. While\nthe idea that the effects of your actions don't stop at you or your\ngeneration holds water, and the way Luke's son and those that knew Luke\ncast Avery as the villain reflects the past treatment of Luke and the\nsame error in perception, the characters' sons are so unlikable and\nhave such poor judgment that the second half is hard to enjoy or\nappreciate.\n"
"\nSeeing the great cast in this movie fooled me! This movie made no\nsense, the storyline was not smooth, and was not realistic. Ryan\n\"Robot\" Gosling's role was short lived in the movie and was ridiculous.\nBradley Cooper eventually shows us half way through the movie as a\n\"crooked\" hero cop that is taking pleasure in being the hero after\nmurder &amp; theft. Eva Mendez was the only actor that was decent and she\nhad a minor, useless role. Once Ray Liotta entered the movie, the story\ncomes apart. I so disappointed and wish we rented another movie. Don't\nbe fooled by the usual, amazing cast. This was a terrible movie and\nwould have rated it lower without the actors used in the film.\n"
"\nI, like a lot of people, take IMDb ratings as something of a benchmark\nas to what I watch. If it's hovering around a 6 or anything below it's\nusually left well alone. This film (at the time of writing) has a more\nthan respectable 7.5 rating and when I found it I thought I'd give it a\ngo.<br><br>What a huge let-down. How people can refer this to a great film I'll\nnever know. It's slow, meandering pace could be forgiven if it picked\nup towards the end but it simply doesn't. It's a very flat film that\nlacks any sense of direction and when the credits start to roll there\nare two questions that enter into your mind:<br><br>\"That was it?\" and \"How did anyone find this film interesting?!\"<br><br>I'd recommend anyone that has two hours spare to give this a miss. It\nfelt like an eternity and a smart, unique or an explosive finale could\nof saved it from disaster to mediocre but alas, the ending was much\nlike the film: plodding and boring. Avoid.\n"
"\nThe Place Beyond the Pines is honestly one of the worst movies I have\never seen. It was unnecessarily long and incredibly boring. The\ncharacters were not engaging at all and almost no back story was ever\ngiven. The editing was sloppy and the first part of the movie felt like\nit was being rushed and the movie makers were just trying to get it\nover with. The camera was constantly unsteady and shaking. To be honest\nthe whole thing felt more like a bad independent film than an actual\nmovie. The worst part, in my opinion, is that the summary and trailer\nof the movie is completely misleading. The movie is entirely different\nform what the trailer would have you believe. Please don't waste your\nmoney on this movie. If you really want to see it it would be better if\nyou just waited until you can rent it for a couple bucks.\n"
"\n(spoilers) Directed by Derek Cianfrance, \"The Place Beyond the Pines\"\nseems like it may have been a decent book (maybe it was based on one -\nI didn't look), as it's details are fairly involved and sometimes\nvivid.. But as a movie it didn't work for me, especially as it kept\ngoing. Really it meandered badly and failed to hold my attention\nespecially during the \"third\" and final act. It seemed to be bitten by\nthe wandering bug, and the music was monotonous and out-of-place. Too\nbad, as the movie started out fairly well, especially in the first 3rd\nwith the focus on actors Gosling and Mendes - there was good focus\nthere, but then it keeps going and going, and trying to show meaning\nwhere there's none. Unfortunately it's a stumbled missed opportunity.\n5/10\n"
"\nLet me tell you something, a felon is a felon. Nothing deep. Stop\npromote this kind of characters. Those kids are the same crap in real\nlife. They are like rats, poisoning the society. I want my money back\nand my wasted time. Who create this movie? I want to see the guy. Show\nyourself! The image of the felon who jump of the window was too long.\nIt was disturbing to see the dead guy for many seconds. Sick director.\nAwful! Come on, so many good ideas are waiting to be on the big screen\nand they concentrate about felony, bad guy, corrupted policeman, drugs\nand teenagers, all together in a story who wants to make the people to\nfelt down in tears. American crap. Pardon me for my English\n"
"\nThe Place Beyond the Pines\" follows two fathers and two sons over two\ndecades in a quite effective film. In spite of its being a little\noverlong it has a strong rawness and two excellent acting performances.\nRyan Gosling and Bradle Cooper are a perfect pair of opposites: Gosling\nis all wildness whereas Cooper wonderfully plays a man who rehearsed\nfor life and seems uncomfortable with praise. The film's first\ntwo-thirds, focusing on these two men, are fascinating but the story\nends up losing a bit its own way in the last half-hour (the coincidence\nof the grown sons coming across each other is forced). However\neverything ends on the right note with a journey on an old motorbike\nand a slow fade into a new beginning.\n"
"\nSad to say but the talents of Ryan Gosling, Bradley Cooper, and Eva\nMendes were completely wasted on this film. There are no characters who\nare particularly likable (or unlikable) or that are even much deeper\nthan a cardboard cutout. The story is slow, which actually make a\nlittle sense since it goes nowhere. Where's the conflict? Hmmmm, not\nthat sure. Any redemption? Not too sure I'm seeing that, either. Any\nreal point at all? No, not really. This is the kind of film that people\npretend they like in order to appear sophisticated. It that's you, save\nyourself the 2+ hours of your life that you'll never get back and just\ntell people you liked it. You'll thank me.\n"
"\nQuite hard to digest that this movie is so highly rated. One is\ninclined to believe that the popularity of IMDb has led to star crazed\nfans feeling the urge to prop up the movie regardless of the content. <br><br>Almost all the scenes in this movie are clichéd. Agreed that it's hard\nto invent scenes but the director or screenplay writer can at least try\nto innovate. The dialogues aren't anything great too. You've probably\nseen and heard it all - actually seen and heard it all in the exact\nsame sequence even.<br><br>The stand-out performer is Ryan Gosling, and he does quite well in the\nopening scenes. But even Ryan and Brad Cooper cannot redeem this movie,\nthey have been let down pretty bad by a weak script. And there are a\nfew scenes involving Eva Mendes which do not make sense at all. And the\nmake-up artists for this movie do not deserve a place in Hollywood,\nthey just don't. Even B-grade horror movies from the 80s had better\nmake-up artists. <br><br>Enjoy the trailer of this movie and try not to imagine how awesome the\nmovie would be. It just isn't !\n"
"\nWell the trailer showed promise, but the film just never ends ,<br><br>it may even still be on , Just looping endlessly round and round the\nprojector ,If someone offered a one way trip to a Swiss clinic during\nthis tedium I would have jumped at the chance <br><br>I had wondered given some of the revues , but this is just a dull ,\ntedious and dreary film No doubt the sort of people that pretend to\nlike this sort of moody miserable films will say how wonderful it is ,\nwhen in fact this film could be used as a form of torture , just one\nviewing and the threat of a second showing would break the hardest\nsuspect The characters are dull and flat , the story drags its feet\nlike a dog going to the vets , If you go , do yourself a favour and\ntake a blanket , a flask of tea maybe even a 10000 piece puzzle to do\nwhilst watching this glum old cods wallop\n"
"\nThe Place Beyond the Pines feels like three incomplete films stuffed\ninto one film. The ambitious story follows a bank robber, then the cop\ninvolved and then both their sons. A mini- series format would suit\nthis a hell of a lot better and flesh out the story, where here all the\nstories feel rushed, yet the film feels endless. The first part of the\nfilm with Gosling is the most successful, as we watch this motorcycle\ndaredevil go on a bank robbing spree to leave something for his newborn\nson. The second act with Cooper is a half assed corrupt cop story with\nzero payoff. And the last act about Cooper running for public office\nand tying both his kid and Gosling's kid's fate together, feels\nextraneous when it should bring the story full circle. It's an epic\nstory indeed, spanning a generation, but director Derek Cianfrance\ndoesn't pull off the execution.\n"
"\nBecause of the high ratings on IMDb i decided to watch this film,<br><br>but...<br><br>It is one of the worst movies i have ever seen, very boring and slow\nand some weird 3 parts in the story that don't really connect. I\nstopped watching halfway the movie i couldn't bare to watch this slow\nmovie with a thin storyline.. Actually during the whole movie nothing\nreally happens... The story is dull and has no meaning, it's just some\nmessed up dudes doing crazy stuff..<br><br>The actors are convincing and they do a really good job, but that can't\nmake up for story,.. Honestly there is not much more to tell about this\nmovie!\n"
"\nIt starts well enough them the Ryan Gosling character is killed by the\nBradley Cooper character within the first hour. It's like OK, now where\nare we going the lead is just killed off. It continues by following\nBradley Cooper through some challenges personally and professionally\nfollowing his recognition for being shot in the line of duty when he\nkilled Gosling. I really liked seeing Ray Liota I've always been a fan.\nThen it jumps 15 years forward. What?? Where are we now? I was really\nlosing interest by now. I appreciated the work of the cast but the\nstory didn't cut it for me. I felt like I was watching an adaptation of\na novel that was cut too thin to make sense.\n"
"\nAwfully boring movie! The Place Beyond the Pines reads like a book.\nProbably a good read! Regrettably The Place Beyond the Pines could be\none of those books which transfers to film poorly. The story-line is\nlong and dry. Dry in the way of an over cooked turkey, which is hard to\ndigest. The acting and characters are wooden. The characters are stiff\nand unbelievable. Great cast {ie Cooper) but the directer gives a feel\nthat every character is constipated while they are talking. The Place\nBeyond the Pines story unfolds like a boring power point presentation\nwhich has too much information. The movie lost my attention after the\nfirst 30 minutes. I found myself playing with my smart phone, then I\nwent onto the computer. \"Finally its over\" I thought to myself when The\nPlace Beyond the Pines ended. I give 4 stars out of ten.\n"
"\nI have to applaud \"The Place Beyond the Pines\" for its effort. This\nfilm has a fantastic premise and was certainly ambitious with its\nstory. The risks it took and the tale it was attempting to tell are\ntruly fantastic. Unfortunately for this film (and those watching), it\nnever truly succeeds. This is due to some terrible pacing and badly\nwritten characters. It's hard to care about any of them, as none of the\ninteresting ones are given enough time to become fully developed. Those\nwho do get sufficient screen time, just aren't that attention grabbing,\ndespite some descent acting. I would also just like to state that after\nwatching this film, I wanted to strangle Emory Cohen. I'm sure he's a\nfine actor, but he plays probably one of the most\naggravating/obnoxious/annoying characters I have seen in recent\nhistory. On the bright side, this film contains some great\ncinematography and a fantastic soundtrack. Seriously, instead of\nwatching this boring and convoluted mess, get on Spotify right now and\nlisten to the soundtrack, you'll have a better time.\n"
"\nI can't deny everything said by the people who've rated this as a 10.\nWhat I can say is that this director put a lot of effort into the\n\"drama\" aspect of things. If, by \"drama\", you mean taking extended\npauses between dialogs. At some times, so much so, that it is\nuncomfortable. I kept finding myself saying, \"come on, I get the point,\nnow get on with it\". It's almost as if the director felt making a good\nmovie required that it be 2 1/2 hours long. This movie definitely could\nhave been reduced to 1 1/2 hours and wouldn't have lost a bit of\nquality. Now, the critics and the academy awards click will love this,\nbut the average viewer will feel as I do. The movie has a great, albeit\nslightly predictable, plot. The acting is superb. The story itself is a\ngreat one. Had it moved at a comfortable pace, I would give it a 9. For\nnow, it's off to go find some caffeine.\n"
"\nHow can you have high speed motorcycles, bank robberies, and a bad boy\nand still be boring as all hell? This director is as bad as the one\nfrom Drive. Never again! Gosling you are banned from my watch list. To\nsay this movie is slow and retarded is to insult all other slow and\nretarded movies. Save your money and your time and don't watch this\nunless you really like story telling through long scenes with very\nlittle dialog and crap music. This genre that includes this steaming\npile of a movie and Drive needs to die out fast. It's not cool. It's\nnot entertaining. It's a pretentious attempt to be artistic.<br><br>No Thanks!\n"
"\nSeriously .. <br><br>Was I watching a different movie? I went through 2+ hours of pure and\nutter drivel based solely on the IMDb rating of 7.6 (I'd typically\nexpect a 6.5+ movie worth watching or at least have some redeemable\nfeatures)<br><br>Was there one original part in this entire movie? If so, I must have\nmissed it during a blink.. A collection of clichés and over-told\nstories from movies long past.. <br><br>Acting was OK, but the story.. the lack of substance of any form makes\nthe length of the film incomprehensible, a 5 minute short would have\nsuited it better.<br><br>Don't waste your time with this one .. it's a rotten tomato<br><br>This is one of the few films I've seen that makes me depressed over the\ntime I've lost watching it, most rotten tomatoes are actually funny\nthey're so bad, this one just keeps you watching because the optimist\nin you is screaming at you that it can only get better! <br><br>It doesn't\n"
"\nWell where to start, this movie leaves you feeling like wtf at the end\nof it. <br><br>Part 1 - starts off good, bank robber bandit on a dirt bike with a\nhillbilly wheel man. Bank robber starts robbing banks to provide for\nhis baby son until he gets shot dead. <br><br>Part 2 - movie suddenly turns into a cop drama with crooked cops and\ndoing shady corrupt things. Movie starts to get a bit slow and boring. <br><br>Part 3 - movie suddenly jumps unknown amount of years and bank robber\nbandit baby has grown up and snitching goody two shoes cops son is same\nage and becomes friends with bank robber bandit baby at school blah\nblah blah<br><br>Then end - makes no sense at all kid buys a road bike and rides off\ndown a dirt road (father who robbed banks always rode a dirt bike???) <br><br>The movie leaves you feeling like wtf, so many loose ends and overall\ndoes not really make any sense, which is a let down because the first\npart of the movie was good\n"
"\nI can't remember the last time I was this excited to see a film.\nStarted off with so much promise and slowly built tension and momentum.\nThen it all fell apart for me. Ryan Gosling does his typical tough guy\nshtick which works for the first half hour. Bradley Cooper starts off\nstrong but there doesn't seem much for him to do after his big shooting\nscene. The more he is on screen the less believable it is to me that he\nwould be a cop. I do like how he handled the corruption but it left me\nwith a lot of questions as well. Act 3 was just depressing and I became\nuninterested as it slowly dawned on me that this movie was a huge\ndisappointment and basically going nowhere-slowly and painfully.\n"
"\n\"The Place Beyond the Pines\" is easily one of the most morose films\nI've ever seen.<br><br>It feels like the screenwriter came up with a dramatic climax first,\nand then proceeded, in fits and starts, to write some drafts of what a\nscreenplay leading up to that climax might feel like. Unfortunately, he\ndidn't pick just one, and the result is a meandering film that\nconstantly feels like it's starting over. The end product is way too\nlong, and is not helped by the fact that the tone is one of nearly\nrelentless and one-note gloom.<br><br>Some good actors like Bradley Cooper and Ryan Gosling are lost in this\ndesultory mess, and I stopped caring about what would happen to their\ncharacters and anyone else for that matter long before the movie itself\nended.<br><br>Grade: D\n"
"\nIt could have been better; good acting might have carried it, but the\nabsolutely clichéd soundtrack started grating on me early. And the most\nsurprising thing about the ending is that anyone would think it was\nbelievable. After all the dawdling over the beginning of the movie, it\nwas quite a shock to see the dreaded \"15 years later\" show up, like\nsomething a high-schooler would have written. In fact, I think the\nclichés and choppy storytelling show a lot of immaturity in the\nwriting. It's not a bad story, and like I said, the actors did what\nthey could, but so much of the character motivation was vague, and for\na movie that lasted so long, it felt like a lot was missing. Best line,\nfor unintentional rhyming comedy, \"He got ecstasy from that kid from\nSchenectady.\" Not sure that was worth the 15 year wait.\n"
"\nI have tried to watch this movie because of the high ratings and good\nreviews and was utterly disappointed by this very mediocre pointless\n2h+ flick. Ryan Gosling is playing the exact same role as always in the\nexact same manner. He always seems out of his place with his fake\nemotionless moron-ish look. His acting is limited to be standing like a\ncarp, awaiting to drop his 3 word lines before fading away and then\nreappearing again... I really don't get how and why he is that famous,\nhe is probably the worst Hollywood actor of present times. Cooper is in\ncontrast far more talented and credible in his role, although he also\nseems not in his place: I don't get why he was involved in such a bad\nmovie.<br><br>This movie is extremely boring, slow paced and pointless. Directing has\nnothing special and Gosling is so annoying that unless you are one of\nhis fans, he alone should convince you to stop viewing this and save\nsome of your time to do something else.<br><br>Save yourself 2h20 of your life and avoid this overrated, pointless B\nseries.\n"
"\nI was actually BORED during this movie! It is a waste of time and\nmoney.<br><br>This is the first movie that I have been glad that it was over.Even if\na lot of known actors like Eva Mendes, Ryan Gossling and Bradley Cooper\nwere cast, the movie was really bad and lacking of content. I wish\nsomebody would give me back my money and the time I wasted. During the\nplay, half of the people in the theater left. Even my friends wanted to\nleave. Spare yourself of the misery and don't go. I made my IMDb\naccount especially to write this review and advise others not to go see\nthis movie. I hope I was useful.\n"
"\nThe film is not worthy the money, nor the time. Its long and boring. It\nlacks argument and meaning, nothing seems to happen for scenes and\nscenes and the final message is really thin. If you want to delight\nyour sight with Eva Mendes or Ray Gossling you can do so in much better\nfilms. The film is not worthy the money, nor the time. Its long and\nboring.

"\nWhen I saw the previews to this movie it looked very interesting, I\nfigured it was going to be a movie that starts out kind of slow and\nbuilds up to a really great story, my god was I wrong. This is the\nexact opposite, the movie starts out laying the ground work for a\nmotorcycle rider/bank robber, and then when the story just gets good,\nit stops. From that point on they just kind of toss in little side\nstories here and there from this persons view from that persons view,\nfrom everywhere. About mid-way through this ghastly long winded movie\nyou understand where it will all come together, and here's the kicker\nIT DOES! It comes together just like you think it will and then nothing\nhappens. It's seriously one of the most disappointing movies I've seen\nthis year and if it weren't for Ryan Gosling and Eva Mendes this movie\nwould have easily been a 1/10.\n"
"\nThis movie had decent acting, but the pacing and connection between the\ntwo story lines was weak at best. The first 30 minutes or so were\npretty good, and then things shift dramatically and I started losing\ninvestment/interest in the characters. The plot just kind of trickles\nalong with no real direction; it felt like the writers got kind of lost\nin their own story. I think it was meant to be a movie about how our\nactions affect others, and maybe about the role/legacy of the father,\nbut it didn't reach any kind of significance for me. I got really bored\ntowards the end and considered walking out (which is saying something\nb/c it is rare for me not to finish a movie). The movies had the\ningredients to potentially be a solid movie, but it just did not make\nit happen.\n"
"\nThe movie is about a man named Luke who rides his motorcycle inside the\nglobe of death, a carnival attraction. He runs into his old lover,\nRomina, who has secretly had Luke's child. In an attempt to support his\nnew son and win his girl back, Luke quits his job at the carnival and\nrobs some banks. He is successful until he tried one too many times,\nand was accidentally killed in the process. The story then shifts to\nthe police officer that had Luke in pursuit, Avery Cross. Fifteen years\npass, and the rest of the story unfolds. The film was produced so well\nand had a very grabbing plot line, and the actors were hot. This movie\nwas so great!\n"
"\nI didn't fall asleep but I didn't pay much attention either. It's not\npainfully slow moving it's not flashy either. It's 3 small movies none\nof which could stand on their own, stitched together into a cliché\nriddled saga. The first story with Gosling is cookie cutter depressed\nmumbling Gosling. The second story is a 70's episode of a TV show about\ndirty cops it even has Ray Liotta being a dirty cop, I know, where's my\nfainting couch. The third is the most 'cinematic' replete with morality\ntales about sins of the father and whatnot. But at the end it's light\nand fluffy. Not much to it. Would have made a good flick 30 years ago.\n"
"\nStunning actors, beautiful camera work (first take in the movie was\nabsolutely gorgeous), and a great story with a message. It just felt so\nrealistic and close to the characters. But I think it was a little bit\ntoo long and sometimes felt a little unfocused in the second half.\nAdded to that it felt, because of the realism, kind of depressive, but\nthat is just my own, personal, point of view: If you don't have a\nproblem with something like this: Cool! but that is what makes movies a\nlittle bit worse for me. But still: Almost a brilliant piece of\nfilmmaking!\n"
"\nI've wanted to watch this film for a while and was looking forward to\nit. I wasn't disappointed, but it wasn't what I was expecting. <br><br>We're told it's a crime thriller, and I think this is where some of the\nbad reviews are coming from. A crime thriller is usually racy and full\nof suspense. This film isn't. It's a slow paced, thought-provoking film\nabout fatherhood, relationships, fate and life itself. It's split in to\nthree separate stories that all link together. <br><br>I love the way it's filmed and the characters created. I also found it\nhad a subtle, dry humour in it. <br><br>It's not a crime thriller, but I wouldn't know how to categorise it\neither.<br><br>It left me thinking and affected me in some way, so it's not something\nto just watch for a thrill, but rather something to mull over\nafterwards.<br><br>Worth a watch, but don't expect an edge- of-your-seat crime thriller\nthat leaves you guessing until the end.\n"
"\nAfter this movie I am definitely going to wait every single movie for\nDerek Cianfrance,it is his second long film and also his second work\nwith Ryan Gosling.<br><br>I really really loved the story lines of this film ,three films in one\nfilms, the three films overlap together to give us this great film.<br><br>All the actors did a great job especially Ryan Gosling. Every scene he\nmade was tremendous. I also loved Bradley cooper , you hate him for a\nsecond then you find yourself sympathizing with him, and by that you\nknow a great actor.<br><br>Derek Cianfrance did a great work and showed great abilities in\ndirecting and also in writing. he gave every part of the film the exact\ntime they needed, he also knew how to find the best in Gosling and made\nthe best work with him.<br><br>A great movie and a Big recommendation 8/10 , 2 points are lost because\nthe first part was much better than the second and the third .\n"
"\nThe storyline is something I value the most in one movie. This movie\nconsists of three separate acts which are consequential to each other.\nIt is more suitable for theater than for the big screen. If the story\nwas told using retrospection, it would have kept me in suspense\nthroughout the whole 2 hours 15 minutes.<br><br>Nevertheless, the three separate stories are interesting, but they\nmight just as well have been separate 40-minute long movies. The\ntransition between the first two was fine, but it was non-existing when\ntransitioning into the third part. A few facts were hidden from the\nviewer which I found confusing. The acting was good too and so was the\ndirecting as well.<br><br>What I took from this movie is how an event from the past (which you\nhad no control of but own the blame for) can come back and haunt you 15\nyears later. It also showed how an ambitious father can lose control\nover what is happening with his own family (wife &amp; child).\n"
"\nThis movie really excelled because of excellent directing. All the\nstars were stars. There are a reason certain actors rise to the top and\nit is because they are able to act. Too simple? Go to an acting class.\nGosling plays these drifter characters brilliantly. His character here\nis similar to that in Drive. I got wind of Gosling in Fracture and he\njumped to the \"A\" list instantly. Never a fan of Eva Mendes, but I have\nturned a leaf. If you are ridiculously pretty you have a lot of\novercome, and she did so here. Her facial expressions and under acting\ndisplayed her confidence (again, excellent direction). The entire cast\nwas superb!<br><br>Those complaining of story miss the point. The story was strong enough,\nbut the acting on every level made this a very emotional experience,\nand that means the movie was very good. This plot introduced something\nnew, two babies that grow up apart but have much in common. The six\ndegrees of separation always works.<br><br>Two thumbs up for this one!\n"
"\nMy mom said this movie was really good and gripping. I watched it and\nwas disappointed with the tediousness of the length and the differing\nstory lines. This film should have been presented as three short films\ntied together, however flimsy. The story lines that should have been\nrife with tension and consequences are not. Just when you think\nsomething will go the distance and really explode...it backs up or\ntakes a detour and it's way too neat, especially the end, THAT would be\nhighly consequential in real life but in this movie it's another weak\nsoft spot. The only real event that happens is the end of the first\nact, then everything else keeps going soft. Its's a hard 2/12 hours\nwith no payoff and dumb characters that you can't believe or want to\nsucceed.\n"
"\nOK, the story is about two men and later, their sons. In the summary,\nit says something about the place in the woods where they find refuge,\nbut to be honest, they hardly ever went there. The performances were\ngood, probably the only thing that saved the movie from hitting rock\nbottom, as the story doesn't unfold as well as it would have been\nexpected. I mean, it's a good drama in theory, but it fails to deliver.\nIn the end, what did the movie had to say? That the sins of the parents\nare burdens of their children? That one can't escape their fate? Maybe\nthat there is an authority problem in the police system. Anyway, the\nfirst part of the movie was better than the second one (the one that\nlimped into the future fifteen years later). It had more feeling into\nit I guess. But to end this, I have to say, that even though the main\nidea of the film was great, the movie didn't live up to it. So three\nout of ten.\n"
"\nThis movie is an amazing piece of art. The trailer of this movie is\nmisleading, I watched the movie thinking that it was another boring\ndrama but I was so surprised when I watched it. The way the story was\ntold was wonderful and kept the viewer wanting to know more about the\ncharacters. <br><br>Dane DeHaane was amazing with every role he takes he proves that he's a\ntalented actor and he has a good future ahead of him.<br><br>The movie has a long running time which is two hours and a half but I\ndidn't feel bored through the entire movie. The story was emotional and\nunpredictable. The characters are very well presented but you feel like\nthe movie fell a part in the final act, the movie was so good and it\ndefinitely deserved a better ending.<br><br>The cinematography in this movie was so beautiful. It made every scene\nlook like a piece of art. The same thing goes to the soundtrack that\nwas so emotional and mixed perfectly with the emotions and the\natmosphere of the movie.\n"
"\nThis film is a great study of characters and how lives intertwine.\nGiving a meaning to what a small world. This film is in 3 parts and\nDerek Cianfrance travels through them fluidly. It is a film of strife\nand struggles and shows the audience that people will do what needs to\nbe done. No matter the circumstances. A bold movie with no lulls and\nsome pretty good action. There are a couple of genres that this picture\nmoves through. Making it an exciting and enjoyable feature to watch.\nRyan Gosling and Bradley Cooper were great and Eva's character\nprogressed beautifully. Mike Patton did the score which carried the\nfilm through it's long time line and added a certain atmosphere. All in\nall an excellent film with great acting, awesome story writing, a\npowerful score and interesting characters. I highly recommend this\nmovie.\n"
"\nIt has been a while since I watched a movie that did hold me like this\non the edge throughout the whole movie. With a length of over hundred\nand forty minutes, it is worth every second. \"The Place beyond the\nPines\" is a well made structure where every moment means a new layer of\ncomplexity and uncertainty. With an epic structure but with an lyrical\ncontent! The most difficult thing is to form an opinion about the main\nprotagonists. Do you condemn someone who never had a chance to be a\nbetter man or react instinctively to fear for your life? It is far from\nperfect but achieves perfection! It's interesting to see three\ndifferent stories so interconnected.\n"
"\nWatched this movie the other day and it was just amazing. The story and\nthe story-telling; the movie really cares about its characters. The\nstory is a kind of anthology design that is built around Ryan Gosling's\ncharacter and how his life comes to affect the lives of others. The\ncharacter itself I found to be one of the greatest written characters\nof the last twenty years: you really become attached to his story. The\nmovie also focuses on following Bradley Cooper's character after an\nencounter with Gosling's character. I think he did amazing job\ncapturing the guilt his character felt and you could sense how that\nguilt was present throughout the movie. Then there is Dane DeHaan's\ncharacter, which was superbly executed in story and in performance.\nStrong support came from Eva Mendes and Ben Mendelsohn in supporting\nroles.<br><br>Something in this film truly answers the reasons why I watch movies. I\ncan't praise enough the cast, the directing and the story. It enters\nwith a high note to my all time favorite films.\n"
"\nWhen I had first watched Place Beyond the Pines, it was mostly only\nbecause it stars both Ryan Gosling and Bradley Cooper. It has since\nbecome one of my favorite movies and is somewhat similar to another\nfavorite of mine, Drive. The story is split into three acts, all\nlayered well and coming together at the end. Although the first two\nacts were done extraordinarily well, the last act lacked a lot. It\nhonestly probably could've been cut from the film entirely, but that\nwould've taken away from the larger scope to complete the storyline.\nBut that didn't make me enjoy the film any less. The cinematography was\ngreat and so was the acting. I would definitely recommend this movie to\nanyone looking for an intense drama with great acting.\n"
"\n'The Places Beyond the Pines' tells us the story of the death of a\ncriminal, and its longer term aftermath: three separate stories focus\nsequentially on a different character. The weakest section is the\nthird, focusing on the children of the original participants: their\nmotivations seem more stylised, and less particular, than those of the\nleads in the earlier sections, which by contrast are subtly and well\nportrayed. This is a self-consciously serious movie, but it's not quite\nas engaging as it could be: none of the protagonists are particularly\nappealing. It's not just that they're flawed human beings; they're all\nquite close personalities, selfishly self-contained, and while their\nalienation provides a unifying theme the film fails to truly probe its\nunderlying causes. What is left is simply a story of some not\nparticularly likable people doing bad things to each other. I've seen\nplenty worse movies, but ultimately this one takes quite a lot of\nscreen time and, while it takes it quite well, the overall effect is\nunderwhelming rather than emotional.\n"
"\nGoing into this movie I didn't know what to expect. I had heard mixed\nreviews and was intrigued by what I had heard, and you know what? It\nwas a genuinely good movie. The cast is varied and has two very\nprestigious actors as the main characters. The seamless change between\nprotagonists after the biker, played by Ryan Gosling, dies is to be\nadmired and the psychological effects of events on the cop, played by\nBradley Cooper, being only subtly worked in so they are noticed by the\nviewer is rather impressive. The movie superbly shows the truth behind\ncorruption in the law and how far the people in charge can abuse their\npower, even though I suspect that may not have been their intention.\nAlso, I thought about what I would give this as I watched the movie I\ntried to decide what I would give it, I decided on 8, however, as I\nwatched the scene were I discovered the two son's were friends years\nlater I decided for a nine as my mind was blown. The only reason it was\nnot a 10 were some minor things along the movie, and I believe that\nvery few movies are worth full marks.\n"
"\nThere are few films that can grab me the way 'The place Beyond the\npines' did, I believe the script is so well written that the characters\ndo not feel to be just characters anymore, and I don't feel to be part\nof the audience. This film will grab you and take you on a roller\ncoaster. It truly is a credit to Derek Cianfrance's ability to not just\nwrite, but to create. Credit is also due to the actors in this film for\nan excellent portrayal of what Cianfrance had envisioned. It is truly a\nbittersweet shame that this movie hasn't received the commercial\nsuccess it deserves. I recommend this film to absolutely anyone who is\ninterested in good cinema, particularly good acting and even more\nsuperb scripts.\n"
"\nAt first, watching the first half of the movie, I thought that the plot\nmust have been based of either a true story or a book that someone else\nhad written, as good movies tend to be nowadays. I was pleasantly\nsurprised to find that \"The Place Beyond the Pines\" is an original\nscreenplay - so that earns it some brownie points with me. Kudos\nCianfrance. This a great story, full of dramatic irony.<br><br>Ryan Gosling gives a powerful performance, and surprisingly so does\nBradley Cooper - well known for role in the Hangover. Cooper shows us\nthat he can do much more than comedy and plays the part of a rookie cop\ntorn between doing what's right and reaching for the top perfectly.<br><br>However, be forewarned that at times this movie is a long (and some\nmight find - painful) watch. The film runs for 2 hours and twenty\nminutes and after about the first hour, things kind of dull down in\nterms of action and focuses more on character and plot development.\nDialogue and scenes can be slow.\n"
"\nI had high hopes for this movie but it fell flat as a near total\ndisappointment. The only high point of the movie was Ryan Gosling's\nperformance, which came as a surprise because I watched it hoping for\nsomething interesting from Bradley Cooper, but his role will simply put\nyou to sleep. Unfortunately Ryan only appears in the first half of the\nmovie, and nobody steps forward to fill the vacuum. Thus the movie\nplays much as though there was a revolt half way through filming, with\nthe director and lead actor leaving, with a much less capable director\ncharged with completing the movie with a dispirited and decimated cast.<br><br>Bottom line: Not even worth the Netflix download time.\n"
"\nMotorcycle stunt rider Luke (Ryan Gosling) quits his carnival job\nriding the cage. He wants to start a new life with waitress former\ngirlfriend Romina (Eva Mendes) and their son. He starts robbing banks.\nHe tries bring a crib to his kid, but he ends up hitting Romina's\nboyfriend Kofi. He's on a head on collision with police officer Avery\nCross (Bradley Cooper).<br><br>It starts slow and doesn't get interesting until around midway. At 140\nminutes, it is a very long movie. It's a very slow build into something\nmore poetic. Director Derek Cianfrance tries to create a Greek tragedy.\nI wish he would trust that the actors could get across the required\nemotions without a prolong take. I don't need an action thriller, but\nthis movie could be more efficient. The Bradley Cooper part is\ninfinitely more compelling. The slow pacing in that part of the story\nworks much better. Then it jumps 15 years into the future. The slow\npacing strikes again. The two teens are well played, but it feels like\na third movie. By then, I want this whole thing to explode and wrap up.\n"
"\nI happened to like both Ryan Gosling and Bradley Cooper, and both of\nthem put in a good performance. However, the story is just not\ncompelling enough, nor totally believable. What kind of corrupt cops\nwould try to set up the son of a judge? Granted he was supposed to be a\nrookie, but a rookie with a law degree! And given the obvious\ndiscomfort and hesitancy of the supposed pawn, how did he ever manage\nto pull off that sting operation?<br><br>The first of 3 \"acts\" was by far the best. Yes, people living at the\n\"fringe\" can still have a conscience, showing decency and goodness,\neven though they have been dealt a bad hand. A similar theme underlies\nthe director's other collaboration with Gosling in \"Blue Valentine\",\nwhich I like much better than this one.<br><br>Worth mentioning is the character of Jake (I think, the one who took\nLuke in and brought him into the bank robbery capers in the first\nplace). He tried to stop Luke from destroying himself, but who could\nstop a runaway train?\n"
"\nThe trailer would lead you to believe this is an action movie\nsurrounding a guy on a motorbike who robs banks.<br><br>While the first half of the movie does surround the bank robber, the\nactual action is few and far between. Just when it really gets going\nit's over.<br><br>The remainder of the film is an action free drama with predictable plot\n'twists'.<br><br>Either make an action movie or make a drama. Don't try to mix the two.<br><br>The plot twist near the end had been glaringly obvious for the previous\nthirty minutes and you are just waiting for it to happen.\n"
"\nI'm not one to get emotional during a lot of movies but The Place\nBeyond the Pines hit that sweet spot for me.<br><br>Going into this movie with no knowledge of it was the best way I\ncould've watched it the first time. The Place Beyond the Pines is a\nmovie with such a well written story line that it makes you think it's\nabout one thing until the story unfolds and you realize that there is a\ndeeper message within the movie. This movie depicts torn relations\nbetween fathers and sons in a whole new way.<br><br>The Place Beyond the Pines is a suspense-filled, emotional master\npiece.\n"
"\nI think the movie was great in terms of screenplay and script. The\nfirst half of the movie is too interesting with Ryan Gosling and his\nmotorcycle mania. Eva acted good too as a supporting character but then\nwhen Bradley Cooper comes into the show and the movie loses its pace.\nBradley is a great actor and he did very well but somewhere I think\nJake Gyllenhaal could do it more precisely. The story gets a bit messy\nwhen Bradley's character get into trouble between the corrupted cops, I\nthink Jake would have been an excellent cast in this role. Jake\nGyllenhaal was great in Prisoners as a cop and I think he would have\nbeen excellent non the less it was a good movie, it had some sort of\nmystery from the beginning.\n"
"\nThis movie takes you on a ride not quite many others. The story starts\noff with a struggling motorcyclist (Ryan Gosling) who is trying to win\nthe love and trust from his ex-girlfriend (Eva Mendes) and newborn son.\nGosling finds himself going to extreme measures to do this when he\nmeets a man that he would later devise a plan to rob banks with. After\nsome success he is later caught as he tries to rob too many banks at\nonce. The cop (Bradley Cooper) shoots and kills Gosling and an entire\ndifferent storyline is presented. Cooper is faced with the tough\nsituation of being portrayed as a hero and avoiding what dirty cops do\nwith the money that was compromised from the robbery. The movie then\nprogresses 15 years later and a successful Cooper is now faced with\ndealing with his rebellious son who later would become best friends\nwith the son that Gossling had.\n"
"\nWe watched this film last night - not really knowing to much about it.\nat 2 hours 20 minutes it's quite long. as said previously - it's a 3\n'act' film, which all comes together in the end. I love the 'feel' of\nthe film. reminded me a little of 'crash' the way you have several\nstories all going on that all come together in the end. there were\ntimes during the film - that i found it quite uncomfortable to watch,\nbut when the movie picks you up - boy does it thrill. there are times\nwhen it's really slow also - but stick with it. the music in the film\nis brilliant, especially the track used for the end titles. This is a\nfilm - i'm glad i've seen - but not sure if I would buy it for my movie\ncollection. would I recommend it?? - absolutely - but stick with it...\ndon't give in and you'll be rewarded in the end.\n"
"\nGreetings from Lithuania.<br><br>\"The Place Beyond the Pines\" (2012) is easily on of the best motion\npictures of 2013. This movie kept me glued to the screen from the\nbeginning till the very last end. Simple, yet very interesting story\ntold in non typical way. I won't spoil anything, but would like to\nrecommend you to see it without reading any synopsis - you will be\nblown away by storytelling itself. Flavless direction by Derek\nCianfrance. Great acting by everyone involved, all actors did great\njob. Writing is superb, realistic and very involving. <br><br>Overall, 10/10 for \"The Place Beyond the Pines\" - very good story told\nin amazing way, after seeing this picture for a second time, i felt\nlike i just read a good book - thats a extremely rare thing in cinema.\nHands down, this is easily on of the movies of 2013 - shame on you\nAcademy for not giving even single nomination to this superb picture.\n"
"\nhmmm, so i dint get a chance to see this film immediately. When i was\nin redding California i almost got to see DRIVE while at the stardust\nmotel, but it cut off. I forgwet what film it was where ryan was\namongst steve carell but i think it was more than once..if im right\nunless the other time was when he steve was with m wahlburgh, whatever?\nso, here we see a robbery. very dreamy, seemed kind of easy. He shrieks\na bunch, ryan gosling. the c ops chases him finds him and then has\nweird feelings after the attempted arrest. its over....but maybe\nnot...emotions and loss and identity towards desperation bring our cop,\nmister bradley on a reimbursement like agenda even though it seems the\nforce coexisting ray liotta has intent on pursuing this situation 100 %\nand its not bad, the vocabulary and interaction seems seedy and\nridiculous but it wasn't dressed up that way. time passes and the\ngeneration of heroics versus crime becomes misinterpreted through more\nleadership,consequence and confusions....making this a story that sort\nof became a sequel in one film.\n"
"\nI really enjoyed this movie. I could not pick Ryan Gosling out of a\nlineup before I saw this movie, but I thought his performance (minus\nthe high pitched squealing during robberies) was fantastic. His\ncharacter had a quiet energy and even though he didn't speak all that\nmuch I think he was the star performance in the movie. I was sorry to\nsee him die with all that movie left. The other performances were\naverage and the story was OK, but Gosling really shined in his brief\nappearance. The story had a sort of \"domino effect\" to it with\nconsequence after consequence resulting as effect of the first part of\nthe movie. Moderately unique, good acting and a decent story. Not\ngreat, but better than most of the movies I see these days 8/10\n"
"\nThe first act was visceral, grabbed you by the throat in the opening\nsequence and wouldn't let go. <br><br>As first acts go 10/10. <br><br>Then Gosling dies. <br><br>Not in any special way either. He jumps out of a window. <br><br>Then bradley cooper's rookie cop turns up and everything becomes a\nmess. <br><br>I tried to make sense of what the director was trying to achieve, maybe\nhe was making some kind of elusive elliptical point. <br><br>He should have just stuck with expanding on a brilliant first act. <br><br>Real shame. But it is worth watching for Gosling alone.\n"
"\nDerek Cianfrance is easily one of most talented young directors today.\nThis picture is so goddamn ambitious I can't even handle it. Do all of\nits aspects work, maybe not, but they come real close. Soundtrack and\nmusic, out of this world!!! The best I've heard that utilizes\ncontemporary electronic music like witch house to its advantage. Sean\nBobbit cinematography really, really impressive and very memorable. To\noperate in a spaghetti western changing of the protagonist style is\nvery clever for the time and you don't see it often. The film was just,\njust slightly off point but it was so close to being unbelievable. Its\nthird act was most likely its downfall. I liked it, but it was way to\nnaturalist after what we had seen previously. Still, an amazing try at\na very contemporary picture for the masses. I can't wait to see what\nCianfrance does next\n"
"\nI mean wow what a terrific film. There's many great things about this\nfilm.<br><br>The acting and the cast is great. Bradley Cooper should have a Oscar\nfor this film. Even Eva Mendes is good in this film and you don't see\nthat everyday. Everybody acts real and feel like real persons. There's\nno big acting moment like in a typical Oscar film, it was very subtle\nto know what emotion the characters feels. the story itself is\nbasically three films in one, and that's not a bad thing because each\nact is solid in there own way. The cinematography is great and doesn't\nfeel like a typical Hollywood film. <br><br>the only complain i had that is kinda predictable at points but that's\nnot the problem of the film that's me watching too much films.<br><br>This is a great drama with a excellent cast. i really recommend this\nfilm. even you're not going to like it, just see it. But you probably\nwon't be disappointed.\n"
"\nThis story started out as you would expect a good drama to start out.\nIt moved through some initial gut wrenching human drama, then chugged\nalong through some middling 2nd act narrative, and then dropped like a\nrock into \"ok, so what was that all about?\"<br><br>Make no mistake - a lot of stuff happens in this film, but the problem\nis, it's not clear by the end who protagonist is and what his struggle\nis. Hence, I don't care AT ALL about the film or the characters IN the\nfilm.<br><br>What makes it even worse is they cast an absolutely detestable, skeevy,\nweirdo in a major role about 1/3 of the way into the story. The writing\nfailed here, big time.\n"
"\nAfter watching the movie i was very much impressed by the way the story\nhas been scripted. Casting was too good. Ryan and Cooper perfectly\nsuits the character and they have lived them.<br><br>The only thing that was out of the place is that the movie was a bit\ndragging but it is understandable. You've to be patient cauz the movie\nwill surprise you at the end. The director needs a big applause for not\ndisappointing the viewers in the climax.<br><br>But if you were expecting any nail biting action scenes pls avoid this\none . There are some scenes that will push you to the edge but sadly\nthey are predictable. <br><br>This movie gets the rating mainly for its story and screenplay. They\nwere too good. Watch it you'll like it !!!!!!!!!!!!\n"
"\nI was pleasantly surprised by this film because it got a lot of mixed\nreviews from people I know, so I was a little apprehensive about seeing\nit. On that note, I'm glad I did and I would definitely recommend it.<br><br>All the characters are entwined and the story comes full circle which I\nliked. Personally, I liked the actors chosen for the parts they played.\nBradley Cooper always seems like the sweet, honest do-gooder and Ray\nLiotta, well he's a great bad guy. I loved Ryan Gosling as Luke, I\ndon't think anyone else would've done that role justice. Dane DeHaan\nwas most impressive as Jason.<br><br>When you watch this, you find yourself cheering for Luke and wanting\nAvery Cross to be punished, but by the end of the film, you feel\ncompassion for Avery especially when Jason finds the photo of his\nfamily in Avery's wallet. <br><br>In the end when you see Jason ride off in his newly purchased bike,\nknowing he is trying to be like his father, you know the story has come\nfull circle.<br><br>I found it to be a compelling story of tragedy, morality, denial, greed\nand desperation.\n"
"\nWhat really caught my eye about \"The Place Beyond the Pines\" is how the\nfocus shifts as the movie progresses. First it's about Luke, then it's\nabout Avery, lastly it's about the sons. Moreover, in each case you\nwant the focused-on character to achieve his goal even if it's\nsomething ethically questionable. It's as though director Derek\nCianfrance - who previously directed Ryan Gosling in \"Blue Valentine\" -\nis playing with the audience, much like Alfred Hitchcock did with\n\"Psycho\" (which also shifted its focus from character to character,\ngetting the audience to root for each character). The result is a very\ngood, tense movie, one that progresses at just the right pace to let\nmore and more of the story develop. I recommend it.\n"
"\nI watch a lot of movies and this is one I will remember and recommend\nothers to watch! In the beginning I thought it was going to be\nromantic, cause beautiful Eva appeared, but it is raw and real, very\nreal! One of my favorite movies of this year, definitely.<br><br>Ryan Goslings' character is dark and intriguing. Hes an \"outlaw\". His\nclothing, his manners and neurotic behaviour are so well thought\nthrough and eventually performed by Ryan. He is great at it. Bradley\nCooper is a totally different actor. I was curious to see them\nperforming together and what kind of movie it would turn out to be. <br><br>I have a coupe of favorite actors I can always watch. Ryan Gosling and\nBradley Cooper are on that list and again they lived up to that\nexpectation.\n"
"\nThe Place Beyond the Pines <br><br>Honestly, the best business to build beyond the pines would be a\ntoothpick/chopstick/canoe paddle factory.<br><br>Unfortunately, this drama doesn't even consider clear-cutting the\npines.<br><br>When Luke (Ryan Gosling), a traveling circus stunt motorcyclist, learns\nhe has a son with Romina (Eva Mendes), he quits the big top and begins\nrobbing banks on his bike to support him.<br><br>After one heist, Luke's accidentally killed by a beat cop Avery\n(Bradley Cooper), who is branded a hero by his superior (Ray Liotta).<br><br>Fifteen years later, Avery's running for office and his son AJ (Emory\nCohen) is getting into mischief with Luke's boy Jason (Dane DeHaan).<br><br>Though a finely acted account of fathers and their influence on their\nsons, Pines' is also a solemn saga that struggles to segue from\ncrime-caper to family epic.<br><br>Incidentally, if you were to rob a bank with a circus-owned vehicle,\nwouldn't a clown car be more logical? <br><br>Yellow Light<br><br>vidiotreviews.blogspot.com\n"
"\nJust watched this and I have to tell you, it's very good.<br><br>It would be easy to think that it is about bike chases and bank\nrobberies, to a degree it is but it also tells a greater story about\ncause &amp; effect, ripples through time and how every action has a\nreaction now and in the future.<br><br>It is told in one film but it feels more like 3 and each segment could\nbe a whole new film, in it's own right, the cast all do a good job,\nalthough for me Ryan Gosling gives the best performance and you really\nempathise with his character, almost to the point you forgive his sins.<br><br>It is quite long and does slow a little midway but it is never boring,\na thinking persons film.<br><br>I enjoyed it and I think it will stay with me for quite some time...<br><br>A justified 9/10\n"
"\nI am going to start out by saying that this film is beautiful, in every\naspect. The cinematography, direction, acting, and writing are superb.\nThis film is not your average heist movie, it is much more than that,\nit is about consequences, not only of yourself but to those who\nsurround you, this was certainly exposed in a variety of ways. Ryan\nGosling, Bradley Cooper, Eva Mendes, Dane Dehaan, and Ben Mendelsohn\nwere all spectacular. These are the performances we live for. Derek\nCianfrance is one of those directors who you can trust to make it\nhappen, captivating audiences with storytelling. Place Beyond the Pines\nhas easily become one of my favorite films of the year. It's\nsimplistic, non flashy, gritty film not regularly found in a heist film\nis a refresher. It brings you in to the real world of what someone like\nLuke would do, how far they would go for their loved ones.\n"
"\nWhile living his abundant life, being a stunt biker and adrenaline\njunkie moving from town to town with a traveling circus, he suddenly\ndiscovers something that will change his life. Robbing banks to save\nenough money for his son, he eventually ends up face to face with a\nheroic cop. The years go by and the heroic cop has a breakthrough in\nthe political world. His grown up, teenage son coincidentally happens\nto become friends with the heroic cop's son. It doesn't take long\nbefore he begins to inquire about his dad and soon finds out about the\ntroubled life he has led.<br><br>This movie is a perfect mixture of action and drama, containing a\ngripping story.\n"
"\nThis is an amazing movie stuffed with intense emotional drama. This\nhappens to be the first movie I have seen from writer-director Derek\nCianfrance and I can say for sure he is a very talented guy. All the\nactors gave powerful performances in accordance with the brilliant\ndirection. The ones I liked in this flick are certainly Gosling and\nCooper. You all may have seen Bradley Cooper in action packed and comic\nroles. See this one and you will know how emotionally powerful he can\nbe. Ryan Gosling is maturing as an actor as well. Although, his\nsemblance is concise, he intensifies the screen with his presence. Eva\nMendes is superb in showing her sentiments flowing. One other young\nactor who shines is Dane DeHaan. I saw him in Lawless and Chronicle.\nHe's gonna go very far if he continues in this fashion.<br><br>The story is fairly acceptable but the main focus of this movie is the\nacting. It sanguinely shows that we can never turn our back on fate.\nFate has its own way of grooming us.<br><br>Probably, one of the best dramas I've seen lately. <br><br>A must watch. 8/10.\n"
"\nIt was erroneous of me to expect a film experience similar to \"Drive\"\nand the experience was very mixed.<br><br>On the one hand, I cannot deny the effectiveness and depth of the\nstoryline - robber who wants to provide for a lover with his child and\nthe altercation with some corrupt police officers - especially when it\nwas made one run through generations and how by killing off the main\ncharacter soon in the film proved a risk worth taking.<br><br>Despite the promise, this project did not bring home the exhilaration\none has come to expect from the great crime movies. It felt as we saw\nthe end titles in anticipation mode and asked ourselves \"was that it?\"<br><br>Much as Gosling carried the film with great skill, Cooper was just\nswimming out of his waters; just because he got noticed for utilising\nhis good looking boy persona in the \"silver linings\" does not make him\na good choice for a crime/drama film.<br><br>Concluding, I would call this a film of promise but not of fulfilment.\n"
"\nEva Mendes is not only beautiful, but also a great actress. Something\nthat also can be said about Mr. Cooper and Mr. Gosling. While Blue\nValentine (same director) did concentrate on a single relationship (and\ntwo people), this is a wider look on relationships and consequences of\nsome actions people take.<br><br>Just because someone is doing a bad thing, does not make them a bad\nperson. Same goes for a person with a badge (police). The movie will\nnot give you easy answer and might take away a few things early on,\nthat might be surprising (if no one has told you that is). But the\nemotional impact should be a really strong one. If you can bare to sit\nthrough it, it will be worth your while\n"
"\nThis movie was very unique to me. I haven't seen any movie play out\nquite like this one does. The story line is very good with a great\ntwist at the end that everyone will love. Although this movie had a\ngood story line, the reason I gave it an 8 out of 10 was for the way\nthe movie is written. It has 3 main segments to it that has a new main\ncharacter, but it all comes back around at the end. Most movies stay\nwith the same main throughout the film, and the way this one takes on\nalmost an entirely different movie between segments is fascinating and\neven though the movie is long and sometimes drawn out, it keeps your\ninterests throughout. I strongly suggest watching this movie, you will\nnot regret it. The creativity is superb.\n"
"\nThe is a multi generational saga. It's surprisingly engrossing - even\nthough it's not an action movie it's quite tense. Not what you'd expect\nsome surprising things happen. The story is well written and doesn't\nhave clichés. There are no clear heroes and villains. Everyone is\nflawed and human exhibiting nobility and bad choices.<br><br>Ryan Gosling is convincing as a motor cycle stunt rider turned bank\nrobber. For a leading man he isn't afraid of looking ugly which is why\nhe can take on so many different roles. Bradley is good too as a\ncop/lawyer. Eva Mendes acts as well in drama as comedy. The grief and\npain are so clearly etched on her face it's quite memorable.<br><br>Worth a watch.\n"
"\nAfter the first 20 minutes I was expecting 2 hours of high speed pure\nentertainment! What happened next we a complete unexpected change of\npace! Ryan Gosling is fantastic in what ends up being more of a Cameo\nthan anything else.<br><br>Even though the pace changed and the film became more thought provoking\nthan anything else I did enjoy it. The performance of Dane DeHaan was\nreminiscent of The Chronicle and brought some class to the end of the\nfilm. Change of pace for Bradley Cooper compared to the lighter roles\nhe usually plays, enjoyed his role throughout and am hoping for similar\nperformances from him in the future!<br><br>Worth a watch if you have 140 minutes to kill!\n"
"\nI am writing this as the credits from this film are playing in the\nbackground. <br><br>First, let me say, it was amazing. I went into this film blindly. I\nmean I saw all of the commercials and read other reviews but I had no\nclue what to really expect. It took a while for me to finally watch the\nfilm and I'm glad I did. <br><br>The plot is filled with stories of the lives of people living in\nSchenectady, NY with unique time line twists. You're not just following\none person, the director takes you through the lives of every character\neffortlessly. It's almost as if you're walking with them through their\nlives, forced to feel every private emotion that they feel.\n"
"\nThe movie started with a very exciting history with this stunt rider\n(Ryan Grosling) who quit his job and start robbing banks in order to\nprovide for his 1y old son, who he lately find out about. But suddenly\nafter 45 minutes, the movie switch completely and turns into another\nfilm about a rookie cop who deals with corrupt colleagues and then it\nfast forward 15 years to show a new history with the stunt riders child\nwho had grown up.<br><br>It was like watching 3 different movies, but at least the third part\ntracks a bit back to the beginning history which was the part I liked\nmost!<br><br>A complete movie with Ryan Groslings character would've been a great\n10* movie. In 40 minutes the movie has build up excitement and\ncompassion for the stunt rider, which is why it is so sad it suddenly\nchanges direction.<br><br>But due to the great acting it still score 7 stars overall.\n"
"\nIn this movie we can watch a really great interpretations made by Ryan\nGosling and Bradley Cooper. To be honest I did not like the\ninterpretation of Eva Mendes because I think that she did not do her\nbest in compare with other interpretations of her.<br><br>\"The Place Beyond the Pines\" is a modular movie which has to do with a\nmotorcycle stunt rider (Ryan Gosling) who becomes a bank robber because\nof his economical issues. Eva Mendes plays as her girlfriend and\nBradley Cooper as a police officer.<br><br>Finally I have to tell you that when movie started and during its\ncontinuation it was really good but after the second hour of it, it was\nnot as great as the beginning.\n"
"\nThis film really had me interested from the first few minutes all the\nway to the end. It really showed an intimate image of fragile\nrelationships and how the choices we make changes both our lives and\nthose closest to us. <br><br>Ryan Gosling is one of the the greatest actors in the last couple of\ndecades in my opinion. Not that he acts in any specific way. He just\nseems to be the character he portrays. <br><br>A lot of emotions in this film. It made me think about how we just got\nthis one life given to us and how important it is to make the best of\nit. We're so powerless over the choices we make. <br><br>A really great film.\n"
"\nWhen my wife brought home this film with the dippy title, I was\ndreading another teenage horror flick. But I was wrong. If you're tired\nof all the formula flicks this may be just the right one for you. There\nhave been a number of past films with three or more stories, some\nconnected, some less so. But this film is (to me at least) unique in\nthat it follows one protagonist for a time, then switches to follow\nanother, and finally winds up following still another. All are of\ncourse closely connected, so you always know you're watching one story\nunfold as the film progresses. Everyone does a good job in the various\nroles and while the pace is measured, the film is always beautifully\nfilmed and keeps you watching, trying to guess what's going to happen\nnext. It's hard to describe much of this without getting into spoilers,\nand I don't want to do that. Some may find the storyline a bit\ncontrived and predictable, but on the other hand, done differently it\nprobably wouldn't have been so satisfying. A thoroughly enjoyable film.\nI give it a thumbs up.\n"
"\nWhile \"The Place Beyond the Pines\" may sound like the name of a steak\nhouse in the middle of the Pacific Northwest, the film proves to be one\nof the most emotionally powerful and dramatic films I've watched in\nawhile and may be the best drama I've seen in 2013.<br><br>The story is just drenched in human turmoil and emotion and was a\nlittle different that what I expected when I sat down to watch it but\nwas more than pleasantly surprised with how engaging and enthralling it\nwas. Not to mention the film is presented in a terrific, gritty way\nthat made the film feel real and authentic.<br><br>Finally, the performances are just incredible in it. Gosling and Cooper\nwere two actors that were pretty much expected to deliver with their\ncharacters (and they did...and better than they usually do--and they\nusually do great!) but I was surprised how great Eva Mendes was and,\nmore so, how amazing Dane DeHaan was.<br><br>Overall, the movie is just a prime example of how great a drama can be!\n"
"\nInteresting premise, solid acting, good cinematography. The pieces are\nall there. And as a mini -series, it might have worked. But why write a\nnovel in an era of comic books?<br><br>Director Derek Cianfrance approached this movie like a bored student\nwith a checklist and a Tablet. Infidelity. Check. Unemployment blues.\nCheck. Orphaned kids. Check. Broken families. Check. Depression,\ncorruption, gun violence, jail, bank robbery, financial challenges,\nracial tension, single mothers, political cynicism, drug culture, teen\ndisillusionment.... All checks. Oops forgot the Tats. Double check.\nThrow in abortion, gay rights and space aliens and all the issues of\nthe age would have been covered in 2 minute sound bites. <br><br>How do you cover so many topics well in one movie. Umm, Derek, you\ndon't. <br><br>Kudos to the director in a McMovie age for trying to do something\ndifferent. But at the end of the day, the movie was scattered, shallow\nand unsatisfying. And for me, 2 hours and 20 minutes not well spent.\n"
"\nThis is the most interesting, memorable and chilling movie of the year\nso far.. !!<br><br>\"The place beyond the pines\" is a another excellent movie by the \"Blue\nValentine\" director Derek Cianfrance.. He wrote and directed this movie\nand i'm glad to say that he nailed it again.. !! This movie is absolute\nbrilliance. Ryan Gosling as Luke is really good,He's such a different\nactor and Bradley Cooper does his job nice. so far i think it's the\nbest acting performance by Eva Mendes. This movie explores about\ncouple's relationship and relationship between fathers and sons. It is\ndelivered in a brilliant way !!<br><br>It is really sad that very less people watch these movies and it is not\ncommercially acclaimed. But still the best of 2013 so far.\n"
"\nWhen I noticed the length of this film, I thought how can a bank robber\nfilm be that long? Well is my title, '' film with in a film'' the bank\nrobber story is just the prelude to a great story! <br><br>I rarely give a film a 10 out of 10, as most films these days are dumb\nremakes, have been done before. or are just badly casted, not this gem!\nI won't go into the story line, but it has a fantastic line of actors,\nit is well directed, flows at a great pace for a long film, and in my\neyes is one of the best films I have seen for some years.<br><br>10 out of 10 for me, HI5<br><br>And here is some more text to get my short review onto IMDb, I just\ndon't need to ramble on for a great film like this!\n"
"\nThe story depicts the chronicles inter-crossing a motorbike stuntman,\nwho chooses robbery to grope his child's happiness, with a young\npromising cop's life. Director Derek Cianfrance, once again, comes\nstupendously with a depressing family crisis plot likewise his previous\nBlue Valentine. Ryan Gosling makes a stout performance as the\nmotorcycle rider who is desperate to retain his family back. Bradley\nCooper, as the cop, brilliantly brings his essence to show inner\nstruggles regarding the events. Eva Mendes, Ben Mendelsohn, the two\nteen-kids also put their acting aptitude. The gloomy setting throughout\nthe film with excellent score definitely play a lot with emotions___\n"
"\nThere isn't a dull moment in this movie. Like one reviewer said already\nthis movie has three stories in it each linked with the other. There\nare some unique and uncommon emotions that are dealt here and this is\nnot a typical heist or crime flick like the storyline might suggest.\nThe first section belongs to the character played by Ryan the second\nsection of the movie revolves around the character played by Bradley\nCooper and the third section is about the sons of the above mentioned\ncharacters. Each of these section is strong and well written and well\nplayed out, like I mentioned there isn't a dull moment. This is one of\nthose underdog movies that will take you by surprise. Top notch\nperformance from Ryan Gasling, Bradley cooper, Dane DeHaan and Emory\nCohen. Congratulations to the producer and the crew. Well Done!\n"
"\nTypically I'm compelled to dissect a movie somewhat; comparing and\ncontrasting its anatomy, etc. Perhaps this tendency is due to the\nfriction those pieces cause each other when viewed as a whole or\nperhaps its my penchant for minutia. In either case to do so with this\nfilm is pointless; its pieces glide effortlessly together painting a\ncomplex tapestry of human causality while avoiding potential pitfalls\nsuch as rhetoric or overt opinion.<br><br>This movie is an opportunity to see your reflection; in that it does\nnot distort or attempt to distort the viewer's perception. A most\ncommendable achievement. Truly a stellar effort, cinema at its finest.\nHighly Recommended, Must See.\n"
"\nHaving been a Schenectady area resident my entire life, I had to see\nthis movie. That being said - perhaps I am biased, and perhaps also I\nam thrilled to see local places and names in a movie.<br><br>However amidst this I thought this movie was clever and very well\nwritten. Before attending the movie I read many friends reviews stating\nthat it was \"aweful\" and now I couldn't disagree more.<br><br>The character development and somber, but very realistic storyline of a\nrookie cop and his demons he now carries as a result of his duties -\nwere wonderfully done. A reviewer on this site said that Avery's sons\nportrayal as \"ghetto\" was unrealistic. As someone who works for a\npolice department - I see this a lot, so I disagree that it is an\nunreal scenario.<br><br>Not quite what the trailer surmised the movie to be, but a great story\nnone the less and would recommend it to anyone willing to sit and\nfollow a story for it's content, not for it's flash.\n"
"\nWith Ryan and Bradly, there certainly was enough eye candy. The story\nstarted off well, but slowed down and drizzled out. I didn't like any\nof the characters enough to care deeply about what was going to happen\nto them. <br><br>With bad cops/good cops, tough district attorneys, you would think\nthere would be more suspense.<br><br>The idea that this carnival worker who chain smokes, rides motorcycles\nand has tattoos all over his face is suddenly going to try to be a\ndaddy just because he lays eyes on his one year old baby is about as\nplausible as Ryan Gossling actually getting a face tattoo.<br><br>The acting was good. I am sure the book this movie was based on was\nmuch better.\n"
"\nTHE PLACE BEYOND THE PINES (2013) *** Ryan Gosling, Eva Mendes, Bradley\nCooper, Rose Byrne, Harris Yulin, Ray Liotta, Mahershala Ali, Ben\nMendelsohn, Robert Clohessy, Bruce Greenwood, Emory Cohen, Dane DeHaan.\nWell acted character study with a novelization approach from filmmaker\nDerek Cianfrance - who collaborated on the screenplay with Ben Coccio\nand Darius Marder - enables three acts concerning the tapestry of a\nmotorcyclist-cum- bank robber (Gosling, who teamed with Cianfrance\npreviously for \"Blue Valentine\", is excellent) after learning a\none-night stand (Mendes acquitting herself nicely too) has produced a\nchild to raise; a morally-challenged policeman (Cooper, in a wonderful\nbalance of right and wrong) with aspirations and consequences beyond\nhis realm; and the offspring of the two men years later with echoes of\nSteinbeck and O'Neill. Well-crafted if a tad too long in structure the\nfilm rolls along at a decent pacing with some sublime performances and\na great ensemble including the low-key Mendelsohn and a return-to-form\nby Liotta as a corrupt cop.\n"
"\nDon't care if I offend anyone, But \" The place beyond the pines\" has to\nbe the most overrated pile of crap this Year. It wouldn't have been so\nbad if they cut out the whole Ryan Gosling part and Just said the\nfather was a scumbag, Instead You get almost a full hour of that slab\nof meat mumbling trough the story and chewing up the scenery. Bradley\nCooper is always worth watching and does a fine job here with a limited\nsupporting cast. The sure fire banker in this movie, Eva Mendes ,\ncouldn't even give the kiss of life to this 120 minutes of tedium.. Do\nYourself s a real favor and watch some paint dry, At least You will\nhave something at the end of that.\n"
"\nI checked the cast and Ryan Gosling was in this movie , so ... i\nthought this has to be a good movie , and WOW i was so right. <br><br>i had no idea where this movie was going in the story . it went beyond\nusual film scripts i have seen lately. <br><br>nice surprise to see other famous actors show up suddenly, like Ray\nLiotta , and few more. <br><br>this movie was a big surprise for me. i knew it was gonna be good , but\nit was even better. the garage guy was a cool dude. Luke should have\nlistened to him. <br><br>yes this movie impressed me. as usual with IMDb reviews here i am sure\nfew people will say this movie was so bad etcetera. probably they\nprefer a Disney movie or a cheap horror . <br><br>you can't please everyone. even the best movie ever gets worst reviews.\n"
"\n6/10 on the Pig-O-Meter. I really wanted to like this film.\nUnfortunately, I did not. The acting was truly fantastic.\nCinematography was brilliant. It might be worth it, just for the\nperformances and the filming alone. The story? It could have been\ngreat! It should have been great! But, it was told so poorly. It was\n'coincidental' at best, and disjointed at worst. The pacing was\ndreadful. There is no reason to care what happens to any of these\ncharacters. This is not the actors fault. This all falls on the\ndirector (and I loved Blue Valentine). You will be better off renting\nthis 8 months from now, vs paying for it at the theater...\n"
"\nForgive me, my first review. This movie was hyped, great actors and\nreviews. I found it far too long and just not worth it. First 90\nminutes was good, but when the sons become the main characters just\nslow and tedious. Brad Cooper and Ryan Gosling great performances but\nthey cannot lift this movie.<br><br>There were some memorable lines (I'm am your father was a classic).\nRyan also looked hot.<br><br>I also found the camera work off putting the hand held jerky a,era\nadded nothing.<br><br>6 (6.5 at most). Flawed and over-hyped.\n"
"\nI thought this movie was great. It was basically 3 little mini movies\nin one. I love the idea of interweaving stories and all of that and\nthis movie kinda did that except in different acts. The leads in this\nmovie were fantastic. Gosling and Cooper had a great presence on screen\nand I believed their characters and acting. There were some very cool\ncamera shots in this that I absolutely loved. I especially loved Dane\nDeHaan (from Chronicle). He really played his character well and I\ncan't wait to see what else he makes in the future. I would definitely\ngive this a watch. It's got a love story, action, thrills, suspense,\ncrime, everything all in one movie. It could have been just a LITTLE\nshorter but the movie wraps up nicely and was a great watch. Now I want\nto watch director Derek Cianfrance's \"Blue Valentine\".\n"
