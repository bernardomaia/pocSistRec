"\nWhat a disappointment. Two hours of movie time passed like 10. The\nscript is terrible. It's kind of like when a 5 year old tries to tell a\nstory. \"And then the science lady goes to a different planet and she\nfinds an alien head but it's not really an alien head and she puts it\nin a bag and then she takes it back to the spaceship and the lady and\nanother science lady bring it back to life and the robot guy gets some\nalien blood and gives it to the science lady's boyfriend and then they\ngo to sleep together and the next day she has a baby inside of her so\nshe goes into the surgery machine and has the baby taken out but it's\nnot really a baby it's an alien and then she goes to save her friends\nbut then she goes back and finds out that the baby alien didn't die and\nkills the bald man\" And on and on. Zero suspense. A Golden Razzies\nlevel performance by Charlize Theron. Save your $$ on this one. It's a\nstinker.\n"
"\nThe irony is that while 'Alien' was a film with a modest budget that\ndesperately tried to use the available resources to pull off the look\nof an A-film, 'Prometheus' is a film with a monstrous budget that\ndoesn't even seem to aspire to rise above the B-movie level - with the\nexception of special effects.<br><br>Alas, 3-D glasses can never compensate for one-dimensional characters,\nand an experienced director cannot fix a poorly written script that\nmakes every screen writing error imaginable.<br><br>I guess what it comes down to is that god is a bald bodybuilder who\nnever says anything but instead punches everyone he meets straight in\nthe face. Don't mess with him!<br><br>By the way, the aliens in this film verge on silly. You don't want that\nin a horror film, much less in a film that wants to explain human\norigins. Can anyone explain the stupidity of the characters?\n"
"\nDon't get me wrong. It's gorgeous to look at, and I'm definitely going\nto go and see it again. It's really impressive.<br><br>But... It's stuffed with scenes without any payoff. Again and again it\nsets stuff up and then just... walks away from it.<br><br>In at least one unforgivably stupid scene, someone *literally* just\nwalks away from an antagonist and leaves it there. And then doesn't\ntell anyone about it. Some of it's really effective. There are some\nscenes that are absolutely gripping. But so much of it doesn't make any\nsense...<br><br>Having said all that I think it's very clear that what I just saw was\nPrometheus part 1. It's very definitely supposed to have a sequel and I\nwill certainly go to see the sequel. I think both movies taken together\nmight score a 10.<br><br>But this movie by itself doesn't.\n"
"\nPrometheus is one of the most underrated and misunderstood science\nfiction movies in recent memory. Do NOT view this as a prequel to\nAlien. It is part of the same universe, but while the first 4 are\naction/horror films, Prometheus is a sci-fi adventure that explores the\norigins of mankind. This concept is something I've always wanted to see\nput to screen, and Prometheus delivers so well that I'm enthralled by\nit no matter how many times I watch it. The cinematography and score\nare Oscar worthy, and the direction and visuals are near perfect. I\nbelieve Prometheus would be much higher rated if more people went into\nit with an open mind. The first Alien did have mixed reviews upon\ninitial release, and now it is an all time classic. I really think that\none day Prometheus will have the same status, and I hope the sequels\nare more appreciated.\n"
"\nMost of the bad reviews on here pretty much sum up my\nfeelings...especially where the leaps of logic are concerned.<br><br>I will sum up how bad this film is with one scene.<br><br>Years ago, I saw a comedy sketch where someone was about to be run over\nby a steam roller that was six feet away and traveling about 5mph.\nInstead of getting out of the way, this person just stands there\nscreaming for the entire duration the steamroller slowly approaches and\nrolls over them.<br><br>There is a scene in this movie exactly like that. Yet, instead of a\nsteamroller, its a space ship that crashes into the earth and then\nslowly rolls over someone as it topples over. Yes, a person gets run\nover by a spaceship in Prometheus. Not killed by an Alien or from\nexposure on an alien planet...literally squashed by a space ship.<br><br>And here's the worst part....this almost happens TWICE. Seriously Damon\nLindelof? You couldn't come up with something better than that?\n"
"\nShame on all who created this film. From the ridiculous story line to\nhorrible acting. On a side note, the costume designer shouldn't ever\nwork again. Do you really think that we will be wearing skinny jeans\nand platform clogs in 2094 when we are zooming through space and\nvisiting unknown planets? There were some scenes that were supposed to\nbe intensely serious and I burst out laughing at their absurdity. I\nkept waiting for the phallus-like creatures to start tap dancing on the\ntable, or the last living engineer to say \"Rosebud.\" <br><br>There were only 2 redeeming parts of this movie: The opening scenes\nwere like watching an IMax opening, and the acting of Michael\nFassbender was superb. I give him 10 stars. I want my money and two\nhours of my life back!\n"
"\nA beautiful opening shot followed by ridiculous non-science showing\nlife's beginnings, shortly after that our group of heroes awake after\ntheir long journey in space and start bickering. Really? They're on a\nTrillion dollar expedition and have never met before or been trained as\na team?<br><br>From there on it goes downhill into clichéd nothingness: the ice queen,\nthe big charismatic black dude who will save everyone, the impetuous\nscientist, the other scientist who chooses to believe in god (and given\nthis film was funded in America you know which god), the two bickering\nones who get killed first, the other two or three characters who may as\nwell have been wearing red shirts, and so on...<br><br>One star each for Michael Fassbender and the special effects, minus one\nfor the clichés and nothing else is worth a mention.\n"
"\nWhat can I say? I personally think Ridley Scott lost his mind or\nsomething terrible happened. I'm sorry to say this, but lately, all\nHollywood movies are bad, I mean bad in terms of acting, script, ideas,\neverything is going down. At some point, you should do something\nbecause otherwise, we would need another Hollywood soon. Special\neffects is not enough, really not enough and this movie doesn't have in\nmy opinion good special effects, and when it has plenty, the impact on\nthe viewer is low because of the bad acting and script. I'm sorry to\nsay this and to write this review, but it is true. The difference\nbetween Aliens and this one is huge. Almost 30 years ago and Aliens has\nbetter script, acting, plot, even special effects are better. This\nmoview was predictable with every step and no thrilling moments, none!\nI don't know what happens to your ratings and with all the people here,\nthe figures don't picture the reality. What can I say, wake up\nHollywood before it is too late!\n"
"\nI would rate the movie 1 just for its graphics. Pros: Nice Sci-fi\ngraphics.<br><br>Cons: (Never ending list..) Movie starts with a Robot wearing\nFlip-flop(Slippers) in a space shuttle..!! Hilarious..!! WTH..LOL..\nlead actress(Noomi) looks horrible through the movie.!! Lead hero dies\nin the middle of the movie without know how or why..!! why is the alien\nguy trying to kill humans..?? (No clue) why does the lead actress go in\nsearch of the creator of the aliens..that too alone and with the\nsupport of a robot head in her hand bag..!! ROFL..!! When a space ship\nin the shape of a tire comes rolling at you why would you keep running\nin its path..?? isn't it common sense to run in a haphazard manner to\navoid it running you over..!! LOL.. <br><br>This movie is probably the worst Hollywood Si-Fi movie i've even\nseen..!!\n"
"\nThis movie was not at all what I expected. I expected a somewhat\nintelligent script. No. This is nothing but a vapid, CGI, Hollywood\nfilm with a big explosion at the end. This will probably be the last 3D\nmovie I see. I loved the original Alien movie. If you did, you will be\ntotally disappointed by this one. It lacks everything the original had.\nThe characters are boring, the dialog is stupid, there is no suspense\nand no humor. Fans of the original will be wanting to learn more about\nthe alien world of the the original but you won't find that here. There\nare too many questions that are never answered. There is absolutely not\none original sci-fi idea in the script. I am so upset by how bad this\nfilm is that I want to write to Ridley Scott himself. Apparently all\nHollywood knows is CGI and BIG EXPLOSIONS. The movie obviously is going\nto have a sequel but they won't get my money. Fans of the original\nAlien film, PREPARE TO BE DISAPPOINTED BIG TIME. Save your money, watch\nthe original film.\n"
"\nA really good prehistory of the Alien series. The Movie reveals some\nambiguities from Alien (including how the Xenomorphs have emerged).<br><br>There is not much to say about the story. Towards the end of the 21th\ncentury, followed a research group of the Weyland company with the\nSpaceship \"Prometheus\" notices of extraterrestrial origins of the human\nlife. On the planet LV-223 thy found creatures inside of a mountain\nthat are the predecessors of the later Xenomorphs and the Horror\nbegins.<br><br>What bothers me is just something that the technique more modern is\nthan those from Alien, after all, its a prehistory.<br><br>But its a very good movie and I look forward to the second part.\n"
"\nThis movie was absolutely terrible. It has no plot at all they just go\nto a planet that they discovered from two researchers about our\n\"creators\" coming from another planet who in the end try to kill them.\nThis movie is very stupid and is not only a waste of money but a waste\nof time. The movie was a complete waste and ended horribly just so that\nthere could be a sequel by making Dr. Shaw get on another ship just to\ngo to another planet because the planet that they where currently on\nwas just a war experiment planet. The movie had a lot of random scenes\nthat tried to make the audience flinch to make the movie seem exciting\nor horror like but it back-fired and made the already terrible movie\nworse.\n"
"\nPrometheus lived up to my expectations. I was satisfied with the movie\nand would recommend it to all Sci-fi fans. Please watch the movie with\nan open mind and don't make the mistake of comparing it to past Sci-fi\nmovies.The special effects were excellent. Michael Fassbender as the\nandroid is the standout cast member.<br><br>There are some minor gripes. At two hours in length the movie seemed to\nbe too short; it should have been about thirty minutes longer. A longer\nmovie would have allowed for better character development. Some\ncharacters appeared to be superfluous and could have been omitted from\nthe final script. <br><br>Overall I was happy with what I saw and I was mesmerized by the alien\nworld that Ridley Scott created for his audience. Sci-fi is a genre\nthat allows us to escape the drudgeries of our earthbound existence and\nwonder at what might be. Prometheus did it for me.\n"
"\nAs the title says, after seeing two times this great movie, i just\ncan't really understand why there are many people who doesn't like and\nmore than that HATE this movie, in my case all the entire movie i got\nstick to the screen enjoying this fantastic movie experience, I liked\nthe argument, it's original, new stuff to explore in the sci-fi world.\nAt least 2 very emotion scenes that i remember (cant spoiler he he). If\nany people ask to me to recommend a very well made sci-fi movie i\nsurely recommend this one, and i really hope that could exist a sequel,\ni would love it.<br><br>And if you tell me, yeah we are a lot of people who doesn't like this\nmovie, that probes this is bad, ill tell you that good taste is not a\ndemocracy.<br><br>Thanks for this movie guys.\n"
"\n&gt;May Contain Spoiler&lt; This movie is the baddest movies i ever watched\nin recent years. It was so bad that while watching it, i laughed all\nthe way. It's quite unbelievable how stupid the character, that i\nalmost punch my TV. It's so bad that it became a nightmare to me until\nnow that's why i write my first review on movie.<br><br>I can accept weaknesses in some area such as plot or not too many\nunanswered question but to make a story or plot based on stupid\ncharacter which is supposedly clever scientist or geologist just an\nawful movie. This really insulted the audience intelligence.<br><br>The scientist is so stupid that they don't act like one such as no\nweapon allowed, opening the helmet in unknown environment, playing with\nsnake like creature in new planet just found, don't have proper\npreparation in assessing new situation such as the risk or danger they\nmay encounter. It's not just a stupid act, but make the scientist look\nvery unbelievably stupid. And that make the whole movie look\nunbelievably stupid!!\n"
"\nMission to Mars story told by a 7 year old. An opportunity to explore\nhumankind origins gets utterly wasted. The plot is ridiculously\nincoherent. The characters are never developed, the dialog is childish,\nthe ending is... pathetic.<br><br>--- SPOILER ---<br><br>Such a promising start with mesmerizing visuals and then... meet the\ncrew, a bunch of untrained mercenaries hired to manage a 1-trillion\nproject. Logical flaws abound, but I will not repeat what other\nreviewers have already said. My 18 yr old loved it, I can see why, my\nwife couldn't bare to watch after the crew is introduced. I stayed\nuntil the end in the hope that some philosophical angles could be\nintelligently explored... LOL!\n"
"\nI settled in my hotel room and switched on HBO to find Prometheus just\nbeginning. Checking IMDb, I found that it had 7+ stars, so I thought\nwhy not. Boy, what a disappointment! By the end, I was almost laughing\nexcept that I knew I would never get those two hours of my life back.\nFuturama is more compelling sci-fi than this!<br><br>The talents of many fine actors was wasted here - Charlize Theron was\napparently signed to look devastatingly beautiful and calculating,\nwhich she managed effortlessly. Michael Fassbender's role was laughable\n(such a waste). Indris Elba was apparently asked to affect a southern\naccent (tragic!). Noomi Rapace was able to generate a bit of character\ninterest, but it was all for naught when she put Fassbender's head\n(still talking) in her backpack, hence the Futurama reference. Awful,\nawful, awful, awful!\n"
"\nI am a big fan of the original Alien, but came to this film with no\nexpectations except one: I fully expected it to be good. Not great.\nGood. Heck, I would have settled for decent.<br><br>Thing that gets me is, they had me for the first hour and a half. I\nliked that it was meandering and slow. It reminded me of the original.\nIf only it was going somewhere...<br><br>Unfortunately, they begin with Alien and end with Armageddon. Worse\nthough, because Armageddon I could safely turn off after 20 minutes.<br><br>Over two hours, with no action to suck up the time mind you, and they\nstill couldn't come up with a remotely original or interesting plot?\nCouldn't develop a single character beyond a cardboard cutout? Not a\nsingle one! All those great actors wasted. And then the ending ticks\nevery cliché in the book down to projecting a sequel. No thanks Mr.\nScott.\n"
"\nFirst of all, this is my first review. I decided to post it because I\nhave never been so disappointed by a film....ever. I always wanted to\ncomment about some of the greatest, but never got around to it.<br><br>Well this time is completely different. I have to tell you about this\none.<br><br>We went in the theater we huge expectations. The house was SOLD OUT and\nthe rumors ( started by the fantastic trailer ) announced a stunning\nfilm.<br><br>We waited half an hour for the action to start. Nothing happened. The\nbest known actors were killed in the first 40 minutes. The acting was\nthat of a TV movie. The story is a very poor rip off ( he had Alien on\nhis mind ). The alien in the film is actually a very cute starfish.<br><br>Bottom line, we left the theater 4 minutes before the credits and heard\nbuuing because it left room for a sequel.<br><br>O please for the love of god....don't! I am a great fan of Scy Fy and\nFantasy and have been waiting for Prometheus with very high\nexpectations. This film changed my opinion on Ridly Scott. So, so...so\nBad.\n"
"\nThis movie is basically Alien 1 with updated visuals added and the\nfascinating antagonist removed. It generates a lot of expectations but\nnever follows through. It talks about this mysterious race supposed to\nhave engineered mankind, thus supposed to be of a superior intelligence\nand it keeps us in expectation of the dialog between it and the humans\nand the answering of their interrogations, such as \"why did they create\nus\", \"why did they want to destroy us\".<br><br>And in the end, all we get is a Prometeus acting like some dumb caveman\nkilling everybody first and not even asking questions later. Pure waste\nof time.\n"
"\nThe trailer was kind of annoying for one, but the movie was just awful.\nFor one, unlike most people it seems, I can't take it seriously. When I\nhear \"thought-provoking\" and \"plausible\" it's as annoying as I thought\nthe trailer was. <br><br>And two, as far as entertainment is concerned, I can be entertained by\nsome seriously bad films, but I wish time machines were real so I could\ngo back and not see this! However, I will admit that I am not really a\n\"sci-fi\" kind of guy. Although not for me, if you love this kind of\nstuff you will appreciate the fact that the \"aliens\" are not that\noutrageous looking green creature that is totally bizarre, but rather\nmore human-like in an attempt to show, I guess, that \"we\" share a\ngenetic lineage...again, not my \"cup-o-tea.\"\n"
"\nI'll say it straight away, the script was crap. Everything else was\nbrilliant! The acting, 3D, music, plot etc. were all great. <br><br>It lives somewhere between Alien and Aliens. With a beautiful opening,\nshowing the \"Creation\" of man. <br><br>The scenes involving the ampules were amazing and the \"surgery\" scene\nwas an immediate classic. The ending seemed to have been slapped on and\nwas a bit cheesy but the movie as a whole fits perfectly within the\nAlien universe and does not detract from the myth as it does NOT\nexplain the LV-426 derelict, it merely explains and I say explains\nlightly, what those beings were and what they did for mankind. <br><br>I hope that the Blu Ray release adds about 20 minutes back in so that\nthe characters are fleshed out a bit because on leaving the cinema, the\nonly thing I felt let down about was that the characters weren't given\nroom to breathe. (and of course, the crap script).<br><br>Don't go into the cinema with reviews in your mind, just make your own\nmind up.\n"
"\nInteresting enough concept but I felt it was handled rather poorly. The\nvisuals were stunning (but the 3D was weak) and it was great to see\nGiger's designs fleshed out a little more.<br><br>On the other hand, we have two young adults who have supposedly risen\nto the peak of their profession yet apparently haven't grown\nemotionally beyond being emo fifteen-year-olds. The interplay between\nthem was almost unwatchable and left me feeling the movie was\nintentionally dumbed down way too far. There's far too many minor\ncharacters to even start to sort them out or care about them. The plot\nis a confusing mess which several times veers off on tangents which\nthen whither and die without going anywhere.<br><br>And why not cast an old man to play an old man instead of using bad\nmakeup on a younger man? <br><br>Overall, it was deeply flawed but it was still worth going to see for\nGiger's art.\n"
"\nWhat to say what has not already been told. I can maybe talk about the\nstuff that annoyed me and left me clueless. - Safety on board is a\njoke. Every rule is broken and broken once more. Helmets off everybody.\nLets bring contaminated lifeforms into the ship to mention few. -\nScientist that has strange \"vice versa\" temper. Gets crazy about rather\nsmall thing but remains calm as ice when he should be screaming his\nhead off. Behavior of the characters is not believable. - Then comes he\nworst off the bunch is that the android head is still on the same\nlocation after the ship crashed, rolled half a circle and crashed again\ninto the ground. What a sticky head :) <br><br>Well on the more positive notes, the film is beautiful. I specially\nlike the shots from Iceland. For Alien fans this is a nice addition,\nbut be ready for a disappointment as I stated above. I give it six for\nit is nicely taken, David the android is well performed and it is quite\nexciting at times. <br><br>I recommend it as it is enjoyable feast for the eye.<br><br>Have fun. Signing out. Robbinn.\n"
"\nTo keep long story short the movie is two-fold. From one side it can be\nconsidered a reboot of the original film with all the gimmicks that\nmade the first film a cult, i.e. oral rape with men on the receiving\nend, childbirth, etc. But either they are done too explicitly or they\njust don't work the second time, but the overall experience is a flop. <br><br>The other side of the film tries to appeal to thinking man's questions\nlike where have we come from, whats the purpose etc., but there is\ndefinitely not enough substance to it; This part of the movie feels out\nof place. <br><br>Also events throughout the movie are poorly connected and undeveloped.<br><br>Yes, there are some nice special effects, but some of them seem cliché\nand a copy-paste from a number of different places ( ex.: the vehicle\nused to travel between Prometheus and the alien ship was pulled\nstraight from mass effect video games series, etc )<br><br>Not recommended.\n"
"\nI went to this movie with high expectations, hoping for something\nastonishing. But the movie was rather disappointing and pitiful. I was\njust hoping it would end sooner, and thought I wasted 2 hours and some\nmoney for this movie. The beginning was promising, so I hoped it would\neventually get better, but it didn't. Too many holes in the plot,\nterrible overall acting, and too many goofs. It seemed to me that the\nproducers wasted more money on the effects (which weren't that good\nthough), than on the plot. I just couldn't stand the plot holes. I\nwould suggest not wasting your money, and waiting for a DVD.<br><br>3/10 just can't give more.<br><br>I sincerely suggest not wasting your time.\n"
"\nUm, so basically to sum it up, this movie is worse than watching Miley\nCyrus act. I practically feel like slamming my head into a wall right\nnow. Prometheus was maybe the worse movie I've ever seen in my whole\nlife, other than Grease 2. The events that occurred were completely\nrandom and really did not go along with the plot. I mean, really, wtf\ndoes the doctor's baby have to do with the story at all? How could she\nbe running around after a C-section? What in the heck was her boyfriend\ndoing with his legs behind his neck after being killed? REALLY?! Going\ninto the movie theatre knowing what the plot was, I thought it would\npossibly change my beliefs about the beginning of life. I now know how\nmuch I believe in God. Dear lord. Don't waste two hours of your life\nwatching this load of crap.\n"
"\nRead some of the other reviews with low score for an in depth\nexplanation of why this movie sucks big time. As many of the others who\nloath this movie I also only signed up to say: Boooo! Sure, the movie\nstarts well enough, but soon goes down hill as the crew wakes up and\nstarts to vomit.<br><br>If I had written this script I wouldn't have shown it to any one, I\nwould have burned it. That Ridley Scott decided to direct it only\nconfirms that truth often is stranger than fiction. I hope he got well\npaid for staining his reputation for ever. As the movie - it just makes\nno sense.<br><br>As Spock of StarTrek would summarize it up: \"Illogical.\"\n"
"\nIt, was, a, waste.<br><br>It had the biggest plot holes I've ever seen in a movie. When watching\nthe movie you could predict about 95 percentage of what was going to\nhappen. <br><br>I actually started laughing at the main character when she started\ncrying because she was alone, it was just so... Pathetic. I don't know\nwhat happened in the middle of the movie but seriously? <br><br>Alien I loving robot, again? Plus I sure do love a zombie movie... If I\nwant to see nice terrains for 5 minutes I could just as well go hiking.\nThe scariest part during the movie was when my girlfriend got spooked\nby the surgery performed.<br><br>If it hadn't been for the animations and the details I would've thought\nthis was a b-film produced in India, only thing missing was some\ncitizen starting to dance with the snakes, which actually partly\nhappened - he just wasn't from India.<br><br>Anyhow, it's alright to watch as you'll be busy watching how beautiful\nthe landscape and animations are whilst the blonde gets a ship in her\nhead, fair play.\n"
"\nWhat a mess of a movie. It's basically ten botched episodes of\n\"Twilight Zone\" badly edited together. There's the movie about the cave\npaintings, the movie about the snakes in their helmets, the movie about\nthe vases, the movie about the storm, the movie about the exploding\nhead, the movie about the old man with wrinkles, the movie about the\noctopus in her tummy, the movie about the big aggressive guy, the movie\nabout getting back to Earth. I kept seeing characters getting killed\nthat I did not previously remember seeing in the movie. Well, I just\nwatched him die, but who is he? Did he have any lines? Basically, this\nis a movie about any random poop that fit into the CGI budget.<br><br>On the other hand, the music by Chopin was nice.\n"
"\nI saw this film twice on two languages  my native Russian and original\nEnglish. When I saw \"Prometheus\" first time, I had exciting experience.\nGreat visual effects, drawing, views  it was on highest level. Second\ntime I saw interesting story with different turns, good acting. Special\nacting is acting of Michael Fassbender, who acted robot David. He was\nbrilliant. Film gave us a lot of questions. When, how and who created\nus? Meeting with Creator is the greatest dream of our world. Author of\nthe film gave us own version of answer. Greatest race, Engineers,\ncreated humanity from its DNA. Price of this was the life of one of\nthem. May be, it was Prometheus  atlas, who kill himself for life of\nnext generation creatures  people. There are many questions without\nanswers. We are waiting next film.\n"
"\nExpected a lot better from such a renowned director and following all\nthe hype about the movie. I am very pleased I did not waste money going\nto the cinema . The plot was poor and predictable, the acting very\nwooden and some of the scenes involving a young woman leaping around\nhaving just undergone abdominal surgery, downright silly and humanly\nimpossible. I did expect something a lot better than this. I have\nstruggled with the 10 lines of things to say about this and also\nbecause the system did not want me to submit anything profane or\nspiteful - not being spiteful but this was slow and unwatchable in\nparts and I found myself contemplating the pile of ironing in the\nkitchen that needs doing . it was boring. Cannot imagine why this was\nOscar nominated - can understand why it didn't get any awards . I would\nnot recommend .\n"
"\nI give it a 1 only because there is no 0. I called and predicted this\nfilm's complete premise and outcome 20 minutes into it. If you've seen\nAliens, Aliens vs Predator and 2001, you've seen this film. A \"robot\"\nwho runs the ship on a long deep space mission (while the crew is in\nstasis) and is on his own secretive mission...(even having his head\nripped off, drooling a white substance while still talking)...to bring\nhome an incubated alien tissue; an alien that hatches from an egg-like\nurn, and attaches itself to the hosts face, with the Alien-esque teeth\nand the snake like impregnation into the host's mouth....which as in\nAVP, impregnates one of the super-aliens in the end (and when its\n\"born\" oddly enough resembles one of Ridley Scott's original Aliens).\nJeezus, give me a break. <br><br>Could have been so much more but the producer(s) saw a cheap\nthrow-together film with lots of hype - something I expect from Sy-Fy\n\"original\" movies.\n"
"\nPrometheus is both horrible and awesome. Awesome because I'm a sucker\nfor alien worlds. Great special effects and awesome world building.\nMichael Fassbender is wonderful as David. A good movie for 3D. But what\nwas Ridley Scott thinking? Some pretty bad dialogue and awful\nhorror/scifi clichés. I don't care for plot lines that only move\nforward due to one stupid decision after another. The viewer wasn't\ntaken on a journey of discovery. Instead, whole plot lines were\nresolved thru unexpected short dialogues. I could almost see Noomi\nRapace cringing...as if she new the dialogue was bad as she was saying\nthem. Despite the bad lines, Rapace acting is good. Because the\nPrometheus movie trailer was amazing, I expected a smart and sleek\nmovie. Am I glad I saw the movie? Yes. Am I disappointed? Yes.\nBut,perhaps my expectations were too high. If they had been lower, I\ncould have just enjoyed it for what it was. All that being said, I'll\nprobably see it again on DVD and if there is a sequel, will look\nforward to it.\n"
"\nAs a self-confessed Alien fan boy I've found it difficult to put down\nsome unbiased thoughts around Prometheus. After the first viewing I was\ndisappointed, I was expecting a direct Alien prequel and this isn't it.\nThe film was better second time as I could leave all my preconceived\nideas behind and enjoy it for what it is. There are some good\nperformances (particularly Michael Fassbender), some great set-pieces\nand for the thinkers it proposes some answers to the big questions: who\nare we and where did we come from. That's not to say the film is\nwithout its flaws, it has plot holes (what doesn't?), can be clumsy in\nits delivery and at points to fast paced. However, it's enjoyable -\nwhich is all you can really ask for and from me is praise indeed!\n"
"\nwell, i somehow looked forward to that film coz i generally like ridley\nscott films (esp. the alien movies) .... man was i disappointed... u're\njust sitting there for the whole film to evolve but it's far from\nhappening. the most action takes place when this one actress cuts out\nan alien from her womb, somewhere before or after that her boyfriend\ngets fried with a flamethrower by his own men and let not forget the\nstarship which gets shotdown and is rolling over the earth (quiet the\nfunny scene actually.. ;)) after that -&gt; cut / they get another\nstarship and fly away.. you'll get to see some kind of alienish alien\nin the last 2 seconds of the movie... well see for yourself or get to\nsee some better movie like the last batman which actually pays off...\n"
"\nI'm a huge alien franchise fan and I love scifi movies, especially deep\nspace horrors, but this one ... I can't believe what I just saw and\nwhat to make of it. The CGI and 3d were amazing, but the rest: - it's\nboring from the beginning - it's not an alien movie, it's not a horror\nmovie nor action movie. I can't classify it. - plot is really cheesy\nmost parts don't make sense - shallow dialogs, unbelievable characters\nand actions (for eg running after surgery, removing masks and many many\nmore) - no suspense AT ALL - the alien planet isn't even a bit scary\n(including alien craft)<br><br>Alien was so great because it was plain and simple. This move has\nambitions to be epic and profound but finishes like a B action movie\n(and a bad one). <br><br>that's it - really disappointing :(\n"
"\nI went into the movie thinking this was gonna be a great movie because\nof the excellent marketing campaign for this movie.The first half of\nthe movie held a tight grip on me,the second half was one wtf moment\nafter another.Plot holes and a bad script make the movie fall apart\nrather quickly and by the time the Alien was born at the end people\nwere laughing their butts off at how stupid it was.<br><br>The film was incredible to look at, unfortunately the plot was\nincredibly stupid.Almost makes the AVP movies look brilliant by\ncomparison.I cannot believe i paid $27 for me and my wife to watch this\ncrap.\n"
"\nOkay, so this is a big budget movie that purports to be some epic\nevent, but ten minutes into it, I wasn't sure if by accident, I was\nwatching some made for sci-fi channel low budget piece of garbage by\n\"The Asylum\". Their mission is the most expensive, the largest\nundertaking in the history of mankind, and these guys wake up from\nyears of deep sleep to immediately disobey orders, run around a\ncompletely uncharted alien planet without taking even five minutes to\nstudy the damn thing. Did they not hire any technical advisers? I just\nget really irritated when Hollywood types, producers and directors,\nhave zero clue about how things would have gone, and simply have the\ncharacters act like a bunch of idiot mitten screwballs, believing that\nthe kid doing the special effects will make up for the really, really\nbad direction and complete lack of technical advice.\n"
"\nI've read several reviews of this movie, but had to stop. They all\nremind me what a disappointment this movie was. Not only was it not\nentertaining, it totally disregards the legacy of the original Alien.\nThis is strange since Ridley Scott made both movies. The most annoying\nplot blunder in my opinion is that in the original Alien movie, the\nhumanoid alien is in the driver seat of the spaceship. In Prometheus,\nhe is killed on Shaw's ship?? Did Ridley Scott think people wouldn't\nnotice or not remember??<br><br>The ending of the movie was just weird. And there is no explanation for\nall the weirdness.\n"
"\nThe film was rubbish. It looked all shiny, but was rubbish. At no time\ndid I care for anything of anyone. Well okay, maybe the android David.\nThe script should have been thrown out. Dialogue was weak. Plot was\nshockingly bad. This was an insult to the Alien franchise. In order of\ngoodness, this is at the bottom. Yes, you read that right, even worse\nthan Alien 3. Oh it was shinier, but they should tell each viewer to\nleave their brains at the door and not to question anything, because\nyou'll be disappointed if you do. I can't believe the IMDb rating. My\nfear is now on the BladeRunner reboot. Just find some new material to\ndestroy. There are countless thousands of good scifi books out the.,\njust waiting for the cinema treatment.\n"
"\nWith the exception of Fassbender and Theron, the casting was very poor.\nThese actors had zero charisma. It was a mistake to not cast more well\nknown actors that don't need a lot of character development.\nFassbender's character development was the only attempt (Theron didn't\nneed it) and it worked. Guy Pearce would have been great if cast in a\nreal role. The young actor made up as an old guy NEVER works. Pearce,\nso strong in the trailer was totally wasted in this film. Maybe a\nprequel might be in store for him, that would be an excuse. The plot\nalso got a bit too coy, it was thought provoking but went overboard\ntrying not to be transparent and not explain ANYTHING (characters while\nbeing developed in a film often discover things with the audience...not\nin this film). Rapace was just awful, no way to compare her to the\nstrength that Weaver had in her many Alien appearances. Overall a\ndisappointment when there was such a good potential story with which to\nwork. Not a film I would want to see a second time.\n"
"\nMust be time for Ridley to retire - after creating a video game and\nmarketing it as a film! There is nothing redeeming about this effort.\nScript...terrible. Acting...often terrible. Character\ndevelopment...terrible. Ending...beyond terrible! This film was so bad,\nI may never watch anything from Ridley Scott again. What happened to\nMr. Scott's ability to create a masterpiece. He has been responsible\nfor several amazing films, thus I can barely comprehend this\nembarrassment. If I had to write one thing that could be a positive\nfrom it, I can only say that hopefully it will falter at the box office\nand minimize the chance of them making another one. One basic bit of\nadvice, if you're an intellectual, trust me and spare yourself from\nthis disaster...\n"
"\nAs a big fan of the Alien series, and of Science Fiction in general, I\nwent into this film slightly concerned that Ridley Scott would, after\nall these years, botch the job. And he did. This film was horrible.\nThere were gaping plot holes, the behaviour of the characters in the\nfilm completely illogical at times, and an overall weak story that is\nnever fully explained. Yes, the film is very pretty, and stunning to\nlook at. Yes, some of the acting is quite good. But as far as story and\nplot goes, this film is a disaster. An apocalyptic Sci-Fi catastrophe.\nAny Sci-Fi fan of Blade Runner, 2001, BSG, the original Star Wars,\nAlien, Aliens, will be let down on all fronts. In regards to Alien,\nthis film isn't as scary. In regards to Aliens, this film isn't as fun.\nVery disappointing. I had high hopes, and they were dashed.\n"
"\nWish we could get that moment back when we stood in the ticket queue\nand pondered whether we should spend $45 on this film. Damn, - wrong\ndecision.<br><br>Cannot comprehend how IMDb rating is 7.6 given all sane reviewers gave\nit one, and the very generous, gave it twos. <br><br>Buyer beware - it's stupidity has no bounds. <br><br>Truly a Ridley Scott fan......which makes it all the more disappointing\nto see such drivel. Special effects and gimmicks with zero substance.\nAn unworthy prequel to the excellent Alien. <br><br>Ridley are you out there? Give us a refund.\n"
"\nI went to this movie hoping for a revolutionary sophisticated new sci\nfi genre. Nope. This movie was written by the guy who wrote Lost and it\nwas just as pointless. It was like he crammed every theme you could\npossibly think of in the movie and then didn't even bother trying hard\non any of them. The characters were completely unrealistic. They don't\nseemed to be interested in the fact that they are the most important\nexplorers that have ever lived. Or that they have discovered the\ngreatest discovery ever. Or that there is a squid alien they just left\nbehind in the medical bay. They're all hostile toward each other for no\ngood reason. No one in the movie acts reasonably at all. If you take\nout all the visual effects, you don't have a movie. If you decide to\ngo, just bring your ipod and listen to music over it or something. They\ndidn't even put that awesome sound from the trailer in the movie!\n"
"\nI could go on about all the failings of this film but there are enough\nother reviews that do that. Without going into detail about the actual\nfilm ... This is a film with zero plot, very little explanation about\nwhy they embark on the trip, it produces zero empathy for the\ncharacters (essential in a film where you know some will not see the\nclosing credits), the characters themselves are not believable and\nthere is some pretty poor acting. There is an attempt at a bombshell\nbut it is so predictable that the dramatic pause leading up to it makes\nthe scene laughable. The only reason to see this film is if you like\nlots of CGI and the fact that it appears to be some rushed padding to\nset up another few films.\n"
"\nWhy did i see the reviews on IMDb and then go to the movies?<br><br>This movie is made only for those who appreciate quantity over quality.\nDon't get me wrong, the graphics were excellent. But oh dear god, the\nstory was so bad, so clichéd, I felt like killing myself and so did my\n3 friends i was watching the movie with. <br><br>Acting-wise they ranged from bearable to awful. I was rooting for the\naliens to kill them off than hear another dialogue from them. They are\nsupposed to be intelligent scientists, but they acted like dumb bimbos\nfrom some B-grade slasher flick. I was immensely disappointed with\nCharlize Theron, she is a wonderful actress, she let her talent waste\nwith this flick. <br><br>I have seen these aliens movie before, nothing new to offer except for\nthe wonderful visuals.\n"
"\nI HIGHLY recommend that you do not waste your money, and more\nimportantly your time, on Prometheus. I was Mind-raped by the Hollywood\nbraindeath administration again... Ridley Scott, you're dead to me.<br><br>It's hard to know even where to begin describing the idiocy of this\nfilm. A complete insult to anyone's intelligence. Worst acting I've\nliterally ever seen. Non-story composed of non-ideas with\nnon-dimensional characters. It's like Ridley Scott has alzheimer's\ndisease and all the writers, actors, and crew are trying to keep him\nfrom finding out so that they can still collect their undeserved\npaycheques. They should nuke this thing from orbit before it\ncontaminates this planet any further.\n"
"\nMuch like the series \"Lost\", Damon Lindelof started out with a great\nstoryline but was unable to conclude. The idea was good, but the\nexecution was poor! Again like \"Lost\" it left you with more questions\nthan answers, and the ending doesn't exactly suggest they will be\nmaking a sequel, so you're left wandering what the whole movie was\nabout. Visual effects wise the movie was excellent, and the actors did\na great job, but their was a clear lack of depth in the characters.\nOver- hyped movie and like Star Wars episode 1 it leaves you feeling a\nlittle disappointed. I would recommend waiting for it to come out on\nDVD rather than go watch it in the cinema.\n"
"\nThere were aspects of this film that blew me away. It was a great\nconcept but it's execution could have been so much better. The crew\nselected for this extremely important mission were portrayed as fools,\nunstable jerks and undisciplined morons, it's like they weren't vetted\neven to slightest degree. Would this occur in a similar undertaking? I\ndon't think so! How could Ridley be so blind to this, how could the\ncast in general accept these moronic roles? Ridley your opening\nsequence promised so much then the plot spiraled into lunacy. I would\nencourage everyone to watch this vehicle because it does make one think\nbut just keep in mind the execution leaves one wondering, at least it\ndid me, how the nonsense remained in the film? I do enjoy pondering why\nthe beings that seeded the planet are so upset with us! The one clue is\nthe 2000 year time period mentioned.\n"
"\nEh........... I saw this film the day it was released eager with\nanticipation. I then watched it last night again (a year later), I\nstill don't really know what to make of this film. First off, visually\nits stunning! People who say Avatar was don't know what they're talking\nabout! Blue people ain't visually stunning! Story wise it certainly\nraises a question or a dozen, I mean what was the story with that black\ngoo? And why were they're loads of squids? and how could that machine\nperfectly remove the alien from her???? Overall it is rather compelling\ntho, and has that horror factor that's associated with the original(not\nto the same extent obviously). Worth watching,Michael Fassbender is the\ndefinite man of the match with this film. Nobody else really stands\nout, the girl Noomi Rapace isn't bad, tho she is no Sigourney Weaver.\nIf your a fan of the franchise watch it (I mean after Alien vs Predator\nRequiem this is like the greatest film ever!) 6 out of ten I think, an\ninteresting and compelling film that is lacking in the most basic\nsense!\n"
"\nIs this some kind of joke by Ridley Scott? Answer big life questions? I\ndon't think so. I love the first two in the franchise and was bored by\nsubsequent ones taken over by other directors. So this is his big\nstatement? A mess of silly philosophy is what I saw not unlike what\nScientologists try to peddle. Bad computer animation/effects, a\nlaborious storyline and a grating female lead protagonist. No thanks\nbut I do give thanks that I didn't pay hard cold cash to sit through\nthis snorefest. In short, I found no redeeming qualities in this opus\nof excess and hope Scott realizes it's time to call it a career as well\nas close the franchise.\n"
"\nThe movie was great until they woke up the crew.<br><br>I just do not like movies where supposedly trained specialists make\ndumb decisions. The story is missing a lot of the plot to connect the\nstories on why some did some things.<br><br>I never understood the rationalization of the android doing what he was\ndoing along with most of the rest of the crew at the cave / ship\ncomplex and yet the moon had other ships too. When given a choice\nbetween doing nothing out of caution or doing something, they always\ndid something that usually ended up killing them.<br><br>It was hilarious that someone could go through a cesarean on machine\nonly designed for men (!) then with a belly stapled together was able\nto outrun and outlive everyone else.<br><br>One would think for a mission that cost a trillion dollars (maybe that\nwas not much in 2090's), they could afford a better crew and a ship\nwith living room size working spaces.\n"
"\nI saw this movie thinking \"this looks cool\" and I was disappointed. So,\na massively expensive space exploration goes under way, and a bunch of\nbumbling babbling baboons who often know hardly anything about science.\nAll I ask is why? Why did they have to do it that way, why is there\nhardly anything in the movie that's original? Example? Carnivorous\nspace creatures that wind up killing everybody by the end of the film.\nSound familiar? Try Apollo 18, Alien, Creature, etc. It's a story\nthat's been told many times, and it's not any more entertaining or\ninteresting the fifteenth time it's told. I was not pleased with this\nfilm at all. Even the acting performances weren't very good. Fassbender\ndid a great job playing an emotionless robot, but other than that, i\nsaw nothing special about this movie especially after all the\npre-release hype that it received. Final score: 4.2/10\n"
"\nI paid my money and now I'm gonna post my first review after years of\nbeing on IMDb. <br><br>This movie is flat-out awful. From the very start to the bitter end,\nits disjointed, poorly scripted, without direction and an utter waste\nof money -- to the viewers at least. I'm sure the industry profited\nfrom its production as I'm sure Ridley Scott made his pile of loot. But\nthe producer seriously ought to stand up in front of the audience and\nsay \"I'm Ridley and I now make lousy movies\". <br><br>The characters are superficial, unbelievable and given some of the\nworst dialog ever. I truly believe the master copy of the script fell\noff a table, the pages got mixed up and in their rush to start the\nmoney train rolling the producers just said 'the heck with it, just say\nwhatever lines you feel like.. I'm losin' money here talking'...'. <br><br>Don't see it. Don't waste your money. Rent the original Alien and enjoy\na tightly crafted imaginative flick that isn't a pretentious crap\ndumbed down to meet some strange audience demographic.\n"
"\nI remember Ridley Scott directing some great sci-fi movies in the past.\nWell... this starts as a decent sci-fi, but as soon they land to the\nplanet it turns to a some family drama and pointless walking in the\ndark. Nothing really happens, just horrified shouts, all the action is\nboring. So predictable twists on the plot that made me yawn, when I was\nsupposed to be excited and terrified... I think Ridley Scott should\nretire from sci-fi and make some good old time movies with a good\nstory. This movie is just waste of money and time. I'd rather see\nStalker and 2001-A Space Odyssey once again... This is like a James\nBond movie going bad; You only watch it once.\n"
"\nReally disappointed to say the least - I was expecting something epic\nand mythical to add to the canon of Alien and Aliens. Looks like Scott\nwas trying too hard and tried to juggle too many ideas at once; so the\nend result is a mish-mash of half-baked ideas and red herrings - just\nwhen you think you know what direction the movie's taking and you think\nyou've got it sussed, Scott will throw in another random idea that's\nunrelated to the other plot points before it that'll take the whole\nthing in a different direction. You'll be left wondering how the\ncharacters went from one plot point to another, for example; at what\npoint did Idris Elba and his crew actually realise the danger they're\nin and the imminent threat to humanity that they become so heroic as to\nsacrifice themselves? They were hardly involved! What was the purpose\nof Charlize Theron's character?? How the hell did the dead Engineer get\nfrom the shuttle wreckage back to his own ship to position himself for\nthe start of Alien? Overall, stunning visuals but this is a confused,\nmediocre effort.\n"
"\nidiots who complain about space explorers taking off their helmets on\nan alien planet know nothing about science. NOTHING. are you bill Nye\nthe science guy ? are you Dr honeydew from the muppets ? do you even\nknow how to cook meth ? no you don't which means you have no right to\ncomplain about anything ever.<br><br>look, I'm a scientist and i can tell you that this movie is 100 percent\nscientifically accurate. ridley Scott never would have been knighted if\nhe made bad movies. <br><br>not only did i recognize the DNA of the first alien film when i watched\nthis but i also recognized Prometheus for what it is - a modern day\nmarvel of cinematology. <br><br>also anyone studying screen writing should be interested in this\nbecause it has possibly the best screenplay ever written and all of the\ntop movieticians agree.<br><br>go to hell all of you.\n"
"\nIt starts off nicely with a promise of a good film, then it falls flat.\nInconsistent, unbelievable, and generally disappointing.<br><br>Good material, awful execution - the actors were not bad, Fassbender\nwas really good, but the characters were completely illogical at times,\nsome actions clearly contradicting the whole character, done only to\nfurther the plot.<br><br>An experienced and ready to die captain leaving his post to shag a\nblond, while two of his crew is stuck in an unknown structure? A\nsnakelike parasite controlling a human body with awesome precision -\ngiving it superhuman strength and dexterity? Did the movie really need\na super-zombie or just fillers?\n"
"\nPretty much all pizazz and no substance. I expected it to be a proper\nprequel but it wasn't supposed to be, but even as a movie it had plenty\nof shortcomings. It's like a series of boring events made exciting by\nhaving them take place on an alien planet. I didn't like the character\nof David at all and his ridiculous knowledge and understanding of an\nalien dialect/language he's never seen before. I don't like how Weyland\nwas alive and on the ship for no reason other than his own desires. And\nI especially didn't like how stupid every single crew member was.\nAlthough the technology was seven kinds of amazing, it's not a big\nenough influence on the actual movie itself. If you wanna see amazing\ntechnology, just find it on YouTube. Scott demands that the audience\nsuspend practically all of their disbelief to make the film work, and\nthat's never a good idea.\n"
"\n3/10 because of the CGI, and the first half an hour. It is all downhill\nfrom there with little thought put into it.<br><br>Scientists that don't act like scientists, a less than average dimwit\nwould outsmart them. There is no purpose for any action, no motivation\nfor the actors to behave or act in a certain manner.<br><br>The movie has no plot or too many plots ( i didn't get any of them!) ,\nno character-buildup , no purpose, filled with movie moments from badly\nmade horror movies. <br><br>I could only think of a movie like \"Skyline\" from 2010, which carried\nsimilar direction-less plot. Had a great trailer and nothing to offer\nmovie-wise. <br><br>If you are expecting to view something that makes you think long after\nit ends, this could still be for you. You will have a million questions\nlike 1. why would they do that? 2. why did this happen? 3. why didn't\nthat happen? And if you have a group of friends that love tearing apart\na bad movie, this would be a number one choice.\n"
"\nI am quite disappointment of this movie. It's a scientific fiction\nmovie. You basically can make up anything you want that contradicts any\nknown scientific theory. So I am not going to be picky about the\ndiscoveries in the movie. As a scientist myself, I have to say that the\n'so-called' scientists in this movie are totally unprofessional. The\nwriters need to have REAL scientists as consultants. Just like when you\nare making a war movie, you want to have real military personnel,\npilots, snipers etc as your consultant, to make sure the things the\nactors do and say in the movie are authentic and believable. I am a big\nfan of Tom Hardy after 'Warrior'. I think he gives an Oscar worthy\nperformance in that movie. In this movie, he is good, but not\nmarvelous. Mostly because of the role he is playing.\n"
"\nI really enjoy watching movies. I enjoy sitting down with an alcoholic\nbeverage and diving into someones creation.<br><br>Halfway into this movie, I realized I could not care less about what\nwas going on. I am fully convinced it took a conscious effort to make\nthis movie as lousy as it was. It is completely useless. <br><br>1 star for nice images. <br><br>9 stars lacking for being the second movie in my life I needed to turn\noff.<br><br>Amazing how another human can enjoy and respect this work. Just\namazing.\n"
"\nSo poorly directed, and written, that it could classify as one of the\nbest comedies ever written. So many \"Why don't we stall the story here,\nwith traditional moments that don't really move the story forward, but\nmight get us to two hours worth of filming.\". On a positive, great idea\non a prequel for Alien, and photography is very good. Just wish\ndirection would have been more sophisticated, and logical. You can\nprobably stop reading here because the site is requiring me to write\nmore, as if length of idea is more important than the idea itself.\nWhich aren't really the point of reviews, but in order to get this\npublished, I'm going to publish words that don't really matter, but the\nsite would like me to continue writing because they believe more is\nbetter. Not the greatest logic, don't you think?\n"
"\nTruly the worst movie to disgrace the silver screen in recent years,\nPrometheus will leave you with a profound sense of confusion and\nemptiness that is hard to rival.<br><br>Many were unaware that this movie was intended to be the prequel to the\nmovie Alien that spawned three sequels and a plethora of other forms of\nmedia (namely graphic novels). Those viewers were the lucky ones.<br><br>Aside from butchering his own history, the movie itself has no merits\nto stand on. Otherwise accomplished actors flounder as they attempt to\nportray characters with as much depth as a thimble and the murkiest\nmotivation imaginable. <br><br>Between supposedly educated scientists acting like horny teenagers from\nan 80's slasher flick, an android with poorly defined abilities\nreminiscent of Data (Star Trek the Next Generation), and the most\nforced plot \"twists\" in recent memory, the audience is left with\nnothing but a deep sense of dread that Ridley Scot has been attending\nprivate tutor sessions with George Lucas.\n"
"\nPlease be warned that this movie completely lacks the screenplay. It is\ninconsistent, illogical, unreasonable. The acting is not bad at all,\nthe underlying ideas are not bad at all, the graphics is not bad at\nall, but the dialogs and actions are just plain inconsistent like a\nheap of garbage.<br><br>If you study how it is possible to have such a bad screenplay you will\nknow that first story was written by Jon Spaihts, who also wrote the\nmovie the Darkest Hour which is not as bad as Promethius but it is also\ndone very poorly. In addition, Damon Lindelof was the screen writer who\nrewrote the story. He is known for his absolutely absurd soap opera\n\"Lost\". The question remains though: why spend so much money on actors,\non graphics, and save money on a screenwriter??? Why James Cameron is\nnot a screen writer of this movie?\n"
"\nSo poorly written and asinine all I could say at the end was... huh?\nThat's it? As stated by others, none of the suspense of Alien. Like\nGeorge Lucas, apparently Scott comes from the school of \"If I put my\nname on it it's great and if you don't like it you just don't get it.\"<br><br>Don't see this, pretend it doesn't exist. Don't ruin the Alien the way\nthey ruined Darth Vader. <br><br>On a side note: I am fascinated by users who write 10 paragraphs about\nhow bad a movie is and then give it a 7 or 8. That explains how it has\nan overall score as high as it does. FYI more stars is good, less stars\nis bad.\n"
"\nA crew of idiots who would not be allowed to cross the road\nunaccompanied in real life are somehow presented as the plausible elite\nchosen to fly on humankind's most important mission ever. The mission\nitself has been launched based on dodgy cave paintings that it takes a\ngreat leap of faith to believe point to the origin of our species. Our\nspecified idiots seem to represent devolved rather than evolved humans,\nas they now smoke in their space suits, bait clearly dangerous alien\nlifeforms, and hide symptoms of illness from their colleagues in this\nhostile, uncharted territory. The old man financing this fiasco isn't\nold, just badly made-up. Relations of kinship and sexual/romantic\nattraction make no sense. The ending is ho-hum.<br><br>Hitchcock said an epoch ago that three thing make a good film: Script\nscript script. Ridley Scott knew that once, but seems to have\nforgotten. A terrible, horrible film.\n"
"\nWow, this has to be one of the most ridiculously made movies in\nhistory. First 20 mins was interesting and then it went downhill\nexponentially. NOTHING the characters do in this movie makes ANY sense\nespecially given that they are SUPER Scientists. So many things\nhappening in this movie that made me wanna cuss out Ridley Scott for\nmaking such a piece of ****. Seriously man, do not watch this, skin\nthrough it if anything and you shall want to puke. HOW the heck does\nthis movie currently have a 7.4 rating on IMDb???? this is more like a\n2.5. Anyway, don't want to keep repeating myself but go watch something\nelse even if you are desperate.\n"
"\nAlien was a great movie that took us into unknown territory or should I\nsay another territory that was not what one would expect.<br><br>This movie is poor in execution, poor in plot development and poor in\nacting. What was Ridley Scott thinking of when he put this together\nother than a way to make some more money to support his next big\nexperiment. And he seems to give the viewer little credit for brains\nand attention to details. <br><br>The movie does a poor job of explaining any real logic to the mission\nand the characters going on the mission. And it goes down hill from\nthere. All of the nonsense around destroying the earth to make it\nbetter for them. It made no sense. While I like Sci-Fi movies I like\nthem to have some plausibility - this one has none. There are too many\nholes that can be shot into any logic around the plot, the characters\nand the purpose of the mission.<br><br>Long Live Sigorney Weaver and Alien\n"
"\nI was really looking forward for watching Prometheus and I thought this\nmovie could among the top movies released in 2012. After watching the\nmovie I was in a shock, wondering if this is indeed a Ridley Scott\nmovie.<br><br>I will be precise here : <br><br>Good : Visual effects are great. Thats it.<br><br>Bad : Slow, predictable, not enough thrills, low on action and\ndisappointing last half.<br><br>In such movies you expect action, thrill and there was none. I would\nnot say zero but very less. The plot itself is so so, I thought it\nstarted off well but lost it soon enough. I don't know how this movie\nhas got good rating but I think its a total disappointment.\n"
"\nI was really disappointed with Prometheus it dosn't live up to the hype\nthat has surrounded the film. I actually have never fallen asleep\nduring a movie and I did during this movie.<br><br>I'm not a big fan of science fiction this could be why (however my\npartner is and he also agreed that this film was a complete let down) I\njust found this movie to have a lot of talking to begin with... and for\nthe first half of the film nothing really happens. It picks up towards\nthe end and I did wake up and it was bearable but I left the movie just\nfeeling like I didn't experience anything worth while.<br><br>It's just typical and nothing really sets this film apart so I don't\nreally get why such a big fuss over this movie? Seen better!\n"
"\nThe ONLY positive thing I can say about this is that it looks great on\nscreen, stunning actually at times. Everything else was disastrous. The\nbiggest problem was the plot, which would have been naive and clichéd\nif it had been done well, but did not even live up to that and ended up\nbeing simply nonsensical. I could literally list dozens of\ncontradictions, holes and unexplainable oddities in the storyline. Then\nthere was the acting which was uninspired to be kind about it, which\nobviously leads you to wonder about the direction. I find it hard to\nunderstand how a movie like this which should have been great can go so\ncompletely wrong and not be caught by the studio quality control\nsomewhere before release, or perhaps it was too far gone too fix by\nthen. I find it harder to understand how people are giving this movie\npositive reviews. Major disappointment given the director's history\nwith this genre.\n"
"\nI am a big fan of Scott's and of sci-fi. Had been waiting for weeks to\nwatch Prometheus and drove like crazy to get on time for an after work\nshow. I should have known better. The movie simply sucks. The visuals\nare great, no doubt, but everything else does not make any sense at\nall. Admittedly, you do not expect scientific truths or revelations,\nbut some bone structure is primordial. The ship goes off to find our\ncreators. There is an underlying story about the zillionaire who in his\ndying days pays for everything, his daughter who wants to stop him and\nthe robot who clearly wants to become Data. But the center story,\nnamely the aliens, what they are, what they want, why, who are they,\nwhat did they do, etc. remains nonexistent. Lots of disgusting\ncreatures, lots of modern splatter, and nothing beyond. The characters\ndo not evolve, and practically no decision of their's really makes any\nsense. Even the music was boring, borrowed and lacking originality.<br><br>I give three stars for the effects only.\n"
"\nIt's pretty obvious that whoever wrote this script lacks the scientific\nknowledge of the average 12-year old. That's a pretty major problem\nwith a SCIENCE fiction story. Unfortunately, the FICTION part of\nPrometheus is even worse than the science. Characters with very little\ndevelopment, maddeningly stupid dialogue and wildly inconsistent and\nquestionable actions leave the excellent visuals as the only enjoyable\npart of this film. I am astounded that the studio allowed this film to\nbe released in this state. It's a mess from start to finish. Not even\nworth a rental, unless you want to invite your friends over and make\nfun of it together.\n"
"\nWhen i first saw this advertised it did look a bit rubbish, yet all the\nreviews i read told a different story. so naturally i took myself in\nwith an open mind.<br><br>And i wish i hadn't, i never thought i would say this about a film but\nthere was really no point to making it at all, there was countless of\nscenes and characters that were made out to be important to begin with\nbut ended up really not being, and to use Charlize Theron and not make\nuse of the acting she has to offer is a shame, her character really did\nnot hit the spot with me, especially since the release of snow white\nand the huntsman was out at the same time and that was amazing and a\namazing performance. <br><br>I do enjoy these sort of films but there really was something about it\nthat really wasn't good enough. <br><br>Maybe it was all the hype that wasn't quite how they made it out to be,\nor maybe it is just one of those films that i wont get on with. Its\neveryone's opinion\n"
"\nThis show have it's good point, but mostly, it's all bad. The starting\nof the show seems rather alright as it was flowing rather smoothly.\nHowever, already at the beginning of the show, it was extremely boring.\nI find myself nearly dozing off at the front part of the show as all\nthat talking without the suspense which it was suppose to have just\nmakes it dreadful to watch. At least at the later part of the show\nbegins to get more interesting and the suspense was starting to build\nup. But the ironic thing is that the story wasn't flowing properly as\nit progresses deeper. In fact, the plot seems to be mixing up at the\nlast few part and it felt more like the director was vomiting out\nwhatever he could to end the show, something to me which makes it\nextremely horrible. But the only plus side to the story is that it is\nnot predictable as I thought it would. To conclude, it's not really\nworth the time to watch or let alone buy the DVD. If you are really\ninterested to watch the movie, I recommend you wait for HBO or\nFOXMovies Premium to play it on TV.\n"
"\nRidley Scott! Uneblievable. What a disappointment. So much to look\nforward to, so much to experience. Then, what disaster. Absolutely no\nsense at all, pointless plot, really poor storytelling, nothing makes\nsense, scenes without any connection. I am speechless. Good sound\nediting, good visual effects. Point taken, someone threw money in and\nsaid, make it look nice, don't worry about meaning or sense, the\n3D-event-and-sensation-generation swallow any nonsense. And so Ridley\ndid. Hard to believe, this was meant to be like that. If anyone has an\nexplanation for this, please come forward, but truly, nothing in this\nfilm is coherent or within the story or the setting plausible. Very\ndisappointing.\n"
"\nI know this is only entertainment, but in order to entertain there are\ncertain goals that must be achieved. This movie deserved believable\ncharacters, believable situations, a top-level science fiction script\nand the best special effects of all time; unfortunately it has none.<br><br>If your idea of entertainment is that anything is possible because \"it\nis just a movie\", then you have a chance of enjoying this film.\nOtherwise, you will be seriously bothered by completely flat, silly,\nunbelievable characters; silly situations created because the\ncharacters are plain dumb; a script that offers a number of plot holes,\nvery few suspenseful and uninteresting moments, scientific background\nthat requires no degree in science to notice that are just foolish; and\nspecial effects that are as good as any other recent movie but by no\nmeans a reason to watch this one.<br><br>I went to watch this movie with low expectations because of the\nreviews, but it was much worse than expected. I have never been so\ndisappointed of a movie in a long time.\n"
"\nWhile I found the movie to be somewhat entertaining, I still shake my\nhead on the mentality of the entire script. Is that what the future of\nscientific technology amounts to ? Lets spend a trillion dollars to\nsend mostly nitwits and a robot across galaxies to represent us.. ? At\nno time did I feel anyone was really intelligent. They seemed to all\nhave their own agendas. No one was there to actually represent Earth ..\nLOL With that said, it wasn't a total waste of time. Just an average\nsci-fi movie that was suppose to be a prequel to the original movie\nAlien.<br><br>Not sure why it even has a high rating. Guess given the crap movies\nbeing thrown out these days it's expected though.\n"
"\nI suspect that Ridley Scott had a few misgivings about the theatrical\nrelease version of Prometheus. I stumbled across what I'm sure must be\nhis Director's Cut version, where he has dealt with some of the more\nobvious shortcomings that seemed to have found their way into the film\nthrough the various departments...casting, writing, dialog coaching,\ncontinuity, scientific authentication, editing, etc. I think I found\nwhat Scott will offer as an improved version with: Cleaned-up dialog.\nJudicious and disciplined edits of unnecessary scenes. Some clarifying\nback story. Amplified sound. Expanded epilogue. Better closeups. He\nremoved a few unnecessary characters, plot devices, clichés and\nsubplots, and in doing so, has provided us with a tighter, focused\neffort that I think will make his fans eagerly await his next film. <br><br>Find it here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sftuxbvGwiU\n"
"\nFrom the music to the plot, this disaster reeks of cliché after cliché\nranging from venerable Star Trek musical melodic references, to the\nhack style of \"Lets do the most stupid thing we can do when facing\nunimaginable danger!\" <br><br>But I must say the visuals were absolutely top notch.<br><br>The real question is how did this train wreck happen? Maybe RS\nfunctions best as a director only. Maybe he needs the perspective of a\nProducer. Maybe he works best with some higher level guidance. Who\nknows? <br><br>And the other question is why has this gotten such great ratings? How\ndid Roger Ebert rate this 100??? Could be that I'm 59 years old and the\nRatings System is geared for the Young that don't know much about\n\"Vintage\" sci-fi.<br><br>At any rate, a dismal failure and now, I'm going to be very skeptical\nof any RS movie to come my way - and let me tell you, that is a very\nsad state of affairs considering his previous works.<br><br>Oh so disappointed, Tom\n"
"\npredictable! firstly, anyone at the end of the 21st century still using\nMILES... is just pandering to a Yank audience who would not understand\ndistance anyway when expressed in 'scienfic' termology. ANYONE who goes\non such a mission and does not believe and KNOW it is a one way mission\n- is living in a Disney fantasy world. Calling it not a pre - alien\nfilm... get real, I might have been slightly amused if this was made in\n1976 but to make it in 2012... very disappointing. Seems the studio's\nthink because it has a half cooked plot that any kindergartener could\nfollow and 3D (actually 4D) is going to get people to watch and think\nOH AH LA LA like with Logan's Run or Star War's, is sadly mistaken.\n"
"\nThe most stupid science crew ever to grace the silver screen charges\nonto an alien planet, removes all their protective clothing the moment\nthe find breathable air. It's hard to talk of plot holes in a plot that\nmust have been written on a stamp with a Crayola. The characters are so\nunrealistic and one-dimensional that it is hard not to wish them to\nkeel over as quickly as possible to end this travesty. The director\nshould not even be allowed to tape family holiday shots and the script\nwriters are not even fit to write Nigeria scam mails.<br><br>This movie has a single redeeming feature. Charlize Theron in\nclose-fitting costumes.\n"
"\nI am a huge fan of the aliens series. I'm not a huge sci-fi lover, but\nthe Aliens movies are brilliant, so when I heard that they were making\nanother movie in the series I got pretty excited.<br><br>First of all this movie barely lasted a month in theaters. I didn't\neven have time to go and see it because it was in theaters than it just\ndisappeared. That should have been my first indication of how bad this\nmovie was going to be, but I was curious and hoped it would be good so\nI watched it anyway.<br><br>I was beyond disappointed by this movie. The other movies are\nbrilliantly directed, scripted, and the acting is very on point, but\nthis.....this was a disaster. The plot barely connected together. The\nstory was all over the place and didn't grab my attention. Then there\nis the fact that it barely connected with the other movies in the\nseries at all. The connection that it did have bridged on completely\nnot making any sense.<br><br>All around this movie is the worst I have seen this year, and it\ndisappointed me beyond words. I would not recommend this movie.\n"
"\nAlthough it starts with a alright (but clichéd) premise , Prometheus\nquickly loses sight of its goal and become a dis-articulated mess of\nridiculous tries at action. there is no message, no ideas. A very very\nvery very badly done film. I would rather watch my own feces swirl\naround the toilet bowl. Glad I did not pay anything to see this movie.\nThe twists are so contrived and obvious. The whole film stinks. Do not\nwatch.<br><br>Why do the scientists completely ignore any type of method. The \"robot\"\ncharacter seems to do whatever he wants. No one asks him questions. Why\ndid they even bother. I pray there will be no sequel, for all of\nmankind.\n"
"\nI originally had no interest in seeing this movie when I saw trailers\nof it; it just seemed like yet another alien movie... same old premise,\nsame type of storyline...<br><br>After seeing its rating on IMDb, my husband and I decided to check it\nout.<br><br>The plot had way too many holes to make it anywhere near logical to a\nreasonable, semi-conscious viewer. Yes, it's set in the future, yes, it\ndeals with a subject that is debatable at the best of times, but still,\nthere are ways to draw people in and make them believe even the most\nunbelievable things.<br><br>We chose to see it in 3D, which, to be honest, I have no idea why they\neven bothered making a 3D version... it did absolutely nothing for the\nfilm. It's a shame when 3D isn't used to make the film more exciting\nand enjoyable.<br><br>It wasn't the worst film I've ever seen, but I really suggest waiting\nto see it when it comes out on blu-ray. I personally find that we\nwasted our money going to the theatre to see it.\n"
"\nPlot was weak and in-cohesive. Actors had little to no chemistry, yet\nstill had relations. Characters were shallow and don't seem\nintelligent/qualified enough to be manning a space flight. Noomi Rapace\nappeared to reprise her stumbling role from Girl with the Dragon\nTattoo; only less convincingly.<br><br>Things happen without so much of an explanation nor motive. \"Style\"\nover substance?<br><br>Even Guy Pearce seem to have quietly withdrawn from this overblown,\nover-hyped, over budgeted piece of disappointment.<br><br>Insults the original. Truly.<br><br>Stay away...\n"
"\nMy wife and I saw Prometheus tonight. We said \"Hey, Ridley Scott\ndirected and produced it so it HAS to be good, right?\" Boy were we\nwrong! We were literally yawning by the end of the movie.<br><br>Yes the special effects were quite good. And the guy who played David\nthe Robot was good and the South African chick who played the blonde\nwho acted like a robot was pretty good and nice eye candy to boot. But\nthat's where the good stuff kind of ends.<br><br>The part of them breathing the atmosphere was really ludicrous. Who\nknew what the heck the infectious germs would be in that atmosphere in\nthe ship? From there, I just realized that they had chucked any sort of\ncommon sense out the door.<br><br>It wasn't so bad I would demand my money back. But there was WAY to\nmuch lousy stuff. I don't know how it got such a high rating on IMDb,\nballot stuffing by the production company I expect.\n"
"\n* 4 point - * so alien like you can almost call it a a copy.<br><br>I truly don't understand this bizarre process of chowing old materials\nin new concept .<br><br>there must be some talented new script writer some where with brand new\nideas.<br><br>similarity in the story line and even in the design is astonishing<br><br>sorry to say I didn't liked it much. I couldn't avoid comparing scenes\ncharacter and effect between alien and Prometheus. it was quite\nannoying and total fun spoiler. any how....... <br><br>will probably watch alien saga again to wash the bad test.\n"
"\nI Was really looking forward to this film, however i was so\ndisappointed with it. <br><br>It failed to deliver on so many levels, i felt it was sooooo slow at\nthe start it seemed to take ages to get to the main point of the film\nand when it finally did it all seemed a bit rushed to hurry up and get\nto the end. <br><br>The trailer they are showing for it really is the best parts coz\nnothing else is really worth watching or writing about.<br><br>Even now as i'm writing this review i'm struggling what to write about\nit,,,,, mainly because there is nothing to write!!<br><br>I'm a massive fan of the Alien films and of Ridley Scott but don't\nthink i'll be in a hurry to watch this again anytime soon!<br><br>Might be time to give up on trying to jump on the bandwagon and not do\na prequel like the rest (even though Charlize Theron keeps saying in\ninterviews it's not a prequel) it sooo is a prequel!!\n"
"\nI'm a Sci Fi Fan and went to this movie with great hopes seeing the\nscore rating from IDMB. Have to say that I'm really disappointed. The\nplot is confusing and hard to fallow to say the least, maybe because\npeople do and react to situations unnatural. Don't want to spoil\nanything but those aliens don't deserve to be an advanced civilization\nif they die in such hilarious ways. I left before the movie ended as i\nalready knew how the movie will fail(end).<br><br>To sum up the guys at Hollywood don't realize that after you do the\nsame thing in 3 or 4 movies it becomes a cliché, it's expected. As it\nwas for me with absolutely everything in the movie.\n"
"\nPrometheus is a badly written and badly directed movie. Science fiction\ncould be interesting, but it is a C-grade flick, with big actors like\nCharlize Theron, who has hardly any significant role.<br><br>Characters are shallow. Events funny, but improbable. Effects are not\neven 10% compared to other 3D movies like Avtar.<br><br>A woman just deduce that the aliens are gonna destroy earth, and\nappeals to the ship commander to stop him. The commander decides in a\nmoment with his two member team to go and commit suicide to save\nhumanity. Funny. Unrealistic. Stupid movie.<br><br>I wonder how Time of India has given it 4 stars. Not worth wasting your\ntime!\n"
"\nIt actually starts out really visually interesting for about the first\n20 or 30 minutes, but leaves you wondering when something is going to\nhappen. Gimmicky marketing tricks make you think this is going to be a\nmovie in the same class as the Alien movies. The plot is some kind of\nweak push toward the idea that humans came from giant space aliens and\nthere is no God. This is a very slow scattered movie with a horrible\nstory and a mess of a script. There is no action, no drama, no\nsuspense, no tension, no adventure, no background story, and no\ncharacter development. There are no connections or attachment to any of\nthe characters. The characters are unintelligent and annoying. This is\nliterally one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I don't know how the\nsame producer of some of my all-time favorite movies including the\noriginal Alien movie can put out this complete piece of garbage movie.\n"
"\nWaste of my time, I was so fired up about this movie since I am a major\nSciFi fan. I still love the first Alien movie.<br><br>Prometheus is a lot similar to Alien but it is so bad.<br><br>The build up is pretty OK but as it unfolds planet-side it really\nsucks. The story doesn't hold up. I think it destroys some of the\nmystique round Alien movie<br><br>It had the potential to be such a good movie, I am grieving.<br><br>It took all my strength not to leave before the end.<br><br>I am really disappointed.<br><br>Of course it must be seen by all SciFi fans anyway but maybe my review\nlowers your expectation a little bit. I hope you don't get as\ndisappointed as me\n"
"\nThis film is scoring 7.8? I just can't understand how thats possible,\nmy wife and I went to see this film last week and it is truly awful.\nThe characters are both cheesy and pointless and the story has holes so\nlarge you could drive a truck through them.<br><br>Some of the antics of the so called \"scientific team\" beggar belief and\ncan only be considered contrivances. <br><br>To say these days that the effects are good is not enough, any movie\nwith a budget like this is bound to have good effects, they should not\nbe an excuse for credible characters and proper story.<br><br>I've seen reviews saying \"don't believe the negative press\" but trust\nme you should save your money and if you really must see this, wait for\nDVD which won't be long!\n"
"\nWhat a completely mindless waste of time. The movie makes no serious\nattempt at finding a plot. Character development is completely\nnonexistent. Clearly stole ideas from previous sci-fi hits. Aliens was\na great movie, but you can't just copy and paste scenes from Aliens,\nadd modern-day special effects, and expect that somewhere in there a\nplot will evolve on its own.<br><br>I'm the type of person that would actually rate a movie like Armageddon\na '7.5' because it was at least a lot of fun to watch if you just\nsuspended reality a little bit. This movie, however, I can't rate\nbetter than a '3'. <br><br>I should've known there was a problem my friends and I entered the\ntheater (a major theatre in Boston, on a Friday night, only two weeks\nafter this movie first came out), and it was less than 5% full. We were\nall greatly disappointed by this movie.\n"
"\nAmazing amount of special effects... and that's it. This movie has\nnothing more to offer. A very poor story line, crazy characters who\nappear quite confused themselves, doing crazy things for no reason.\nYucky worms...Stereotyped aliens thrashing about...Live surgeries, with\nthe character running as if nothing had happened after undergoing quite\na major abdominal surgery... Haven't we seen all these stuff in every\nalien movie. What's the point in showing these again and again? Do not\nwaste your time on this movie...Finally you leave the movie dazed and\nconfused...Why did I ever....<br><br>7.6 on IMDb... Oh come on! I'll never ever trust IMDb again! It's\npathetic! <br><br>Come on guys please try something new. We're quite fed up with these\nstale stuff!\n"
"\nThis film really disappointed me. I am a huge Ridley Scott fan so that\nmade it worse. I think it needed a better editor to tighten up some\nscenes that were s-l-o-w because that drags the film down. It got to\nthe point where I started thinking, why are we seeing this? This\ndiatribe is boring and irrelevant, can we get back to the story? It\nwould be like listening to my mother share what should be a 2 minute\nstory but taking 15 minutes to do so. Good story buried in a long and\nboring dialogue. The CGI is awesome and the tech ideas are cool as\nwould be expected these days. But that isn't enough to make me want to\nsee this a second time.\n"
"\nWith all the money these film makers had to make this film one would\nthink that they could hire a few graduate students at any local\nuniversity for peanuts to check for scientific ignorance. This film is\njust sloppy. The list of things that made absolutely no sense would go\non for pages: from placing themselves somewhere between Mars and\nJupiter to not knowing the difference between abiogenesis and\nevolution. From performing archeology with the equivalent of a\nbulldozer to having a hodgepodge of symptoms from identical infections.<br><br>It was like spending two hours kissing someone with a halitosis. I\nsuppose it would be an entertaining film for someone who isn't bothered\nby scientific ignorance and is willing to forgive gaping plot holes\nthat make no sense.\n"
