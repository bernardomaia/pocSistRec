"\nI'm a little perplexed having read a couple of user reviews - one of\nthem said this was movie was unbelievable and unconvincing due to the\nfact that it had a love theme going on? huh? I suppose the film 'A\nNightmare on Elm Street' is unbelievable too? In fact, how many movies\nare believable? 'The Dictator' is a comedy, nothing less and nothing\nmore than that, and that was the intention. Whether it's believable or\nnot is irrelevant. The movie had plenty of laugh out loud moments.<br><br>I'm glad this movie headed in a different direction from his previous\nefforts. Had the film continued in the same fashion as the reality TV\nway, then I don't think it would have stood any chance of working, not\nwith this new character anyway. So to those who are expecting and\nhoping for something similar to Bruno and Borat you may be left a\nlittle disappointed, but for those who wouldn't mind seeing something\nslightly different, and can take a movie for what it is, then you\nshould enjoy this, as I did.\n"
"\nI wish there were more comedies like that - crossing over the political\ncorrectness line, but not over the line of good taste, so as to make a\nmovie hard to watch.<br><br>The film is quite pointy, it is for a moderate audience and will make\nall kinds of extremists quite unhappy. The plot is well thought out and\nfunny. It'll nail you to the screen.<br><br>I like the unorthodox character of this film, Sacha Baron Cohen's\nmovies are definitely one of the kind. I wouldn't consider the humor\ncrude, but it is certainly honest. Some of the unthinkable things you\nsee are likely to have happened in reality.\n"
"\nJust been to see this film and could never stop laughing. Sacha Baron\nCohen is a true comedic talent...an excellent writer as the jokes in it\nare genius. The film is short but packed full of laughter. Perhaps I'm\nan easy laugher, but what can I say, I liked it!!! A LOT!!! As well as\nthe comedy being brilliant, the actual plot/storyline is superb also.\nFrom watching the trailer, and then watching the film, it was actually\na completely different story to how I thought it was going to be. I\nwasn't very excited to see the film after the trailers, but decided to\nventure in... I enjoyed it much more than I expected and will likely\nsee it again! It isn't for the easily-offended but if this is your sort\nof humor then you need to go and watch it now!\n"
"\nOne of the funniest movies I know! There are so many good jokes based\non what's happening in the world. If you read the news on a daily basis\nand know what's going on in the world you'll like this movie. Some\npeople may not like Cohen but I think he's a genius. It really takes\nsomething to show the problems that we have in a funny way. However you\nshould really go and watch that movie, it's worth the money. I\npersonally watched it twice in theater. Now I really don't know what to\nwrite anymore without giving away any jokes because the jokes come one\nafter another. I was already laughing out loud after one minute. It's\nreally cool if you watch a movie in theater and everyone in the room is\nlaughing. So my definitive final conclusion is that The Dictator is\nmore than a movie, it's an experience ;)\n"
"\nThis movie was absolutely dirty, offensive, hilarious, racist, and\ncrazy over-the-top moments. It's about the same style as Sacha Baron\nCohen's previous movies, but it's done much better. Cohen plays a silly\nruthless dictator named Admiral General Aladeen. He is very\nanti-semitic and plans on creating nuclear weapons. He hates the very\nidea of democracy. While on his way to the United Nations, he's\nbetrayed and shaven so no one would recognize him. He's taken in by\nZoey, a vegan hippie, and gives him a job at her store. Will Aladeen\nmake it to the U.N. to stop democracy from coming to his country, or\nwill Zoey change his heart? I would definitely recommend THE\nDICTATOR!!!\n"
"\nI really enjoyed Sacha Baron Cohen's previous work with Borat. I came\nin to The Dictator with relatively high hopes for some good laughs.\nI'll say that I wasn't disappointed in the slightest. Cohen gets some\ngreat laughs on politically incorrect humour in to this film, and it's\nwell done. In the first 10 minutes of the film, I was laughing my head\noff with the consistency of the humour, but I can see why in the later\nhalf this can not be abundant. However, sometimes this film falls flat,\nwith a lot of humour being delayed in the last half of the movie.\nSometimes it (but very rarely) feels like it is not Cohen. However\nthese jokes are still a bundle of laughs for the right people. Overall\nit's a great film if you're familiar with Cohen's other work.\n"
"\nJust to note i haven't watched \"Borat\" or \"Bruno\",so i only kinda knew\nwhat to expect from the movie.<br><br>In short it's a really great film,filed with great humour and great\nactors,that doesn't take itself too seriously and it shouldn't be taken\nseriously from the audience around the globe.It's lighthearted comedy\nfor those who have a hour or two to spare.<br><br>The main problem for me (as noted in the title) is that the trailer\ngave away maybe 70% of the really really funny parts.I remember seeing\nthe trailer for the first time i laughed for a good 5 minutes after it\nended.The second time i saw it,it actually convinced me to go and see\nthe movie later on,expecting much more from it.<br><br>In the end i can't say i was disappointed i still think it's a great\nmovie,just with a trailer that gives away less of the really funny\nmoments it would have been a much,much more memorable experience.But i\nguess that's my mistake since i know that trailers usually give away\n50% of the comedies these days.\n"
"\nWhat do people expect from a movie to be excellent!? Im an Iranian and\nhe was joking about our president! it made me laugh so what? this film\nis only a comedy a simple but in my opinion magnificent comedy, this is\nnot one of those expensive Hollywood movies that the turned 200 cars on\nfire to make. but as a comedy and nothing more it made me laugh several\ntimes and having a good time is only thing you expect from a good\ncomedy. I think this ratings are really just not supportive , yeah it\nseems many people expected some thing real and fancy the same way but\nthe whole point of comedy is to laugh so I don't see why not 10 stars !\nSorry if there were some grammatical mistakes!\n"
"\nThis film is crass, stupid, offensive, childish, crude, and very very\nfunny. It is if Team America and There is Something About Mary both got\ndrunk, ended up in bed together and this is their brat of a kid out in\nthe streets of New York running wild.<br><br>There is something here to offend everyone, but it is especially\noffensive to anyone from the Middle East or Muslim. You could argue\nthat Sacha Baron Cohen is making some point about the West's regard for\nMiddle Eastern dictators, but I suspect he just wants to make the\naudience laugh and so produce a box office success.<br><br>A guilty pleasure.\n"
"\nAnd this movie supposed to be a comedy? Who was the target group?\nPeople with lower IQ level I guess. Nothing worked here. Script was\npointless, stupid with some odd jokes that make you only puke. Acting\nwas terrible. Of course what we expected after previous work \"Bruno\"\nwhich was the most stupid and disgusting movie ever made. This one is\nin some kind of way in same direction. I have no idea what was Ben\nKingsley doing in this rubbish. The role of the dictator by S.B.Cohen\nis just unsatisfying and amateurish even for a comedy. Every next role\nof him is getting worse. Maybe I won't watch his movies anymore. This\nwas too much for me. I don't want to waste more words to describe this\nfolly. Just avoid it.\n"
"\nThey are scraping the bottom of the barrel with this movie. Please\ndon't waste your time or money watching this. It shouldn't even be\ncalled a film. What do we call it then? They really stoop low, so low.\nStooping low is necessary when there is really ZERO content. The\nDictator is VERY POORLY DONE. There is nothing to laugh about. It's NOT\nFUNNY. The film is a disgrace. It is truly unbelievable what goes out\nto market these days. Who approved this and how could it ever have been\napproved? I felt embarrassed for the actors. When movies are this bad\ncustomers should have the option of getting their money back. The movie\ngoes from scene to scene to scene. There is no consistency and it is\ncomplete nonsense. In the previews they'll show you what you will think\nis funny. I thought other reviewers were exaggerating as to how low the\nfilm stooped, but they were not. The actors who were paid for this film\nalong with the producers and directors should refund the viewers who\nwere totally disappointed with it.\n"
"\nAbsolute garbage. Not since The Pest have seen a comedy THIS bad...oh\nsure, Pink Panther 2 was horrible but this takes it to a whole new\nlevel. Cohen should not be allowed to make another movie and Farris and\nKinglsey need to have their heads examined. It simply not funny,\nracist, offensive and filled with flat jokes. You can see the jokes\ncoming a mile away and everyone is as lame as you imagined. It's funny\nhow most critics would say Mel Brooks fell off with his last 4 films\n(Spaceballs, life stinks, Robin hood and Dracula) and the box office\nreceipts might agree with them (although I never have. All of those\nfilms have merit in some ways) but THIS - THIS IS HOW YOU FALL OFF.\nIt's absolute SHITE.\n"
"\nThis film was a disappointment to say the least, not just by the\nterrible acting but also by the structure of the film. Sasha has really\nlet himself down with this one, from the days of Ali G indahouse and\nBorat you can clearly see that he has sold himself out. This film\nconsists of a poor attempt at comedy that cannot be described as more\nthan 2 stars (just like the cast). If anybody goes to see this film\nwith any expectation please don't as you will see the harsh reality of\nwhat once was a comedy genius selling himself out to Hollywood in order\nto make big money instead of sticking to what he knows best. The\nsurprise element in the Dictator was  Nothing! I watched the trailer\nbefore and that's all that was in this film apart from a terrible\nscript and woeful acting throughout. All I can say is please just stick\nto the trailer and do not waste ninety minute of your life you will\nnever get back.\n"
"\nSomeone asked \"Did anyone over 30 like it?\" Maybe I would have liked it\nwhen I was under 13, not sure. <br><br>I was over 30 when I saw 'Borat', thought it was wild and I laughed a\nlot watching it. 'The Dictator' is just cheesy and bad. Waste of time.\nThe fact that title of this film is close to Chaplin's 'The Great\nDictator' almost gives me a headache. <br><br>Acting is clumsy, jokes are childish, timing is terrible, looks cheap,\nplot is a big cliché... almost everything in this movie sucks. MC Rai's\nversion of REM's Everybody Hurts is the only exception, but obviously\none track in the soundtrack just can't save the film.<br><br>1/10 stars. That bad.\n"
"\nSasha Cohen is old news. The movie had a cheap comedy. If you will\nlaugh at anything then its not bad. I rather go to sleep. The movie has\nno sense of direction. The actors are C- storyline is weak There are\nsome funny line here and there. Borat was excellent, however this was\ndisappointment. The Ali G show was great when it came out. This was a\ncontinuation of The Ali G show.There was a lot of racism and typical\nstereotypes but most were overplayed. This movie was probably done in\nSasha mind in a 5 minute dream. I am glad i did not pay to watch this\nmovie. I guess when he spilled the ashes on Ryan Seacrest this was a\nsign how bad his movie was. He is a great actor, I commend him on his\nwork in other movies, but this movie was for amateurs.\n"
"\nWow, I really don't know what to say about this movie. There were\nplaces where I felt mild enjoyment but for the most part it was pretty\naverage. The dictator character felt unoriginal and just like\neverything Sacha Baron Cohen has ever done. It's always trying to be\noutrageous but in his pursuit of this he has become very repetitive.\nThe vibe was also somewhat boring and it just didn't interest me.<br><br>I also found Anna Farris' hippie little boy character to be weird and\nunnatural to the flow of the movie. Now if she was a hooker with a\nheart of gold, I would have believed it. In their own way they are both\ntoo good and not good enough for each other. The prospect gives you\nthis weird icky feeling.<br><br>I've watched it once but never need to again.\n"
"\nThis movie was great in the beginning it was really funny and I loved\nit. It set itself up to be a great comedy that I would gladly give\nabout a 7 or 8 to but then in the second half it took a major turn for\nthe worse. The movie got really inappropriate and I'm one who normally\nlikes inappropriate comedy but this just went way too far to the point\nwhere it wasn't funny and it ruined the movie for me. The story is fine\nI mean it's a comedy so it's not going to be ground breaking so that\nwas fine. It's not a movie that I'm going to want to watch more than\nthe time that I already saw it but you will be entertained if you watch\nit. Overall I would say it's not worth your time but if you do watch it\nit's not the worst.\n"
"\nIn the words of Comic Book Guy \"worse film ever\" , its badly written\nyou can tell its been scripted by a teenager with a crayon and not a\nlot of free time with predictable stereotyping of 3rd world dictators\nblatantly replicated the countries ending with -stan .If you read this\nreview before you watch the film then take it from me Don't cause its\n1hour forty six you will waste of your precious life and you will never\nget back.<br><br>The acting quality is very poor especially from Sacha Baron Cohen and\neven from Sir Ben Kingsley i know even I'm shocked that distinguished\nactor Ben Kingsley would get involved in poor film.\n"
"\nSuch a funny movie - love it - you guys rock. Keep on the great work!!!\nThe actor is a genius. I love you Sacha.<br><br>I cant wait for the next movie by you guys. Thank you guys.<br><br>Perhaps, The Dictator 2? or Dictator returns?<br><br>From Borat to Dictator, what is next? Doing a fantastic comedy. No\nother comedian can reach to you. Look at Bruno or bad-grandpa, they\ncant be as funny and realistic as you guys. Thanks<br><br>Why did it get removed from Netflix? I watched it there and wish it was\navailable again so I could watch it.<br><br>Sacha you are brilliant in every movie I see you. I recall from\ntailgate with Will feral, you were amazingly great.\n"
"\nThis film is so crude and ridiculous than it's impossible to not laugh\nat it. I would add childish to the description as well. Sasha Baron\ndidn't in 'The Dictator' a horrible mess like he did in the unfunny and\nforced 'Brüno'. That time he really delivers a few Laugh out Load\nmoments and not only terrible crude jokes,as his aforementioned\nprevious film.<br><br>Some may find it offensive, and rightfully so. But those who aren't in\nthe offended group will just enjoy this over the top comedy.<br><br>The soundtrack based of north African versions of famous American hits\nis quite hilarious. I guess it's because is really weird. <br><br>But what i found really funny about this film is the way it criticizes\neverything. Nothing really escapes from being mocked here. <br><br>And yeah, far from being the funniest and even more far from being the\nsmartest one. But is somewhat enjoyable during it's run time. Good\n'pass time' flick. 5.5/10\n"
"\nawful script awful acting it's awful from the beginning to the end, but\ni was surprised that sir ben kingsley agreed to take part in this one\nsad to see him in the cast. if you are a good viewer you will see the\nwhole summary of the film. i'm not saying ''don't expect much'' i am\njust saying ''don't expect anything at all'' i don't like writing bad\nreviews but i tried my hardest to write at least something, anything\ngood about the film but i couldn't find any. of course we know it's an\nabsurd comedy and we put our logics aside before watching the film but\nwe cant ignore horrible acting and weak plot, i mean you could have at\nleast shown us that you made some effort and some thinking about making\nthe film. really disappointment\n"
"\nThis movie is over-rated. PERIOD.<br><br>It's not the kind of classic comedy movie and it's meant for a certain\nkind of audience.<br><br>The characters are of a staggering stupidity and they would amuse me if\nI were maybe 4 years old. I had the patience to watch it to the end,\nand made me smile for 3 times.<br><br>The plot is weak and most of the jokes are obscene or an insult aimed\nat somebody.<br><br>It's impossible to figure out how this movie got it's HUGE grade on\nthis site...\n"
"\nI had to force myself to watch this movie to the end (download). I\nfound some of the humour, if you could call it that, absolutely\nsickening (and I am not referring to the scatological and sexual\nreferences). Torture is not funny, overt racism and stereotyping is not\nfunny.<br><br>There were one or two amusing instances. Not enough though. The\ndialogue was poor. 90% of this movie filled me with disgust. It was\nracist, meaningless, with had very little to recommend it. Something\nhas happened to Sascha. He used to take risks in all the other movies\nhe made. This movie is studio material and not really made as a\ndocumentary. Does he think he is being dangerous by insulting\neverything and everyone? I don't think so.<br><br>SBC. get your act together. I wish I had read some of the more\nthoughtful reviews before watching. So glad I did not actually buy this\nmovie (I bought Borat), and still find it a killer.<br><br>The Dictator theme had great potential, but it died in about the first\nfive minutes of dialogue.\n"
"\nAli G, Borat and Bruno  I loved. The Dictator  I hated.<br><br>I never thought I'd see the day where I actually turned OFF a Sacha\nBaron Cohen film but I couldn't bear to waste anymore of my life\nwatching this terrible excuse of a 'comedy.' His previous characters\nwere all funny because of the raw humour and the way they took the p*ss\nout of all the right people in a very clever way. The Dictator however\ndoesn't.<br><br>The film is full of dud jokes and desperate attempts to be funny. It\nfails.<br><br>I work in the film industry and know people that have worked with Sacha\nBaron Cohen. They say he has become a 'diva' and treats crew and behind\nthe scenes staff with total disrespect. Unfortunately it seems as if\nthe man has become a victim of his own success.<br><br>If the fame and money has gone to his head maybe he should use that\nmoney to retire early and spend time with his family. If he makes\nanother shocking (for all the wrong reasons) film like The Dictator\nagain he will destroy all the good work he has done with previous films\n/ shows / characters.\n"
"\nEver since the Phantom Menace I've always been very wary of films which\nhave a great trailer. The trailer for \"The Dictator\" was very funny,\nbut in common with other comedies you always have a nagging feeling\nthat the best gags may have been included in the trailer. This was the\ncase with \"The Dictator\", but there are some other funny moments to\nlook forward to as well.<br><br>As with most of Sacha Baron Cohen's films much of the comedy tests the\nlines of good taste. The plot is fairly straightforward and follows the\nattempted overthrow of a dictator. <br><br>It's a very easy watch and you always know that the parts which drag\nwill soon be followed with something that's funny. It isn't for the\nfaint hearted though, so if you are easily offended you should steer\nclear of this.\n"
"\nI would normally hesitate to award a 1/10 to any movie, as there is\nusually some redeeming factor to each production that would warrant it\nbe award SOME merit. Unfortunately, that cannot be said about this\nmovie.<br><br>Being a big fan of Sacha's early work, in the guise of Ali G (having a\nslot on the show The Day Today), I was bitterly disappoint at the\nextremely adolescent and unintelligent 'humor' he has adopted for this\nmovie.<br><br>I can honestly say that there wasn't ONE amusing moment through the\nfilm, from start to end.<br><br>Your 83 mins would be a well worth spent on something else a lot more\nproductive.... like sleeping. Sorry for the negativity, its just that\nthis movie was utter s***.\n"
"\nThe Dictator is one of the top-10 worst movies I have ever seen. We\nleft in the middle of this dreadful creation. Bathroom humor is fine\nbut the gratuitous, sophomoric filth was over the top.<br><br>How Ben Kingsley could have lowered himself to this level is\nastonishing. One of the best actors of a generation has gone from an\nAcademy Award winning portrayal of one of mankind's greatest\ncharacters, Ghandi, to a film that could have been produced by a\ncollege fraternity. <br><br>Borat was great and Bruno was good, but Cohen jumped the shark with The\nDictator.\n"
"\nThis is up there with one of the worst movies I have ever seen. And I\nloved Borat and Bruno. To me it's lazy and completely predictable. With\nnone of the shock elements of his previous movies. I can't tell you how\nbad this movie was. But what I am amazed is it got 6.7 so far in IMDb\nwhich now makes me doubt this site. Overall the core problem is that\nthe subject matter ie dictators just does not offer the same scope nor\nthe opportunity to give you that real scenarios where the main\ncharacter is causing caos. This to me was Sasha with a bigger budget\nnot knowing or caring of the outcome. Brutal. Every joke was obvious.\nThe accents were terrible. It just like any originality. I sat there\nwith a sense of disbelief about some of the scenes. Really really\ndisappointing. But then the trailer didn't suggest much. Butni thought\ngiven it was Sasha that it would be great. Brutal\n"
"\nI left the cinema after 45 minutes of this spectacularly unfunny film.\nI enjoyed Borat and Bruno so I was surprised by just how much I hated\nThe Dictator. It reminded me of spoof movies like Scary Movie with it's\nsteady stream low quality, witless jokes that might appeal to people\nwho laugh at their own farts.<br><br>Sacha Baron Cohen's reality-style comedies work because the audience is\neither cringing in sympathy for his unwitting victims or wincing in\nrevulsion at the lengths he will go to for a laugh. His willingness to\npush boundaries in these films is what makes them entertaining, but in\na scripted comedy, Cohen's utterly unsubtle sense of humour comes off\nas crass, lazy and cheap.<br><br>Anna Faris's character epitomises everything that is wrong with The\nDictator. She's a political activist that works in a non-profit\nfeminist vegan health food democratically run co-operative shop who\ndoesn't shave her armpits. She's a caricature of a kind you would\nexpect to find in a formula spoof movie. It just isn't funny.\n"
"\n+ Sacha Baron Cohen's outrageous but liberating total lack of political\ncorrectness. + The amazingly ridiculous beard of Aladeen. + Anna Faris'\nand S.B.C.'s unexpected chemistry. + The music and the songs, which are\nreally good and greatly adds to the atmosphere and the humour. - \"The\nDictator\" is not as wonderfully great and funny as \"Borat...\". Nothing\nis. Still, you can't help comparing.\n"
"\nThis movie is really funny movie. I laughed so much that my it gave\naches in my stomach. Should you watch this movie.? Yes ! definitely.\nJust watch it and have a good time. But the movie contains some curse\nlanguage and little bit of nudity but that's OK just watch it with your\nfriends.\n"
"\nThe dictator is a comedy movie not just about dictatorship, but about\nour democracy too.<br><br>First of all, the movie goes thought some stereotypes, begins with how\nwe see the middle east, and the dictatorships, stupids and full of self\npride. Although it shows a society with multiples interests, for good\nand for bad.<br><br>Furthermore the dictator, called Aladeen, goes to America and suffer\nfrom a cultural shock in the way of life. After he has access to\nwestern way the way he thinks change and start to have more conscience.\nBesides the dictator epiphany, the main question is ourself reflection\nafter listen his speech in the United Nation. About how unequal and\nunfair our society is, and beside the average sense we are more similar\nwith dictatorship we use to think.<br><br>All in all, the movies make a critical vision of our society, and how\nbig is the possibilities ways we humans can organize ourself, it is\namazing, for good and for bad. I strong recommend this movie, specially\nthe final UN speech.\n"
"\nThe jokes in this movie's opening parts are very much hilarious.\nAlthough their very subjects may be perceived as offensive as most\npeople, still they crack out great laughs. I really like how the movie\nreally uses great imagination in depicting the crazily stupid things\nthe dictator may do. Couple that with the sensitive issues of race,\nterrorism suspicion, and phobia to Arabs, the movie makes it a fun way\nto approach such sensitive matters. But then all those good stuff\nstrays away some time near the ending. The movie tries to follow the\npattern of mainstream comedies by bringing in the romantic\nrelationship. I think that having the character Zoe is nice to add\nbalance to the story. But forcing in to be predictable by following to\nhave a romantic relationship brings the predictability up. The acting\nis just a standard overall, but the jokes are really enjoyable that\nthey cover up the lack of acting quality.\n"
"\nVery difficult to describe this movie. I can't stop laughing i wish\nthere should be more movie like this. The plot of this movie is very\nfunny, this movie is not for all audience only a genius can make this\nkind of movie. When the fist time i saw trailer i decided to give it a\nchance. Tis movie is about the story of a dictator who risks his life\nto ensure that democracy would never come to the country. Just watch\nthis film and could never stop laughing. Sacha Baron Cohen is a true\ncomedic talent. I enjoyed it much more than I expected. I would\nrecommend this movie to all those who are not looking for logical fun.<br><br>This is definitely that sort of humor you will not regret then go and\nwatch it now!\n"
"\nA couple hearty laughs, some pretty smart political jokes, and a\nsurprisingly sophisticated finale still doesn't allow The Dictator to\nachieve its nuclear level of promise. I was truly hoping for something\nthat would be smart, but I guess I was asking way too much. No one in\nHollywood would dare to make a smart political comedy. <br><br>Sigh...<br><br>Unlike Borat, The Dictator is staged and written. It's not that funny,\nand lots of the laughs are ridiculously nasty or played for shock\nvalue. Borat was genuinely funny and incredibly original (in its\ndocumentary style direction) but this was destined for the bargain bin.\nIt's funny, but nothing close to the level of genuine comedy or genius\nof Borat.\n"
"\nAbadeen is the dictator of a crappy little North African country and he\nis modeled after the likes of Kadafi and Kim Jong Il. But, to make such\na character more palatable, he is played for laughs--albeit very uneven\nones. That's because \"The Dictator\" is an incredibly uneven film--with\nlots of funny parts and lots of unfunny and offensive parts. My advice\nis to DEFINITELY not watch it with your kids, your mother-in-law or\nFather Jenkins! But, if none of them are around and you have a high\ntolerance for this crude humor, then by all means watch. But I am\nwarning you--there are lots of rape jokes, some full-frontal nudity and\nlots and lots of sex jokes. Worth seeing? I dunno--but it did often\nmake me laugh--especially when I watched the Olympics.\n"
"\nA movie where you can be free to laugh at stereotypical jokes even with\na friend or your girlfriend from a different culture, just to get away\nfrom all the racial tension these days.If you're hypersensitive to\nracial jokes do all of us a favor, do not bother watching it.Even with\nthe crude and sometimes uncomfortable humor, its still a pretty good\nmovie. Though most people prefer Borat to this movie, in my opinion i\nkind of prefer this. Though you might feel guilty afterwards after\nlaughing to the stereotype jokes.However people should remember it is a\nsatire and they should not take the jokes so seriously as some of my\nfriends have.Its just a movie, kickback, relax and enjoy the show.\n"
"\nWell, there is no concerning plot. A simple kick to the governments:\nfascism, democracy &amp; dictatorship!

And if you are not, also don't think that's how things run\nin moslems countries. <br><br>This is pure entertainment and this movie is perfect to watch with your\nbuddies, over some beers and snacks.<br><br>There are some scene which are way overdone, too long that made the\nscene less funny, but it's OK. You will forgive it and forget it. Just\nlike the movie itself.<br><br>There is surprise cameo of ... and that's kinda cool moment. Good dude\ngone 'euw' kind of cameo. Don't worry there are some gross things in\nstore enough to make you say yuck. Or gigantic breasts and some hot\nchicks doing pointless scenes. Come on, it's typical.<br><br>It's not as original as Borat. Not the best comedy of the year. Not\neven the best performance of comedic cast ensemble. But then again,\nforgive you have logic and forget you have brain, and you'll have a\ngood giggles here and there.\n"
"\nsometimes a mediocre artist produces one moment of genius that makes\ntheir career worthwhile whereas, as is often is the case, another who\nhas produced moments of comic genius in the recent past reaches a point\nwhere they unleash on the public a moment of dumb, formulaic crap.<br><br>Those hoping for the same quality of humour that Sach Baren Cohen\nreached with Ali G, Borat and Bruno will be disappointed with this\neffort and pray that he finds a way to revitalise his career and reach\nthe same levels of comedy as he did before.<br><br>Worst thing he's done since Ali G Indahouse. That's forgivable, but\nhere's hoping he doesn't end up like Eddie Murphy and Steve Martin and\nreturns to form one day soon.\n"
"\nVery good movie! At Borat and Bruno there were a parts of the movie I\nliked but with this one I can't even put a number on a things I liked.\nAlthough it looks cruel at some moments, when you think about it,\neverything is perfectly at place and right up to the point. There will\nbe people who wont get this movie because it moves them from their\npoint of perspective so they wont feel comfortable. If you free your\nmind from all you know about dictatorships before you watch this movie,\nyou will find it profoundly courageous and deep, as one comedy can be.<br><br>The only thing I do not appreciate the most is the thing that he got\ncarried away from the point at some moments and trying to satisfy\ndifferent viewers with different attitudes so he can \"trigger\" them\nalso.<br><br>Highly recommendable movie for everyone.\n"
"\nThat was just awesome. There's only one is a 100 years like Sacha Baron\nCohen. I was worried when I prepared to watch this movie. So I've\ndecided to select a Jim Carrey movie. Just for a moment, my eyes stuck\nat Cohen and he got selected. The past 80 minutes of my life has one of\nthe best 80 minutes I've ever been. In short, now I turned to be a big\nfan of him and searched all his works and bought all of them from\nAmazone and just finish watching. This is all a one man show and as it\nshould be. If you want to laugh and to get some relief from tension,\nread the Bible first and then watch any movie of Sacha Baron Cohen,\nespecially this one.\n"
"\nBorat, Bruno, and now the Dictator. I thought this was going to be just\na third movie with the same style and genital jokes.. far from it. This\nwas well written, the jokes are hilarious, and the jokes poke fun at\neveryone from Hollywood, the global elite, the US and the Middle East.\nSome of the jokes are so subtle that I'm betting a good majority of the\npeople don't even realize they're there. Not all jokes in this movie\nare slapstick crude jokes, many of them are observational and you need\nto have a little knowledge on class/power differences from the elite to\nthe layman.<br><br>***SPOILER ALERT**** The ending speech where he tells the USA how they\nwould love a dictatorship and proceeds to describe what it could bring\nto them (and perfectly describes the US as it currently is, then\nrealizes he described a democracy, and then instills a \"democracy\" in\nhis country) is genius.\n"
"\nHaffaz Aladeen (Sacha Baron Cohen) is the tyrannical ruler of the\nRepublic of Wadiya. His uncle Tamir (Ben Kingsley) schemes to take\nover. Aladeen escapes and loses his identity. He has trouble fitting in\nas a nobody in New York and hippie store owner Zoey (Anna Faris) gives\nhim a job.<br><br>Sacha Baron Cohen is at it again with another character. There's\ndefinitely a lot of Colonel Ghaddafi in this personality. I LOVE Borat.\nIt is one of the most brilliant comedy in recent memory. On the other\nhand, I HATE Brüno and Ali G is watchable only in short bursts. Why?\nIt's hard to explain but funny is sometimes very personal. I like The\nDictator.\n"
"\nBorat is a distant memory by now, but a fond one even if it isn't the\nlaugh riot it was the first time. I don't know why Sacha Baron Cohen is\nstill trying to do these low-brow types of satires when I know he has\nthe talent for so much more, both comedy and drama. Taking on a more\nconventional style of comedy, The Dictator ends up pretty generic. It\ngoes for cheap blows and on-the-nose laughs and tries too hard to be\nshocking. It can be funny at times but only when standards are dropped\nquite low. I didn't have much expectations but it's unsurprisingly\ndisappointing. It is entertaining enough to pass the time but I wish\nthey'd spent more time on the movie than the marketing.<br><br>5/10\n"
"\nIndeed, this was a romantic comedy and goats were not directly\ninvolved. It had a head and a heart that raised it above the level of\nthe humour which was substantial on its own. And in fact the humour and\nthe romance played off each other in a way that enhanced both. No, this\nis not an all time great movie, but it was a year's great for this\ngenre, which is admittedly thin. <br><br>It was not a film that required great acting, and none was evident but\nthis did not detract from the film either. The story line and\nrapid-fire jokes kept the movie going and it went by all to quickly.<br><br>If the dictators of the world watched it, I am sure that they would\nlaugh at themselves - before sending out an execution squad to\neliminate Sasha Baron Cohen.\n"
"\nThis movie does have some shocking humor that was funny and some that\nwas gross. Also, this movie is less than 90 minutes, it was very short.\nSome of the better jokes are Aladeen order executions and learning they\nwere never carried out, the wall of girls' pictures, stealing the head,\nthe head under the covers, the exposed bathrobe, birthing the baby, the\nhelicopter ride with the other couple. There's definitely some laughs\nthere even though there wasn't much to this story. Anna Farris wasn't\nthat great in this. I didn't like the wig she had to wear.<br><br>FINAL VERDICT: If you like crude humor, I'm sure you'll want to check\nthis out.\n"
"\nSacha Baron Cohen takes a time out from his candid camera style films\nto give us a scripted one (though he's probably so well known now,\nsomething like Borat or Bruno wouldn't work anyway). It's a generally\nfunny affair that will keep a smile on your face throughout, but there\nare no real belly laughs. As for the plot, the most charitable thing I\ncan say is at least it sets things up for the MANY hit-and-miss gags.<br><br>It's strange: a lot of the humour would have been shocking even 15\nyears ago, but now jokes about sexual assaults on young boys and\nfellatio with a decapitated head seem to be the norm, rather than the\nexception. Is this a key example of our steep moral decline? I'll leave\nit up to talk radio to decide... 6/10\n"
"\nAlthough some scenes are quite long drawn-out and are kinda hard to\nwatch, my overall impression of this movie is a good one. <br><br>The beginning is funny and delivers a nice preview of the rest of the\nmovie. Then it gets a little boring with stale jokes until they arrive\nin America, where my favorite scenes, the demonstration of the torture\nequipment and its criticism on the part of Aladeen and the helicopter\nflight take place. Again, the movie becomes a little bit stale with\noccasional laughs but overall more story-advancing than funny scenes.<br><br>The ending however is made really well and had me break out in laughter\nquite a few times. At the same time it's still original and not the way\nyou'd expect it to be (I'm not going to spoil it here, though).<br><br>What I especially like about this movie is its hidden criticism not\nonly of African and Asian dictatorship but also of America and western\ncultures (see opening of Aladeen's long speech at the congress, \"why\ndictatorship is great\").\n"
"\nHm, disappointing. Sure, I did not expect a high culture movie from\nSacha Baron Cohen, but Borat was a pleasant surprise. While Bruno was\nsomewhat disappointing too, I got my hopes up for two reasons. The\nfirst was reading this was to have more of a story as well. The second\nwas the surprisingly memorable performance by Baron Cohen in Scorsese's\nHugo. But The Dictator is merely a chain of sketches stitched together\nto form a story. This would not be a problem if most of it was funny\n(see Borat), but there is too little material which is of good enough\ncomedic value. Bruno was disappointing, but at least successful in its\nuncompromising bad humour. This leaves no impression at all.\n"
"\nThis movie was really funny.<br><br>My friends suggested to watch this movie to me.But I think this movie\nwas not very successful. Because there was not many action in the\nmovie. But I liked market scenes.<br><br>I laughed very much at starting of movie. I thought \"it will be more\nfunny in next scenes\", but movie failed me. In my opinion remaining of\nmovie is bad.<br><br>Actor doesn't like democracy and he is a dictator really.If there had\nbeen more intrigue in the movie, It would have been more interesting.<br><br>Thats why I give 6 out of 10.\n"
"\nIn typical irreverent humor, Cohen has a unique way of presenting\nreality in the most provocative way; he excels at it. In this movie,\nthe character is perhaps chosen because the subject could not be more\ncontemporary. There are some very funny moments and an abundance of not\nso funny ones. As with all the previous Sacha Baron Cohen characters,\nhe plays the role of a character you would really love to beat the sh**\nout of; so he provides that outlet like few others do. There are\nsupporting cast members and cameos that also add greatly to an\notherwise mediocre production. I did have fun watching it, but I picked\nan appropriate time to do so; it's perfect when you have a lull in your\nviewing schedule.\n"
"\nThis movie is not intended for cultured and educated people. I've seen\nthis one with a friend of mine on the plane heading for home. First I\ndidn't intend to finish watching it, but I thought, \" I have much time,\nwhy not spend some on this trash.\" I think this movie was produced\ncompletely by Israeli ones. It has a political message to deliver to\nthe audience. The theme of the film is utterly absurd. The comedy is\nartificially unnatural. The is no plausible sequence of events. The\nmain point is how to deform the picture of the other in any possible\nway. We know Mr Cohen is an English actor, but at the same time he\nholds the Israeli citizenship.\n"
"\nThe only funny thing about this movie - are the raving reviews of\npeople who thought it was funny!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! ... Sacha Baron Coen\nwrote this movie as: a joke! He is now reading all these *Good reviews\nof his *Terribly unfunny film and he is laughing his socks off! No Brit\nis going to be impressed by this film... and he knows it... He is\nlaughing reading IMDb reviews! The Joke is on the public for sure... I\nthink it was his evil plot all along - to make a terrible movie and\nthen laugh at all the people who laughed... I still love him though!\nEven if he is totally taking the Mickey! He can't help himself... He is\nfamous enough now to get away with it.... LOL\n"
"\nOkay first of all, I liked Borat really funny movie. Bruno that was\nokay, but not so funny. But then \"The Dictator\" Saw it today, it's\noutrageously funny to watch with your friends or alone. Cohen is\nsomething really \"Laugh out of loud\" man. Jokes were funny and\nhilarious to watch some real-life situations. It's not a masterpiece or\ncomedy gold. <br><br>But really MUST see one, something different by other comedy movies.\nOverall it's damn good and i like too see it again. Acting was good,\noutrageously, disgusting jokes, very offensive ones, but laughable. Go\nsee it.\n"
"\nTHE DICTATOR (2012) ** Sacha Baron Cohen, Anna Faris, Jason Mantzoukas,\nBen Kingsley, John C. Reilly, Kevin Corrigan, Bobby Lee, Fred Armisen,\n(Cameo : Megan Fox as herself) Lackluster satire from Baron Cohen as\nruthless fictional terrorist leader Haffaz Alladeen of Wadiya (as in\nwhat-a-ya-kiddn'-me!) whose attempt to deliver a fiery speech at the\nUnited Nations has him replaced by his idiot decoy and the\nfish-out-of-water despot trying desperately to fend for himself in The\nBig Apple with the unlikely help from organic food store owner Faris\n(again sadly misused and robbed of her naturally comedic talents).\nHamstrung screenplay by Cohen, Alec Berg, David Mandel and Jeff\nSchaffer has more misses-than-hits and the static direction by the\nusually on-target Larry Charles is woefully inept. A misfire for Baron\nCohen and co.\n"
"\nSacha Baron Cohen is a strange guy, a bit too much in many ways, but he\nalso got a sense of humor that is different from many other\n\"comedians\", it is very crude and to the point, so much so that it just\nbecomes corny for me.<br><br>I liked this film more then I had expected I would, I thought it was\nmore in the lines of Borat then an actual film. It definitely have its\nmoments and there is a lot to laugh about, both in big silly somebody\ngot hurt kind of way, but also in the more subtle references and\nbehaviors of the characters, the latter works best for me in this film.<br><br>I am not a fan, it had its moments, but not really my kind of comedy.\nIt does work well as a plot and setup and the film is nicely put\ntogether, but all in all I was expecting more and hoping that this\nwould be more to my liking, but it was not.\n"
"\nI found this movie just offensive on so many levels. The thing that\njust disgusted me the most is what I will deal with here. He blatantly,\nand very obviously, ripped off The Great Dictator and replaced all the\ngrace and beauty in Chaplin's original with crass, crude, and very\nlowest common denominator gags. And that enlightened, oh so amazing\nspeech he gives at the end of the movie? Watch Chaplin's original to\nsee what the real thing sounds like, and how beautiful and moving it\nis. This is just a really awful, disrespectful abuse of a true genius's\nwork by someone arrogant enough to think no one would realize it was a\ncomplete rip off, and a bad one at that.\n"
"\nSo good, I still laugh till I cry two days later. Ingenious. You may\ndisagree with its jokes and its bluntness, but feel free to have a good\nlaugh. It is OK. If you are a man of any other culture than that of the\nUnited States, you might be able to relate and enjoy the movie more\nthan the average American. If you are an American who has been exposed\nto other cultures, that would make you above average by the way, you\ncan at least learn to appreciate the movie, if you do not already. If\nyou are an activist of almost any sort or a feminist, you might find it\noffensive. One thing for certain is that the dictator shine a little\nlight upon our deepest desires, the things we discuss among those who\nshare our core values. The Dictator is a must see regardless of your\norientation religiously, sexually, politically,...\n"
"\nSuccess spoils talent. We see it everywhere. This movie is a prime\nexample. The Ali G Show (HBO) is Cohen at his best. Crazy, edgy,\nhilarious, and above all, BRAVE. Borat was a tad childish but very\ngood, with some amazing moments. Bruno was uneven, homophobic and a bit\ncruel - but also with its moments (the scenes with the Mexican\n\"furniture\" is not to be missed). Now we have The Dictator. While I\ncommend Cohen for giving a shot at scripted comedy, and fully\nabandoning the impromptu \"reality\" comedy he excelled at, sadly it was\na complete miss. I did not laugh a single time in this terrible,\npointless sell-out of a movie. A couple nervous laughs at the beginning\nas I hoped it would get better... but it never did. A complete and\nutter embarrassment, on a part with Hangover II as one of the biggest\ncomedy disappointments of the decade. Awful, awful, awful. And to make\nthings even worse, not a shred of the intelligence or multi-layered\nhumor Cohen is deservingly famous for.\n"
"\nthis is really worst movie i have seen . not a single time i feel like\nlaughing . a movie starts with a leader laughing speech on nuclear\nweapon and obama taking action on weapon . a baby was born with a 5inch\nbeard and long penile hair .what the hell is going on .leader goes to\nUSA and someone cut his care and unwanted story begins .with the help\nof cute girl and his native country scientist he gave speech on\ndemocracy which all like . story revolve round some cheap comedy scenes\nand a look alike who ejaculates milk from beautiful lady breast . king\nof wadiya don't know about masturbation and many insane part which make\nme suffer headache ,,i recommend don't watch this movie !\n"
"\nAs a fan of Borat and Ali G, I was excited by the launch of the film,\nand was evermore excited anticipating the next 1 and a half hours of\nanother beautifully humorous Sacha Baron Cohen classic. For The\nDictator is a film among many riddled with tasteless or sometimes in a\nexcessively grotesque and childish demeanour, (not that the film is\nmature, but consists of comedy that has not yet outgrown the\nplayground, distinguishing from previous Sacha films). Overall it\nsurpasses the classic and highly amusive humour Sacha Baron Cohen has\npreviously achieved originally, which has therefore ended the film in\nan utter disappointment.\n"
"\nHere is the short story of this movie. The trailers are way much better\nthan the movie. From the beginning to the end, the movie is full of\njokes but most of them are really not funny. Compared to the previous\nmovies of Cohen, this one is at least worth watching. There was less\ninsult, less adult content, more jokes that everybody can enjoy. The\nstory line was not so brilliant but at least it was coherent. Acting\nwas kind of OK. Considering the trailer was better than the movie, I\nmust say the directing was not so great. Overall, an average movie. It\nwas worth the time I spent but I am not so sure whether it was worth\nthe money I paid.\n"
"\nI almost split my sides laughing. Yes, it's crude, politically\nincorrect and trivial but - at the end of the day - it is funny,\nuplifting and entertaining. I read the fatuous politically correct\nreview by James Berardinelli, who picked holes in this film - but he's\ngot his nose so far up his own \"alladeen\" that he misses the point...\nThis is a film to make you laugh. People who watch this film expecting\nto find some wonderful sense of enlightenment will be disappointed - in\nwhich case go and see some French film that shows a surly man smoking a\ncigarette commenting on Life, The Universe and Everything. Watch this\nmovie if you want a belly laugh and don't want to analyse the film with\nconnoisseurs and pretentious twits over multiple glasses of chardonnay\nand late coffees.... I loved the film. It made me feel good and giggle.\nIt's a shame there aren't more movies like it. The world's miserable\nenough. We need more inane laughter - it's good for the soul.\n"
"\nThe Dictator is hilarious; although it does not give the same affect as\nBorat and Bruno it is still genuinely hilarious. It is shocking,\ndisturbing, vile. I had to look away sometimes at how terrible it\nreally was, the humiliation in the film is unexpected and you can tell\nwhen the moments aren't unscripted. It is like Ali G on acid. It is\nsensational. All the way through I was hysterical. I nearly peed myself\nat one moment :/ It is a very enjoyable film, the thing with Sacha\nBarron Cohen you either love his films or hate them, and nothing will\nchange about that. The same rules apply for Dictator. You will love it\nor hate it. simple as.\n"
"\nWhat is with Sacha portraying stereotypical Muslims in all his major\nlead roles minus Bruno. I am not bias towards any religion but seems\nlike this Jewish person is really intimidated by Muslims. Look at Ali\nG, Borat and now Aladeen. <br><br>He definitely can make outrageous comedies but he needs to come up with\nfresh ideas and stop beating the dead horse.<br><br>Also I am not sure if he is confident with his sexuality, dudes are\nalways making out in his movies and rubbing on each other naked. This\nis getting really old and stale.<br><br>Sure, there were some good jokes in the movie but again they were on\nstereotypical Muslims expense. I didn't find anything original in this\nmovie.\n"
"\nThe Dictator  CATCH IT (B-) There are some movies people will always\nwatch it even if you tell them don't watch it. The Dictator falls under\nthat category, it's not that movie is dreadful it's just its not as\ngreat as we had expected from Sacha Baron Cohen since Borat. The\nDictator is mostly funny, in addition to being obscene, disgusting,\nscatological, vulgar, crude and so on but somehow it doesn't work all\ntogether. Especially his scenes with Anna Faris are tedious. Sacha\nBaron Cohen is good but certainly not great. Anna Faris is OK but she\nisn't that funny with Beiber hair cut. Megan Fox one liner cameo was\nalright. On the whole, The Dictator is disappointing but still\nwatchable because crude antics of The Dictator.\n"
"\nI am not a fan of movies like Borat, or even a Dumb and Dumber type\nfilm, or even the scream parodies are dumb to me. My boss paid for us\nto see this film. Everyone voted and I lost. Or should I say I won. I\ngot to leave work early and laugh the entire film. I am so happy I was\nforced to see it. I was dreading it all week, and I ended up thinking\nit was extremely funny. It is not a PC film.... I guess I loved that\ntoo, which also surprised me. But it is not gimmicky, not the same old\nsame old, not a shock fest to be one... It is funny! My face and\nstomach hurt from laughing so much. See it... Adults only. But see it.\nSo happily surprised. I have never seen a film quite like this one. If\nanyone would have bet me in advance I'd even like it a little I would\nhave lost. I really thought I would HATE it. Yet I love it. See this\nfilm and be happily surprised like I was. Absolutely no kids though. It\nis too adult in humor.\n"
"\nIf you are a fan of hilarious , delicate, taboo, politically incorrect\nmovies then this is yours.<br><br>great great great fun. Seriously Nobody stopped laughing all time, i\nalmost cried, some funny middle east accent, some racial abuses, a\nwrong very wrong Dictator, that never masturbate. Aladeen is the best\ndictator, it's a mix , with a plot that you already know about in the\ntrailer, and so it goes on, but one of the finest political movie , and\nactually if you know the world you will see the truth in the movie,\nbecause the movie actually is telling the truth.<br><br>Big up Sasha, you are the man<br><br>must watch\n"
"\nThe best part about The Dictator is also what holds it back. Most Cohen\nmovie lovers(that are sane) will rate Borat as his crowning\nachievement, which means all other movies will be judged with bias. The\nDictator stands alone in that the entire movie is scripted, thus the\nfunny moments, though plenty, are carefully positioned in between\nmoments of actual plot. The movie uses cameos, stills and references to\nmany celebrities and politicians in a very humorous (Canadian spelling)\nway. Another thing Cohen did well was his trailers, there was very\nlittle similarity from what was shown on TV to what was shown on the\nbig screen. Overall, it was a great improvement over his last movie\nBruno and on par with Borat.<br><br>PS: Stay for the credits there are lots more laughs.\n"
"\none the worst movies i have ever seen &gt;&gt; full of unethical scenes and i\ncould even love once , full of hatred and racism , and of course now i\nknow why after knowing that the hero is Jewish . AWFUL, totally of\ntrash I totally hated this movie But I struggled to watch it till the\nend . meaningless movie . full of symbolism towards Muslim countries.\nThe leader of a country appear like a stupid gay , unaware of\neverything and care only about sex , with women or men , and killing\nall people around him literally , how come this is a movie and against\nracism . stupid movie stupid actor stupid theme stupid direction, and\nfor + 30 viewers .\n"
"\n*** This review may contain spoilers ***<br><br>The title is about a dictator who's trying to stop democracy from\nreaching his country but whats the movie really about is mocking other\nculture and very disgusting racism and insulting religion and some\nshallow knowledge about Arabs , i don't really know who sacha think he\nis. even when he showed in red carpet he came and made a mess ,he gotta\nstop this silly comedy but i don't think so because this is all he got\n, clowning and insulting, this think can never be comedy. sacha really\nhave a serious issues and i'm not going to watch any of his movies\nbecause it is a waste time and clowning is not really my taste and what\ni think this movie deserve is 1 of 10 and no more. this actor can ride\nhis camel back home .this movie is really what prove that comedy now is\nnot very good and its turned into clowning .\n"
"\nThey should have hired the guy who wrote the trailer to write the\nmovie. <br><br>I didn't find it funny.. only a few and sporadic moments here and\nthere, and most of them are in the trailer anyway.<br><br>I am not sure why the writers had to spoil a perfect canvas for comedy\nto take the story from political satire about a dictator to some mushy\nlove story that insults the intelligence of anyone watching.<br><br>What a disappointment. They had all the potential to make something\nthat can knock your socks off but they resorted to stuff that reminded\nme of House Bunny. No surprise she was in both movies. <br><br>So, if you find House Bunny, Waterboy, and other crap/fart/accent jokes\nfunny, knock yourself out. <br><br>If you were hoping for something a bit above the waist line,\nseriously.. don't bother.\n"
"\nHollywood is a sanitized labor ward and it takes Sacha to rev things\nup. However, this time I am wondering if he has ever been to the movies\nhimself? Not only a complete rip off of the extremely talented Turturro\nfrom \"don't mess with the Zohan\", it was just boring, not funny and a\nfeeling of when will it end or get funny. Sacha is clever, but maybe\nwith less money, less ego and maybe he should go to the movies\nsometimes, I thought this was Turturro, funny how no reviews mention\nthis? Being Jewish is not a license for poo jokes. This film could have\ngood, maybe with a script? Better jokes, less poo jokes. 65 mill on\nwhat? The people who actually enjoy this movie are the same people the\nfilm is making fun of. Missing this mark is an understatement.\n"
"\nSacha Baron Cohen's take on the late and unlamented Colonel Qaddafi\nmakes for a hit-and-miss movie that misses more than it hits. As\nGeneral Alaldeen's Machiavellian adviser Tamir, Sir Ben Kingsley looks\nmighty uncomfortable at being in this schlock, as well he might.<br><br>There are some un-PC observations (racist, homophobic, anti-feminist,\nanti-vegetarian - you name it, Sacha trashes it) but the threadbare\nplot and scenes that fall flat leave THE DICTATOR floundering for much\nof its 90 minutes. Funny moments and one-liners are not enough: a\ncomedy needs sustained scenes of hilarity and THE DICTATOR has hardly\nany of these. The humour targets pre-teens and the frat-house\nmentality. In BORAT and BRUNO Baron Cohen entertainingly satirized\nbigotry and intolerance in the US; now that he's playing a bigot,\nsatire and entertainment go out the window.<br><br>American Reunion, two weeks ago, was rude, crude, well-scripted and\ngenerally funny. THE DICTATOR is rude, crude, poorly scripted and\nnowhere near funny enough.\n"
"\nThis movie is incredibly OFFENSIVE. To Muslims, to Indians, and to\nArabs. I feel very disgusted by this movie, and how they presented\nother nations. It is presenting Arabs as cruel, disgusting, \"ride\ncamels on daily basis\", unsympathetic, etc.. Yes, the movie does talk\nabout a made up country but still, there are a lot of offensive things\nto Arabs that go along with it.<br><br>Very shameful, I think the case would be totally different if the\nwriters, producers, and directors as well as Sasha had a better\nunderstanding of those nations they were talking about instead of just\njudging it based on the lies they hear and watch.\n"
"\nThis movie is a complete refreshment for any body who understands the\nArabic influenced English. It will make you laugh and laugh out loud.\nEvery dialogue of the movie is worth listening and it gives you smile\nin return . Go for it people it is the best comedy movie and even much\nmore interesting than scary movie series ..... :)Movie starts with\nhumor and end on a very good and emotional note that will make you\nthink . Movie ends up with a critical joke on democracy and its\nimplementation versus the dictatorship .Acting is superb and timing of\ncomedy \"comic sense \" is quite awesome. The males in the movie dominate\nthe female actresses .... :) ooops there is only one woman in the movie\nrest are private guards of the dictator .\n"
"\nAfter Bruno I was not expecting too much from this film, but it\ndelivered laughs in spades. My family had fun watching it.<br><br>The movie had searing political satire and hilarious slapstick comedy.\nSome of it was pretty twisted, but was so outlandish it avoided being\noffensive. I don't see why anyone would watch the unrated version of\nthis movie, surely many of the best parts would be missed.<br><br>You have to abandon all seriousness when you walk into this movie.\nCohen has really gone after some of humanities idiotic inconsistencies\nand after what happened a few days ago in Benghazi over an equally\nsilly film, people need to realize this is what it is, humor.\n"
"\nWhen I sat down to watch this movie I have to admit that I did so with\na few preconceptions about what to expect. I was not impressed by Sacha\nBaron Cohens, Ryan Seacrest/ashes stunt as for me, it was just\npublicity for it's own sake, and, yes, I know, 'no such thing as bad\npublicity!' but still! poor! That aside, this movie, simple, and\nfollowing a 'clash of cultures' format that has worked well for Cohen\nin the past (as well as for many others before him) it was entertaining\nand funny, while at the same time being racist, sexist, misogynistic,\nhomophobic...all of those things we hate in the intolerant shadows of\nsociety, but all at a level that is made acceptable by the satirical\nnature of the movie. It's intended to be mildly offencive, and it is,\nbut funny with it! Not rolling in the isle's funny, but funny!\n"
"\nIf you get bothered by dirty and sick humor, you'll stay away from this\nmovie or moan on your wasted time and money! There are many cons I'd\nmention: 1. Racism 2. Religious Prejudice 3. Religion Abuse 4. Poor\nCast 5. Dirty and I mean dirty storyline 6. Rubbish dialogues Complete\ncrap. When you watch parody movies like: Vampires Suck, Scary Movie\netc. that's a thoughtful item but this is pure junk. Stay Away!\nMoreover, It's completely inappropriate for family and children. Sick\nnudism and flashing was made part of every scene that is about to come.\nThere are few place where you'd like to keep pushing to see full movie\nbut when time keeps passing, you get more and more disappointed.\n"
"\nIf I could've voted negative, I would have. This is by far the worst of\nhis movies I've seen. I wanted to laugh, and even tried a few times,\nbut it was really only out of pity. I truly wish I could take back the\nhour and a half that I spent watching it. I can't believe this actually\nmade it to film. Don't waste your time or money, even if it's only a\ndollar rental. I actually paid $5.99 to rent this on demand, and I\nreally feel cheated, annoyed and betrayed. SBC should really consider a\nnew line of work, because his acting is questionable, and really makes\nhim look like a giant, goofy ridiculous man. I sort of liked Borat, and\ntolerated Bruno, even though I feel guilty for finishing it. SBC needs\nto try a different genre if he wants to continue acting, because these\nroles do not suit him, or vice versa.\n"
"\nFor those who are offended by this movie, you have no business watching\na Sasha Baren Cohen movie. You're probably the same type who thinks\nTarantino's movies are just about violence. Sasha Baren Cohen is a Jew\nplaying an Islamic dictator; what were you expecting?<br><br>I didn't really like Borat and I hated Bruno but this movie was\ngenuinely funny. Sasha once again shows how he can be so offensively\nfunny. Yes, he pushes the boundaries with his comedy and he does go\nover board a lot of the time but this one was actually done well. <br><br>This is the type of movie where you'll need to listen to every line\nspoken because so many jokes are thrown at you at times, it's hard to\nrecognize all of them. Definitely 10 times better than I thought it'd\nbe. LOL even the music is done hilariously.<br><br>1 thumb up\n"
"\nAfter watching Borat and Bruno I was hooked and couldn't wait to watch\nthe 'dictator.' However, the movie was a huge disappointment. It was so\nboring that I didn't want to sit through the whole movie. Please don't\nwaste your money on this one.<br><br>Cohen is brilliant as Ali G, Borat and Bruno, but he's terrible in\nscripted comedy. There were plenty of scenes that tried to shock the\naudience and make them feel disgusted. But the jokes were just not\nfunny. The actors were irritating to watch. I still can't believe that\nCohen made this one. Cohen's talent is for improvised comedy. He should\nstick to that.\n"
"\nAwesome, funny, and very good @ pointing out some of the realities in\ntoday's geopolitical landscape Very equal opportunity @ insulting\neveryone Also very good @ poking fun @ true dictators (past and\ncurrent)-it seems they captured the top 5 of them of the past 30 years.\nQuite provocative yet well put together. Enjoyed it greatly.. and I\nwill likely to watch it few more times. Unlike the Borat, this is a\nmovie with everyone being actors, so effectively series of skits - aka\nSNL. Quite a few details captured in the movie, so watch and laugh! Few\nscenes (like in Borat) went over \"my line\" but all in good fun If you\nlike Borat, you will love it... otherwise, you will hate it!<br><br>And yes, I like watching documentaries with a ducks... like Nuclear\nNadal has pointed out...before his \"execution\" 8)\n"
"\nDon't know where to start. Just been to see this film and could never\nstop laughing. When I thought it couldn't get any funnier, it did!\nSacha Baron Cohen is clearly an excellent writer as the jokes in it are\ngenius. I love the humour of it! Although it is a short film, the jokes\nthat it includes seem to pay off. As well as the comedy being\nbrilliant, the actual plot/storyline is superb also. From watching the\ntrailer, and then watching the film, it was actually a completely\ndifferent story to how I thought it was going to be. The plot made the\nfilm funnier. I would recommend that you all watch it as I would\ncertainly watch it again, a lot more as this film is a work of art. It\nisn't for the easily-offended but if this is your sort of humour then\nyou need to go and watch it now!\n"
"\nThis movie was so idiotic,parts of it were\nunwatchable.....unfunny,gross with horrible acting...how ben kingsley\nagreed to do this crap is beyond me!..What a waste of time...Im glad I\ndidn't have to go out to see this garbage....Please someone try to find\nanything funny in this poor excuse for a movie\n"
"\nI'm a big fan of Sacha Baron Cohen and 'Borat' remains today one of my\nfavourite comedy movies of all time. No matter how many movies he\nmakes, I doubt any of them will come close to 'Borat'. I was a fan of\n'Bruno' too, so I couldn't wait to see what 'The Dictator' had to\noffer. I did enjoy it, but I do think that Cohen's other movies are\nbetter.<br><br>'The Dictator' is refreshingly politically incorrect at a time when\nfilm-makers go out of their way to avoid causing offense. I thought the\ncharacter 'Zoey', an obnoxious left-wing feminist, was a particularly\nfunny and accurate representation of many people in society today. I\nloved that side of the movie. However, I did feel that there were\nchunks of the movie that didn't provide any laughs whatsoever, which\nwas disappointing for a Cohen film.<br><br>'The Dictator' is an entertaining and funny film, but I must admit that\nit didn't meet my high expectations. Probably Cohen's worst film, but\nstill worth a watch.\n"
"\nAfter watching BORAT a couple of years ago I must confess I've become a\nfan of Sacha Baron Cohen's extreme brand of humor. Where BORAT was\nbasically a series of pranks stringed together to make up a movie,THE\nDICTATOR is indeed a movie with plot. The kind of humor seen in this\nmovie will certainly enrage quite a few (arabs, Jews, Muslims, 9-11\nvictims, New Yorkers, etc), but the extreme nature of the movie's humor\nhas a very definite message towards the U.S. Sure, not all jokes work\nall the time and sometimes they seem forced, but I must confess I\nactually enjoyed most of THE DICTATOR. Imagine Sacha Baron Cohen as an\nextreme Adam Sandler (some of his jokes do resemble Adam Sandler and\nRob Schneider). <br><br>THE DICTATOR is political satire at its most extreme and some people\nmight even find it disgusting but I just had huge laughs for it and I\ncan't wait to see it again.\n"
"\nThe Dictator has sweet crude humor and social satire galore. I\nliterally couldn't stop laughing throughout this film it was so funny.\nAll the self- juicing jokes were probably the best. I loved watching\neveryone's reactions to the protagonists crude jokes and blatant sexual\nreferences. The Dictator also points to a lot of flaws in both American\nsociety and Muslim society. The end speech is a good example of how\nboth societies are criticized.<br><br>I can't really say more without spoiling the movie but trust me if you\nlike crude humor and political humor you will love this film. If you do\nnot like this kind of humor though you really shouldn't watch this\nmovie because there is a lot of it.\n"
"\nTHE DICTATOR, it has to be said, is an extremely funny film. Sacha\nBaron Cohen has undertaken the task of attacking those demigods who\nconsider themselves both impregnable and supreme, running their tinpot\ndictatorships. He is largely successful in his task; his Aladeen comes\nacross as incredibly narcissistic, whose philosophy is simple - execute\npeople first, and ask questions later. The film has him coming to the\nUnited States to address the United Nations; this gives director Larry\nCharles the chance to make some trenchant points about so-called\n'democratic' societies which, in their way, are almost as repressive as\nAladeen's. Some of the jokes are extremely vulgar, but delivered with\nan élan that renders all criticism impossible. Ben Kingsley copes well\nwith the thankless task of acting as Baron Cohen's foil, while Anna\nFaris is a feisty love-interest. Not the most memorable comedy,\nperhaps, but certainly an entertaining one.\n"
"\nSacha Baron Cohen's film \"The Dictator\" is too hilarious! Cohen takes\nthe despotic leaders of Syria, Iran, Afghanistan, Egypt etc.--rolls\nthem all up into one tyrannical, misogynist, terrorist package--and\nbecomes the Don Rickles of in-your-face, race-based, satirical comedy.\nHis portrayal of a Middle Eastern dictator is racist, offensive and a\njoy to watch. There is a \"goat\" milking scene that will make you bust a\ngut.<br><br>Cohen also spoofs liberal, lefty, tree hugging activists--lampooning\ntheir assault on the establishment and global no-goodniks everywhere.\nIn a series of mistaken identity plots, his character falls in love\nwith an over-achieving vegan from Amherst College who he meets at a\nprotest rally outside the UN.<br><br>I laughed hard when I heard the Arabic language versions of\n\"Funkytown,\" Marvin Gaye's \"Let's Get It On\" and other R&amp;B classics.\nThis movie is a smart, entertaining political satire. It's good to\nlaugh about the Middle East for a change. I laughed until I cried.\n"
"\nI have to say I really enjoyed this movie and look forward to any other\nnew Sacha Baren Cohen films in the future. It had many controversial\njokes but I just thought they were hilarious, it simply added to my\nenjoyment. Not many recent movies have made me actually laugh out loud.\nAs I said, it reminded me of \"You Don't Mess with the Zohan\" but that's\nokay, another great film. \"The Dictator\", in my opinion, is Cohen's\nsecond best movie. 1.) Borat (It's a classic) 2.) The Dictator 3.)\nBruno 4.) Ali G (I didn't find it that funny.) The reason why I\nwouldn't give it 10 is the fact that it had a few recycled jokes such\nas the AIDs joke. I highly suggest that you rent/buy it if you haven't\nseen it yet!\n"
"\nIf you like shocking and controversial scenes, black humor in the style\nof South Park this movie is for you. Previous works of this team:\n\"Borat\" &amp; \"Bruno\" was too much for me. Still, even this movie is not\nfor a weak minds. At some points I've asked myself: \"Really? You have a\nnerve to make jokes from these tragic things?\". It seems that the movie\ndoesn't have any censorship which is adorable. Thumbs up for great job\nof director and actors. Perfect reflection of Arabic behaves &amp;\npronunciation. I'd like to emphasize Sacha's impersonation talent. I\ncould never tell that he is Englishman by the movie. He played well,\ntoo well. I worry of his well being now :)\n"
"\nI don't particularly like Sacha Baron Cohen. Although I liked Borat and\nthe Ali G interviews. This film is decent. It could've been a lot\nbetter. And I mean a lot better.<br><br>They're making fun of dictators which could've been much better. But as\nhe only is a dictator for a short while in the movie, there really\nisn't much time to do too much.<br><br>It's OK. Granted, it does have a few scenes that are hilarious. But\nit's not consistent with the laughs.<br><br>Overall, it could've been a lot better but wasn't. While it still\nprovides some very funny moments.\n"
"\nYet, given it's a Sacha Baron Cohen comedy, I'd have liked even more.<br><br>\"Borat\" was large and \"Bruno,\" while often very funny, aimed smaller.\n\"Dictator\" takes Cohen back to the heights he dominates, yet also\nleaves the impression success may be dulling his edge.<br><br>Still, the story is irresistible: Shamelessly sexist Middle Eastern\ndespot falls for hairy-underarms progressive foodie. Combine this\nclassic miss-match with non-stop one-liners targeting a herd of sacred\ncows and you've got an irresistible 83 minutes.<br><br>Some scenes are so over-the-top it's nothing short of amazing (think\n911 attackers, \"see you in 15 minutes,\" and first-time masturbation).\nYet there's a repetitious and obvious quality to some of the humor and\nI think this flick could have been better with tighter editing. <br><br>Even so, Cohen's a stellar talent and I can't wait to see what and who\nhe skewers next.\n"
"\nWhen I asked the lady at the concessions stand if The Dictator was any\ngood, she said, \"well, it's mostly boring, but the funny parts are\nreally funny\". She was so right. There are many boring popcorn scenes\nin this movie.<br><br>I have hated every single Sacha Baron Cohen movie I have ever seen\n(with the exception of Sweeney Todd). However, this movie was pretty\ndecent. The funny parts are what make this movie worth seeing. Anna\nFaris was decently funny. And of course, all the cameos were awesome!<br><br>Of course, I wouldn't pay full price to go see it. Wait till your local\ntheater has a discount day. :)\n"
"\nAs a comedy film which ridicules everything which is discussed in the\nfilm, 'The Dictator' can be seen either with people of one's age,\njuniors or friends. It would be not right to call its opponents\n'Victorian prudes' but under no circumstances should one watch it with\nfamily. American director Larry Charles and actor Sasha Baron Cohen\nhave contrived nicely to make their film replete with sexual innuendos.\nThey also make a lot of fun of nature loving geeks. Some hints of\nauthenticity are witnessed in the portrayal of UN delegates especially\na Chinese diplomat who makes a lot of comical remarks about his wife in\norder to seek false popularity ? American director Larry Charles' film\n\"The Dictator\" is a bad work of art for dictators and their megalomania\ncal images. It is a film which no intelligent dictator would like to\nendorse. Most dictators feel that their actions are always justified.\nFor this reason, they would never like to be remembered for this type\nof hostile portrayal.\n"
"\nFunniest movie i ever watched and believe me i have watched a lot of\nmovies.You can really use some stopwatch and check and i assure you\nthat this movie will definitely make you laugh every 10 seconds(There\nmay be some exceptions like if you are not mature enough to understand\nthe jokes then do not blame me ).Every person who watches this movie\nwill surely become a huge fan of Sacha Baron Cohen.I personally think\nhe is the most intelligent guy in Hollywood.Even the technical parts of\nmovie is awesome. You can see how much money,Thought were given to each\ndetails in the dictators palace and stuff like that.Background score\nand songs also are very impressive.I don't know how some people get\noffended by this as its just for fun and people should take it that way\nas Sacha himself is a jew and he offends them the most.\n"
"\nThis film was not as good as Borat, but from the moment I left the\nmovie theater I knew Ghadaffi was going to fall from power. I thought\nhe would be smart enough to leave Libiya but he was stupid and stayed\nto fight. May be it was better for him to die, then to face loss of a\ncountry he so lovingly worked hard for democracy not to come to it. As\nsoon as the Americans found out that he really had no weapons of mass\ndistraction he was done for good.<br><br>Sasha Baron Cohen was excellent in his role of dictator, but not as\ngood as in Borat.<br><br>Great film to watch, where Libiyan reality convalesces with fiction of\na film.\n"
"\nI thought this story sounded like a bad idea for a movie, but I wanted\nto see it for Sasah BC. <br><br>There were some funny moments. Mostly, it was forgettable. The delivery\nscene was outrageous, and I liked Jason Manzoukas. <br><br>It would have been nice if s.b.c. had made a movie that would get\nenough attention that the speech at the end would have made more of a\ndifference.<br><br>The subplot involving Anna Faris' character was mostly tedious. It\nfeels a bit outdated to still be making fun of the p.c. counterculture\nstereotypes.<br><br>I'd like to see Cohen do something as funny as his HBO series again one\nday. Obviously, he works best in situations that are not scripted.\n"
"\nCompared to his former films such as Borat and Bruno (Ill leave Ali G\nout..., better best forgotten as some naff pop group used to sing) this\nfilm is a lot weaker in terms of outrageous humour, yes there are parts\nof the film that begin to push towards Sacha Baron Cohens uniquely\noutrageous films of the past but then they simmer again as if he has\nbeen ordered to behave himself this time round. Either way, yes its OK\nas a film, it has some funny bits, some dull bits, to be honest in\nhindsight I'd definitely wait for the film to come down in price before\nI even considered buying it. Better spending the money on something\nelse or go watch something at the pictures instead :)\n"
