this movie touch me
the story line is amazing and at the same time lovely as u guys know already that basically that the plot of how to train your dragon 2 is about hiccup reunited with his mother valka
while stoick the vast will continue his love to valka as he thought valka was dead
the voice actor for valka cate blanchett
her voice is just perfect for valka character
the drama for this movie is really touching as the family go up against the enemydrago bloodvist
the graphics for this movie is incredibly stunning
for those people asking whether to watch in 3d my answer is yes it is definitely worth your money
i think this movie is suitable for people in the world as it is one of a kind movie
so just relax enjoy your sit and your popcorn and enjoy watching the movie
the reason i put 3 stars at first place it is because it had nice graphics
other than that the movie was terrible
spoiler alert
hiccups mother left them and never came back because she was looking after dragons
stupid his father and mother find each other after so many years and they want to start over why
she abandoned them anw and then he dies
he dies because of toothless who was under mind control
sad the good alpha dragon just died
toothless and hiccups remain best friends even after toothless killed hiccups dad
all these do not make sense the movie had no plot it was terrible plus the person who makes hiccups voice has a deeply annoying voice
it is not a cartoon movie for kids
it is very dark
and the first one was dark but this one is worse
i think it should be a pg13 movie
the feeling after watching the film was sadness and disappointment
i like cartoons i liked the first one too
but this it was a big failure
i love this movie but each time i see htyd2 it cuts me deep and i keep wondering what has happened to animation industry
these movies are supposed to be for kids
why more and more directors feel obliged to add cruel reality to cartoons
having a family reuniting after 20 years to see them torn apart again by killing one of our favorite characters is really disturbing and it feels so unfair
cartoons are supposed to give us hope
half of this movie was for us to feel happy for hiccup and stoick having found his mother and wife
they tested our empathy and compassion just to be devastated when stoick dies just minutes after dancing with his longlost love
i mean come on you have to be heartless not to feel sick by that
i mean did the directors hoped for a cinema full of children crying
anyway prepare yourselves to share some tears
i just can say damn you dean deblois for killing stoick or should i even say that
how could you kill him
they just met
everybody care about hiccup and astrid yes i did care about them in the first movie but not this one
the love part in this movie belongs to stoick and valka
it was so beautiful how they pair up and dance i loved hiccups lookits full of happiness to see his parents together
they just found each other after 20 years they both deserve more than that one hour
as stoick died i just couldnt enjoy the movie anymore i just watched
it was not fair to valka stoick and hiccup
damn you dean deblois damn you
i hope you pay for this
continued great how to train your dragon  how to train your dragon 2 tries to be higher than its predecessor and almost can  but i still prefer the first  but its still a very good animation the characters are older we are introduced to new characters the film is a bit sad and dramatic than the previous some legal others uninteresting  the night fury is more docile cute and funny in this movie  the soundtrack remains excellent  the voice work is at the same level of the first  great  the plot is good and the battles are good yet how to train your dragon 2 is a bit lower than the first  more is very funny and has some sad moments
note 8
3
hiccup tries to stop a war with a bad guy named drago who wants to control all dragons
hiccup also finds out his mom isnt dead shes just terrible
the first half is light and enjoyable
second half descends into darkness with the senseless killing of stoick
what because hiccups deadbeat mom is back its okay to kill off his dad
how depressing
for me the movie never recovers from this huge downer
the animation is pretty and even better than the first movie
the returning characters are all likable although hiccup grates on my nerves at times
but i felt that way about him in the first one as well
i didnt care for the mom at all
less said about that the better
also the whole preachy peace message is undermined by all the violence and the fact that peace is only achieved at the end by having superior firepower
mixed messages much
if you liked how to train your dragon youll probably like this
but be ready for it to have some flaws that might bother some more than others
i have been a fan of the how to train your dragon franchise since the first movie and when i saw this movie for the first time
it was nothing i had ever seen before
every component of the first movie was expanded and branched out upon
their world has gotten bigger in every way possible
the colors the characters the conflict the dragons
even the score has been expanded and improved to bring about a whole other dimension of their world
how to train your dragon 2 is truly an animated juggernaut and is something that nobody else will be able to upstage
it is possibly the most unique storyline of any animated film out there and is a movie that the entire family can enjoy from ages 8 to 98
heres to you hiccup and toothless
how to train your dragon 2 which is directed by dean deblois is the story of hiccup now at the age of 20 and the growing bond between him and his dragon toothless
i think this is a great film for many reasons
first this is probably the best cinematography ive seen in an animated film
the action is great and aesthetically speaking this movie would definitely get a 1010
this movie really illustrates the growing bond developing between toothless and hiccup and how they cant take each other for granted
this movie also portrays hiccups maturity as opposed to 5 years ago
hiccup is starting to realize that he cant be the chief his father wanted him to be and that hell never replace someone so selfless caring and brave
this movie really has a lot of heart
it delves into themes like responsibility dealing with loss loyalty and peace
how to train your dragon 2 builds upon its predecessor and exceeds it by encompassing the virtues of a true chief
how to train your dragon 2 is definitely worth 5 watches and id highly recommend checking it out
about 1 the 3d too was very good
2 it has some great action sequences
3 i love the main cast
4 finally the great battle with an equally terrific villain
5 the art and background of the story was pretty spectacular
6 the second film after the critical success of the first is what you would expect  bigger louder faster and with excellent attention to detail
7 great adventure action with a bit of mild rude humor
8 filled with great sly humor and breathtaking visuals
9 thenaand one of my absolute favorite aspects of the filmawe have the amazingly beautiful score by john powell that honestly sends me back to the days of classical elegant disney tales
i read review in httpstoprater
comenmoviesobjects2367941 howtotrainyourdragon22014criteria3deffects
well i looked at my review of the previous how to train your dragon in which i gave it nine stars
i havent seen it since then but reading it did bring some good memories of watching it
this sequel was also quite enjoyable though part of me admits that i didnt find myself laughing heartily until the nearclimax involving some of those sheep
but there was quite a lot to be inspired by like the finding of a character thought to be dead or someone who may end up as such
i saw this on imax 3d with my movie theatreworking friend and his nephew and we all enjoyed this immensely
i mean the characterizations were believable enough which brought great emotions when some of the more dramatic scenes were done
and yes the action was awesome as well
so on that note i highly recommend how to train your dragon 2
i saw this movie yesterday
believe me it is really amazing
this is one of the movies that let your mindset change that a sequel can be really nice as mostly they dont live up to the mark
but this one does
it really does keeping the dignity of its previous part
dreamworks has proved that four years of wait was finally worth waiting for
the grownups teens are more convincing than the previous ones
they seem like they have grown so naturally
special effort has been done to hiccup amp astrid to make them look handsome amp beautiful respectively
the movie is much more fundarkercomplicated than the previous one
soundtracks are really amazing
its really a must watch flick
i hardly have any words to describe this piece of art
i fell in love from the very first time i have watched it
the story is very amazing and satisfying and the animation art is so beautiful
the characters are very well chosen for this type of story
the film gives an introduction to the people and especially the young generation that the only beings that do harm and evil to anyone even to themselves were the people and teaches us to be more kind to others and to respect the surrounding around us world that for me was quite enlightening to todays harsh world
hardly recommend this to people who are dragon fans and not only
all i can say is great job dream works
once again you bring happiness to the people around the world with your wonderful movies
my personal score 1010
cant wait for the next movie
lt3
when hiccup and toothless discover an ice cave that is home to hundreds of new wild dragons and the mysterious dragon rider the two friends find themselves at the center of a battle to protect the peace
darker and more mature than the previous film but also more heavily action packed and with some really beautiful places and new characters coming in how to train your dragon 2 is for me at least better than the first one and it also has something that i didnt expect to happen a sudden death occurred and it was painful to watch it it puts a friendship on the line but also the fate of dragons and it just made the movie even better not only as a sequel but also as a film on its own
this movie is amazing
sad that all the lego fans are being rude abut this movie
but this movie will make you very emotional
i watched it 3 times and it made me cry every time
and for the characters they actually make them develop unlike a lot of movies
the animation is gorgeous and i will say its the best animation ive ever seen
they made everything so detailed
you can see the scars and freckles on everyones faces
and they didnt make the characters perfect looking
they made them have flaws
like valka with her wrinkles and her grey hair same with stoick
the villain was a little clicha but it makes up for it at the end
scene are amazing
if you havent seen this movie yet
go see it
the movie is far the best from the sequel of how to train your dragon
it shows excellent emotions with amazing animated graphics mixed cartoon with realism
it has unexpected moments it has funny romantic sad and epic moments
you will never regret from watching this movieit really sticks to your heart
im 21 and watched these movies since toy story dreamworks makes an amazing job to please not just the kidsbut also adults
the main characters become even greater and it will make you wish they existed in your life
i recommend this movie for everybody of any age who enjoys animated movies
but be sure to watch the 1st movie
because this one is even better
an incredible second installment to a mature teenage franchise
dreamworks is daring in the way it challenges its characters and it pulls no punches for drama or stakes
action and scope are increased in this one but more importantly a significant emphasis on hiccups journey to find his identity and face up to responsibility
his belief that all people can change for the better is challenged and a high price is paid in testing that conviction
the major relationships in hiccups life his dragon and parents and girlfriend are developed from the first movie with depth and maturity with characters bouncing off one another vividly
emotions run high  the thrill of flying sequences the humor of sarcastic comedic relief and the gutwrenching sadness of climactic narrative sequences
what movie can have an adult and kids laugh cry and bring out all those emotions
beautiful movie
love love how they develop tothless and hiccup relationship of friendship
my favorite was that last scene with them and the blindfold
not spoiling just mentioning for those who have already seen the movie  my nieces said it was better than frozen and they love frozen i love it more than the first how to train your dragon and i thought no other movie could top that
beautiful movie better than frozen
in fact i am going to see it again and i never go to the movies to see a movie twice in a theater
love it
please bring another how to train your dragon 3
please go watch it and the 3d is awesome
after the huge success of how to train your dragon its sequel was much awaited but in my view the sequel was not up to the level and perfection of the first part
no doubt the cinematography and graphics effect was upto the modern eras perfection but story was bit weak and was not as powerful and catchy as it was supposed to be
the dragon toothless along with his rider hiccup are again main leads of the movie which pretty much is same thing for viewers and the ancient charm and terror of dragons are seemed to be carried away from the movies which i think is giving a new perception towards the dragons
this may effect the original and ancient terrorizing and horrific image of dragons and a new conceptual idea of dragon being a pet makes place in the viewers mind
the twists and turns of the movie are pretty expected and the end of the movie can be guessed at the mid of it
with its perfect animation and beautiful cinematography and catchy creatures in it and bearable language this movie is watchable for children of all age groups
this heart touching film was delightful from the beginning to the end
first the resolution from the previous movie allowing the dragons stay on the island with hiccup was a nice touch
seeing hiccup and toothless with all of the other dragons playing was a good way to start the film
then the unexpected surprise that hiccups mom was still alive was a twist no body could have seen coming
her love for dragons was just as great as the reunion of hiccupc father and mother
then the tear jerking death of hiccups father who died protecting their family was a good ending even though it was hard to overcome
i hope this family friendly film has a third movie coming along
how to train your dragon 2 builds upon the successes of the last film and turns out a visual and aural feast
the music by john powell and the songs by jonsi amount to the best soundtrack of the year so far
visual wise there are some really impressive scenes with giant overlord dragons as well massive dragon battles and beautiful new arctic scenery
like the first film httyd2 has that rare gift that the best animated films have of appealing to all ages
the voice acting is great again with the addition of the always incredible cate blanchett who adds a nice touch to the film
however i wouldnt say the story and writing were quite as good as the first
when i watched the first how to train your dragon it was a pleasant surprise that blew me away
the expectations were high this time around and the movie did not disappoint
the animation is top notch with scenes that transport you to flying amongst the clouds
the excellent soundtrack is also back with where no one goes by jonsi being a standout track
fortunately it is used many times in the film
there are some emotional punches that i wont spoil
also i like how the film further uses characters that have been maimed
something that you was a surprise hiccups peg leg in the first movie and continues in this one
i definitely will be looking to the next part of this franchise that appeals to all age ranges
i am so much agree with the other reviewers
from the beginning to the very end the movie takes you to an incredible journey in a viking way with lots of adorable brave and amazing dragons
the most beautiful about this movie is its content i wonder what emotion is left to reflect here
every emotion that makes a human who he is reflects here and drawn so beautifully elegantly
words are less to narrate the stunning movie creation
lovefriendshipjoylaughtersorrowfearbravery and vice versa
last but not the list it has a hidden message unlike other animated movies it tries to tell something
i lovelove and love this movie
i think it takes animated movies to an another leveldo watchhave fun and fasten your seat belts for an amazing adventure with dragons
i went to go see this with my friend from my film class and we both were fans of the first one and we went in thinking it couldnt be better then the first one
but we were totally wrong
this movie is so amazingly made with a darker story but it still has humor like the first one
the music fits the movie perfect it really doesnt even make me feel like i am watching an animated movie
some of the scenes were so real looking it blew me away
jonsi who does the theme song for the movie did a amazing job at making a song that fits the movie so well
my friend and i were kinda surprised that it was a pg movie because it has a much darker story and very surprising deaths
it could have been pg13
little kids that were in the theater had to leave because there are some scary scenes
but i am looking forward to the next movie in the series
i highly recommend this movie to any that loves movies that let you escape the real world
if you havent seen the first movie yet i suggest that you watch it and then watch the sequel
this is a 10 out of 10 movie for me
how to train your dragon 2 is a worthy to watchthe expectations you kept on it are surely carried through the entire filmthis film is a pack of every feeling
happinessexcitementemotionfun
though they are unexpected turns of emotion but it made to felt that feeling to the next higher level
visuals amp flight sequences are pretty impressive even director foretold about that they are going to use new lightscore technology we can surely well observe that on screentoothless funny gestures worked very well
background score is very bold amp well tuned by powellthis movie is really going to do magic at the boxofficeeven may be definitely at oscars too
hats off to the team of how to train your dragon
this second part is very nice and super
first 15 mins i was stunned by 3d effects
i was felt i m riding the dragons
i never seen this much amazing 3d effects before hero dad passed away scene was heart melting scene
even at theater all people felt very sad including me the face expressions of dragons is cute and loved by all people
each scenes all people applauded and laughing by seeing dragons activity
the animation work awesome i felt like traveling in adventure and screenplay good
i didnt find any boring scenes
the introduction of new character hero mother is nice and touchable
the film traveled with humor too
over all i loved the movie very much than part 1 and waiting eagerly for third part
beautifully animated
ingeniously crafted storyline
a little corny but if this isnt the movie of the summer then i dont know what will be
it had the spirit of brave and the heart of frozen not the frozen heart but you know what i mean
it really gave it a more lifelike feel and mood
great job maintaining the charm of the characters we love
finally toothless gets his moment to shine and hiccup gets out of his awkward stage
they are definitely not kids anymore and their maturity creates a great loop hole to get out of those gaps in the plot
also the element of surprise is back which was the reason we all loved the first one
cant wait for the final installment of the series soon to come
hope you love it as much as i did
6 july 2014 film of choice at the plaza dorchester this afternoon  how to train your dragon 2
hiccup toothless and all the gang return for this most excellent sequel
now living in harmony with the dragons the citizens of berk face extinction from an unknown foe its up to hiccup his friends and the dragons to save their way of life
four years on from the original the animation in this sequel seems to be more seamless and slick and i find myself immersed into the world on the screen as if it is live actors in real scenery
reunited with old friends and introduced to new ones we are immediately sucked back into the world of the animated viking and their unusual way of life
once again im in awe of the animators who can put so much personality into characters that dont speak
children and adults in the audience seemed to enjoy this and its definitely a good way to spend a couple of hours
this is one of those rare movies which is so good on so many levels that the whole family can enjoy it over and over again
the villains are villainous the heroes are believable and heroic and endearing and the fun is nonstop
i would put this film in the same class as matilda and its a wonderful life i
e
thrilling and uplifting entertainment for everyone with a generous dose of humor to keep everything from getting too serious
the animation is truly remarkable and fastpaced including the many flying sequences on the dragons
the creativity is also astounding  there is one sequence in which one animated character imitates the persona of another
do not miss this movie
this movie in general was amazing
it has a lot of action scenes great graphics and nice humor
but personally i think it could have been a lot better
the ending just seemed so rushed out and lazy
its like the people who wrote the script ran out of stuff to write
i was expecting a lot more from the sequel of one of my favorite films but i didnt quite get it
the rushed ending left me quite disappointed
but in general it was a great movie for adults teens and kids alike
i would recommend it for everyone who is a fan of how to train your dragon 1 and who knows maybe it will work out for them better than it did for me
well for anyone who is going to watch the movie after my review good luck and have a great time
this movie is now one if my all time favorites
ive only gone back to the theater and paid their prices to watch a movie more than once only a few times
this is one if those movies
i want to go again tomorrow
it has a fantastic storyline
you will not be disappointed
its an adult like storyline that is appropriate for kids as well
so everyone watching is happy and entertained
the action and graphics are superb
great wow scenes
love the emotional connections between the characters
theyve really evolved
also from a few lines said in the movie
and how it ended
i think there will be a 3rd movie
i cant wait
the movie was good and full of action but it kind of dropped down in the middle
the beginning and the end were excellent
i did not expect hiccup to find his mother in the movie at all
the movie showed people in distress and proved that any situation can be overcome
it shows true friendship when hiccup frees toothless from the control of the alpha dragon
it is unlike any movie that i have seen before with a great storyline to prove it
drago bludvist is the main villain who is trying to assemble a army of dragons
well tell me how you liked it
it is definitely a must watch movie
the part where toothless is taken away by drago bludvist was a good touch to the movie
definitely deserves a 910
this was by far one of the best childrens movies that has been released in a long while
while it seems many found frozen to be the best title of the year i doubt that will stand for long once word of the brilliance this movie has to offer gets out
this movie expands significantly on the first title as how to train your dragon gave you an intriguing emotional ride where the viewer was able to experience a broad set of emotions this sequel expands on that and strengthens each emotion on the table
happy moments are happier but pixar was not afraid to take a risk
most movies of this sort are somewhat tame and while not expressly violent or obscene how to train your dragon 2 made sure to give the viewers an element of realism as things dont always turn out the way you might hope
i would 1010 recommend viewing this movie to audiences of all ages
it is entertaining intriguing fun cheerful and full
its just a full film
it lacks in no area and i truly regard it as one of the best children targeted films in the last perhaps 5 years minimally
just watched this movie yesterday and was not let down
ive read the reviews on this movie that i could which made me nervous about watching it but to my amazement it lived up to it
the animation keeps getting better im always surprised about that but this movie is jaw dropping for that
and 3d im not a fan but this movie needs to be watched once in 3d
better than the first in so many ways
voice acting and the script top it but those were short little blurps so not big
watching it you walk out of the theatre wishing it was 2 years later so you can watch the third
movie of the year and this movie puts a real high bar on great sequels and technology
what are you waiting for go out and see this movie this weekend
i promise you wont be disappointed
this movie i think is better then the first one because the story and the characters are great
i didt actually wanna see this movie because i liked the first one and i thought that this is going to be bad but it was fantastic
the only thing is that hiccupss dad died
whitch didnt feel good because its a fairytale so was sad
but the dragons are looking great toothless looked incredible and the giant dragonscant remember they namewere pretty fantastic
also drago the villain was awesome too
how he controlled the dragons and how you felt so powerful
hicupss mother fantastic the surroundings were pretty epic
gigant battle epic
this movie is totally worth seeing 910
this movie is really inspiring and fun to watch through
watch it alone or with your family you can not resist the pull of this movie
the first one was good the 2nd one is even better
i am sure this movie is going to win the best animated movie title in the oscars
i am eagerly waiting for the 3rd part and i am hopeful the next one will surpass our expectations
kudos to the director music director and all other who have managed to make an astounding movie like this
i have watched this movie alone on my computer and will again want to watch it with my friends and family members
it will be great
i really enjoyed the movie and at the end my heart is left with full of emotions and thrill
httyd 2 must win the oscar for best animated picture this year and should be nominated for best picture just like up back in 2010
this movie has brought animated movies to a whole new level
the story is touching where we can see and related with the bond between hiccup and toothless
the cinematography and the visual effects are fantastic and easily the best in animated movies
the voice work is good
and the story
i cant emphasize enough but i dont wanna give away spoilers
this movie is truly remarkable right from its very core
to all those who havent seen the movie all i have to say is you will not be disappointed
there is only one downside to this movie it ends and trust me
you dont want it to end
this was one helluva summer and i believe we have a chance of beating 1994 moviewise thanks to such a strong start in the year
i gave it 910 because of the problems this movie has with being an unintended sequel otherwise it would be a 1010
its definitively not meant to just cashin on it  it has a very good plot the animation improved quite a bit and they were able to make it just as much fun as the first one
and in some areas they even surpassed it by adding more dramatic elements moments which reminded me of the old animated movies from my childhood like lion king or the land before time
so all in all its a polished and well executed production
the only 2 things that bothered me a bit were that the plot doesnt fit as smooth as youd like to see it in a sequel and baruchels voice which was a perfect fit for the first one is too close to the awkward teenager and doesnt really help to make the transition to the young adolescent hiccup is supposed to be in this one
the first how to train a dragon movie absolutely blew me away
it is still one of my top four animated films incredibles kung fu panda and spirited away are the others
it was the first film that managed to make 3d work so well that it took my breath away
i watched it at the cinema with my four year old daughter and we both spent most of the film on the edge of our seats
i am happy to report that the sequel is just as bright colourful funny and exciting as the first
but most importantly just like the first film it doesnt seem to know that it is a cartoon
the voice work and the animation combine to give us a real acting experience from a fantastic cast and it transitions neatly between teenage angst and non stop action
if i have any criticisms they are all about the story the film does suffer a little from the sequeldisease of unnecessary happenings in desperate bid to ensure old ground is not tread
this film doesnt benefit from the sheer unexpected charisma of the first film but it does tick all the boxes and is very enjoyable for it
the movies are good but the cartoon needs to be watched in between
more will be explained because things that are in this movie are not in the first one
i saw it with hubby and daughter
hubby and i were laughing our as off because we know more about the story through the cartoons and the blanks get filled in
we laughed really hard and the others were staying quiet except for the kids
i watch the show more than hubby does and stilled enjoyed the movie because it was a new adventure for hiccup
i know some moviestv shows do not follow the other and the time line gets eschewed but this does the job
the show on cartoon network is not separate entity from the movies and hope they continue to make more of both
it is a good series all together and worth the money
it was nice movie
the 1st time i watched to howto train your dragon i i was so impressive with relationship between dragon and human
there were amazing
but this episode we have not known about the king of dragon
they can control every dragons including to toothless
how comes  the power can not control the relationship between hiccup and toothless
so i really truly love this movie
you guys should go to see
and not only the relationship between dragon and human but also the love in family
how much dads love  moms love
its good movie for family and everybody
even i am in thailand i really love this movie
thanks to this movie that produced very nice movie to me
how to train your dragon 2
being a sequel of a much loved movie dragon 2 walks on the tight rope of maintaining the fun quotient of dragon 1 and providing some new fresh ideas which can make dragon 2 memorable
movie improves in the stunning imagery and usage of 3d effects considerably
dragons flight scenes would be hard to forget especially by new kids in the audience
characterization of humans and dragons both is done with much care
but it is hard to ignore the fact that fun quotient has been lowered and movie takes a darker way in second half in providing few key twists and turns
burdened by high expectations dragon 2 falls short of being a milestone movie but dares to take new chances
the chemistry of our hero hiccup and his dragon toothless remains the strength of the story
i am going with generous 8 out of 10 for how to train your dragon 2
it has its flaws but is very well saved by excelling in visuals and characters department
watch it in 3d for full impact
i saw the first one when it came out and fell in love when i went in to watch this movie i was scared it may disappoint me
by the end i was clapping and even though i was the only one it was worth being the only one
it is very different from the original much more mature which i was not expecting but i am so happy i went to see it and i cant wait to see the third and final installment the biggest surprise was the death of huge character in the series
as i was watching the movie it felt like it was so much longer than and hour and thirty minutes but in a good way it made me lose track of time and was just beautiful the animation was flawless and the story amazing i would recommend this movie to literally anyone just note is is darker and more mature
