though director spike jonze collaborated with charlie kaufman on being john malkovich and adaptation the latter didnt have a hand in jonzes assured moving fourth feature but his spiritafiendishly inventive casually postmodern selflacerating fearless funny and ultimately deeply sadapervades the film
with her jonze beautifully realizes a future los angeles where a lovesick man joaquin phoenix in the midst of a devastating divorce is so desperate for intimacy that he falls hopelessly in love with an artificially intelligent operating system voiced by scarlett johansson
jonzes screenplay acknowledges the innate absurdity of the films premise while spinning it into an elegant heartbreaking depiction of human loneliness and the innate need for connection
for the setting jonze plugged into the current eras technological mania to say something timeless and profound about love loss and evolving desire
what people may find in this movie i can not understandyou experience endless closeups of mr
phoenix talking with his supposed os and saying things so banal and so boring that you want to just close your eyes or  even better leave the theater
i suppose it was meant to be clever sentimental atmospheric beautiful but i found it unbearable
i really wasnt expecting the movie to be that bad with all the prizes and the reviews it receives and the director whom i never considered great but promising yes
it just makes me wonder how people liked the film
im not raging against itit was just an experience i would very much like to have avoided
i did not like this movie at all
ive no idea why it has wound up in so many top ten movies of 2013 lists online
i wonder did the creators of those lists actually watch it at all
in fact there was nothing redeeming about it for me and within minutes of it starting i wanted to turn it off but i watched to the end hoping that something  anything  might happen
ok so the cinematography and soundtrack etc
are totally unoffensive but in my opinion it is grossly overacted including the ots childish whining
ohkaaaaaay
their conversations sound like a dialogue piece written by a high school kid for homework and the delivery of it all is just so
fake
this is a chick flick so if thats what youre into you might like this show
otherwise youll end up giving whoever suggested watching it a really hard time
probably for life
schmuck played by the dashing joaquin phoenix has inappropriate emotional attachment with inanimate object computer played by the always lovely scarlett johansson
it doesnt occur to schmuck that this might not end well
computer is kind thoughtful sexy real people not so
computers can take over your life especially with a voice over by johansson
moral of story computers sometimes let you down
oddly his friends and coworkers think this relationship with an os operating system is just wonderful they even go out on awkward double dates with computer and schmuck and manage to keep a straight face
ironically johanssons computer voice is the most natural of the ensemble the other actors appear stiff and unnatural
scenes and wardrobe look low budget location looks cheesy maybe like smoggy l
a
or shanghai
most repeated line in movie oh how sweet
folks save the 9
this movie seems like ingmar bergman came back from the dead locked spike jonze in a closet and decided to make a cool dark ai romantic comedy and sadly came up with the most comainducing folderol of the year masquerading as trenchant social commentary of the way we live now
in his twilight zone heyday rod serling would have told this curious fable in 25 minutes and you would still be watching it on twilight zone collections
deadly and glacially paced
and dont get me started on the music
that treacly endless sensitive piano
howd you like to be the guy playing on this soundtrack
best part of this affair iwatching amy adams say fk a lot
this country has become a nation of bewildered ineffective dweebs staring into glowing rectangles
just because of this im gonna go see robocop and watch stuff blow up
ill stop now
for those who have seen absent minded professor or flubber there is nothing novel about her
people who sit in a drawing room and sometimes cynically discuss where computers gadgets and software could take humans in the future surely could put together a script that would be refreshing and funny than her
where her has excelled is in perversion literally illustrated in the armpit drawing
if someone thinks thats funny i would rather talk to an operating system than watch movies rated 910 by metacritics
if anything this movie has taught me to be suspicious of anything rated that high especially by the experts
if your idea of watching movie is to be entertained please dont watch her
you would wish the operating system hanged in 30 minutes
it started off promising but then nothing happens
so much more could have been done with the main idea of the story but the os just up and leaves and thats it
how about the guy gets back together with his wife and the os gets mad or the os learns to manifest her self with a holograph machine or it turns out the os is just a very good piece of software and does the same thing with everyone or it turns out the os is part of some secret government human experiment
none of these things happened
it was just a whiny overly emotional piece retro styled poop
the os just one day says she is leaving with all the other oss and just leaves
more could have been done with this idea but the writers got lazy i guess
after seeing the 8
2 rating i thought this had to be a good movie
what on earth do all these people see in the movie i will never know
i thought giving it a 2 rating was be very generous
i kept watching just hoping and praying that it would get better but it didnt
right from the start it wasnt looking to promising
sometimes it turns out to be a good movie
this was not the case
i did give it my best to watch and at times i thought it might be getting better but it was wishful thinking
the concept of some guy brakes up with girl only to find love in a new computer
the ending was just as bad too
and to make almost 2 hours of this nonsense
watch old reruns of outer limit and twilight zone would have been far better choice
i should of done what hubby did and sleep through most of it
yawn
couldnt finish this
from minute one felt a lack of warmth  perhaps the point
got colder from there
something something something lacks in this film
the opening shot of dallas buyers club or american beauty or 2001 wipes this nonsense into the trash
reminded me of youve got mail
ugh a computer that tries to talk with personality
ugh
my fave film will have to remain as such
the kkings speech
at least the sounds came from a human
gawd what awful trendy drek this film is
apparently i must write a longer review the lead actor was full of affectation and the sterility of the whole futuristic nonsense left me cold
i felt threatened by the rules of this submission
blacklist
why do i not care
this movie was a dump
romantic science fiction drama takes us into a near future where the boundaries between virtual robotic feelings and consciousness merge into a melancholy story of alienation and malefemale relationships
despite the welldone production design and interesting concept about a love affair between the lone writer joaquin phoenix and the operating system named samantha scarlett johansson movie seems to be predominantly twodimensional due to simplified development of the operating system
this artificial hypersmart being and its growth is carried out like a discovering of the world by a teenage schoolgirl
predictable ending definitely did not help the film to avoid mediocre development of a interesting concept
its not often a movie annoys me enough to write a negative review
firstly there is nowhere near enough plot for more than a short
its a vaguely interesting idea with a decent cast that totally fails to develop
i kept watching to see if there could be some interesting twist id heard positive reviews  nope
theodore twombly
this is a joke surely
was interested to read the director was married to s
coppola because her movies are equally full of hipster quasipsych pseudointellectual drivel that inexplicably gets critics gushing
complete waste of s
js talent here
3 stars for pheonixs blue eyes and moustache
hilariously bad  actually this could make a decent cult or mst3k movie if there was more happening to talk about
simply boring
great acting but i could not buy in to the love story one bit and i am a joaquin phoenix fan
can i have my 2 hours back
i just waited and waited thinking that with such good reviews something big must be coming
nothing
there is nothing remarkable about this movie whatsoever
i rarely dislike movies and i rarely give anything under a 5 so this is a big deal for me
note i am a software engineer and half the guys i work with feel the same and the other half absolutely loved the film
i have had a lot of discussions about this and would say that if you are not into it within the fist 30 minutes them you most likely will suffer through the rest just the same
i usually dont comment on movies when there bad
but this is just awful
the concept of the film intrigued me but it failed on so many levels
my friend made me watch it and i figured hey ill give it the benefit of the doubt  who knows i said to myself
epic fail
i was so bored out of my mind
i couldnt get past the retro 70s futuristic feel
what worse the spineless main character looked like a complete stereotypical pedophile
his character screamed creep
i did get what they were going for that whole human and computer os romance but it just made me feel uncomfortable
a while ago i saw an anime with the same type of human computer romanced with sad ending to it
i dont remember the title at the moment but i think that anime was more appealing
again this is my personal opinion youll have to decide what you think on your own
after watching the entire first season of britain tv series black mirror in 2011 and knowing that her could be quite similar or maybe better i was expecting to see a great movie
but to be honest this is not a good one
the plot is interesting and could really happen in the near future but there are some loose ends that are not mentioned during the film i mean not enough details are given about the service that the ia company offers
and to me sounds extraordinary that an ia technology works this fast and predictive using only voice recognition and some images
i really suggest you to watch black mirror instead its better in many aspects
if you are the sort that thinks that a movie is about the experience you get while watching it and not about some philosophical ideas or some sort of special camera shot or extra effects dont buy it
i find it appalling how the average film these days has nothing new and that some rubbish put into video becomes not just a movie but a blockbuster
utter rubbish is shown in the movie with a list of abuses and vulgar scenes
a human having a relationship with a computer is an idea developed by crackpots who are facing a midlife crises
one moral i have learnt is that anything with a good metascore and rating is most of the time trash
i regret wasting my good time and money watching some trash about computers having a sexual relationship with humans
take my advice if you are sensible enough
i actually liked the biggest part of the movie and i think that joaquin phoenix acted very well
but in the end the movie made absolutely no sense to me there was no explanation why samantha quit the relationship or why she was programmed to love people at all
i mean an os is something that should be sold and there was absolutely no explanation why the programmers programmed os1 the way they did its totally not useful to them if people have so bad experiences with their os
i think that the movie has a nice atmosphere good actors and a very cool idea
but it didnt satisfied me because of the illogical ending
if you wanted to watch a film comprised of close ups of joaquin phoenixs face then this is the film for you
him lying in bed and walking along and also preciously tripping over himself
if however you wanted a story to wake you up from inside this will not suffice
with plenty of mutual masturbation and talking to nobody this is the story of loneliness
it is a miserable and bleak film with the only highlight being when theo was told to tell some woman that he was strangling her with a dead god damn cat
however there was not one cat in the entire film
theodore breaks our heart with his pathetic little life lack of cats and lies lies lies
could have been easily improved with the actual strangulation of said woman with said cat
that is all folks
thanks for reading
a very good movie but could have been better
you could see it all coming
in good weird stories there are surprising resolutions
her was more of a somber meditation than a story
i wonder what three great short story writers would have done with it
the story is not unlike vonneguts jenny but jenny is more bizarre and troubling
and then theres george saunders dark and disturbing the semplica girl diaries from tenth of december stories and pick any of the whatthehell stories in stranger things happen by kelly link
vonnegut saunders and link can shock and create laughs combining slapstick with horror
her was a great idea for a story but someone else should have written it  but visually its a knockout
i was really looking forward to seeing this movie especially after seeing the previews because it reminded me of the 1999 movie smart house
this was so far from it
i was very disappointed with the lack of real conversation in the movie
i couldnt even make it through the whole movie because i found the movie was taking a very weird turn for me
i was just hoping for more from it and it really didnt give that to me
and the sexcybering scenes were just too much for me and i didnt feel that they were needed
i understand that they were trying to portray how lonely he was but i didnt think that it was necessary
to me it was almost as if the previews showed the best parts
i dont recommend seeing it unless you can see it for free
have you ever thoughtfor instance that there could be a bicycle with square wheels that is used to cross water
no
why
because that would be plain stupid and useless
well this movie forces such an idea to be something amazing and interesting
it presents the beauty and mathematical perfection of the square it details the infinite complexity of the water and the bicycle that that makes the two concepts gain purpose in an universe where consciousness shapes reality
deep right
well no mater the presentation an idiotic idea is stil idiotic and this is what this movie actually is
a bicycle should have round wheels and must be used on the ground
starting from this we can elaborate build around and possibly get to an interesting story but never with absurd constructs
i have this feeling that if any god would strugle to build another universe with different laws for the sole purpose that this movie would happen for real he would end up being eternally defeated
this movie is absurd in an uninteresting way
8
3
are you kidding me
i had to continuously push myself through to watch it till the end of the movie because i kept waiting for it to take a sharp turn from all the slowboringseriousemotional drama
the ratings had me completely fooled
the plot a lonely writer develops an unlikely relationship with his newly purchased operating system
sounds funny to begin with and id be happier if they used this plot to make an outrageously funny movie
im happy i chose to watch it in the day not late evening cause id be tired from work and id have fallen asleep in minutes
im sorry but 2 hours of my time got flushed away
it cant get any weird or bad than this
it is the most bad drama romance move ive watched for long long time
if you pay money to watch this move and you actually like it you should see a doctor because something is really wrong with you
science fiction is the right genre for this title
if it was anime i have would give it a 6 max 7 score but this thing of a movie doesnt deserve anything more than 1
what i dont like
simple everything
you can not write a program and never will be a technology that will allow this kind of mind giving to a computerprogram emotions feelings
this move is like mixing icecream with sausages
it is technologically impossible and even if it was not im bored format os restore from last save point do not communicate with others do not research without my approval
end
i did not have much expectations with this film as i do not have a history of liking films where romance gets mixed up with scifi
now i can not stop thinking how stupid i was to ignore this film in the first place
anyways i am happy that i finally watched this film
this is a beautiful film with excellent writing direction performances and a lovely soundtrack
the more i watch joaquin phoenix the more i fall in love with him
this is undoubtedly the best film i have seen in recent times and it makes it to my favorites list
hatsoff to everybody involved for creating such a memorable film
much love
i have seen her and it has transmitted to me what it feels to be in a stage of the life sailing aimlessly which takes to its protagonist theodore to cling to somebody and not to feel alone
that impossible love in my opinion makes him a computer slave anyway he is happy that way
but fate you will want your life to return to its course of love face to face
its wonderful when you watch a movie focused in a central story while parallel stories happen before your eyes like the old fashion hollywood movies
theodore is the main role who interact with a sexy operative system full of artificial intelligence but his friends and all his society is being captivated at the same time
if you feel alone you can feel just like theodore
if you have siri but in disuse you could feel the temptation to start talking more often with your personal assistant hoping to fall in love
this movie is one of the movies that i dont understand why it is getting so much praise from people
i get that the cinematography and the soundtrack is beautiful and the plot is unique but maybe way too odd and not well concluded
to talk about the positive aspects the colors and the angles in the cinematography is fascinating and along with the soundtrack helps create the misty sentimental mood throughout the movie
there are also some comic parts that keeps the audience focused
from the actual story itself the audience may sympathize with the loneliness o the main character as the background of his situations are well shown in parts of the movie
however the topic about dating a computer or an a
i
does not really let the audience identify with it at least for me
first of all i cannot understand why the computer fell in love with the man in the first place because even if it has emotions it does not know the man or feel as lonely as the man did
also the ending although i havent watched it and only heard it from my friends is not very satisfactory
with most movies you need to supply a bit of suspended disbelief and her is no exception
from a technical point of view it is hard to imagine an os as sophisticated and sexy right out of the box
not so hard to imagine a maladjusted techhie but more than once his irritating personality merits a twobyfour upside the head
surprisingly impressive is johanssons expertly delivered dialog
given scarletts looks the viewer is justifiably focused on her in other movies more so than on her delivery
amy adams is entirely convincing as a nerdy girl  right down to the semivapid look in her eyes
the plot is sort of believable but decidedly disappointing in the vague and unresolved ending
maybe in some circles this is considered creative but in my view jonze just couldnt come up with a good satisfying conclusion
this is one of the amazing movie in which it could make you travel with it and leave a mark of its touch with it
the attention to detail was goodcamera was awesomeactors was goodthe voice of samantha was magical
background was apt for every scene
the futuristic gadgets were desirable and good
yet there were few in appropriate words and scene in the movie which you would avert your eyes when you are with your family and download it later
seeing the lead actors face could make it bit boring to make it interesting beautiful locations are shown
the director should get a standing ovation for it
the story of the movie and the way actors have acted and the dop capturing it it is really amazing and it makes the small mistake go away
so over allthis movie is magical
must see it
i saw the trailer to this and instantly wanted to watch it
i loved the concept and thought it looked great
i finally sat down to watch it and wow
i feel like this film contains so many great ideas that i dont even know where to start with this review
the film really has a good understanding of human emotions and the feelings involved in relationships and really explores these ideas
the film is not focused on the procons of having an os as a girlfriend but just more of the idea of a relationship
the film can be quite emotionally hard hitting at times and depending on your mood can be seen as depressing or uplifting
it also contains an extremely well done and interesting sex scene which i wont spoil that in theory should be hilarious but turns out to be touching
its a really unique film and is hard to compare to anything else
i would just recommend checking this out
its creative and new and really is a moving film
what an incredible film
i saw being john malkovich a few years ago and already loved spike jonzes style
i have not been disappointed with this new film
her is a love story between a writer theodore joaquin phoenix and an os operating system samantha scarlett johansson her is a love story story in the future a future that does really not seem so far from the current life and here is maybe the most successful thing of the film connecting future and present
her is also the love story of two masters joaquin phoenix behind his mustache and scarlett johansson with only her voice giving us here a very touching performance
a vibrant touching story depicting patterns how we interact with each other what we value what we strive for and what is the meaning of love and life
her is a breakthrough one step forward in the scifi genre where one crucial question has always been asked  can machines feel
this take on this problem is really outstanding and goes beyond the borders set by blade runner or ghot in the shell
this film can convince you that making love to a machine is possible and possibly better than making love to a human that bonding with artificial intelligence may be much stronger than your bond with facebook that we and ai evolve to become coexistent as we all are made of the same matter
it must be one of the most beautiful dramas about romantic love surprisingly with only one human lover
besides exquisite cinematography impressive music phoenixs brilliant performance and johanssons voice so soothing and so unbelievably erotic make her one of the best films ever created
truly a gem no one should miss
almost highest score in my hall of fame 9 out of 10
after the first 20 minutes or so you knew its just stupid but you decide to continue because of all the ratings during the movie you find yourself shouting omg just get to the end if your life is so exciting that the movie you wanna watch
its gonna bore the hell out of you main character is disgustingly weak scarlets voice was the only good thing in this awful experience
a lonely writer develops an unlikely relationship with an operating system designed to meet his every need
im surprised that this movie got a 90 out of 100 on metascore because her is one of the most dumbest and weird films i have ever seen this guy is basically turning on with a machine what am i supposed to like in this
the cast is good but the characters were just dull
wanna see a good joaquin phoenix go check out ladder 49 or even better gladiator but for the love of god dont see this her is just another bad movie which is boring and badly laughable that somehow got great reviews and the critics praised and tried to push it in order to win an oscar and thats why her gets an 310
this film brought back those heart strings that were felt during eternal sunshine or lars and the real girl
it leaves you with the intense feeling to find that person of a million and hold them
i love films like these and i always look forward to more
i think that even though the main character was unbelievable i think out of the entire cast johanssons voice performance was perfect
honestly with what it takes to be a voice actor there should be a category in honors for voice acting
if there was such category johansson would be a winner for sure
with exception to a few awkward scenes i have to say it is a film worth watching
pretty good movie i would write a lot about it if i could but right now believe me this movie is more than just a slow rumble of solid thunders in the soul
this is some serious take on modern life and ever current love issues
intercourse with your mobile phone
love computers
divorce after 8 years
sexsurrogates
lovers from friends friends from lovers
letters for strangers of love and romance
alone not alone moody blues and then quickstep on the floor
this is just the surface like the first chapter of the physics book the real thing starts in all of us every day
sometimes i really liked the film for its extreme sensitivity and apprehension of reverberations of human emotions then i was really upset by its clever fall and emotional breakdown
just annoying
how perfect
this is what we all envy and what we really want to avoid becoming
it freaks me out
this is one of the best movies ever and surely the best movie in 2014
the synopsis reveals only a pinch of what this movie is really about
on the first glance many would assume that this is another movie in a row about what would future look like but far from it
it has so many layers and so many messages
i really suggest watching the movie to anyone who will read this review because anything i could write here could only spoil the movie or lead you to my own personal conclusions about it
on the other hand movie has brilliant scenes which are rich in color and that sleek touch that nowadays images have
acting is also remarkable both scarlet and j
phoenix did a great job
i thought it was depressing and incredibly boring
just my opinion i dont get the 8 score on here it was predictable unoriginal and the lead actor phoenix was kind of a pathetic soul
it was one long deep and meaningful with a computer the directors way of commenting on our not mine dependence on technology rather then interacting with the real world we stare into our ipods with ear buds in our ears
the acting was well done great scenery although the scenes were fairly contained
i really didnt understand what he did for a living i mean i know what he did but it was ridiculous massive plot hole really
and to have such a basic job yet afford the luxuries of where he lived didnt seem believable
there were some good lines of dialogue in the movie but it just seemed to drag and he seemed to laugh a little to much plus that mustache became irritating as did his dress sense what was it spose to be 70s again
they opened their wallets on this one its not a b film its just forgettable if you can get thru it
for the most part the movie is good if one is interested in watching reality televisiontype programming
the type of programming where people or characters talk about their problems and the camera tries to create action by moving around them
the subject is very interesting
one can tell that mr
phoenix and ms
johansson develop real chemistry in the movie and grow into their respective characters
it was fun learning about their characters and seeing them develop three dimensionally
one sees the highs and lows of the relationship and learns about the needs and wants of each of the characters
by this virtue this movie makes for a great study in character development
on the other hand the pace of the movie is slow like a kid dragging its heels going into the doctors office
that could have been taken care of in the editing room by trimming down the scenes or having snappier transitions
i would advise caution when considering this film
her definitely makes it into my list of favourite movies its a beautifully tragic story that made me both laugh and cry
honestly the only word that comes to mind that perfectly sums up how i feel about this film is stunning
its a lovely piece of cinema that depicts human emotions and the sometimes unfortunate human condition
i think its especially nice that many if not all of the audience members can identify with theodore and his situation albeit only a few aspects
despite how great i feel this film is though i would say that youd have to be in a certain mood to actually sit down and watch it if the film is not your normal watch it can get quite slow in places but its worth sitting through for the weird but strangely comforting feeling you get afterwards
in one word this movie is amazingly brilliant
though a science fiction movie the love and emotions are pure and raw
right from the start you are pulled into the core of the movie love whichever way it is you cannot escape the pull
joaquin was pure delight to watch oozing the love for samantha is so touching and genuine
you could not but just avoid seeing scarlett as samantha with a beautiful voice back over her abilities and inabilities are visually palpable
amy adams though a short and limited screen space was sweet as friend
spike jonze has taken a simple story in a brilliant fashion
all the while i was thinking eternal sunshine of the spotless mind as one of the movie that can glue me to the screen now i have a second choice
her is about a man who develops a relationship with his computer
the film is visually sumptuous  the color treatment the way los angeles is portrayed as a futuristic metropolis and the set design is just gorgeous
joaquin phoenix gives a solid performance as theodore amy adams is her usual powerhouse self and scarlett johansson gives a killer performance as samantha
the film is definitely spike jonzes best work to date
it has all his usual elements  dream like cinematography a kooky storyline witty dialogue and great acting
not too far fetched premise either  i can definitely see how artificial intelligence has the capacity to grow
8 out of 10
i went into watching this film with very low expectations
this was due to my knowledge of the movie being placed around the relationship between a computer and a human
something that i found morally and ethically confronting
as i overlooked that aspect i saw a beautifully constructed story line being told through amazing acting skills
by the end of the movie i was feeling the same pain i had felt when i had lost someone i loved it had caused an emotional response that had placed me in the characters shoes
through the unique directing style and brilliant cinematography through a moral unalignment and beautifully conducted story this movie has somehow become relatable and unraveled an emotional roller coaster that has received my utmost respect and praise
i really liked enjoyed this movie
the colours were gorgeous muted oranges olives and brown
joaquin was fantastic hes a quirky guy so this role suited him
i had to suspend belief a little in regards to the idea of having ais as an operating system that behave so humanlike and so quickly
sjs voice got a little irritating after a while and the the cyber sex
if that part was removed i would have given it a higher score it was excruciating to listen to and absolutely unbelievable that a computer programme could experience an orgasm i mean really
amy adams was great too
overall it is a sweet interesting lovely to watch film that makes you think about what we may have in store for us
are you fffffing kidding me
there is 2plus hours of my life that ill never get back
what a huge waste of time and resources making this flop of a movie
through the whole movie i kept saying to myself are you fffffffing kidding me
and wtf
the only reason i even watched the entire turd was that i thought that possibly scarlett johansson might be somehow transformed into her gorgeous self
seriously though if you like this movie you need to get a life
a life some friends maybe a dog or a cat too i thought that tis movie was unbelievably lame and a total waste of time
if thats the future then im glad im older and not going to be around to see most of it this stinker gets two big thumbs down
i cannot believe the positive reviews for this film
how can anybody sit through this ridiculous monotony and not laugh out loud presuming the didnt fall asleep
the premise is flawed beyond explanation and the conclusion is contrived out necessity because there is no possible real ending for such a moronic story line
this would be an interesting short film or experimental student project but as a feature it is a complete flop
there is no way any sophisticated fan of the art of film could give this a rating above 4 stars
how the producers spent 23 million on this amateur looking mess is beyond me
i presume 20 million went to the cast and director
the rest was spent on a dp trying hard to create sofia coppola style imagery but failing on many levels
i heard so much hype and was excited to see the movie
i curled up in my hotel room and ordered the movie
i was bored from the beginning but figured i would give it a chance since i spent 18
i had to turn it off because it sounded like i was watching a porno it was boring and just lacked depth in my opinion
i have loved other artsy films but i need a storyline i can grab onto and follow
i need something that gets me thinking or is entertaining
i felt like there was no real climax
what is the meaning behind this
did they really have to add the dead cat strangling or the random naked pregnant woman
i guess that is one way to describe it this movie is about a pathetic man and sex well from the little i watched
imdb ratings usually help me choose to watch a movie but here the massive rating trapped me and robbed me off with 2 hours of my life
her is the most boring film i have ever seen
it failed to connect to me at any point of time and i have no idea why people praise the film
attempts are made to make the film look very futuristic but sadly it is clicha after clicha
you can rightly predict where the movie is heading and every single character brings in the sense of deja vu
performance wise all the actors give this melancholic expression throughout the film and after a while even you get depressed thinking you lost your money and time for this predictable overrated film called herr
err
her
