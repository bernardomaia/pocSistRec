"\nThe movie was so boring and lengthy that I considered to leave the\ncinema. The script was predictable at some points and the acting was so\npoor amongst some of the actors. Anne Hathaway was horrible, she was\nnot convincing at all and her outfit looked like a cheap Halloween\ncostume. Bane, the main villain of this movie was killed in a split\nsecond and everything was forgotten about him, that's it. It's like the\nscript writers wanted this movie to end quickly as possible at this\npoint. The actor playing Miranda who appears to be Ra's Al Ghul's\ndaughter Talia should get the award for worst death presentation, it\nwas some of the worst acting I have ever seen, you can tell that she is\nacting. It's like she is taking a nap for crying out loud. Blake who\nappears to be Robin gets access to the Batman cave and all the high\ntech stuff that is in there, but he didn't receive any training at all\nso he wouldn't know how to use it. Robin is just an ordinary cop in\nthis movie with no combat skills, yet Bruce Wayne gives away the cave\nto him and settles down with the supposed Catwoman.\n"
"\n1. This movie is almost 3 hours long. Out of this 3 hours Batman was\nsick and crippled 2 hours. He was in his batman suit and did his batman\nstuff 15 minutes.<br><br>2. I could not understand 80% of what Bane was saying.<br><br>3. There are A LOT of long, boring, brainwashing , cliché dialogs.<br><br>4. Gotham painfully reminded me of LA and NY. I mean really painfully.<br><br>5. Throughout the movie i had a feeling that i was watching some stupid\npiece of propaganda how wonderful all super rich people are and how\ndumb are the rest of us. That orphanage in Bruce's house almost made me\npuke.<br><br>Catwoman was rather enjoyable character.<br><br>This movie, or should i rather say this propaganda piece would appeal\nto a people with very low IQ and some really die hard Batman fans.\n"
"\nI think the other reviewers are on crack... This is one of the worst\nfilms I have seen in a long time. The plot made on sense, Bain was\nhorribly misrepresented as one of the greatest comic villains, and the\nstory had horrific plot twists that made on sense as to why it was even\nin the movie. To me the only saving grace was killing Batman because\nthey killed his career with this insipid movie but alas they even\nscrewed that up.<br><br>This is just simply a bad movie with a few special effects that of\ncourse were completely impossible in real life and mostly wasted\nscenes. Wait for the CD and use it for a pot holder...at least you\nmight get something positive from this movie...\n"
"\nIt took me one week to finally watch this whole movie, fell asleep\ntwice, got distracted by lint in my belly button, watching paint dry,\netc. I don't know what people are looking at. This was SOO boring and\nthe plot holes and ridiculous story lines was just too much. I agree\nwith all the other negative reviews... couldn't understand anything\nBane said, the fight scenes were 'yawn' boring, what happened to\nBatman's kick ass kungfu???He got slapped around like a 2 dollar\nhooker... no reasonable explanations for anything-how did he get back\nto US??? and what kind of \"hell on earth\" prison has cable TV?\nPoliceman come out of dark sewage like they are getting ready for a\nparade...the big melee fight, police have no guns, bad guys have guns\nand they just let the police beat them up???Talia's death scene, she\nneeds to go back to acting school, I just burst out laughing...it goes\non and on and on. Save your money, wait till it comes to video.\n"
"\nI knew right from the opening shot of Gordon's eulogy \"I knew Harvey\nDent...\" with the breaking to form the Bat symbol, that this was going\nto be epic. It was obvious from the beginning that the film legend. In\nfact, I loved it and I think it is the best movies The Dark Knight. I\nabsolutely Loved it, and I'm glad they really humanized Batman and\nlimited his screen time in this film. Some \"comic booky-actiony\" type\nfans didn't like the small amount of time we actually see Batman, but\nthat was the whole point of the trilogy! The ending, where Foley says\n\"there's only one police in this town\" while doing their march against\nBane was really awesome. The ending was perfect. But the movie has\nmissed the Joker. I say as both a Batman fanboy and especially a Nolan\nfanboy that this is the perfect trilogy.\n"
"\nThere is not much to say about TDKR, because after some days there is\nnot much left in my movie-loving-mind. Not much except this: a\ndisappointing villain, who is beaten in a fist-fight (!!!) and without\nany cool action which wasn't shown already in the trailer ... a batman\nwho was once struggling about his gone love-of-a-lifetime Rachel but\nbangs now two girls in a row ... a main villain who suddenly plops out\nafter bane is dead but acts just some minutes as head of the bad ...\nand a foreseeable average climax with an atomic bomb (how creative is\nthat???). Where was the epic conclusion? where was Batmans inspiration\nto the people (not just Blake), were was Alfred??? TDKR is technically\nwell done. But thats it. Don't be stupid and let cheat you by that! Not\na bad movie. But not more.\n"
"\nOverlong, talky and boring.....<br><br>And who had the idea of having a villain with a art-deco ashtray on his\nmouth? Bane is one of the most poorly developed villains in history.\nWhat were they thinking? What is the point of hiding is face and facial\nexpressions?<br><br>The dialog is painful, tedious. The film is overlong, bloated, they\ntried to pack too much into it and the result is very confusing. <br><br>Anne Hathaway in unconvincingly flimsy looking. Not to mention she has\nno charisma, chemistry with Batman.<br><br>Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine (the coolest characters) are given\nminimal screen time.<br><br>I rather watch Adam West's Batman. At least it was fun.\n"
"\nyou disappointed me Nolan, what the f? -cheesy way of ending conflicts\n-uninteresting characters. -deus ex machine in its cheap form. -sleepy\ntime in action sequences (not in the \"more hardcore action, images that\nbalance content\" persuasion). -destroyed the image of a passionately\nfollowed character (not talking about batman). -are you going to slack\nin next project? -more preproduction man, think stuff trough. -where\nyou in contract debt to finish the movie or something? -you know you\nare better than writing stuff for the ridiculous \"10 line in comment\"\nrule last night i proved my girlfriend its a hassle to take care of one\nanother while drunk\n"
"\nRight from the start of the movie you will be on the edge of your seat.\nPersonally I think this is the best conclusion I have ever seen.\nPerformance of each actor in the movie is outstanding.Before I saw the\nmovie I thought that Anne Hathaway wouldn't be as good cat-woman as\nMichelle Pfeiffer was, but not only was she better, she blew Michelle\naway. All the special effects are amazing and unbelievable. I have to\nsay I love some of the batman's new toys. I have seen it in V Max\ntheater last night but I am going to see it again in I MAX because Its\nworth the experience. It runs for 2 hours and 45 minutes but it felt\nlike 30 minutes and I wanted more. 10 stars is not enough for such a\ngreat movie. I recommend to all movie lovers out there to go and see it\nin cinemas.\n"
"\nThe plot is a total nonsense from the beginning to the end. They don't\neven try to make it believable. I know it's a super hero movie, we're\nnot in the real world, but still. I felt this movie was an insult to\nthe public. It's like saying you don't understand anything of what is\nhappening in the world around you, why would you care to understand\nwhat is going on in the movie? We end up with a very childish plot\nwhere whatever you want to happen just happens with magic. A nuclear\nreactor turned into a nuclear bomb with a screwdriver in 2 minutes in a\ngarage, a broken spine healed with a rope and 3 push ups, it's all like\nthis. Just boring and lazy. Even the fights are lame. Bane and Batman\nare supposed to be the 2 best fighters in the world but they fight like\na couple of drunk cowboys. Jackie Chan would kick their butt in no\ntime. Can't believe it's rated 8.7 today.\n"
"\nI felt compelled to submit my first IMDb review after seeing the film\ntoday and looking at the IMDb rating and some of the reviews which have\nbeen posted.<br><br>Nolan has been praised for his gritty realistic portrayal of batman,\nyet chooses to focus this last film on a giant cartoon bomb with huge\ndigits counting down to destruction.<br><br>WOW...<br><br>Social, moral and political issues are hinted at but never truly\naddressed, instead mind-numbing punch-ups and chases play out with\ninevitable conclusions.\n"
"\nWhats with all the high ratings... Story was terrible. how can 1000\nunarmed cops walk towards the bad guys with guns up an alleyway and not\nget shot then just start fighting. I fell asleep through this and was\ndis-appointed with all the hype. Can you trust reviews anymore, I'm not\nsure.<br><br>The Dark Knight was very good - i loved it. But this was so bad. Felt\ntricked at paying to watch this and felt so angry. Batman gets his ass\nkicked in a fight, then goes away and does a few sit-ups and come back\nlike superman. Batman gets stabbed with a 2inch knife and nearly dies\nyet he got bullets bouncing of him through the film\n"
"\nSo is The Dark Knight Rises better than The Dark Knight? If you were\none of those fans who prefer Batman Begins to TDK then you'll find much\nto love about TDKR. And if you weren't then no Batman film will ever\nmatch TDK for you. (SPOLIER ALERT)And yes, it is The End, a resounding\nresolution for what Batman Begins begun. Threads from that film are\npicked up, lengthened and strengthened, bringing a staunch integrity \nin every sense  to the overall arc. Is it perfect? Factor in some\nclunky catch-up exposition near the start, a cringey log-fire love\nscene and moments where Hans Zimmer's score nearly foghorns the actors\noff the screen and the answer's no. An even bigger question: is it up\nthere with The Dark Knight? Not quite.\n"
"\nAfter reading so many good reviews I was expecting a lot more from this\nmovie. The time line is completely screwed, events even more impossible\nthan any other super hero or even science fiction movie I've seen\nlately and I can't count the number of times I thought \"Oh come on!..\nthat's just ridiculous\". <br><br>Certainly there are nice images and interesting characters but the\nstory sucks so much it made the movie absolutely boring and ridiculous\nto me.<br><br>I was not a fan of the previous Batman movies but at least I found\nsomething interesting the first 2 movies of this trilogy. This is more\nlike a science fiction movie and nothing like the other movies which\nwere a lot more realistic and close to my idea of what Batman should be\nlike.\n"
"\nWhat a load of rubbish! I can't believe I actually went to see this\ntripe. It was only because I went with friends (and they all wanted to\nsee it), that I went.<br><br>Nearly three hours of utter clap-trap. I didn't understand the\nstory-line, I couldn't tell what the guy with the \"Alien type\" mask\nover his faced was saying? I couldn't care less about ANY of the\ncharacters.. There was no story to it... All of the actors (such as\nChristian Bale and Michael Caine and Anne Hathaway were obviously just\ndoing it for the money).. Christian Bale should be ashamed as he has\ndone such fine work in his time such as \"The Machinist\" etc.<br><br>All that money and THIS is what Hollywood gives us these days!!!! Where\nare all the GOOD films these days? Where are the \"Schindlers List's\"...\nWhere are the \"Empire Of The Sun's\" or \"Eyes Wide Shut\", where are all\nthe arty films such as last years \"The Artist\"?? This film was utter\nrubbish!\n"
"\nI have just seen this movie and was deeply disappointed. I think this\nis the worst movie I have seen in years. I really liked the previous\nfilm \"The dark knight\" with Heath Ledger in a fantastic role as the\njoker, but this film !? Why not rename it \"The dark knight s\". The\nmessy plot, all the logical faults, the soft comments where to\nsacrifice oneself for the city of Gotham, the tears, the worn out\nwisdom of the wise-man in the cave. I suspect a \"we're only in it for\nthe money\" attitude for the creators of this film, but then again it\nlooks as if they tried but failed, and an expensive film to make it\nmust have been. Why not use some of that money on an intelligent plot.\nInstead of this mess. Just forget this movie and save your money, and\nyour time.\n"
"\nBad guys: have selective omniscience, perfect security, complete\nwillingness to die for a very obscure cause. Perfect precision in\noperation. Good guys: Absolute idiots, useless in a fight, completely\ndisorganized.<br><br>Plot: Riddled with holes you could drive truck through, even\ncontradicting itself five minutes later because, apparently, the\nscriptwriter couldn't be bothered to care. <br><br>Motivations of characters: None, on either side. Stuff just happens.\nThe stated goals of the characters make no sense, but then very little\ndoes.<br><br>Time scale: Disjointed. Things that should take months take minutes and\nvice verse.<br><br>Fun level: Zero. No character in this film is particularly sympathetic.\nAction sequences are dull and look exactly like previous outings, not\nto mention none of them are of any consequence, solving nothing. Of\ncourse, you may enjoy pointless beatings, but don't expect them to\nadvance the plot--whatever the plot is.<br><br>This film is the Mass Effect 3 of the superhero film.\n"
"\nThe Dark Knight Rises capped off what is probably the best comic book\nrelated trilogy of movies of all time. Earlier in the series you had\nBatman Begins and The Dark Knight with this just being the perfect way\nto finish off the series.<br><br>Since the last movie it's been 7 years and Batman has been in seclusion\nsince then. Christian Bale returns as Batman/Bruce Wayne. A new villain\nhas emerged that being the menacing Bane played by the great Tom Hardy.<br><br>The supporting cast has returning members like Morgan Freeman, Gary\nOldman and Michael Caine in addition to new members like Joseph-Gordon\nLevitt, Marion Cotillard and Anne Hathaway.<br><br>The movie has a running time of about 2 hours and 45 minutes but it\ndoesn't seem like it at all, the movie flows like a 2 hour movie.\n"
"\nChris Nolan has r-e-a-l-l-y outdone himself again this time. An amazing\nstory that I don't even know who else could write such a treatment on\nthe World's Greatest Detective, the crowning glory of Nolan's Dark\nKnight trilogy.<br><br>I remember I once made a joke to myself a long while ago about him that\nif he was going to make another movie, he would probably cast Heath\nLedger and Joseph Gordon-Levitt's respective love interests from a\nmovie of which they BOTH starred in and worked on-- 10 Things I Hate\nAbout You.<br><br>It would be ironically funny how both actors are connected to each\nother from working at different times with the \"holy-moly mind-blowing\"\nfilmmaker and that the actresses that played their love interests would\npossibly too as well.\n"
"\nChristopher Nolan has out done himself again, striking not just Batman\nfans, but fans of the series and movie goers everywhere with his\nbeautifully crafted, last installment of The Dark Knight trilogy, The\nDark Knight Rises. The acting has always been well done in the last\ntwo, but something about the last one really made me feel the\nperformances were real, quite like the late Heath Ledger's performance\nas the Joker. The movie ran about two hours and forty-five minutes give\nor take, but I never wanted it to end. The story progression never\nseemed to drag on, the movie always kept me on the edge of my seat.\nThis is one that will be an all time favorite of mine, and a true\nclassic.<br><br>10/10\n"
"\nI am not going to lie. I was fearful for this movie. Normally when you\nthink of trilogy's the third one is always the weakest one-Godfather\npart 3, Spiderman 3, Matrix Revolutions. However, this movie is-in my\nopinion-the strongest of the Nolan Batman Trilogy. Nolan proved to all\nof the critics that he was right with going of the character of Bane, a\nterrorist who has great plans to fulfil his destiny in the city of\nGotham. Tom Hardy excels in this role and it is one of his best roles\nin any movie he's done. He is required to do a lot of acting with his\neyes and he has great screen presence, it immediately makes you feel\nintimidated. Anne Hathaway added depth to the Catwoman character, and\nportrayed her excellently. Yet, the icing on the cake is Christian Bale\nwho reprises his role of Batman. The whole atmosphere in Gotham is\ncreated through Nolan's direction of the film. It's a very dark\nsetting, darker than The Dark Knight was, but this adds further to the\nmain theme of the story-redemption. It was the best movie in 2012 and\nNolan, I thank you for a superb trilogy!\n"
"\nAfter watching Dark Knight Rises I concluded that if there is anybody\nwho can make kick-ass sequels its Nolan. The film contains everything,\nfrom brilliant acting, raw action, out of the world one-liners and\namazing cinematography. It is already very hard to make a sequel for a\nfilm which was just good enough hit but to make a sequel for a film\nwhich will always be remembered as the best you have to do a very\nimpeccable job and that is what is done in this movie. From the\nbeginning to the end you have some very beautiful and emotional scenes\nlike the mob fight between the police and the thugs, the rise of the\nBatman from the prison and the chants \"Deshi Deshi Basura Basura\"\ntowards the end where Alfred and Bruce see each other for probably the\nlast time and both know that he has made it.\n"
"\nThe plot is very good and unpredictable, the story is amazing just like\nThe Dark Knight. Nolan did a great job doing this movie with a very\nhuge expectations from the movie critics following the huge success\nfrom the earlier sequel, The Dark Knight in 2008. The Catwoman role was\nbigger than I thought it would be, she was an enemy but then became\nBatman's partner Tom Hardy's Bane look terrific and menacing with his\ncontrol-freak personality and a bit of Joker's agent-of-chaos. Joseph\nGordon-Levitt's role is also bigger than it looks like from the\ntrailer, from a young cops to be the new Batman It's very satisfying\nhow Nolan showed us that \"Batman Always Win\" and the fact that Bruce\nWayne live made my day Overall a very great movie\n"
"\nThis was the best way to end the Dark Knight Legend and is the best\nBatman movie ever made!<br><br>The story starts with Bruce Wayne being scarred and deeply injured\nwhilst the dark knight has disappeared for 8 years, The Dark Knight\nfinally returns as a new villain, Bane (Tom Hardy who is an excellent\nactor), terrorises Gotham City and wants to rip it apart. <br><br>Bane wears a mask to keep the pain at bay which happened in the 'pit'\n(prison) so he cannot use facial expressions to show different\nemotions. The amount of expressions he can do with solely his eyes is\namazing!<br><br>I have watched this film 3 times and found it gripping and exciting\neach time. If you have not watched this film yet, go watch it now. <br><br>Also, how was this masterpiece not even nominated for an Oscar??\n"
"\nThe Dark Knight Rises: Movie Review<br><br>We all know the first two movies in this trilogy directed by\nChristopher Nolan were phenomenal. We were all worried about whether or\nnot this movie would live up to the high standards set by the first\ntwo. Luckily, this succeeded in pleasing us and is an excellent\nclassic. The villain in this is played by the brilliant actor Tom Hardy\nwho gives an emotional and compelling performance as Bane, one of\nBatman's greatest foes. We liked how they also included Catwoman, who\nwas played by Anne Hathaway. We loved the insane thrills this movie had\nto offer. For example, Batman's jumping off of buildings, flying in\nBat-planes, and much more. We really liked the twist at the end, like\nmost good movies. The final thing that we enjoyed about this movie was\nthis: It's about Batman. In conclusion, The Dark Knight Rises is a must\nsee, and give it an A, or 10/10\n"
"\nI've always loved superhero movies and as a kid Batman was my favourite\nsuperhero and I collected as many of the comic books as I could\npossibly afford.<br><br>Saying that I've never expected a superhero movie to be between the\nbest genres of movies that I would ever watch. I just expect them to be\nentertaining and something fun to watch. I watch most of them;\nSuperman, Spiderman, Ironman, X-men etc.<br><br>I expected the same this time but I was knocked off my feet. The\nactors, the storyline, the manuscript and the filming just came\ntogether as one of the best movies I've ever seen. This movie has\nreally brilliant and powerful dialogues.<br><br>If you haven't seen it yet then I can strongly recommend it. I will\ndefinitely see it again with a good bottle of wine and popcorn. Enjoy!\n"
"\nThis movie is bad entertainment.<br><br>Not only does it not stand up with the standards of good plot / acting\n/ reason whatsoever. Not only does it has nothing to do with the\nconcept of Batman, except that black costume they gave Christian B. The\nworst part is that this movie is so morally impaired (and subliminally\njustified), its influence on all the millions who watched and will\nwatch this movie is a corrupting one.<br><br>It might sound a bit drastic, but I really wish this movie have never\nbeen produced.<br><br>I'm also surprised and disappointed that actors that I respect, like\nMorgan F, took part in this distorted creation.\n"
"\nThis is a great movie in line with the last two.<br><br>Great performance by Gary Oldman. <br><br>I think the biggest role was from Tom Hardy, shame he wasn't able to\nshow his face for much of the movie.<br><br>The only fault with it is Bane's super-loud voice, it makes no sense to\nhave that kind of sound in an open space it sounds like it was speaking\nfrom a sound booth.<br><br>It even made me wonder if the voice was from Patrick Stuart. <br><br>Cat woman's ears were very cool as did the bike used by Batman and\nCatwoman.<br><br>Besides that it was great.\n"
"\nSo after seeing the The Dark Knight my expectations were pretty high\nfor this movie and most movies would fail miserably but luckily The\nDark Knight Rises is not one of most movies. It absolutely lived up to\nmy expectations. What was good about the movie? Pretty much everything.\nThe acting was top notch in this movie everyone does a good job in it.\nThe action was great but the movie is great without action. Tom Hardy\nas Bane is one of the most terrifying villains I have ever seen. I\nlikes the characters, the story everything. The one gripe that people\nmight have is that it is very dark. But even that is not a real issue.\nIn the end I loved this movie I recommend it to everyone an even though\nits not as good as The Dark Knight its still an amazing movie.\n"
"\nThe Dark Knight Rises was a perfect sequel to a masterpiece.\nChristopher Nolan took a different direction and focused more on Bruce\nWayne/Batman. This movie is filled with lots of emotions. It has such\ngreat characters and of course the dialogs is so good. The performances\nare incredible. It was my most anticipated movie of the century. The\nmore I watch it, The more epic it gets. Personally, I think The Dark\nKnight Trilogy is the greatest Trilogy of all time and this movie gives\nthe greatest ending of all time in the movie history. I remember seeing\nit thrice and the more I watched It the more respect it earns. Thank\nyou Christopher Nolan, You Sir Are A Master.\n"
"\nI'm sure at this point everything has been written about Nolan's 3rd\ninstallment to this trilogy. So, I am just going to add this, I had two\nmajor problems with this movie: (1) The dialog audio was periodically\nburied in the soundtrack. There were many times I had no idea what was\nbeing said. I have this on Bluray and had to back it up multiple times,\nand still some things were impossible for me to understand. Along with\nthis was Bane's audio which was even more difficult for me to make out.\nI realize it fashionable to emphasize/hype-up the audio for the\nrock-concert effect. But there was so much bottom-end EQ-boost it made\nfor much of his dialog unintelligible.*Spoiler-alert* (2) Four times in\nthe last 30 minutes someone is on the brink of being killed ( or at\nleast seriously hurt) only to be rescued. Its not always necessary to\nwrite in this kind of fractional desperation, and these actions became\nobvious and annoying to me. Other than these 2 items, I loved the movie\nand was a fitting end to Nolan's brilliant and masterful vision of this\ncharacter.\n"
"\nOnce more and for the final time Christopher Nolan manages to pull it\noff as we can add another well told story in the Dark Knight Rises.<br><br>Bruce Wayne(Christian Bale) has left the vigilantly which is Batman\nbehind him and is on the verge of bankruptcy. Meanwhile a new criminal\nis arising called Bane (Tom Hardy) who's plot will threaten he safety\nof Gotham. Batman will be forced to come out of hiding and will need\nthe help of a cat burglar but things become more complicated when there\nis another plotter behind the evil plan. <br><br>The pacing is slightly off for the first 45 minutes and a couple of\nplot holes crept in but it did not effect the story overall. Tom Hardy\nsteals the show and the fact that you can barely see his face did not\nknock the effectiveness of his chilling presence when ever in a scene\nwhich just boasts his ability as a actor. It would be a crime to forget\nAnne Hathaway who provided the key role as Selina Kyle.<br><br>With some great camera work and fairly decent fight routines between\nBale and Hardy the final installment is a overwhelming success.\n"
"\nwhat can i say really, this movie is fantastic. the plot is genius. the\nactors and so well put together. the best movie of 2012!<br><br>The direction they took this movie is beautiful. and the way ended the\ntrilogy is breathtaking.<br><br>This is the best batman movie. his biggest job yet!<br><br>Save gotham one last time! the rise sequence is perfect. Lovie it! <br><br>10/10 all the way.<br><br>nolan the way.....<br><br>Nolan is amazing! :)<br><br>Also, Bane is great. Now i like joker and bane both. i like them eqaul.\nThe joker scared me but yet i rooted for him. Bane really freaked me\nout! Scary stuff!\n"
"\nWords cannot express how I felt after watching The Dark Knight Rises..\nA sense of hope that even in the most dismal of situations one should\nhave. A sense of relief that this trilogy did not go in the way of most\ntrilogies. A sense of sadness that this would be the last batman movie\nin the Nolan franchise. But more than all this, I was elated and joyous\nabout the way this movie kept my interest throughout the whole 2 hrs 45\nmin. To say one word about this film.. EPIC !!! . All the characters\ncompletely complimented one another. Was especially astounded by Bale,\nHathaway, Hardy and Caine's performances. I am definitely going once\nagain for this one.\n"
"\nagain.<br><br>I won't comment on the movie as such in detail because i am not willing\nto compare to people who are paid for writing fake reviews just for\nmarketing purpose. The IMDb rating has become a hoax over the time. In\nthis case here, it's getting really ridiculous because too many cheated\nreviews were written in advance to compensate possible negative\nreviews. By implication this means, even the makers know that the movie\nis not that good, or, as a prospectively rule for IMDb-ratings:<br><br>The higher the rating at the beginning, the more it was required.<br><br>bottom line: This is still a superhero movie with a blown up pseudo\ndeep dramatic plot around a, well, super hero in a latex costume.\nContrary to a really emotional connection of the characters to the\naudience there are still the super powers and the silly latex costume.\nIf you are trying to transform God or Jesus to an everybody with\neverybody problems you are always doing somethings silly or comedic.<br><br>Therefore any super hero movie can't be a frigging \"masterpiece\" and it\nshouldn't be rated as such.\n"
"\nas much as i am huge fan of the batman in almost every facet of the\ngenre, i am having a hard time getting completely behind this film. it\nmakes the same mistake a lot of sequels do: it tries to pack too much\ninto the story. the reason why the first two films in the trilogy,\nbatman begins and the dark knight, worked so well was because they\nmostly focused on one central story and villain. in the dark knight\nrises there are too many new characters and too many story lines to be\nintroduced and told that the film loses focus. sure it has plenty of\naction which you would expect but nolan strays too far from the source\nmaterial when it comes to the characters in the film. the cast does a\nfine job with the script they had to work with and most film goers will\nprobably like this film but i think true fans of the batman who know\nthe history of the characters will wonder what nolan is doing to their\nbatman.\n"
"\nSeriously why the hell did they have to make Batman a friggin weakling\nat the beginning of the film? Gee, this film is meant to be based on a\nsuperhero not a laid back. Yes injuries and stab wounds are sore but a\nsuperhero like Batman never gives up to save the world!<br><br>Also why the hell did they make Michael Caine's version of Alfred the\nbutler so whiny? He is meant to be a straight up person to Batman, not\na cry baby. Honestly what kind of superhero movie would show this? So\nstupid like, I swear they should've had a better cast and a better\nstoryline to draw people in. However it didn't draw me in, it made me\ndisappointed and bored even wasting my two hours at looking at this\nmovie. Thank god it's Christian Bales last film as Batman and I really\nhope Michael Caine is gone from it too. They are great actors but this\nkind of film wasn't their best choice to be involved in.<br><br>Well done DC\n"
"\nAn epic end to an epic series. This movie had everything, action,\nemotion ,every single thing. If Batman would have died, then it would\nhave been a very sad ending.<br><br>Everybody was so delighted, literally cheering when they saw him alive.\nThe acting of everyone, was just outstanding. This is the best cast\nthere ever could be. Joker was a great villain. But so is Bane. Some\nwould say Joker is better, in my opinion its a tie. Batman is the best\nsuperhero there ever could be. This trilogy just seams so real and\npossible even though its just fiction. Thanks Christopher Nolan for 3\noutstanding movies. There were no flaws in the movie. To produce such a\ngreat film after The Dark Knight, its just marvelous.\n"
"\nI loved this film, a perfect ending to the \" Dark Knight\" trilogy. It\nwas shocking, but just perfect when Batman blew up in the Bat...\nbecause at the end, when Joseph Gordon-Levitt went to the Batcave to\nbecome the new hero, it showed that Batman isn't a person, but a\nsymbol. It barely won anything though! I don't know how the Oscars\ndidn't nominate it for sound, visual effects, I even think it should've\ngotten an Adapted Screenplay nod &amp; maybe even Best Picture, they've\nnominated action films before for Best Picture. Even at the Kid's\nChoice Awards, stupid Kristen Stewart beat Anne Hathaway for Favorite\nFemale Buttkicker! It won NOTHING at the MTV Movie Awards &amp; at the Teen\nChoice Awards, it won 1 out of 5 awards, winning for Choice Movie\nActress: Action - Anne Hathaway! This movie deserved more than it got\nand it gets a full 10/10.\n"
"\nI have loved the last two movies and was expecting a perfect conclusion\nto this epic-superhero-crime-saga. This movies is so fantastic. The new\ncharacters are well-depicted that are Bane,Catwoman,Talia and Blake\na.k.a Robin. As this is Christopher Nolan's movie ,the acting is\ntop-notch but i wanted to see more of Bane,he is good but not as\nJoker,anyways Tom Hardy did a great job especially physically and that\nnasty voice. Christian Bale is again the superhero,he is most unique.\nAnne Hathaway did very nice ,she looks smoking' hot kitty as the role\ndemands. All other actors Morgan Freeman,Joseph Gordon,Gary\nOldman,Michael Caine and Marion Cotillard did supported great. There\nare few scenes which gave us goosebumps like the one where Batman\nreturns with the bat,and Hans Zimmer's music as always epic. but it\ndoesn't feels perfect like the Dark Knight,maybe Heath Ledger Pulled\nout in that one ,but it's slightly lower that the last movie. Special\neffects are amazing,everything else is great and finally a satisfying\nconclusion.\n"
"\nA movie of epic proportions because its time to rise. As Bruce Wayne\nfaces having been gone for 8 years you'd think he'd lost his touch but\nwith a little help and the bane of Gotham making himself known its time\nfor the Dark Knight to rise to the its hype. Unfortunately the hype was\na little to much for the movie and in my eyes was a little\ndisappointing but not so much i'm going to downgrade the rating because\nall in all it was a brilliant film but hard to compare to the second\nmovie because it was an extremely good film with some absolutely\namazing actors. Bane was well portrayed as the villain he is. A simply\nfantastic film that i give a 9.\n"
"\nChristopher Nolan has made tons of great movies in the past. Insomnia,\nMemento, The Prestige, and Inception. His most recognized movies are\nfrom his Dark Knight Trilogy which contains Batman Begins, The Dark\nKnight, and The Dark Knight Rises. The predecessors of TDKR were\nnothing short of great, but TDKR exceeded all of my expectations. The\nvery first lines of the movie picks up right where we left off in TDK\nwith Jim Gordon talking about Harvey Dent. Then we cut to one of the\ngreatest opening scenes ever assembled. Then learn about the Dent Act\nwhich is keeping all of the mob contained in prison. Then things start\nto go bad again and Bruce Wayne decides he must put back on his cape\nand cowl. The story is very entertaining and keeps you drawn in for the\nentire movie from start to finish. Speaking of which the ending of this\nmovie was fantastic. I did not see it coming and it was just flat out\ngenius. In this epic conclusion Christopher Nolan out does himself\nagain! This is a must see movie 10 out of 10!\n"
"\nThis is my first review I want it to be simple TDKR is an epic\nconclusion to any superhero movie ever seen its lengthy and dark\nbecause of pressure of previous blockbuster TDK it builds up its story\nslowly n deserves multiple viewings to clarify every aspect its not\nfast paced as TDK but it is just like begins in terms of story telling\nand it is superior to every other super hero movies because it delivers\nwhat it promises and this is satisfying ending it doesn't leaves you\nfrustrated TDKR completes on the great trilogies in movie history.\nFinally, I would like to thank Christopher Nolan for portraying Batman\nin a way no one ever thought was possible and for making one the best\ntrilogy of all time.\n"
"\nI wanted to write \"just see it,\" but IMDb requires 10 lines, so here\ngoes nothing. There's something in this film for everyone, especially\nBatman fans. That doesn't mean Chris Nolan and team tried to please\neveryone -- if you've seen any of his films, you know he's got too much\nintegrity and cinematic love for that. There's romance, real drama and\nfeeling, in contrast to the first two movies. Action fans will dig it,\nwingnut tech-heads will dig it. There's even a hint of the supernatural\nin this movie. War movie fans will dig it. I think it's fair to say\nthat most Chris Nolan fans will dig it too. I can't even fault the film\nfor it's moment of garbled dialogue, because those moment just fuel my\ndesire to see this movie again. Just see it.\n"
"\nI'll start out by saying that I'm not the biggest fan of Bale as\nbatman. I did like Batman begins, I wouldn't say that I enjoyed it. The\nDark Knight was a good cinema flick.<br><br>This movie on the other hand, well it's just deplorable. The story is\nweak, the narrative is all over the place, it doesn't flow and it looks\ncheap and nasty (Mad Max looked better in the eighties on a fraction of\nthe budget of this film.) Where did the money go?<br><br>Either some of the positive reviews here are from shill accounts or\nI'll just have to acknowledge that there are some people that will buy\ninto anything. I was tempted to walk out of this film. It's a turkey.\nAnd for why? What a waste of talented actors and a great opportunity.<br><br>The franchise again, has ended up run into the ground. Perhaps high\nhopes and hype just stand in the way of a good movie.<br><br>I enjoyed Kick Ass way more than these endless reboots. Even half an\nhour of the high colour series is better for the soul than this.\n"
"\nNever has a comic book film make you care about the main character\nespecially throughout a trilogy, these movies should be viewed as one\nbig film, it all adds up and comes to full circle in this one. The\nacting alone in this movie hits you hard and when Bane appears on the\nscreen it's nail biting. From Christian Bale, Tom Hardy, Ann Hathaway,\nMichael Caine, Joseph Gordon Levitt, Gary Oldman the list goes on and\nthey make this movie well worth it.<br><br>You really feel for Bruce Wayne the most in this movie (because its a\nbatman film) and the ending has the best pay off ever and is very\nemotional and satisfying. One of the best things about this movie is\nwhen you watch it more than once you pick up on things you may have\nmissed which i find more gratifying in a movie, its like watching it\nall over again and those movies to me are the best, its definitely not\na one and done type of movie so you get your moneys worth. This movie\ndefinitely deserves the praise it has. Its going to be a long time\nuntil someone makes a comic book trilogy as brilliant as this one.\nThank you Nolan.\n"
"\nI hate this movie. I just really, really, really hate this movie.\nEverything about It is about as entertaining as The Room, the quality\nof the acting is feeble at best and I'm pretty sure Christian Bale\ngives the single worst performance of his entire career in this mess of\na movie. It tears apart Batman lore, It makes Bane into a lovesick\npuppy dog that couldn't escape the friend zone and Talia just turns\ninto a cow without any of the honor her father or her clan had in the\nprevious movies. Probably the only redeeming factor about this movie is\nthe cinematography and the acting done by Gary Oldnan and Joseph Gordon\nLevitt, as for the rest of the cast It was mediocre at best. To hell\nwith The Dark Knight Rises, almost everything about It can be\nsummarized by saying Christopher Nolan thought he could get away with\nthis, he thought wrong.\n"
"\nThis movie i saw today and hoped that this movie was gonna be a very\nboring and unrealistic movie but later on the movie it got exciting and\nmore sad and intense. The movie about Batman experiencing the strength\nof Bane. Back with Christian Bale and Gary Oldman. Still have learned\ntheir actings with Joseph-Gordon Levitt as the friendly policeman\nBlake. Yay. We got Tom Hardy as Bane he really was a good actor in that\nmovie. I thought as well that Batman was dead then at the end of the\nmovie he lived still. Batman also saves Gotham City from Bane and the\nterrorist who was revealing Batman her true nature Talia Al Ghul that\nwas named after Miranda. Then at the end of the movie, Selina and Bruce\nare dating.<br><br>10/10\n"
"\nOh my god this movie was awesome !.and what an amazing ending to a\nsuperb trilogy.this movie Can't get better the story the cast\neverything is just too perfect.and no one is better than Chrestian Bale\nfor this movie he is a very talented actor with a really special acting\nskills.i am confused why anyone well hate this movie its one of the\nbest movie for all ages ! in my opinion its the best action movie of\n2012.and of course the well directing and superb special effects of the\nmovie makes it more amazing.what a blockbuster movie is this.this movie\nis no doubt a most watch and best of the year and it deserved an Oscar\nat least.\n"
"\nThis movie has everything you could want all while wrapping up one of\nthe best film trilogies. As far as bad guys go Bane is pretty much the\nepitome of the character type. I personally feel the villains in the\ntrilogy is what makes them so special. The story is great and engaging,\nit was so good I didn't even realize that the runtime was over 2 hours.\nIf you like dark, gritty, and/or action movies its a must watch. Also\nit should be noted that you should watch the first 2 films in the\nseries otherwise some stuff might not add up. It wraps up everything in\nthe trilogy and answers pretty much every question you could have. How\nit relates back to the first movie is quite impressive and after\nwatching this one you'll probably try your best 'bane impression.' His\nvoice is as memorable as his stature. So even if you don't like Batman\nyou must watch it for Bane because he is that amazing. Props to Tom\nHardy on his out of the park performance.\n"
"\nThe Dark Night Rises is one of mine's favorite movie. Christan Bale and\nTom Hardy are classy and they show great commitment to they roles.\nFascineting scenes. Just brilliant. After Joker is hard to find a true\nrival for Batman. But Bane was great and I really enjoyed. I watched\nthis movie two or three time. And I'm gonna watch it again. Such a\ngreat story and I'm sad because it can't be minimum ten Batman movies.\nWho wasn't see this must see it. Now. I really hope this review helped\nsomeone who was undecided about this movie. The women in movie was\ngreat and I love them. Marion Cotillard and Anna Hathaway are beautiful\nand really good actresses. They merged they two very good.\n"
"\nI have watched this movie several times, and the last time I watched\nit, I was still sitting in the edge of my seat! Nolan is a brilliant\ndirector who weaves every scene together and makes it look meaningful.\nAlthough the movie is well beyond 2.5 hours, there is not a scene in\nthe movie that looks out of place or was just thrown there without\nmeaning. We endured the old 60s styled batman with his cute sidekick\nRobin. It was silly and stupid and tore batman's legacy apart. Then\ncame the cheap imitations by Val Kilmar and Michael Keaton in the 80s\nand 90s Batman movies. Seriously, Arnold as Mr.Freeze? Nolan takes\nBatman back to his dark roots. He injects some realism into the story,\nreasons what shaped him to become who he became and brings Frank\nMiller's depiction of the Dark Knight straight out of the comic book\ninto the screen. Nolan's Batman trilogy is masterpiece! And there could\nnot have been a more fitting end to the trilogy. The Joker was awesome,\nand so is Bane. Go watch it if you haven't. Watch it again if you have!\n"
"\nWith many sequels, when the first film is brilliant, the director and\ncast try and duplicate that, or even try and make something better.\nMost of the time this is impossible to do, and they fail to make a film\nthat everyone is expecting to be better.<br><br>If it were not for the ending, this would not have been the case<br><br>I loved the whole film and it is another masterpiece from Nolan.\nHowever, I was disappointed with the fact that once you realize who\nMiranda Tate is, it changes the story and makes it seem like her plan,\nnot Bane's. And it turns it into a bit of a love story.<br><br>If it weren't for the twist to make it \"Miranda's\" plan, I would be\ngiving this a 10. It is a brilliant sequel, especially one that had so\nmuch expectation, and for me it met that expectation. Definitely one to\nwatch!\n"
"\nThe first thing I have noticed is,,we got a situation in the movie,,and\nagain and again we struct in it. its beyond a movie,,beyond a story.\nIts about a hope,,about a regular prayer for the man with a mask for\nthe last 4 years when he was running and dogs and cops were chasing\nhim. After watching the dark knight in 2008,,I became the disciple of\nBatman. after watching the dark knight rises,,I realized he is god.\nsometimes when your excitement level cross the limits,,,u cant explain\nmuch. Same happens to me. Batman is a normal human being, who inspired\nus to ask Jesus Christ not to take our sins. He is among and within us\nshowing the way of perfection and purification.\n"
"\nwell before entering the theater like most of u guys i had 3 questions\nin mind... 1:would it b worth the 4 year gap? 2:can it outdo the last\none (pretty tough one)? and finally would this be the end of the Nolan-\nbatman saga? one thing more i didn't watch a single trailer of this\nmovie on purpose which was pretty hard though....so the excitement was\nsky high . so after watching the movie ....its not as good as the dark\nknight ...reasons : heath ledger was too good , the story of this part\nis not as complex as last one ...this is the kind of story which builds\nup to a magnificent climax but offers little before ...plus this part\ndeals with more characters than last one so less time to build them\nup... the MOST INTERESTING and exciting part is the ending which gives\na definite hint of a new series!!\n"
"\nTitle: The title is perfect for movie story specially for main\ncharacter. Actually it's better than 'batman' to me.<br><br>Genre: Action: In my point of view, action seemed to be a wrestling\nshow.<br><br>Crime: Yes, this is an actual crime movie.<br><br>Thrill: It's truly thrilling at each and every sequence of movie.<br><br>Drama: The total dramatic plot is tremendously evolved with strong\ncharacters<br><br>Visual Effects: The batman's ride thing, bike, burning property etc are\nextremely accurate.<br><br>Character: Obviously Christian Bale and Tom Hardy.<br><br>Overall, I like it. It is really enjoyable and entertaining. Of course\nyou'd want to see it again and again.\n"
"\nI am a person that just do not believe in a perfect rating, but this\nmovie definitely deserves a full credit. I mean whats not perfect in\nit? the acting , the music, the story , the action, everything was made\nin the most perfect way ever and I Like it. I saw this movie may be 3\ntimes now and I believe it is very difficult to do such great work\nagain.<br><br>I will never forget the first time i saw it in the movies and the\ntheater was full and at the end of it everyone started applauding like\ni never saw in my entire life. If for any reason you hadn't seen this\nmovie then you should. You will just love it.\n"
"\nFrom start to finish a great movie in my life, I watch the best films,\none of the previous films in the same way was very good Batman versus a\nspecial affection there, player selections were wonderful and the\ncharacters are very good especially the previous film wild card\ncharacter was amazing. Director Christopher Nolan is a great director\nas all the movies will be very good, no part of the criticism of the\nfilm from beginning to end I do not think a movie masterpiece.\nChristian Bale is very good and the characters well suited to a player\nin his place someone else if it would suit you do not think the new\nwill be drawn Batman series, this film should keep out of this film\ntrilogy end as I think, the same staff fourth film possible these three\nfilms grow missed I believe.\n"
"\nWith this film I would say it was quite magical. The affects that took\nplace were spectacular a great increase from The Dark Night. When I saw\nthis film, as a Batman fan I purchased the trilogy ticket starting from\nthe first Batman featuring Christian Bale up to the Dark Night\nrises.One thing I would have to add is that I feel as if Anne Hathaway\ndidn't live up to the role of Catwoman as I expected also known as\nSelina. I thought that she could have used some studying from older\nmovies or even comic books to display the attitude of Selina just a\nlittle bit more. But overall this was an exciting film and ultimately\none of the best Batman movies to come in this day in age. Unfortunately\nI am not that ecstatic for Ben Afleck to play the new Batman coming out\nin theaters's in 2015.\n"
"\nThe best installment of the Batman trilogy, The Dark Knight Rises is\ninvolving, gripping, and riveting. The story is on par, as well as a\ngreat cast new to the series (Tom Hardy, Anne Hathaway, Marion\nCotillard, etc.). The movie never lags, and Tom Hardy's Bane comes\nacross as a testosterone-fueled hunk of a man who knows true pain and\nwants to do justice in his own twisted ways.<br><br>While some may say that the background story of Bane isn't what's in\nthe comics, just stop. Did it fit the movie? Maybe it didn't, because I\nbet my ass director Christopher Nolan took that into consideration. I\nbet they did a screen test, and that storyline didn't work. To be\nhonest, it's not that big of a detail and can be easily overlooked, and\nit didn't do any damage to the story. In fact, it made it *that* much\nmore interesting.<br><br>HandHStudios Rating: 10/10\n"
"\nI know most people did not like how bane was played or portrayed, but I\nloved him as a villain. I actually loved the voice that Nolan gave him.\nTo me he was a menacing and impactful villain in the movie. I also\nthought the plot by Miranda Tate was exceptional. It was devious and\ndeceiving, while deceptively cunning. Sure there was things that Nolan\ncould have done without (the kiss scene between batman and catwoman),\nbut the overall vision for Batman was exceptional. I also like that he\nleft the possibility open for future movies featuring Robin! I loved\nthe original batman with Michael Keaton, but the following batman\nmovies left a sour taste in my mouth.\n"
"\nAnother achievement by Nolan Bros. and Warner Bros... Thanks to its\nhuge budget available (ca 230 million USD) one could use\nstate-of-the-art technology and employ a dream-team of actors of\ndifferent generations: Christian Bale, Michael Caine, Gary Oldman,\nMorgan Freeman, Anne Hathaway, Joseph Gordon-Levitt... And they got the\nopportunity to have elaborated roles to play, not just appearing in the\nbackground; Michael Caine as Alfred Pennyworth is probably the finest\nof the great ones. Moreover, it is no comic strip movie, but an epic\nstory of universal values, attitudes and issues, with superhero and\nsci-fi moments complementing the script, not governing it.<br><br>Minuses from me due to length (ca 2,5 hours) and too obvious\nreferences/comparisons with characters from other hit movies (e.g.\nHannibal, Catwoman, James Bond). But still, the movie is worth watching\nand recommendable!\n"
"\nI would describe this movie as a great production with great directing\nand a terrific cast where in my opinion everyone put in great work. I\nam not gonna spoil anything specific from the movie but just say that\nits obviously a huge production with great talent behind it and a very\nworthy third movie by the today legendary Christopher Nolan. It is in\nmy opinion a great movie and lives up to the huge hype witch in itself\nis an amazing achievement. The movie will be seen by all previous fans\nand you should see it but I can not agree that this is The Dark Nights\nfinest movie even after all the great work put in and with all the\ngreat scenes combined with the best of effects with this huge budget. I\nconsider this movie a great one but far from my top five and even this\ngreat movie in the Batman category would be behind \"The Dark Knight\"\nbut as u know, that certainly doesn't mean it couldn't be great. Go and\nsee it!\n"
"\nFirst things first, don't watch the Rises without watching the Begins.\nYou will surely miss the heart and soul of the movie.<br><br>This movie is not about the action, the conflict, the villain or the\nhero. Nolan returns to the roots of this series by making Bruce learn\nmore about fear. Bruce must learn the power of fear yet again, see it\nin a new way and learn to use it in a different way.<br><br>The expected things are all there, the villain winning the first\nbattle, hero returning stronger, nice twists, action and fist fights,\nnew gadgets, effects. But don't let them blind you, look deeper and you\nwould find the crowning jewel of this series.<br><br>Another thing worth mentioning, the soundtrack is amazing!!\n"
"\nThis movie is full of excitement, explosions, and edge of your seat\nmoments. It ties up all of the loose ends in a great culmination to the\nseries. The casting is perfect. I was surprised by some of the\ncharacters that were added. I would have liked to see the story line\ncontinued though. It is a bit of a let down that they didn't\nincorporate more of the villains.Or even continue the series to include\ncooperative adventures for multiple DC heroes.It is great that they\nmanaged to keep all of the same actors from the previous movies. It\nirritated me when they changed the actress who played Rachel. I think\nthat this is a good date movie or movie for a family with older\nchildren. Of course it is great for a guys night. Make sure you have\nyou popcorn ready.\n"
"\nAs the ending chapter in the trilogy I enjoyed this movie the most. It\nhad more of Bruce Wayne than just Batman. It showed Bruce's face behind\nthe Batman mask and did so believably. Like we all know the Joker took\nthe spotlight in the previous film and the first one was more Batman\naction. So we got a trilogy with a balanced focus between the guise,\nthe seamlessly corrupt and the person behind the guise. Which is nice.<br><br>As a movie about the struggling person behind the mask this was, for\nme, the most touching out of the three films. And the most hope\ninducing, seeing Bruce Wayne recollect himself from the pit and rise to\nstand on his own feet. Re-mustering his courage and will.\n"
"\nI love the whole Batman series with Christian Bale. I love the fact his\nvoice was not nearly as annoying in this film. I did not see that twist\nat the end coming which was a nice surprise. The only thing I didn't\nlike was Bane's character. I think it was just because of the mask\nthing and not really being able to see him. The actor did a great job\nportraying the character despite this. This is one of those movies you\ncan watch multiple times and pick up different clues along the way. I\ndo wish Morgan Freeman had a bigger role in this one. Love Lucius! I\nwould like a TV movie of Lucius and Alred having some adventures\ntogether. After seeing this one, I think it's time for a Batman\nmarathon.\n"
"\nNow, if I was being honest, I would rate this movie about a 4 or 5 out\nof 10. But the fact that this is in the IMDb top-rated 60 films OF ALL\nTIME needs redressing. Because TDKR is simply lazy, full of holes,\nboring, badly-written and just generally a vain, ugly mess of a movie.\nI thought everyone agreed with me but apparently thousands think it\ndeserves a 10/10. Did you watch the film? Christian Bale does OK, Tom\nHardy is OK, Anne Hathaway is OK, JoGoLev is OK, Gary Oldman is OK, and\ndon't get me wrong I like all these actors, but none of them does\nenough to salvage this from being blockbuster filler. I guess the\nexciting music and callbacks to the previous 2 movies persuaded people\nthat it was half as good as either. It's not. DO NOT SPEND MONEY ON\nTHIS FILM! Watch The Dark Knight for the 88th time instead, or maybe an\nactual great work of cinematic art!<br><br>Note: I have been to lazy to actually present evidence for why it's a\npiece of crap. But, plenty of people have done that already. Hit up\nYouTube if you don't believe me.\n"
"\nThe action was pretty mediocre at best. The plot was decent but most\nthings were pretty predictable. Even the \"surprise\" evil villain at the\nend was predictable. During the movie I turned to my girlfriend and\nsaid \"$20 says she ends up being a bad guy at the end.\" needless to say\nI got a pat on the head later.<br><br>Is the movie good? Yes. Is the movie great? Depends.... it is great for\nthe fans of the movies but in general its not a masterpiece. I feel it\ndeserve a 8 on IMDb at the very best. The fact that its so high rated\nright now is pretty unrealistic.<br><br>Everyone saying Bane was the greatest villain of all time with amazing\nacting? I disagree... I still think Heath did a better job as the\nJoker. I feel Bane was a cool character but I don't feel he at all\nlived up to the hype provided in other reviews.<br><br>The movie is a must see for the year, but it is something you can watch\non DVD and still get the same effect. No idea how they spent so much\nmoney on this movie... the action wasn't that good.\n"
"\nI sat through 3 hours of this film last night and just could not\nbelieve how boring it was, and how it just was not any fun at all. Very\nlittle action, lots of brooding and the most boring Batman villain\never. Bane is a third rate Darth Vader, and his voice-over is mixed way\ntoo high; plus there is no motivation I could see for what he was\ndoing.<br><br>My 14 year old daughter was so bored also that she kept asking me when\nit was going to be over. I personally think this film is an early\nleader for this year's Razzies. Worst Picture, Worst Director, Worst\nScreenplay, Worst Acting, and Worst Editing are some of the potential\n\"honors\" that immediately come to mind.\n"
"\nI really enjoyed watching the film but as a Batman fan it felt like\nsomething was missing. With some of the characters written differently\nfrom their origins in the comics, it almost made it feel like a non\nBatman movie with political under tones. I had to forget what I knew\nabout the Batman universe in order to enjoy this last installment of\nthe series. But knowing what I know about how movies are made, it\nreally didn't surprise me that things were done the way they were done.\nPersonally, I think that Warner Bros. and D.C. executives need to get\nit together. I marvel at the fact that their animated movies are more\naccurate and entertaining than the live action movies. This needs to\nchange very soon! Despite my dislikes about how the film was made, I\nwas entertained for the time spent in the theater.\n"
"\nThese batman films made by Christopher Nolan always give you a feeling\nof wanting to become a masked crusader. The reason this is is because\nof the realness of these films. The Dark Knight Rises is not just a\ncomic hero movie it is an example of socio cultural problems that we\nhave in today's world. These problems such as the poor against the\nrich. The movie's action is amazing. The fight between bane and batman\nshowed that you sometimes have to fall to get back up. This movie had\nmany life lessons. Another reason why I love this movie is because of\nits darkness that Nolan portrays in the film. This darkness allows you\nto feel as though something like this could really happen, minus the\nsuperhero. This is my favorite movie in the franchise and I will\ncontinue to watch the masterpiece for the next 40 times I watch it\n"
"\nAwesome Movie and just Not a Superhero movie at all.You will get to see\nreal life sufferings and all other related Problems that you have and\nyou can get inspiration as well. Batman here is more of a human than\nthat of a Immortal Superhero. Actors gave their best. Plot is\ncompletely unexpected and gives you sense of anxiety all time. Had a\ngreat time and one of the movies I would like to watch with my family\nand yet will not get bored at all. Worth every Penny spent. Looking\nForward to seeing some similar films is future. But the Ending could\nhave been better. It seems Robbin will be seen as the boy wonder or\nNightwing in the next parts, so lets see. Thumbs Up . :D\n"
"\nIn a season filled with big movies that somehow ask even bigger\nquestions, \"The Dark Knight Rises\" feels like the superego to its\ncompetition's id. An action opus that manages at to be both viscerally\nand intellectually engaging, Christopher Nolan's highly anticipated\nthird Batman film comes full circle, examining both the Dark Knight and\nthe society that produced him without sacrificing any of the sweeping\nthrills for which the series is known. A literate, thoughtful and\ninvigorating finale, \"The Dark Knight Rises\" delivers everything\naudiences ask for and then some, albeit in fewer of the ways that they\nmight expect.\n"
"\nI loved this film, the acting was perfect. Bane was so cool, the actor\nplayed his role brilliantly and made the film great. I wasn't expecting\nto like this film as much as i did, i mean i was hooked right to the\nvery end, everything about the film was interesting. I think The dark\nknight rises is better than The dark night even though Joker is one of\nmy favourite characters but i felt this one was more enjoyable to\nwatch, it didn't bore me at all and it is a film i could watch again.\nThe Dark Knight bored me and seemed to drag on but The Dark Knight\nRises wasn't like that at all.<br><br>I think this film deserves a 9 / 10 at least. I can not really think of\nanything wrong with the film, i can't fault it.\n"
"\nThis film was a great and fulfilling finale to Christopher Nolan's\ngenius reinvention of the caped crusader! Don't get me wrong this film\nhas flaws. it's inferior to the first two and has a mild case of\nsequelitus! This films picks up 8 years from where TDK left off, Batman\nis gone and Harvey Dent is remembered as a hero! The first half is a\nlittle slow and cuts a few corners but when Bane is introduced as the\nbiggest threat to Gotham yet the pace really picks up.......only to\nslow right back down again! Despite what people have said both Bane and\nBatman are easily audible Catwoman is awesome, Alfred and Lucius are\ngood as always and the action is awesome! The problems lie in some lazy\nwriting, 3 months glossed over in about 5 minutes and Batman fixes his\nknee with a magic knee brace and SPOILER!ALERT! fixes his broken back\nwith some string..! Overall the film is good, don't let a few issues\nput you off! 8/10!\n"
"\nI don't understand why all these people are complaining about. It was a\nreally good and well made movie. Some people say that there wasn't\nenough batman.<br><br>there were some technical parts that weren't perfect, yes.<br><br>But the whole point of a film Is that it tells a message or puts an\nidea into your head not just action with nothing but fighting. This\nfilm has both elements laid out very well. It wraps the batman trilogy\nup very nicely. If you haven't seen it I highly recommend it,one of the\nbest movies made. I do sort of wish they made one more follow on to\nthis movie though because coming out of the theaters I kept thinking\nabout the ending and what would happen next.\n"
"\nI did not like how this was the most sentimental of the three Nolan\nBatman-movies. I prefer when the emotional aspects are more subtle,\nletting the audience draw its own conclusions about the characters\nfeeling given their circumstances and back-stories. In The Dark Knight\nI felt the director trusted his audience more to understand Wayne's\nreactions after having heavily emphasized his childhood in Batman\nBegins. Whereas in The Dark Knight Rises it was much dwelled upon and\nfed to us with sentimental music. This made the first part of the movie\na bit dreary, but it quickly became more enthralling and kept getting\nbetter as the story progressed. The acting was impeccable as were the\nvisuals. I admit to having prejudices against superhero-movies, but the\ncharacters are complex and interesting. So was the plot, though it is\nclearly made to appeal to a mass-audience. There is nothing wrong with\nbeing popular and I did not waste my time watching these three movies.\n"
"\nFor some reason this film is completely missing the distinctive Nolan\ntouches of finesse pacing and emotional involvement that made the\nprevious DK episodes classics.<br><br>It all just felt a looked a bit B-movie ish. The bat vehicles looked\nlike cardboard mock-ups, the \"guns\" visibly wobbled about and on the\nbat bike the effect is bordering on comical. The tank gun muzzle\nflashes had that kind of sparkly effect that was state of the art in\nabout uuh 1985. The main fight scenes lacked any sense of tension or\nintensity. The bad guys/girls lacked any real menace. The plot was\npoorly paced.<br><br>The presence of the top rank actors like Freeman Caine and Oldman only\nserved to make these shortcomings more noticeable and discordant. Think\nTerminator 3 - its basically a B movie riding on the coat tails of its\npredecessors.\n"
"\nThe Dark Knight Rises<br><br>I enjoyed The Dark Knight Rises and believe there were some great\nthings in it. Joseph Gordon-Levitt, (who previously worked with Nolan\nin 2010's Inception) was a new addition to the franchise and gave a\nterrific performance as Detective Blake. Marion Cotillard and Anne\nHathaway also surprised me with their ability to be action performers.\nBane was a bit of a letdown for me. The movie trailers promised so much\nfor his character that just didn't deliver the same showdown we saw\nwith Batman and the Joker. I keep reading about the \"political agenda\"\nthis movie supposedly had, and how it's \"almost impossible for The Dark\nKnight Rises to meet the level of expectation it had facing it\", but\nthe bottom line is Christopher Nolan redefined the possibilities of the\ncomic book/superhero movie. Even it fell way below fans and critics\nexpectations following the Colorado shooting, it still performed very\nwell and will continue to end on a note that will keep everyone happy.\nReviewed by AN/NR 07-20-12\n"
"\nChristopher Nolan has outdone himself with this one. At 3.30 in the\nmorning, I was tired. Just getting out of it, I've never been so awake. <br><br>Batman tries to force Bane to reveal the location of the trigger\ndevice, Miranda suddenly stabs him in the side. The bomb detonates in\nthe ocean and gotham is saved!<br><br>I suppose at this point, I have to turn my focus on Nolan. If he ever\nreads this... aspiring filmmaker to filmmaker, I've never been so\nenvious, jealous in all my life. It's a film that leaves me\nfloundering, wondering what I could possibly do to get anywhere near\nthis ballpark. Well done. I think an Oscar Nomination is in order.<br><br>From here, I'm not sure what to expect of the future. Does our\nimagination carry us forward, or do the studios? Time will tell.<br><br>10/10\n"
"\nBatman, the Dark Knight Rises, is an awesome, exciting movie that ends\nsadly, where Batman makes his biggest decision yet.<br><br>The movie is about how Bane, who is trying to destroy Batman and the\ncity, eventually makes a bomb that is going to kill all the police.<br><br>One of my favorite parts was when Batman was held in a prison, and you\ncan escape by climbing a rock wall that was virtually impossible to\nscale, but the amazing Batman did the impossible once again, by\nclimbing that wall! Now he has to complete a mission to stop Bane's\nhorrible plan to set off this bomb. <br><br>I also like the part when Bane announces something at a college\nfootball field, and the field collapses as a player is running for a\ntouchdown, only to fall underground once he stops.<br><br>Christian Bale as Batman, and Bane (Tom Hardy), are both magnificent\nactors in this movie.<br><br>I give this movie 8.6 out of 10 stars. It is just excellent!\n"
"\nChristopher Nolan has done it again with the latest Batman movie and\nhas found a way to finish the trilogy. The Dark Knight Rises is an\naction packed, dark adventure about finding redemption from past\nevents. With sound acting from Levitt and Hatahaway, a well done\nversion of Bane, and some high speed chases, fans will surely not be\ndisappointed. However, for this reviewer the Dark Knight is the better\nmovie of the two. In this movie Nolan has a tendency to make some of\nthe characters idiots when it comes to discovering Batman's identity\nand a few of his dialogue montages are a poorly timed to be more\nridiculous than appreciative. <br><br>For my full review please visit:<br><br>http://robbiesmoviereviews.wordpress.com/2012/07/21/action-packed-\nfinish- to-an-awesome-trilogy/\n"
"\nIt has been eight years since Batman vanished into the night, turning,\nin that instant, from hero to fugitive. Assuming the blame for the\ndeath of D.A. Harvey Dent, the Dark Knight sacrificed everything for\nwhat he and Commissioner Gordon both hoped was the greater good. For a\ntime the lie worked, as criminal activity in Gotham City was crushed\nunder the weight of the anti-crime Dent Act. But everything will change\nwith the arrival of a cunning cat burglar with a mysterious agenda. Far\nmore dangerous, however, is the emergence of Bane, a masked terrorist\nwhose ruthless plans for Gotham drive Bruce out of his self-imposed\nexile. But even if he dons the cape and cowl again, Batman may be no\nmatch for Bane....\n"
"\none of the most rewarding movies not only for having a realistic life\nstory but also for watching a true hero who gets up on his feet at the\nend regardless how badly hurt ed he was he's still there<br><br>a true hero don't always have to had super powers but rather a Strong\nwilling heart to take the right decisions at the right time &amp; knows\nwhen to quit.<br><br>never give up<br><br>accept the truth about your self <br><br>even super heroes must know the feeling of fear sometimes to be true\nheroes\n"
"\nThe Dark Knight Rises was my favorite film of the year and from the\nDark Knight trilogy.I was looking forward to this movie and it didn't\ndisappoint me.<br><br>Positive:epic action scenes ,great acting performances, very good\nvillain emotional ending ,inspiring movie<br><br>Negative: some plot wholes that didn't affect me. <br><br>Overall the movie was fantastic and I think that it is the one of the\nbest movies ever made.Long live the Batman! Eight years on, a new evil\nrises from where the Batman and Commissioner Gordon tried to bury it,\ncausing the Batman to resurface and fight to protect Gotham City... the\nvery city which brands him an enemy\n"
"\nAm not a great FAN of Super Hero movies, but Nolan Changed the entire\nmindset. Of course the Film has a lot of loop holes and glitches but\nthat doesn't take away the edge of the seat thrilling heartbeat\nexperience. What i loved most was the way a simple comic story was\npresented on the screen. I really appreciate Nolan's creativity and\npresentation.What one needs was an awesome experience and not 100%\nlogic to Action movies. The film stand all amid all minor glitches. The\nfilm has a lot of positives, The way Bruce &amp; Tom Hardy character was\nportrayed, The way Real New York city was presented, The way the Whole\nexperience stood at the end especially Bruce climbing out of the Well.\nHans Zimmer Played a wonderful part in giving a master piece. All in\nAll i would recommend everyone to watch whether they like it or not but\nfor the cinematic experience it gives in the end. A Comic Super Hero\nMovie depicted magnificently after a lot of flops earlier. Nolan has\nsilently conveyed that he is the right man who can do it.\n"
"\nI don't' want to waste your time in reading about the story of the\nfilm. I just want to say that I was a little bit disappointed.<br><br>Compared to the \"The Dark Knight\" the film is really a step backwards.\nThe story is OK, but it lacks the depth and psychological burden of the\n2nd film. Bane is the name of the new villain, but his character is\nnothing compared to the Joker. He's simply a former member of \"The\nleague of Shadows\" who's there to fulfil Ra's Al Ghul's dream.<br><br>The happy-ending is rather predictable and you won't be surprised\nreally. There's no twist. Batman and Catwoman together, Albert happy,\nRobin on his way to become the next Batman and all the villains dead.\nGotham is thankful and so on and so on...<br><br>I give it 8/10. It's a good film, but nothing extraordinary really.\n"
"\nWithout doubt the worst Batman Movie that I have seen.<br><br>The plot: Confusing and out of sync - a rehash of another Hollywood\nBlockbuster that I enjoyed but whose title I forget. A city held to\nransom by a fusion bomb that might go orf - tick tick tick.<br><br>The characters: Batman looks past it - badly beaten up - and then\nmanages to come back to full form not once .. but twice (Yawn). The\nvillain Bain you would imagine to be the main man - but low and behold\nthe real villain is his side kick who has little to do with the plot,\nwhats going on etc etc etc - kind of thing I would expect from a Harry\nPotter story rather than Batman.<br><br>Batman locked in jail - police underground - Batman has a way of\nescaping and does so from a broken position (Yawn Yawn Yawn).<br><br>Can we get back to basics here with the Penguin, Joker, The mad Hatter,\nThe Riddler, The Scarecrow etc etc etc. as drawn in the original comic\nscripts.<br><br>AND<br><br>Where was Robin? Batman without Robin is like Ollie without Hardy\n"
"\nFirst of all it was going to have to have been a miracle to top TDK. It\ntried. But this is not a fail. No way. This is a conclusion to a bigger\nstory. So as a continuation its very good. Bale is excellent as is\nCaine. In fact all the cast show here that comic book movies can have\nA-List actors and acting. The film is long, but never feels so. It\nalways builds on its momentum with you just wanting Batman to return\nand kick Bane into next week. The story is complex with a lot of plot\npoints. But with plot points come plot holes. anyway, just get\ncomfortable, sit back and enjoy. As a stand-a-lone movie its good. As a\nconclusion to a trilogy its excellent.\n"
"\nThe problems with this mess of a movie are endless. Mainly, it's just\nboring and completely unbelievable...and way too long. There's not\nnearly enough Batman and, when he is on screen, he mostly gets his ass\nkicked. Meanwhile the villains are capable of doing everything\nsuccessfully. As a result, Batman just comes off as tired and lame. The\nmovie's war scenes smack more of Iron Man than Dark Knight. The movie\ndesperately tries to prove how bad-ass Bane is, but he's just...not.\nTruly, I expected a scene with Bane loading cancer surviving, crippled\ngrandmas into a bus and blowing them up. It was that silly. All the\nsubplots slow things down: I could care less about the backstory of the\nchick with the accent, Robin (gee, I didn't see that coming two hours\nbefore it happened), the corporate stuff, Alfred's blubbering. Dull,\ndull, dull. Lastly, the sound is amateur. Everything is pushed up\nfront, so it's often difficult to understand dialogue. Just a\ndisorganized mess.\n"
"\nWhat a mess. This is one of Nolan's weakest movies and definitely the\nworst in the Batman trilogy.<br><br>I didn't expect much from the trailer, but it was even worse than I\nthought. It's not terrible, but it's not a good film either.<br><br>The characters were uninteresting, plot was a mess, lots of useless\nfighting scenes. Tom Hardy's talent was wasted and Bane character isn't\neven 1% as strong or as interesting as the Joker. Most of all I liked\nMichael Caine's performance, but that was brief and the editor rushed\nhis few scenes too.<br><br>Oh, and the movie is waaaaaaaaaaaaaay too long. Did they really need 3\nhours to tell this mess???\n"
"\nI Lithuanian, I grow up watching Lithuanian Batman with gnashing teeth,\nscythe &amp; big wing. This American Batman is girl.<br><br>Why this American Batman wear shawl, discotard &amp; rape mask? Why no\nscythe? Why this American Batman not live in bin? This American Batman\nhave big house &amp; peasant, he not good, he kind of bad man that\nLithuanian Batman fight.<br><br>Lithuanian Batman lay into American Batman real good, kick her round\nhouse &amp; cut American Bat-bosom off with Lithuanian Bat-scythe.<br><br>Look who American Batman have to fight, clown &amp; little circus freak in\ntop hat. Lithuanian Batman have to fight Imperialist Pig-dog, Gunhead\nYankee &amp; Ronald Raygun. All crazy &amp; vicious killers. Oh! Does American\nBatman have to fight silly smiling clown? It must be so hard! Pfff!\nLithuanian Batman shout at clown \"no more jokes!\" Then kick clown's\nhead off. <br><br>American Batman is girl!\n"
"\nSpoiler alert! even the movie as a whole is excellent the movie gets\nstretched out in the between. The connection between Bane and Miranda\nis not accurate according to the comics and the action sequences are\nway too slow for a batman movie. I support Nollan for bringing his own\nway to introduce bane as Mirandas \"care taker\" to bring the element of\nsurprise into the movie. The movie shows the alliance between batman\nand the law when a crisis occurs. The law needs an outlaw to defend\ntheir law is the irony i found on the movie.<br><br>Acting : 9<br><br>Story. :9\n"
"\nIn another awesome superhero movie, we see the less dark and gloomy\nGotham, with the villain Bane rounding up the support of the people of\nGotham against their rulers and usual heroes.<br><br>The truth about Harvey Dent is exposed and the people realize that they\nhave been living by a great lie, where Dent was a hero and not the foe\nTwo-Face.<br><br>This makes the people to believe in the next best thing which at the\ntime is the alleged socialist Bane. Here we can see several links to\nthe story of the first movie, recalling Duncan of the league of\njustice, and their objective for Gotham.<br><br>There is also a very interesting part of the story regarding his next\nof kin ..<br><br>A new and refreshed Catwoman also appears  Anne Hathaway, which\npersonally I think is very competent but I still prefer Michelle\nPfeiffer.<br><br>It's a very well composed ending of the cycle in a winner formula for a\ngreat superhero movie.\n"
"\nFollowing the cult of the classic, \"The Dark Knight\", this movie brings\nout another masterpiece by Christopher Nolan. Starting from direction,\nstunts, visual graphics to acting, everything just seems to be so\nperfect. Christian Bale reprises his role as Bruce Wayne Alias \"The\nBatman\", thereby establishing his fit to the role. Tom Hardy as the\nstrong evil \"Bane\", who is even more powerful than Batman and in front\nof whom, even Batman is no match, adds lots of value to his role. Anne\nHathaway as \"Catwoman\" is pretty much fitting and justified. However,\none thing missing in the movie was the charm of The Joker. Evil seems\nto be faded away in this movie, as compared to Heath Ledger as \"Joker\"\nin the previous installment. Other than that, the plot, storyline,\nscript, dialogues and dynamism scores equally well, making it another\nmasterpiece by Christopher Nolan.\n"

"\nChristopher Nolan steps back into the director's chair for this sequel\nto Batman Begins, which finds the titular superhero coming face to face\nwith his greatest nemesis -- the dreaded Joker. Christian Bale returns\nto the role of Batman, Maggie Gyllenhaal takes over the role of Rachel\nDawes (played by Katie Holmes in Batman Begins), and Brokeback Mountain\nstar Heath Ledger dons the ghoulishly gleeful Joker makeup previously\nworn by Jack Nicholson and Cesar Romero. Just as it begins to appear as\nif Batman, Lt. James Gordon (Gary Oldman), and District Attorney Harvey\nDent (Aaron Eckhart) are making headway in their tireless battle\nagainst the criminal element, a maniacal, wisecracking fiend plunges\nthe streets of Gotham City into complete chaos. ~ Jason Buchanan, Rovi\n"
"\nWhat a great movies this is, and what a power was brought in to this\nmovie by the role of Bane by Tom Hardy! He became after this role one\nof my favorite actors... It was a very dark movie witch came out very\nnice. I'm waiting for a new part in witch they probably bring in\nRobin... Can't wait ;) For those who didn't see it yet, just do, it's\nreally good! I liked the part where the stadium got blown up, I thought\nthey didn't do that, like in a lot of other movies... But yeah they\ndid, and it has given this movie something more... I must say, i did\nlike the previous episodes but I was never this blown away, I think\nthis part had it all. The great and big action, the story line, and not\nto forget, the makeup and costumes. I'm given this one a 9 of 10.\n"
"\nThis one got me more emotionally involved than the previous two\ninstallments, but still feels like it lacks real substance. The images\nof the October Revolution repeating itself in New York, er, Gotham, are\nchilling, but the movie holds back, and it shouldn't. Let us see Alfred\nand Lucius Fox hang. Let's see Catwoman gang-raped. Let's see Batman\nreally die. That's the problem with Hollywood movies, especially of the\nsuperhero genre  in what I suspect is fear of alienating a large\nportion of the audience, they don't allow anything of real consequence\nto happen in the story. When all is said and done, everyone still\nlives, everyone is happy, with no hint of the tremendous social impact\nthat Bane's reign would have left on the city and the world. The Dark\nKnight was a step in the right direction, and its immense popularity\nattests to that, but instead of building on its success and going even\nfurther, Nolan apparently got cold feet. Which is a shame because he\nhad all the elements  great actors, great special effects  to create\na truly great movie.\n"
"\nI don't normally review movies unless I feel compelled to do so. In\nthis case, I feel I was duped into expecting a very good movie. Isn't\nthat what I should have expected with an 8.5/10 rating?<br><br>I won't get into the details, they're well-documented throughout these\nreviews. And I won't detail the nonsense that is considered a plot for\nthose that may not have had the displeasure of viewing this movie.\nThere are so many times that I was left shaking my head that I\nsustained a neck injury just watching this.<br><br>I like the idea of Bane as a physically powerful foe, I like Anne\nHathaway as Catwoman (although her character has serious flaws) and the\nveterans do their normal commendable job attempting to bring stability\nto this disaster.<br><br>I gave it a 3 because I like Batman and I still want to like him. I\nwill put this movie out of my mind so that I continue to like him.\n"
"\nIn this movie; they had the best villain played by an amazing actor.\nThis movie is about hope. I thought the casting was brilliant in this\nmovie, I thought the fight scenes were intense with Batman and Bane.\nThis movie had a fear vibe with what Bane was attempting and it was a\nthrill to see Gotham fight back and win. The problems that I had with\nthis movie was the aspect ratio switch on one scene. Another problem I\nhad was the ending, I didn't understand how Batman survived the bomb\ndrop but it's down to interpretation. To me, The Bat had super speed.\nThe final ending could have been much better. At the time it would have\nleft some viewers to think that the next film would have featured Robin\nbeing the next Batman. But only for those who would not have been aware\nof the DC movie plans. <br><br>This movie had a great epic thrill feeling which excites me.\n"
"\nView show love, to see the same still feel like Her favorite two main\nactors rapture The latest Batman movie - and final - Christopher\nNolan's pursuit of humor and avoiding flashy. Use technology to create\nnot just a voyeuristic masterpiece that is. And abstain from using 3D\nimages while pursuing maximum IMAX and the classic effect of contrast\nand texture.<br><br>Unlike The Dark Knight - the film with political insight, keen for a\nworld in crisis and acting as a game changer by Heath Ledger. That this\nis a tight climax to a triple beam elevate a film genre, and helped\nwipe out at least a certain ironic associated with \"super hero\".\n"
