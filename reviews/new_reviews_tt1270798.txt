usually i am not a fan of marvel comics but i made an exception for this one  if you followed the comic book series it uses similarities from the comics to the movie
and we also get a cameo appearance from hugh jackmanwolverine
i may have not noticed the infamous stan lee appearance that he always makes in the movies that deal with his comics
but i am sure it was there
i think its a great movie for ages 5 to adult
it has history very mild violence some comedy drama and romance
all the elements to live up to the xmen franchise
it is not at all disappointing if you have knowledge of the other movies or the comic book series
that is the only flaw i see
it is definitely a tribute to the fans of xmen
personally i am a dc comic books fan but if you are a comic fan or just a fan of the movie series your in for a treat  but if you have no knowledge of either of those things you will be disappointed
worst movie i have ever seen
i see all these reviews saying that the movie was excellent
i bet all those are from multiple accounts of the director of the movie no idea what his name is
there is absolutely no way that so many people think that this movie was any good
i refuse to believe so many brain washed people have watched this movie
oh my god it was so bad the action was terrible butterfly chasing a screaming ginger lol
full of clichas
terrible awful please add score 010
wow i have to write 10 lines to complete this review
there is really nothing to say about such a bad movie so i will repeat myself
there is really nothing to say about such a bad movie so i will repeat myself
there is really nothing to say about such a bad movie so i will repeat myself
there is really nothing to say about such a bad movie so i will repeat myself
ive seen all the xmen movies and i wasnt sure if i would have liked this one too
i didnt like james mcavoy that much and i feared that this movie could prove a letdown
i was wrong
the movie is great well directed cgi good to watch without being more important than the movie itself and  most of all  the acting was really good
mcavoy and fassbender were great in depicting xavier and erik
their emotions look real not acted their chemistry great
and the other characters work well too villains and good guys
i liked also the bondesque style of the part during the 60s
drama and humour are well mixed and they give depth to a good action movie
just a last line magneto is right in distrusting humans
i tend to approach prequels with caution
caprica is seriously lacking as are many others
without dragging things out this film has a first rate cast and engaging storyline
something i believe the other x men films lacked
they were all good films with amazing actors the third film being a bit weak but they were all character stuff and wafer thin story lines
this has plots ideas and many gap fillers of mutants introduction into society and provides a wonderful sub plot staged around a very significant part of american history
the script action and characters are all excellent and so many idiots are watching this on download or computer screens
do so at your own peril as this is one for the big screen
restored a lot of faith in marvel movies
oh and i have a whole new respect for kevin bacon after seeing this
having previously seen the three xmen films not to mention read the comics during the chris claremont 80s i had a big interest in seeing this depiction of the beginnings of the team of hero mutants as founded by one charles xavier
that said the real exciting action doesnt go into high gear until near the end but by then there is real compelling drama concerning the main characters of the later known professor x james mcavoy and his initial friendturnednemesis magneto michael fassbender
they along with kevin bacon as someone magneto wants vengeance againstsebastian shawmake the film truly worth seeing and brings this entry down to earth whenever things seem to take a direction that im not sure of
having said that the director matthew vaughn is one who takes care to make sure the other mutant characters dont get too much short shrift so on that note xmen first class comes highly recommended
i am really surprised that so many people liked this movie
i found it quite boring
maybe they thought it was a good idea to cast kevin bacon as a psycho ex nazi mutant scientist but i think it was really really a bad idea
the two leads were okay but for the most part the story was just so so and really didnt help define the characters at all
in fact some of erik ultimately magnetos actions are inconsistent to what he should have done with all of his power
again the character of charles xavier is a weakling who is way too emotional about his friends to be effective as a leader
the comic book xavier has always been better than anything they have put on screen small or large
this movie is unquestionably the best so far in the year of 2011
i went with really high expectations to watch this movie and boy could i have been any happier to see how it turned out
this movie is so freakin awesome that my back bones chilled a couple of times at its majestic awesomeness
its just superbly made extremely captivating acting above all my wildest expectations
to say that i almost cried a few times at the beauty of the footage is to say a lot considering that a i never cry in movies b this is no drama i dont wanna spoil any bit of this masterpiece to nobody therefore i am done for today
just brilliant 10 stars because there arent any more stars to give otherwise i would have given it an 100 for sure
its a complete terrible tedious rubbish of a movie
all positive reviews here are fake
the story was very boring
the sr71 blackbird aircraft should only have one or rarely two seats and it is not hollow inside
the submarine had a way too large interior for its size not to mention its interior was completely unrealistic
the scene with the missiles at the end was embarrassing to watch
im not sure why there are so many positive reviews
one might begin to wonder whether somebody is manipulating the system
and how could this movie possibly have an 8
0 rating
i no longer trust imdb and its ratings
imdb has become corrupt unfortunately
i demand that imdb does something to fix this
i avoided this for years s
thinking it was going to be naff
but no
its great fun
its got a cool 60s bond vibe
fassbender is going all out bond in this
jennifer lawrence is adorable
emma frost is like a later day farrah fawcett its measured
its well paced
its cool
its sexy its almost as good as the first x men film
it just lacks good old wolverine
but the performances here are great
if like me you had your doubts forget them
sit back and enjoy this
we need more 60s themed super hero movies lol
im looking forward to watching the sequel already
its reaffirmed my love of xmen films
after the wolverine movies ruined them a bit
take everything that was excellent about the first trilogy and put those ingredients in the hands of someone who knows exactly what they are doing with the comic book genre then sit back and enjoy the results
superb entertainment delivered by matthew vaughn of kickass fame directing an engaging and dynamic cast
james mcavoy and michael fassbender are entirely convincing at xavier and lehnsherr and they have strong support throughout a wellconstructed story from both alisters and upandcoming young stars alike
jennifer lawrence is again worthy of great plaudits essaying the troubled mystique and january jones is the screen equivalent of super glue to the eyeballs
kevin bacon has no trouble convincing as the personification of evil and the action hinges around his hideous masterplan which is straightforward in its scope but as usual with xmen its the personal relationships where most of the real fireworks are flying
great stuff  essential viewing for hero fans
after three xmen films and a pretty poor origins story attempt for wolverine in a film of the same name i might be forgiven for feeling a little underwhelmed by the prospect of sitting down for over two hours and watching another reboot of a popular comic book franchise
turns out contrary to my expectations i had a great time
this is an origins story that attempts to entertain you rather than bog you down with exposition
the film is surprisingly light on its feet and has many fun action set pieces as well as some eye catching sets and sexy performances
michael fassbender shines for the good guys as magneto while kevin bacon seems to be having the best time of his career in his role as a bad guy
my only disappointment was the performance of james mcavoy i found his character hard to believe and more importantly hard to like
something just seemed a little forced
full credit must go to matthew vaughn for pulling this off
i was a huge fan of kick ass and if it werent for how much i loved that film i may never have tried this
im glad i did
this movie is totally a disappointment
its just full of clicha
a nuclear war between russia and usa which is ignited with treacherous and deceptive act of bad xmen is going to happen and good xmen want to prevent it
bad xmen hope by this war they destroy the rule of human race and instead they shall rule the world
all xmen have kind of stupid ability which may be attractive for kids and teenagers
the characters dont have any profound disposition and traits and they are just plain with simple ambitions
they dont communicate with audience as they should and dont make any sympathetic thought and feeling through the viewer
there isnt any exiting part in this movie despite the fact that the director had wanted to bring some surprise by stupid treason of some characters to each other
alongside days of futures past these are the best xmen films with great music score
all of the characters are given a role and not just logan the professor and magneto
seeing beast is excellent as he is finally given more screen time
this movie gets the x men done correctly
each of the team brought together are allowed to develop
the villain is not the most important part of the story and so does not take away from what is a story ultimately about the xmen team
using their powers to solve problems and actually showing scenes in which the xmen are coming to terms with their abilities
their actually shown as mutants with human frailties
this is a great movie
the first 4 x men movie were good movies
this is better
this movie has a lot of action
it has great acting
it has a great story line
it should have gone to the oscars
7
8 is a good ratting
but this is such a great film the 7
8 is underrating it
wolverine is better
x men day of future past is also better
x men apocalypse is also better
but still a great movie
i give it 9 out of 10
this is a very good movie
see it
it is a prequel
and has far has time goes
this is the first one
great movie
most of the time if the first four movie are good the fifth one is going to be good
see this movie
it is a great movie
it is one of the best action movies from 2011
see it
it is a must see
history is fun
and mixing real history with fantasy is more fun
but remember this philosophy of we are the good guys and they are the bad one is bad
there a video on youtube that bill clinton asks americans for forgiveness because cia tested new drugs and equipment on citizens
and more usa keep doing this tests in humans immigrants without documents
frisks not christians
another issue in about nazi deutschland
why did only east of deutschland the nazi were bad
where are the concentration nazi camps to kill people on france
on italy
remember hitler was catholic
a good christian
but one more time xmen did a great movie
this is indeed a very great movie in the xmen movie franchise
we get to see magnetos tragic past and lots of other xmen character origins in this too
the main villain in this who was of course a nazi was the one that took everything from magneto in that concentration camp in poland
we also take a look at professor charles xavier with hair in this and boy does he look good with hair
we also see him having a love interest in this which is also really cool
this movie contains a lot of action and it takes place during 1962 the year of the cuban missile crisis when the soviet union was shipping nuclear missiles to cuba until president john f
kennedy ordered a navy blockade around cuba to stop the missiles from being shipped in
the early 1960s is also the time when the xmen were introduced along with the hulk fantastic 4 and spiderman
this movie is truly amazing
enough said
xmen first class goes back to the past before wolverine jean or any of the original xmen group we still have the original characters but just some new faces jennifer lawrence as mystique michael fassbender as magneto and nails it and james mcavoy as the professor
the movie shows the tragic past of magneto and how charles xavier lost his feet and of course nicholas hoult as beast who does a pretty great job just like everyone else i dont have a problem with this film its just not xmen without wolverine although hugh jackman has a small funny cameo in this movie and its amazing
i give first class a 9 out of 10 cause its pretty cool
xmen first class aims to start all over again the saga and director matthew vaughn hits the film xmen first class can be greater than the inner trilogy the cast is great michael fassbender james mcavoy jennifer lawrence kevin bacon and etc the special effects are great the beast and mystique of makeup are good the story is very well told the motivation of magneto is plausible in terms of fidelity in comics the movie part especially in training where the havok is older than the cyclops
cyclops 16 he was already the leader of the xmen wheres jean grey storm iceman nightcrawler and others mystique is not the original lineup more fine at least they will do this in xmen apocalypse i hope the soundtrack is good and the action scenes are good too even xmen not be true in the original formation i do not understand why the cyclops is so barely tapped the film the film was a great start
note 8
5
mathew vaughn directed this second prequelthough fifth entry in the franchise set mostly in 1962 where young mutants charles xavierplayed by james mcavoy and erik lansherrplayed by michael fassbender are enlisted by the u
s
government to organize fellow mutants they locate through the use of the cerebro through which charles uses his telepathic powers
once together they are attacked by evil mutant leader sebastian shawplayed by kevin bacon who has a past with erikfrom wwii that puts them on a collision course that will determine the future events that turn erik into magneto and lead his antihuman brotherhood of mutants
surprisingly good film does a fine job filling in the back stories of key xmen characters who are well cast with younger actors
lots of bigscale action scenes helped by a thoughtful script and authentic recreation of the early 1960s
fox decided to reboot the xmen franchise with new actors as younger versions of the familiar roles
this prequel takes place mostly in 1962 before and around the cuban missile crisis
its a good start especially if the most important part of this exercise is to get good young actors to refresh the franchise
james mcavoy is the new charles xavier
jennifer lawrence is mystique
nicholas hoult is beast
michael fassbender is magneto
with them as well as others the franchise looks to be on solid grounds
as for this movie itself its a little bit slow at times
i think were suppose to go weak in the knees every time a new actor for each iconic role is revealed
its still great to see the new actors in action
theyll probably grow into their roles in the next movie
this is a solid starting point
this was a very pleasant surprise
after the infamous x3 and xmen origins the xmen franchise was slowly crumbling
one good movie could rejuvenate the franchise instead we got a fantastic movie
the acting stood out especially michael fassbenders performance as a young magneto
i was immediately invested in the story and captivated by the progression of magnetos character
i thought this was done very well
xmen first class is not your typical summer blockbuster its got more layers to it
for one the script is witty and effective
i found myself on the edge of my seat just waiting for the very well written dialogue
another merit this film carries is the amazing soundtrack composed by henry jackman
it was evident that hans zimmer had his fingerprints all over it for the music sounded similar to inception which is never a bad thing
watching all my favorite xmen characters when they were young was really cool and just makes this film all the more special to me
i would rank this film among the greatest superherocomic book movies ever made
xmen not exactly the most popular of comic book superheros have a faithful following and this flick is about the first assembling of young mutants and the developing of individual powers as charles xavier forms his mutant training academy
james mcavoy is professor x and michael fassbender is magneto and both are youthful and reckless
the mutants have yet to make themselves public but when the ruthless villain sebastian shawkevin baconin 1962 connives the russians to move missiles into cuba xavier and magneto gather the small band of mutants as a covert cia operation to use their powers to stop what would be known as the cuban missile crises
formidable skills make for a masterful climax as the world escapes a nuclear armageddon
i am not actually an xmen fan but i am a fan of jennifer lawrence who plays the mutant named raven
also in the cast rose byrne oliver platt bill milner zoe kravitz jason fleming and january jones
i absolutely love this film and think its ace however it has really disappointed me in one very big mistake that has been made making this film
if you notice at the end of the film professor x gets paralysed then if you watch xmen last stand he is walking with magneeto when they are older
its such a disappointment that you have failed to make this film fit in well with the others
for me personally it has spoilt the rest of the films and should have had more thought put into how the story would fit in with the others
i am aware that everything else fits in but this is such a poor error that should not have been made
until i noticed this error i really enjoyed first class as i thought the characters where good and the powers they had were pretty cool but now i cant help but dislike this film knowing the massive error you have made
after an ok last xmen film with some heavyhitting actors seemingly riding into the sunset marvel and a new set of cast and director comes roaring back in a quite long but not altogether dull reboot type movie
especially for the first hour or so of its runtime xmen first class is disjointed and everywhere  it lacks focus and drags out its introduction too long
however by the 2nd half the movie has settled down and the characters have mostly come together
the strength of the cast like the older movies is rightfully with its 2 leads james mcavoy and michael fassbender especially mcavoy who seems to faithfully represent a young and dashing xavier
i enjoyed almost every scene with him present
unfortunately though kevin bacons antagonist seems more mischievous than truly malevolent so the movie kind of lacks an archvillain
anyway there are both worse and better superhero movies out there
a revealing prequel to the xmen saga
unlike any movie of the trilogy this one has a decent plot and good characters development
indeed it allows us to discover how everything unfolded and why the characters are in the predicaments that they are in the trilogy
many of the characters that we have in the xmen trilogy are replaced by younger actors in order to fit the story which is happening in the past
for instance james mcavoy has taken over patrick steward as professor charles xavier and michael fassbender as a young magneto
together they both offer a different and new perspective on the rivalry those two characters have towards one another
highly recommended
it was great to watch the origin story of professor x and magneto
it took turns in unexpected ways
first of all the characters and the performances are so good
it was fun to watch these mutants get together and save the world
xmen first class is the the type of movie you could again and again without getting bored
it is my favorite xmen movie and im super excited for xmen days of future past
the best thing about x men movies is there characters
theyre so lovable funny and have a great chemistry and hugh jackmans cameo as wolverine just speechless
it was so so good
xmen first class was a great enjoyable fun origin movie
i loved it
ive been looking forward to this movie for quite some time
however i was rather nervous going into as id gone to other rebootsprequels and been disappointed
the special effects arent over the top
they dont need to be because the storyline is quite decent
michael fassbender and james mcavoy both shine in this movie
michael fassbender brings a lot of intensity and anfry malevolence to the role and james mcavoy adds some youthful charm to professor xavier
my only complaint would be that january jones is just present as eye candy
i also felt that nicholas hoult struggled a bit when it came to credibility but maybe thats just me
just watch xmen first class
what a mind blowing movie it was
as a matter of fact i really was expecting this movie to be good
after all i love x men franchise
the effects were superb
amazing actors
awesome story
what else do we want in a good movie
i ran out of words for this movie
it was so cool
the best one in the franchise
i hope the sequel will be much more cooler than this one
and what amazing actors they were
who can say that it was a movie
it seemed like everything was real
but im sad that mystique went to the other side
but it was her choice
and the scene in which erik took the submarine out of the sea
that was the best part of the movie
i hope it gets nominated for oscar
because we wont see such a good movie afterwards in 2011
my ratings 1010
i just came back from the theater and both my wife and i agree that this was an outstanding movie
the storyline was crafted superbly and the characters were well done
the acting was good throughout the entire cast especially the main characters mcavoy and fassbender mesh really well together
i would highly recommend seeing this movie even if you arent an xmen buff
its entertaining and lets you understand the back story
im really hopeful that the box office numbers are high and that the studio decides to continue along this story line
the actors and actresses fit their roles perfectly and the i could see this becoming a franchise
im keeping my fingers crossed for more
the story takes place at the past when charles xavier and erik lansherr are young and they team up to prevent the beginning of world war 3 that the evil mutant sebastian shaw is planning in order to fulfill his dream an earth beloging only to mutants
the movie is a prequel to the other x men movie series but its not as good as the previous ones
the story line at the beginning is confusing as it is switching from one place to an other from past to future
however the rest of the story is getting better and the action scenes are quite good
the performances are good too especially fassbender as magnito
so 5 out of 10 because it is a nice action movie with some funny parts but it resembles other action movies
the xmen are my favourite heroes from comicdom so i was always a little worried when they said they would be making films on the subject
despite not getting the classic xmen i would love to see i cannot fault the films they have made so far and this is no exception
fast paced and exciting with a terrific cast especially jennifer lawrence this film is a tourdeforce and i cannot wait to see days of future past i realise that several anachronisms have been reported for this film but that is the risk you take when you include factual events in a movie
i for one have decided to suspend my willing disbelief on that part
for me this film is almost as entertaining as prometheous
i have been a fan of many marvel comics and films over the years
one particular franchise with promise was xmen
with many different heroes and villains within the comic franchise itself this gives film makers a lot to work with
as seen with the other instalments this has been reflected through the introduction of new characters including villains and different plots
xmen first class is a brilliant insight to where it all began and how the modern day xmen came to be
this film has everything action drama suspense and even bits of comedy
coupled with brilliant effects and terrific acting it is a good film for all audiences
this film is a must see for any marvel comics fan
i do like the motion picture but it is contradictory and conflicting
if you research both comics and the xmen films in the last motion picture it demonstrates charles and eric aka professor x and magnito going to home of jean grey when she was a girl and charles aka professor x was walking where as in the motion picture they have him in a wheel chair before he had met both jean and scott
in the comics and at least shown in one of the films he had met both jean and scott prior to his accident
the movie itself was very good and does explain a few things as to how raven and charles met
it is informative but a bit contradictory it does show however scott aka cyclops and storm in the movie while he is locating mutants
the movie is really awesome
enjoyed a lot while watching
the dialogues of charles xavier professor x in training camp  where in the real powers were bought out from the mutants is meaningful and true
the moral of the real life is explained with mind blowing screenplay the true and actual powers cannot be realized from anger and agony
they are the outcome of concentration and peace of mind
i watched the movie alone by myself however would like to watch it again with my friends as the movie contains the trilling scenes especially when the russian war ship is about to cross the territorial boundary of cuba
good work  mr
matthew vaughn mr
sheldon turner and mr
bryan singer also the entire team
i appreciate it
after less then spectacular installments in the xmen series with xmen 3 and the wolverine origin story the first class did a great job of showing you how the team started out from scratch
the movie is anchored by 2 great leads with michael fassbender as mangeto and james mcavoy as professor xavier
in the other movies you see xavier and magneto on the other side but this is still when the both of them are still working together and shows you what lead them to picking opposite sides of the battle
the movie has a good supporting cast also with kevin bacon rose byrne january jones jennifer lawrence oliver platt and others
definitely recommend this movie for any comic book movie fans or just anyone who wants to see a good movie
i never read a comic book and when i saw the first xmen film i was intrigued but confused
throughout the trilogy i always thought i was missing a lot of the story and this is it
first class is the missing link that will answer questions for the fans of the movie who dont follow the comics and it is one blockbuster film that more than lives up to its hype
from the special effects to the makeup and finally to the actors this film is amazing
movies like this never win awards but you will be hard pressed to find better performances than those of james mcavoy kevin bacon amp michael fassbender
the whole cast was terrific the story was fantastic and the special effects were truly out of this world
this is a great film and im craving more
i cant wait to see what connections the next forty years bring between first class and the trilogy
when its all said and done i hope i can watch all these films and truly understand the whole story
after the disappointing xmen origins wolverine the xmen saga has been fully pumped once again with the origins of the friendship of charles xavier and erik lehnsherr
xmen first class is a very stylish film but still has a brilliant mixture of dark grit and brutality that made x2 such a great success
michael fassbender makes a perfect approach to erik rocking a turtleneck sweater and a great irishgerman accent
and james mcavoys charles is sophisticated when sober and hilariously intelligent when drunk
but the spectacular thing is this they dont even reflect ian mckellen and patrick stewart
this is one film that can stand on its own two feet and make itself its own thing
the supporting cast is also quite brilliant
the star of the careerboosting hunger games jennifer lawrence is sexy but also sweet as mystique lucas till amazes as havok and lenny kravitzs daughter zoe shines as a hero and villain as angel
you must see this film
it doesnt really get any better than this in the x saga
the vast array of uncanny yet stunningly entertaining mutations of the unparalleled members of the xmen first class assemblage bond harmoniously to form a wellbalanced strain of sheer enjoyment
the solid performances of both james mcavoy charles xavier and michael fassbender magneto combine to interweave several moments of sentimental resonance that will certainly send the audience trembling with strong emotions
however the incorporated action sequences follow the typical superhero battle formula comprising gargantuan explosions spontaneous and bland teleportations and the trite levitation of nearly any object in the vicinity which at times induces monotony given the repetitiousness and ridiculousness of these action choreographies
per contra the logical storyline smoothly and comprehensively links all past xmen films
though the action scenes prove to be the weaker gene the talented performances from both mcavoy and fassbender most definitely enmesh to restructure a previously shapeless sequence into a revitalized cruciform helix
at first i thought these movie would fail
because u know in past few years all the movie which has 4 sequel on it equals total failure
but not this movie
this movie has successfully captivated the whole new level in the xmens movie franchise
after first 2 xmen movie which i could say quite good the third xmen the last stand it just soso and flat
so when i heard they wanna make the 4th sequel of this movie the first thing that came to my mind  well it can be good or can be soso but surprisingly director matthew vaughn did a great job in this movie
this movie it kind a back to their roots by simply easy to understand story but not a cheesy and boring one because again in this movie we watched the prequel and most of all the story is very originally from the xmens comic
so as u could may guess it would make all the xmens fans happy
the standout point in this film is an intense action the great plot and the good act from all the actors especially michael magneto fassbender which can make sir ian mckellen losing his magnetic power again
i really wanted to like the movie as i very much like the franchise so far but it just did not do it for me
to me it felt like seeing an heavily edited version of a film cut from a 6 hour version
like we were only shown some highlights here and there before taking us to the final scene with the submarine
i liked what i saw but i felt like there was a lot missing to make the movie complete in lack of a better word
it seemed to me that they had the script for a mini series but had to cut the script to fit a 2 hour movie so they had to leave out the little things that tied the story together
i could really wish for an extended cut of the movie clocking 35  4 hours
that would probably make it more interesting to me
i admit i enjoyed it but there were a few pretty major problems
mainly casting ineffective storytelling plus it didnt add up with the other films
for example why didnt they just cast kevin bacon as the nazi soldier in the beginning
the two actors looked nothing alike
the film didnt explain itself clear enough either
now i realise its a reboot not a prequel
but thats just plain ol lazy
overall it was pretty damn entertaining and impressive visually
i really liked james mcavoy and michael fassbenders performance
but i dont understand why charles had an english accent when born and raised in america
there was no better way to bring about the evolution of each character in x men
credit goes to james and michael aka charleserik
these two are really a driving force for the entire movie
besides this kevin as shaw rose as the cia agent and raven as mystique were splendid
one thing that stands out in this movie is the way they actually brought about the birth of each character and you can then relate it to the x men sequels seen in the past
the first half of the movie is character heavy and focuses more on the script
you are then geared up for the action in the second half
yes i was hoping for a lot more action and fight sequences but that nevertheless it did not change my views about the film
overall i feel the film deserves a 7 or 7
5
but please dont walk in the cinema expecting the film to be a classic or a blockbuster and you will enjoy the film better
a very entertaining film
from start to finish everything just moves smoothly
this is what i call tight writing in a script
every scene just has its up down and perfect transition into the next scene
at no point in the movie will your mind be wandering or your attention wane
the movie grips you from start to finish
yeah it has its clichas and tired messages due to the material being used
but really if youre just out wanting to have a good rolickin time then i suggest you watch this movie in a theatre together with your s
o
or your entire family
after the atrociousness that is wolverine the xmen franchise just got saved by james mcavoy and crew
now if only they can do even better for the upcoming gambit spinoff
that film can really use nolans genius
i loved this movie
xmen movies as of late have not been the best but i saw this one and within the first 45 minutes knew that this movie was a step in the right direction
its no secret to those who know me of my love for mystique and magneto so to have two amazing actors breath life into my favourite duo was an amazing affirmation from the movie telling me the franchise was in more than good hands
i will go on the record and say wolverine is the most overrated xmen in my opinion and revelled in the fact that he was not the primary focus in this film
the movie lends itself very well to a 60s vibe and the story is an origins story of how xavier and co created the xmen
watching the film unravel you realize that matthew vaughn the director understands that action itself is not enough that to create characters you really care for stands as the proper motivation for gluing you to the screen
i really cared for all of the characters and the payoff was the best xmen movie so far
xcellent film p
im a huge xmen and all things comic book fan but the recent trend in the movie industry is to put out butchered comic book movies just to make the big bucks
the xmen series the hulk and even the batman and remake of superman movies attest to that
they all sucked why you may ask well crappy story lines that deviate from the originals bad acting and shitty cgi action scenes
these movies just seem to kid oriented which is good for the people collecting the paychecks bigger demographic  bigger payday but sucks for true more mature fans who covet a more sophisticated and grittier cinematic presentation
dark knight was a god send and a true testament to how every adaptation of a once thought kid genre can make big waves on the big screen
dark knight set the bar high and is now what we as fans expect to see every time our comic book heroes cross over to a full length live action movie
