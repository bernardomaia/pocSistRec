"\nJust got back from an early screening of the movie. As someone who like\nJohnny Depp, I was excited to watch the movie, but nearly ended up\nwalking out of the screening halfway through the movie. There are\nhardly any entertaining moments, an extremely weak plot, and some very\naverage acting. Sure, Johnny Depp may be a brilliant actor, but there's\nonly so much an actor can do to salvage an immensely boring film. The\nweak development of the love story, limited exploitation of what could\nhave been some interesting time-travel anachronisms and absurd\nadditions to the plot (like ghosts and werewolves who remain mute\nspectators throughout the movie only to appear at the very end) were\ninsulting to the intelligent movie-goer..\n"
"\nThe film can't decide whether it's a fish-out-of-water comedy or a\nGothic thriller/romance. Instead, we get treated to a bipolar movie\nthat is, at times, really funny, but mostly full of unnecessary\nexposition. I think Burton wanted to honor the TV show by adding in so\nmany details, but frankly, it was boring at times as they moved from\none plot point to another. Some of the \"wrap up\" surprises at the end\ncame off as forced. Though I'm glad they didn't rely on as much CGI to\ncreate the set pieces, one major scene involving a concert looked like\nit was stolen from the Austin Powers films.<br><br>Johnny Depp did some great physical comedy as well as Helena Bonham\nCarter and Jackie Earle Haley, but Dark Shadows should go back to the\ngrave.\n"
"\nTime Burton scores again. This show is great and I will be getting it\nwhen it comes out on Blu-ray.<br><br>This is NOT a remake of Dark Shadows. It's a funny tongue-in-cheek\nspoof in the lines of Burton's Alice in Wonderland. As a die-hard fan\nof the TV series I can honestly say this is just a lot of fun. Depp is\ngreat and the rest of the cast was well chosen. Even the music, which\nis all of the 70's era, is perfect for the movie. Alice Cooper's\nappearance was a blast and fit in well. There are twists everywhere and\nit doesn't matter if you catch them or not. I bet you'll miss a few.\nLOL <br><br>Go see the movie. Don't over analyze it is, just enjoy it. Come back to\nIMDb and rate it. It deserves a 10.\n"
"\nLets be frank. If you had a dime for every time Hollywood took\nsomething dusty and old, and tried to turn it into something shiny and\nnew, you could retire.<br><br>In fact, most of these attempts barely work. But (having seen this one\nfront to back three times since its first release) I believe this is an\nexception and moreover I believe that viewers have become so jaded to\nthese attempts that they instinctively rebelled against the film (hence\nthe low rating) without even giving it a chance.<br><br>The script by Seth Grahame-Smith is witty and clever and engaging. And\nwonderfully demented. The cast is to die for. Eva Green and Johnny Depp\nare at the peak of their craft, delivering with a straight face bits of\ndialog that lesser actors would choke on. The supporting cast (almost\nall A-list with a young Chloë Grace Moretz) is rock solid.<br><br>Overall a delightfully deranged yet still entertaining exercise in\nbeing silly -- which is exactly what Hollywood aims for in these odd\nexercises.<br><br>The IMDb rating is much too low. Give it another chance.\n"
"\nI was a huge fan of the original Dark Shadows serial soap. Watched it\nevery day until it was preempted in Los Angeles by the Senate Watergate\nHearings. Tim Burton's version of Dark Shadows staring Johnny Depp and\nMichelle Pfieffer is a great send-off to the series and other 70's\nhorror movies. Green puke: The Exorcist. Wearwolf: Wolfen. The boy\nstaring in the hall: Damien from The Omen. And the 1970's soundtrack\nwas second to none, starting with \"Nights in White Satin.\" It was\ntacky, funny, a little scary, and definitely another Burton hit. I\nwould go see it again in theaters, watch it every time it is on T.V.,\nand go see the sequel too. This is one of few movies that I see out of\nthe over 40 new ones I see per year that I can truly say: You gotta see\nthis flick!\n"
"\nWorst movie I've seen in a long time! Recommended for people with\nshitty taste in movies. I was shocked that a great actor such as Johnny\nDeep is playing the main role in this film. The main character is a\nvampire. Through the first part of the movie,you can learn that he is\nnot a friend with the sun light. But still see him in daily sun but\nwith a huge hat,umbrella and sunglasses. And at the end,there he\nis,saving a little boy,and running into sun. Normally,you would expect\nthat it just hurts him,but no he gets on fire. I don't know if this\nsupposed to be a funny film. For me is just sad,and 2hours of my life\nthrown away. And of course money,I'm not disappointed for spending it\non the ticket,rather than knowing the money is going to the movie\ncompilers.\n"
"\nAs a person who watched Dark Shadows in the beginning when it first was\non TV it was a great disappointment to watch this movie. Maybe it would\nhave been okay if I had not seen the original shows but watching this\nadaptation made me cringe!<br><br>Johnny Depp and Michelle Pheiffer should have known better if they had\never really became involved in the original show.<br><br>Makes me wonder what Jonathan Frid and other people in the original\nshow really thought of this movie. <br><br>My daughter saw it at the theater (got in free) and she said she was so\nglad she didn't pay to see this nonsense!<br><br>Johnny Depp has always been a favorite actor of mine especially his\n\"Pirates\" movies, but after this debacle I will be very leery of him\nand any future movies!\n"
"\nSometimes when a talented director and actor get together to make a\nfilm they forget something, like a cohesive plot. Not to worry, they\njust fill in the void with computer generated special effects, sexual\nencounters that completely lack chemistry, some boring 1970s clichés\nand a werewolf. Hey, it's Tim Burton! It's Johnny Depp! So grab some\npopcorn and watch as these Hollywood Giants crap their pants. (yes, it\nis crude and they deserve it.) This movie is horrible. Lame from\nbeginning to end. Poor timing by all involved. It appears that neither\nBurton nor anyone else involved was sure what they wanted this movie to\nbe, so it fails to be anything. It is neither dark nor scary.\n"
"\nBleh! I am so over the weird and quirky Tim Burton stuff. How about a\ndifferent approach... make an interesting, smart, and compelling movie.\nAs a fan of the original Dark Shadows TV show, this was a huge\ndisappointment. What a missed opportunity to provide the massive\nbaby-boomer audience with something they could really sink their teeth\ninto. I am a fan of Johnny Depp. But my two favorite movies of his were\nChocolat and Donnie Brasco. Both of these movies had absolutely nothing\nto do with Tim Burton. He is a very capable actor with the ability to\nplay many genres. But I don't think he has explored his potential\nenough. This will never happen as long as his movies involve the\n'creative team' of Helena Bonham Carter and Tim Burton. Bored to tears,\nI had a hard time staying awake while trying to watch this movie.\n"
"\nSeeing this made me wonder why Tim Burton and/or Johnny Depp ever\nthought this would work as campy comedy. <br><br>It totally doesn't. Not that my liking the TV show kept me from being\nopen to other approaches to the material. I guess it takes a special\nkind of person to laugh at a \"comedy\" that features lots of bright red\nblood on the screen. And I guess I'm not one of them. <br><br>Michelle Pfeiffer is wasted too. And she seems like someone who should\nhave known better. The total of enjoyable moments clocked in at under\n10 for me. An opening scene set on a cliffside, and a nice song by\nAlice Cooper that sounded great on the theater speakers. I barely even\nlike or listen to Alice Cooper anymore. The fact that his appearance\nwas the most enjoyable part lets you know how little I liked this.\n"
"\nFor me ,it is one of the Worst movie of Johnny Depp.I watched this\nmovie due to Johnny Depp,but he disappointed me.Movie is boring with\nbad screenplay.<br><br>I don't know why this movie is put in comedy genre.There is no comedy\nscene.Even there is not any horror content.<br><br>There is no story in this movie.Acting is average.This is truly\ndirector's fault that movie is so awful and boring.He should have\nworked more on screenplay and characters.<br><br>There is nothing in this movie that I was expecting.<br><br>I give this movie 4/10.\n"
"\nDark Shadows is one of those movies that you expect to be excellent\nwith Johnny Depp vamping it up all comedic, with a cool 70's vibe, but\nsomehow this still falls short. The story itself is good -interesting\nwhich sees Barnabas Collins (Depp) turned into a vampire by a witch,\nthen buried alive. Two centuries later, he is freed from his tomb and\nemerges into the very changed world of 1972. Returning to his ancestral\nhome, he then aids his dysfunctional descendants.<br><br>There were lots of things I liked here; the special effects were kinda\ndazzling including Johnny playing dress up (again) and damn did I ever\nlaugh at that violent love scene (up and down the walls). The fact that\nit took place in the 70's was fun, groovy baby, and Michelle Pfeiffer\ndid a good job as the family matriarch.<br><br>Watching Barnabas struggle in this modern world was also initially\namusing but truthfully most of the really good bits were shown with the\ntrailers on TV. Ultimately I felt kinda meh about the whole movie, I\ncan't put my finger on why this wasn't better though. 08.13\n"
"\nAn imprisoned vampire, Barnabas Collins, is set free and returns to his\nancestral home, where his dysfunctional descendants are in need of his\nprotection.<br><br>I'm a Tim Burton fan, I'll admit it. So, I was looking forward to Dark\nShadows. At the beginning it start's off really well, but by the end of\nthe film I left the theater disappointed. It's Tim Burton film so you\nknow Johnny Depp is in it, and he is a entertaining lead as usual. Eva\nGreen was over the top, but also entertaining. Like all of Burton's\nfilms it's very pretty to look at. Michelle Pfeiffer, Helena Bonham\nCarter, Jackie Earle Haley &amp; Chole Moretz feel very under used. The\nchick that played Barnabas's love interest, Bella Heathcote is a bit\nbland actress. The main reason why this is such a disappointed is\nbecause once the film hit's the party scene it got way to confusing and\nthe rest was downhill from there. I wanted to like this, but I could\nnot,C+.\n"
"\nThis is an entertaining film. It did however have some problems, for\nexample in some scenes you felt just lost in weirdness, Johnny Depp\nplays a quirky, weird vampire who is turned into this creature because\nof an evil curse on him, he does play a quite funny role and i think he\nis a very good actor as a whole but although you're sometimes laughing\nand enjoying yourself a lot, sometimes you feel a bit trapped by it in\na way.<br><br>The idea of ghosts being real is a whole stupid part of this film and\nit wasn't brilliantly done, definitely not one of Burton's best films,\nbut it's entertaining.<br><br>6/10\n"
"\nSuch a wonderful cast. Nice picture and scenery... and a really\nbad,bad,bad and nonsensical script. Shame. I think the actors were\nreally unable to produce something better. Lots of nonsensitive humor.\nTim, please, stop making movies like this one. So much money for\nnothing.. i prefer your old-good-innovative, short-budget projects. And\nI believe most of your fans are becoming tired after Sweeney Todd\n(which was your last decent movie). Leave the remakes. Also, the music\nwas nonexistent in the whole movie. Lacks emotion. To sum up, Mr. Seth\nGrahame-Smith, i hope your next attempt will be a better one. You are\nyoung and you have future.\n"
"\nThe best part of this 2012 film is Karen Carpenter's rendition of Top\nof the World. Other than that, this is one totally forgettable film.<br><br>Tim Burton and Johnny Depp seem both to have become masters in Gothic\nhorror-direction and acting, respectively.<br><br>A usual curse is placed on someone, Depp, and he is freed from a casket\nto arrive in 1972's Maine where his ancestors had come from England.<br><br>The family is made up of essentially the characters The Munsters from\ntelevision fame.<br><br>Michelle Pfeifer, believe it or not, is actually normal. With a red\nwig, Helena Bonham Carter plays a psychiatrist there to help a\ndisturbed child. Carter is literally a blood sucker and pays for it.\nSome good acting is realized by Eva Green, the woman who cursed the\nCollins Family for the Depp character not loving her.<br><br>There is all sorts of mayhem and utter madness, but this is far from a\nsatisfying movie.\n"
"\nBased on all the previews, one would think that this was a remake of\nLove at First Bite - a fish-out-of-water comedy, with Barnabas coming\nto terms with 1972. These trailer scenes probably make up 80% of those\njokes for the movie. It is not a comedy that the trailers would leave\nyou to believe.<br><br>Overall it is a quirky retelling of some of the elements from the\noriginal series. I did enjoy it for what it was. You do have to go in\nwith the expectation that this is a Burton/Depp film. Johnny seems to\nplay one character for Burton - pauses in his speech, some weird\nwalking movements, and lots of hand waving. A little more of a darker\nside would have fit this film perfectly. <br><br>While the rest of the cast does a good job (Michelle is great as a\nmatriarch) the biggest problem I had is that characters appear when\nneeded and then go away for long spells. I had almost forgotten that\nVictoria was a role she was off screen so much. Same with a few of the\nother supporting characters.<br><br>Don't expect anything super serious or super funny.\n"
"\nUnfortunately, it was a total bust. My favorite childhood TV show made\ninto a movie by two of my favorite folks, Director Tim Burton and actor\nJohnny Depp. What could possible go wrong? - everything... Mr. Burton\nnever decides if he is making a comedy or a horror or a drama or a\nsatire and ends up with a jumbled mess. What an utter disappointment.\nEva Green tries her best with the script she is given and Jackie Earle\nHaley as Willie Loomis gives a competent performance. Johnny Depp seems\nbored with his role and obviously does not have his heart in it.\nGulliver McGrath does bring the innocence of David Collins into the\nfilm and was the only character that brought to mind the feeling of the\n60's hit show. I knew with it being a Burton film that I was not going\nto walk into a remake of the Dark Shadows of the 1960's, but I did not\nexpect to walk into a piece of junk.\n"
"\nFirst off, it's just plain bad. No coherent direction, at times it\nfeels like it's trying to be a comedy, others it tries to be serious,\nsince it never chooses it just falls flat. The staging, costumes, etc\nwere gorgeous. Depp was great as Barnabus, but, the story played out\nflat.<br><br>As for the comedy aspect, what you saw in the trailers was 90% of what\nwas funny in the movie.<br><br>Classic failure of Hollywood today, wow you with the trailer, get a big\nname to lead the film, have gorgeous sets and costumes, set in a\nbeautiful location, in the end it's a stinker.\n"
"\nMy overall opinion is not negative but I feel like the idea is wasted a\nbit. The movie started pretty good. But after twenty minutes,\neverything became predictable. It was not boring but it was not very\nentertaining either. I don't even think this movie is comedy. There are\nvery few jokes. Overall acting was kind of OK but Depp is becoming a\nvery one dimensional actor by playing always similar characters. The\nscenery was pretty good and I must say, visuals were quite good as\nwell. At the end, I wouldn't watch this movie once more but at least I\ndidn't regret paying for it. If you didn't like the other Depp and\nBurton movies, don't even think watching this one.\n"
"\n*This Review Contains Spoilers*<br><br>I'll start with this, I've read some of the critic and user reviews and\nmost of them don't give the movie Dark Shadows a good name. I am a user\nand I want to set the record straight! If you like vampires that aren't\nall that scary then see the movie. If you're a fan of Johnny Depp or\nTim Burton then see the movie. If you haven't seen the series then go\nsee the movie. I only say don't see the movie if you have seen the\nseries because, yeah, there is some parts to the movie that aren't all\nthat great and if you like the series a lot then chances are you won't\nlike th movie. I've never seen the series myself but my mother has.<br><br>Personally, my favorite part of the movie is when Barnabas dodges the\ngreen goo that the witch vomits and he says \"Missed me\" only to get hit\nright in the face with the green goo again.<br><br>I also like the movie because it's a lot funnier than people think.\nSome people just don't have that good of an imagination.\n"
"\nIf you loved the original series, you are probably not going to like\nthis movie, as they take great liberties with some of the characters\n(Julia Hoffman is now a lazy alcoholic, Roger Collins is a thief and a\ncoward) and the sexual stuff that does happen will probably make you\ncringe. Bad Tim Burton. Thanks for ruining a revival of this series.\nThere are no actual \"characters\" in this film. Everyone is pretty one\ndimensional. I think there were a lot of missed opportunities here\nconsidering the talented cast. Omg.....this movie wins by far the\nStupidest, Corniest, Most, Disturbing and the Definitely Skip Award.\nJohnny Depp was awful along with everyone else in the movie!<br><br>Yikes! What a disaster!\n"
"\nDark shadows is just absolutely terrible, it is muddled, BORING, poorly\nacted to be honest, and a complete waste of talent. Tim Burton is\nobviously a very talented actor, so I don't know what kinda whacked up\nstuff he was on when he did this movie, but even if he was that's still\nno excuse for delivering this trash to us. I'm not a humongous Depp\nfan, but he has been good in previous films, he was NOT in this one, he\nis annoying and way too over the top here. This film is not funny, when\nit tries to get out a laugh, it falls flat every time. Helena carter is\nlazy and lackluster here too. And I usually like Michelle Pfeiffer, but\ncome on Michelle, you deserve better material than this! The events are\nboring and the plot i.e. uninteresting and the script is very lazy and\nphoned in. 1/10.\n"
"\nThis movie is an insult to the watcher. With Tim Burton's overly used\nplots and characteristics, after watching 2 or 3 Burton films, you will\nget offended and ask yourself; \"How many times a Director can play me\nfor a fool?\" <br><br>Tim Burton executes this well. With weak plot, taking so much from the\nearlier Tim Burton movies, fails to achieve anything noteworthy let\nalone entertain the audience.<br><br>I think we are sick of the \"Burtonesque\" cast choices and visuals and\nafter a while, seeing hundred Johnny Depp characters, Barnabas Collins\nshows us, Depp is not a good actor, as a matter of fact, Depp is really\nunable to do anything besides playing himself.<br><br>Dark Shadows is a bad idea, Tim Burton should be ashamed.\n"
"\nIf it wasn't for the obviously enormous budget that went into hiring\nstars and starlets as well as the CGI efforts and special effects\n(which by the way look idiotic at some points), this movie would be\ncategorized as a B-Movie at best.<br><br>The story is flat and uninspiring (bad witch curses everyone, yaaaawn!)\nand flat out predictable. The end doesn't make any sense at all and\nseems completely rushed.<br><br>Seeing Johnny Depp as yet again another make-up-overloaded \"weirdo\ncharacter\" gets boring by now as well and all of the other actors\nexcept for Eva Green seem to not give it their best at all. The acting\nis laughably corny in a lot of the scenes.<br><br>This movie tries sooooooo hard to be funny it is painful at times and\nrarely successful. The obvious product placements throughout the story\nare annoying as well.<br><br>3/10, unwatchable disappointment and a waste of time.\n"
"\nTim Burton used to be gooood. He did. Johnny Deep used to be a genius,\ntoo. He did. Here they both failed. Miserably. Utterly. Wholly.\nCompletely. Totally. Pity. This is a vanity piece, as they say. Truly\nso. Why was that film shot? We did see Depp as a freak with all his\nnauseatic mimics, his wiggling limbs and queer-ish gestures. We saw in\nawful Sweeney Todd. We saw Helena Bonham Carter and we know already how\nbad she is. Any clear spot? Pfeiffer? Nay, she is very much like in\nStardust. Old hat. So, any clear spot? Yeah. Alice Cooper. Music. This\nis all. All that dark, sepia, gloomy scheme is so funny and laughable.\nWe never even smile. We saw all those mannerisms before. The winning\nformula Burton / Depp is a small smelly Quatsch here. No, no redeeming\nfeature here at all. No wonder, it was so panned by critics. They are\nright.\n"
"\nPretty average. OK for a random evening, but quite unmemorable too.\nSeveral plot lines are thrown out in the early stages of the movie, but\nthen altogether left alone. There is an attempt at humor, it does work\nat points, but it also feels a little forced and the whole thing\nbecomes too cheeky because of it.<br><br>I had low expectations about Johnny Depp after liking him less and less\nin recent movies, including Burton's movies. But Depp is OK here.\nStill, Depp, as well as Eva Green, Johnny Lee Miller, Michelle\nPfeiffer, Chloe Grace Moretz, Helena Bonham Carter, while turning in\ngood performances, also are too caricatural. A little too much\none-liners. Cheeky is the word. I do not blame the actors, it is the\nscript.<br><br>Also, there is some unnecessary CGI/post-processing. For example, the\ndocks and ships at the beginning of the movie look very unnatural.\n"
"\nAfter seeing Tim Burton's Ed Wood (which I consider his masterpiece) i\nbecame a huge fan of his. Hes really unique with has his own touch of\nGothic and dark imagery. I was really hyped for Dark Shadows but when\nsaw it and i was disappointed. What kills it: I loved the movie, the\nhumor is cool but what kills it is the lack of focus. The movie didn't\nfocus on all the characters except for Barnabus of course but i didn't\ncare for any of the other characters. for example Victoria is one of\nthe main characters in the story and we see her only for 15 mins! i\nalmost forgot she was in the damn movie. Another thing is the acting,\nthey were all great except for that little boy, he was boring!. What\nmade it good: One of the coolest references was a poster for\nChristopher Lee's Hammer Dracula A.D 1972,which then followed by a\nconservation between Barnabus and the Count himself Christopher Lee\n(C.Lee who played Dracula in every Hammer Dracula). Alice Cooper\nappearance was the best for me he made the movie for me the best part!.\nOver all i give it 6/10 average.\n"
"\nIt's has the vibe, in Tim Burton's view. I think sometimes combining\nthe two, can be refreshing. We need more films that require original\nand creative imaginations of any genre. Even mixing two or three genres\ncould be good justice. Tim Burton outdone himself on all his films and\nthis one, did not disappoint me at all. Johnny Depp's character really\nwas different than any films he has ever done, but very good sense of\nhumor and has a Gothic view on how vampires should be. All of the casts\nand staff members who worked on this 150 million dollar movie, made\nsome fans go. \"Eh, whatever,\" but most Burton's and Depp's fans likes\nit. Yes, it is strange, dark, and funny but remarkably incredible.\n"
"\n\"Dark Shadows\" (2012). <br><br>Another Tim Burton movie that looks beautiful (costuming,\ncinematography, makeup everything!) <br><br>I enjoyed the performances by Depp &amp; Eva Greene &amp; I actually liked the\ntheme of the movie &amp; generally the story (it got a little flat in the\nmiddle), overall I liked this movie...however I might be the only one\n(the reviews I've read have been pretty harsh).<br><br>Eva Greene is becoming one of my favorite Actors, she is hard to take\nyour eyes off, she seems to have a great presence on screen &amp; I look\nforward to watching her in all her upcoming movies.<br><br>Disclaimer: I haven't seen the original adaptations of Dark Shadows.\n"
"\nUsually i don't really care to write down a review i just give it stars\nbut this, this i had to do. i need to be explained (probably by rabid\nsheep) why this movie has a 6.5 rating and the droll which is the The\nAvengers got a 8.5 or so ?<br><br>Dark Shadows is beautifully realized in any way. The acting is top\nnotch: Johnny Depp and Michelle Pfeiffer need i say more ? the scenes\nwere amazingly crafted: no flamboyant CGI which makes films feel like a\ngame on my PS3 the story and plot were nice and kept your mind running\nas to what's to come. in the end what you get is a well made movie in\nall its facets.<br><br>i really don't get why crap like the Avengers which had nothing to it\neven the battle scenes were poor, boring and felt straight out of a\nvideo game at best, rates higher than Dark Shadows<br><br>People if you value your thinking more than you value your reality\nshows go see this, if not go see The Avengers\n"
"\nit was plain old fun. if you're expecting Shakespeare, or looking for\nan Academy Award winner, look somewhere else. If you want to be\nentertained by Helena stealing every scene in a bad wig, and Johnny\nDepp doing something other than the pirate series, this is the place\nfor you! I've seen it twice, will buy it on BluRay, and love it. Sure,\nthere were some scenes that were kinda out there, but it's Tim Burton.\nDid anyone expect anything less? Compared to Sweeney Todd, it's a\nclassic. Compared to Casablanca? It's pretty awful. But isn't that what\nwe go to movies for? Mindless escape into someone else's story other\nthan our own??? Go see this movie. And yes, I'm praying for a sequel,\nwith HBC coming back to exact revenge.\n"
"\nI loved it! Although, I never watched the original. It was an amazing\nmovie the acting was really good! It is a definite must see! I kind of\nwished it was longer because the ending could have been potentially\nbetter. I thought is was worth the money spent. I am definitely buying\nit when it finally comes out on DVD and Blu-ray! Its a perfect date\nnight movie. I considered it more of a comedy than a horror movie...\nEspecially since there isn't anything scary about the movie. The joke\nsetup and timing was perfect! I hope this helps y'all make a decision\non if this movie is worth the money. My personally opinion is that the\nmovie is, but its up to you! Enjoy!\n"
"\nI love Johnny Depp and I love Tim Burton. Together they can be sublime.\nLook at \"Ed Wood\" and \"Sweeney Todd\" Here, well here they seem kind of\nlost. Everything is in over the top tones without getting to the root\nof anything. The performances are shrill and disconnected with the\nexception of the wonderful Helena Bonham Carter. The script is\nunderwritten and the story is tired and unconvincing but in the present\nfilm going landscape it is more enjoyable than most others. I'm tempted\nto advise Mr. Burton and Mr.Depp to be a bit more daring in their\nintentions. We're all aware of Burton's visual wizardry and of Depp's\nremarkable beauty and talent, why not put all that at the service of\nsomething meaningful?\n"
"\nI am always open to something new. I really appreciate Tim Burton and\nJohnny Depp's works, as they are always unexpected and different. This\none was not a replica of the show, but showed it respect. How could\nanyone expect a show that ran for so long to be represented in a two\nhour movie? This was a fantastic piece that I look forward to seeing\nagain and again. It is not a straight up comedy, but I do not know of a\nbetter way they could have sold it. It's nice to see vampires that do\nnot sparkle, and cannot be touched by sunlight. Burton and Depp have\nmade a fantastic movie that has monsters that look like they are\nsupposed to. It does homage to the original show, as well as the\nmonster actors of yesteryear.\n"
"\nThe original TV series was so beloved for its mystique and darkness.\nIt's hard to believe, but this was actually scary at that time. I was\nexcited when I heard the movie was being made. However, I was expecting\nit to be a full scale horror film. This is what the loyal DS fans were\nhoping for. It would be great if they would remake this movie in a\nserious horror style. Bet the profit margin would be significantly\nhigher.\n"
"\nMan, This one reminds me of when Tim Burton was on top of his game,\nmore or less. And I remember this not doing well so well with the\ncritics but I liked it. Wish I saw it sooner but whatever. Anyway, the\nfilm is based on an old boring show from the 70s. They rebooted it as a\ncomedy, just like what they did with 21 Jump St. The movie is about a\nrich European immigrant business man who was turned into a vampire by a\nwitch who loved him, and stuffed in a coffin for a few hundred years,\nonly to be freed during the 70s and help his descendants and blah, blah\nblah. Check it out, you'll laugh a few times. The ending is rushed.\nFinal score, 7 out of 10.\n"
"\nI'm finally getting around to review this one. The film is a cute\ntongue-in-cheek comedy horror. I will admit, I do wish they would have\nmade the film a pure horror instead but I did enjoy the comedy in it so\nI won't complain to much about it.<br><br>There is a great cast, a Gothic charm, some rather weird scenes that is\nenjoyable. Story is fine and it's well filmed. But it pales in\ncomparison to the TV show which was a drama and not comical.<br><br>Yes I wish this film took itself seriously and it was a pure drama\n(that's why I didn't rate it higher) but the Burton and Depp dark\ncomedies are to much for me to resist so therefore, I'm giving it a\nrating I think is fair enough.<br><br>7/10\n"
"\nComing from someone who has never seen the TV series, or learn of their\nexistence before reading the reviews:<br><br>This movie feels shallow, the themes are stated rather than portrayed,\nthe characterization incomplete, fragmented and felt unconvincing. And\nthere are some sequences, for example the last fight sequence, that\nfelt awkwardly hastened and incomplete (statues came alive, and then?)\nat times. The only part that I felt was well done was the \"endure\"\ntheme and the destruction of family house.<br><br>Just a quirky film, fun to watch, good to experience the interesting\nseventies X vampire match-up, and of course Depp as the main\nattraction, but overall the film really has no staying power.\n"
"\nI watches every movie of Johnny deep cause his acting seems beyond any\nother actor and I liked this movie cause as usual Johnny deep's acting\nwas good but the story line was not so impressive seems like they just\nfelt to make a movie and made one Alis in wonderland was good then this\none. and then He woke up from a coffin after 200 hundred years and came\nfor just his family seems like bit less interesting I thought he would\ncome for revenge and then .. . I was expecting more action cause its\nwas a vampire movie and the end was something expected .<br><br>but its Johnny deep so you can see movie who likes him its good for\nthem and I can say movie is well can spend time on it but don't expect\nanything good from movie.\n"
"\nI would run home from school, literally run, to watch Dark Shadows with\nJonathan Frid. It, Les Crane, and Dick Cavett were my must-see TV.<br><br>Johnny Depp is wonderful as Barnabas with some hysterical lines (i.e.:\nupon seeing Alice Cooper, \"ugliest woman I've ever seen\"). His\nperformance as the anachronistic Barnabas is nothing less than\nspectacular. Helena Bonham Carter as Julia Hoffman was a great bit of\ncasting as well. And seeing Jonnie Lee Miller (Elementary's Sherlock\nHolmes)as the sleazy Roger Collins was great. The rest of the cast does\na fine job as well.<br><br>Others may see Dark Shadows as an insult to the memory of the TV show,\nbut I see it as both a wonderful homage and an entertaining send-up of\nboth the show and the times.<br><br>For what it's worth, enjoy or not. It's your choice. I choose to be\nentertained by it.\n"
"\nI know that Dark Shadows as a rather campy TV series rather well known\nin the USA but not outside of North America and this was a concept\nGothic film right up Tim Burton's and Johnny Depp's street.<br><br>However having watched this a few weeks ago and I am struggling to\nremember the film does not bode too well.<br><br>It seems Burton had difficulty in getting the tone right and the script\nwas half baked before the project was green lit. Its like they were\nmaking the Pirates of the Caribbean sequels where the screenplay was\nstill on page 2.<br><br>I can see why this was a box office disappointment, its visually very\ngood, what else would you expect from Tim Burton, the humour is\nsporadic, but lacks focus or a developed plot and fully formed\ncharacters.<br><br>The film is set in 1972 with a revitalised Barnabas on the prowl again.\nAs he acquaints himself with his descendants and tries to save the\nfamily business but old ghosts refuse to die.\n"
"\nBarnabas (Johnny Depp) is a successful man in 1770s town of\nCollinsport, Maine. He makes the mistake of breaking the heart of a\npowerful witch Angelique Bouchard (Eva Green). She in turn dooms him\ninto a vampire, and then buries him alive. Two centuries later,\nBarnabas is accidentally released into the world of 1972. His\nCollinwood Manor has fallen into disrepair. The dysfunctional remnants\nof the Collins family have fared little better.<br><br>This has the great Gothic look of Tim Burton. He is able to have both a\n70s look and an old Gothic look. However it is very difficult to root\nfor Barnabas who is essentially a killing monster. It is not fun. And\nit is not funny. Although there is a monster sex scene that produced a\nfew smiles.\n"
"\nI agree with some of the reviews, that \"Dark Shadows\" director Tim\nBurton didn't know if he was doing a camp comedy, a horror film, a\nromance, or a drama.<br><br>He would have been best to go with the camp comedy in this 2012 film,\nsince that comes off the best. Loved Barnabas experiencing McDonald's\nand television and thinking the Carpenters worked with wood. I loved\nthe 1972 settings and references. And I loved the soundtrack.<br><br>There are lots of special effects here, some are fun, some just aren't.\nI saw this as a rental and I think it probably comes off much better as\na rental.<br><br>Johnny Depp is sheer perfection, so serious, so intense, you can't help\nbut laugh at some of his line deliveries.<br><br>The rest of the performances are fine, but Depp is fabulous.<br><br>Depp obviously loves working with Burton and vice versa, but let's face\nit, not all of their work together is inspired. This film is based on a\nflimsy script that could have been so much better, if only Burton had\ndecided on which way he wanted to go. The comedy stuff was great.\n"
"\nI am old enough to remember watching the original \"Dark Shadows\" soap\nopera, but I was a kid, and so do not remember much about it. Best I\nrecall, they played it straight. But it was, of course, a campy\nconcept, putting Gothic horror elements into a daytime soap. Which\nbrings us to this movie. A lot of movies seem to fall into this trap:\nthey come up with a really good and/or novel premise for the film. And\nso the beginning of the movie, where they are establishing that reality\nis really good. But, it is a movie, which means it requires a story\narc, climax, etc. superimposed upon the premise. And that is where it\nall goes, if not bad, it at least goes not as good. That seems to me to\nbe what happened to Dark Shadows. It was still an amusing film, with\nsome interesting actors doing interesting roles. Worth a look, but\ndon't buy it.\n"
"\nIt's all about Johnny Depp as Barnabus Collins. Every scene that you\nsee him, there's definitely a kind of atmosphere that follows him\neverywhere. While the other characters of the film just seem boring,\nJohnny adds life to everyone in every scene he's in. It almost became\nfunny in places. The humor is of the dry variety of comments/jokes.\nThey are told in a creepy and weird manner by Johnny and solely by\nJohnny. Definitely not the kind of thing that you can laugh out loud to\nbut instead you think about what was just said, which makes for a\npretty boring movie to watch. Tim Burton shouldn't bother with a\nsequel. If you want to watch a show about creepy monster types that the\nwhole family can enjoy, just watch the Addams family. Waaay more\nenjoyable.\n"
"\nHaven't seen any of the older versions so this was completely new for\nme. Tim Burton's movies always excite me and the cast had some big\nnames including Johnny Depp so had to watch it despite the negative\nreviews.<br><br>The story was predictable and the characters lacked depth especially\nthe children. If this was entirely a comedy it would have been a much\nbetter film. Johnny Depp's was impressive as usual, Eva Green was\nstunning in her appearance and performance, they could have done more\nwith the character. Everything else was sort of okay, the locations,\nscenery, costumes, make-up, etc that you'd expect from a Tim Burton\nmovie.\n"
"\nI have a rule of thumb, do not watch movies that have less than 7 on\nIMDb. Because of I admire Tim Burtons work, I made an exception. Only\nthing I learned after watching this is that my \"Above 7 on IMDb\" rule,\nprove right ones again.<br><br>Movie starts nicely, but after some time, there are too much different\nstories, and each one is dragging you in different path, and none of\nthem is leading us anywhere.<br><br>After the one of the most boring showdowns in history of cinematography\nJohn August (story) is leading us to the quick ending.<br><br>All the time you will have that filling that this is just a pilot of\nthe some serial with thousands of episodes, and that it is made just to\nintroduce us to the set of characters and their ability's.\n"
"\nI went on to see Dark Shadows with much expectation but it did not\ndeliver 100%.Firstly the acting by Johnny Depp was very good as\nalways,Eva Green also acted well as the cunning witch,rest of the cast\nperformed accordingly.Story was also good but it lacked depth,the movie\ndid not know whether it is a comedy or a horror movie.Dark Shadows is\nundeniably entertaining and nothing else. There are things that could\nhave been better.Dir. by Tim Burton was not up to the mark,he needed to\nmake the movie more compact.The horror aside - there's nothing to make\nyou bite your nails - Dark Shadows clearly works on three fronts.\nFirst, is the picturesque setting then the acting and visual effect.\n"
"\ni saw this movie three days ago and i had high expectations for the\nnames of (Johnny Depp &amp; Tim Burton ) have a ringing name in my ears ,\nand i was disappointed .. the movie was too naive , the story was\nhollow and the acting was poor , Johnny Depp was the only one who knew\nhow to play their rule , all other were missed up and was wondering out\nthrough the movie without a clue :-( , i really expected much of this\nmovie ... Tim Burton Returns in a very very bad movie , i thought it\nwould be better with Johnny Depp on board . am still mad at them both\nfor doing such a bad movie , the only good thing in this movie ( which\ncould be boring to others ) is the music and songs for the early 70th ,\ni really enjoyed it and this with the acting of Johnny Depp Is the only\nreason i rate this movie 6 out of 10 , without them (music &amp; Depp) I\ncould of rated this movies with a solid 4 or 3 maximum ... wait till it\nis on DVD or go to theater if you feel bored and want to do anything\nbut sitting home .\n"
"\n\"Dark Shadows\" is based on the 1966-1971 television series that\ndirector Tim Burton was a fan of. Here it becomes a mildly amusing mix\nof horror, fantasy and comedy. Barnabus Collins becomes a vampire under\nthe spell of a witch and is buried for 200 years. He's accidentally set\nfree and returns to his ancestral family home. Following the dramatic\nprologue, the film becomes a comedy set in 1972, one year after the\ntelevision series ended. The Collins family is dysfunctional, which\nmakes for some good comic moments. I've never seen any episodes of the\noriginal television series, however, I feel the film would have worked\nmore effectively with a darker, more serious tone. Burton is likely\ngoing for popular appeal here. Introducing an old television series to\na new generation. Worth a look for Tim Burton fans.\n"
"\nDark Shadows based on a British show of the same name, which I\"m not\nfamiliar with so cannot compare, but was enjoyable enough. The movie\nstars Johnny Depp as a vampire named Barnabus Collins, suffering a\nwitch's (Eva Green) curse, finally set free from his prison after\nnearly two centuries, introduced to the modern world of 1972. His\ndecedents now live in his home and he share's his secret with the\nmatriarch of the family Elizabeth (Michelle Pfeiffer), along with the\nsecret to the family fortune hidden in the castle by which they plan to\nreclaim the family glory before the witch, Angelique (Green) cursed the\nfamily. It has some funny moments, and is directed by Tim Burton, who\nhas fun with it, and it pays off and shows, because it is enjoyable,\nand has some great moments.<br><br>http://filmsnob.blog.com/\n"
"\nIt is true that Dark Shadows is less profound, less marvelous, with\nless glitter, and more both clichés and repetitions, but evenly strong\ncast - no matter if leading or supporting roles - makes it still\npleasant and catchy to follow. Johnny Depp, Michelle Pfeiffer, Helena\nBonham Carter, Jackie Earle Haily - those names are all known to those\nfond of \"different\" movies; moreover, they are also recurring actors in\nBurton's movies. Well yes, the plot is uneven, but there are several\nfunny moments (particularly when Depp reacts to 1970ies lifestyle, a\nkind of cultural shock), and depiction of a vampire is also different\nfrom trivial approaches on this matter.<br><br>Despite some shortcomings, still recommended - unless you dislike\nBurton's out-of-this-world creations. Strong 7 points from me.\n"
"\nIf you are going into this movie thinking you are going to see the\ndrama filled Dark Shadows TV show brought to life by the infamous Tim\nBurton, think again. If you are going into this movie thinking you are\ngoing to be watching another great Burton/Depp/Carter movie, then you\nare right, as a stand alone movie this is a great movie about the life\nof a vampire who has been entombed for centuries, only to have to help\nsave his decedents from evil spirits after being resurrected; however,\nthis movie has very little shared plot line with the actual TV program.\nWith the TV show being somewhat of a drama, Burton went for more of a\ncomedic feel to life as a turn of the century vampire. It all depends\non which end of the spectrum you're looking from. Me being the\nBurton/Depp/Carter fan that I am, thoroughly enjoyed watching Depp\nsubmerge himself in the quirky, somewhat naive Barnubus Jones. If you\nare watching the movie expecting it to be a movie version of the TV\nshow, then you'll surely be disappointed. Overall, another win for\nBurton as far as I'm concerned!\n"
"\nI think I am confused. I have never seen this mysterious series that\nthis movie is based on... and indeed haven't even heard of this\nseries... but still if a Movie is good - I shouldn't need to know all\nabout what it is *based on.... and this Movie is NOT good. It is just\nNOT a good movie, that is pretty much what it all comes down to. It's\nnot funny enough to be a funny movie... it could be darker when it just\ngets silly... it could be just silly but instead its boring... it could\nbe dramatic but it just gets too boring silly try-too-hard.... sigh\nsigh sigh... Love Tim Burton! Love Johnny Depp! But what the heck was\nall this? It never took me anywhere... It simply confused me! Recap:\nSilly! Boring! Not-Funny-Enough! What was Mr Burton Thinking!\n"
"\nA high school Goth's wet dream, let me count the ways. He's a Vampire.\nNothing is his fault, its all the witches fault. Having sex with your\npsychiatrist, and also killing her. Being cursed by a witch that he has\ncrazy sex with. No one understands me because I see the ghost of my\npast life, and they throw me in a mental institution. Having a huge\nparty with Alice Cooper singing. <br><br>So I heard this is a spoof of an old soap opera, which I could not\nrelate to since I'm not old enough to remember the show, I'm 33. I did\nenjoy the acting, costumes, and the cinematography in general. There\nwere a few parts that I laughed at. But ultimately the story lacked\ndepth. I never grew to care about the characters. So even if this is a\nspoof of a really old show, the story wasn't good enough to make it\ninteresting to audiences that are unfamiliar with the show. <br><br>I loved everything about the Movie except for the story, which seems to\nme like something a high schooler would write.\n"
"\nThis film looked really good in the trailer, which is why i went to see\nit at the cinema, but i felt really let down as the majority of the\n\"funny bits\" were actually in the trailer and the adding of ghosts and\nwerewolves, just made it feel boring and i felt it lacked originality.\nIf they had just left it with Johnny Depp being a vampire the film\nwould have been a lot better.<br><br>Having said that, the cast were brilliant and they gave a strong\nperformance. Also, the music was well placed and timed. The storyline\nhad a few holes and was slow and dull in places but, overall it was\ngood.<br><br>Overall, i think this film is worth a see if you're in to that sort of\nthing, but otherwise i would avoid this film.\n"
"\nI'm one of those die hard fans of Dark Shadows from the 60's who ran\nhome from school to watch it or one of the \"legions\" as we're also\nknown. I've been to a convention and have memorabilia. I'm currently\nreading the new comic and Benshoff book on the appeal of Dark Shadows.\nI have Lara Parker's new book ordered for my Kindle.<br><br>I love Dark Shadows and Johnny Depp so the movie couldn't possibly\ndisappoint me. Of course it could have been more cohesive but I think\nit did just fine attracting new admirers and taking in millions of\ndollars at the box office around the world. Perhaps the sequel will be\nmore like that \"full bodied\" wine critics were expecting this time\naround.\n"
"\nDark Shadows is unlike the many strange and different Tim Burton films\nthat have come across in past years from Charlie and the Chocolate\nFactory and Alice in Wonderland. This film had a great story with very\ngood acting from Johnny Depp, Chloe Grace Mortez, Michelle Pfiffer, and\nJackie Earl Haley. Haley and Depp were hilarious, while Pfiffer and Eva\nGreen provided the film a backbone. Even though this film may seem\nstrange from the posters and trailers, it truly isn't when seeing the\nmovie due to the story explaining the odd elements of the film. In\nfact, the only strange part of the film was the always strange Helena\nBonham Carter, who actually was decent in this film. This film has some\ndecent scares and some good laughs along the way which makes this a\nmore mature version of A Nightmare Before Christmas and a funnier and\nvery more kid friendly version of Sweeney Todd. This is an easy 7.5 out\nof 10 and should be watched regardless of how strange it may appear.\n"
"\nPredictable and mediocre, but watchable horror. It starts interesting,\nbut midway it looses its way, I suppose if it needed to include ugly,\nviolent sexual scene, it had to loose its way. Dramatic violence at the\nend of film was somewhat overdone. In parts Johnny Depp was enjoyable.\nMichelle Pfeiffer was tolerable. I did not understand the storyline of\npresence of Dr. Julia Hoffman. Helena Bonham Carter did well. I\nexpected some more development of storyline for Victoria Winters. But\nshe remained passive victim lover.<br><br>If you do not see this film, you do not miss anything, except saving\nyour time and money.\n"
"\nI paid my bucks as I wanted to see this on the big screen should have\nsaved my money and waited for the DVD. Even with a large ensemble cast\nthe script writing makes them look two dimensional. This movie can't\nmake it's mind up am I scary, comedic, melodrama? When the gags get\ngoing it jumps to a scary scene then a something straight out of a soap\nopera, all be it that was what the original Dark Shadows was? Also\nrespect to Burton and let down for Depp as this is Depp's project he\nasked Burton as a friend to direct. Young script writers first big\nmovie is a let down and to do it with one of the most famous Hollywood\npartnerships Burton and Depp makes it worse. Dark Shadows save your\nmoney wait for the DVD\n"
"\nAs a Dark Shadows and a Tim Burton fan, I had high hopes for this film.\nThose hopes were crushed. This film lacked in every sense. The script\nwas poorly written, the story was all over the place, the acting was\nehhh, and I felt there wasn't enough focus on the characters, besides\nBarnabas. The show focused on Victoria, Julia, David, Barnabas, and the\nother Collins family members, not on just one or two characters. The\nfilm should have been longer, Depp's make-up was just too white, and\nwow, I can ramble on and on about how disappointed I was after wasting\nmoney to see this. The film has the same Tim Burton/Depp feel, it\nwasn't any different from his other films/collaborations. I would\nrather watch Planet of the Apes and Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\n(two other Burton films in which I don't care for) than watch this\nagain. My advice, watch the Dark Shadows Revival (1991) starring Ben\nCross, or watch the original show starring the late Jonathan Frid, and\nwait til this is released on DVD to rent it from RedBox.\n"
"\nWow, where to start...First off I am a fan of Tim Burton's movies and\nespecially Tim Burton &amp; Johnny Depp collaborations, but this time it\njust did not work. The story was a bore and dragged along. Even though\nit was centered around a 200 year old vampire it wasn't believable. It\nwas just bad. It almost seem the cast was making it up as they went\nalong but never quite connected as a group. Weird, confusing plot twist\nlike Chloë Grace Moretz character in the last 10-15 minutes of the\nmovie is suddenly a werewolf with zero explanation or even a slight\nhint leading up to this!!!! WHAT!!??<br><br>I've seen better plots and more convincing acting in a high school\ndrama play. Thankfully I didn't waste my time &amp; money seeing this at\nthe theater but I'm still disappointed I wasted the space in a BB\nqueue. Don't rent, RUN!\n"
"\nA bit of a difficult on to review as I haven't seen the original 1966\nseries. i knew that it had horror and comedy in it and that's exactly\nwhat we do see here. On the other hand I also didn't found it a typical\nTim Burton flick.<br><br>Johnny Depp is really looking great as Barnabas Collins, his stiff and\non the other hand funny. There are a few good horror moments but in\nfact it's more about the comedy and situations. Not that it was bad at\nall. The original cast of Dark Shadows do appear at the party, sadly\nJonathan Frid (the original Barnabas) died shortly after. What was\nfunny was that we do have a gig of Alice Cooper in his clothes from the\nseventies. I liked that part a lot. I also liked the performance of Eva\nGreen (Angelique Bouchard) and Michelle Pfeiffer (Elizabeth Collins\nStoddard) wasn't that bad neither. <br><br>Still it's not my favorite Tim Burton flick but I enjoyed it as a\nstarter of a horror night. Oh yeah, Christopher Lee makes a small\nappearance.<br><br>Gore 0/5 Nudity 0/5 Effects 4/5 Story 3/5 Comedy 1/5\n"
"\nI thought it was awful. The first time I saw the trailer I thought it\nwould be a bit tacky but then I saw Johnny Depp and I said it would be\na nice comedy movie. But as it turned it wasn't funny and the story was\ncrap. Now about the acting. I thought Johnny Depp wasn't bad\nconsidering it's a shitty role. And the girl I can't even talk about\nher she's like 15 and she's acting like she's in college. And Angelique\nI found her more disturbing. Tim Burton really blew it this time this\nis one of the most awful movies in 2012. It should be banned from the\ncountry. And the ending is the worst thing ever the walls were bleeding\nand Angelique kept on breaking like glass. And then Barnabas jumped\nfrom the cliff to turn Victoria into a vampire. And then the last scene\nwas Dr. Julia under the sea and she's a vampire. I hope they won't film\na sequel because I won't be able to stand it.\n"
"\nThis cannot be classified under any particular genre . A completely\ndifferent concept even from the usual Tim Burton fantasy movies. This\nmovie is obviously not meant for a lot of people and has left a lot\ndisappointed . And that's NOT cos the movie was bad, but just that the\nmajority viewers prefer watching a stereotype fixed movie and are not\nready to venture into something completely new and original. True, I\nagree the the ending is a tee let down from the Super High Start. and I\nhave given a star less for that. But apart from that - Tim Burton is a\ngenius and can deliver something fresh for \"those\" in search of it. And\noutstanding performance by Johhny Depp, Helena Bonham Carter and Chloë\nGrace Moretz, not to mention the rest of the STAR crew\n"
"\nIt has now reached the point that any movie these guys release, we buy\nbecause, even if not the blockbuster of the year, we are guaranteed a\ngood evenings entertainment. And we love that about these guys. OK so\nthere is a \"formula\" there and it is a bit dark, but then they have\ndemonstrated that even in darkness there is diversity. <br><br>It was a nice surprise to see that it was set in the 70's and the\nmusic, cars, sets and costumes were spot-on. The soundtrack was superb\nand while Depps stilted English accent started to irritate after a\nwhile, morbid curiosity makes one stick with it (as does so much of the\nBDBCE franchise) until it becomes less so.<br><br>I see that lots of others who have seen older versions of this movie\nare unhappy with this new version, but as people who have never seen\nthe original, we thoroughly enjoyed the story.<br><br>Lets be clear, there were not many places where we were roaring with\nlaughter, but it was consistently enjoyable and it was very funny in\nplaces. <br><br>Definitely added to Christmas list!\n"
"\nJust saw the film, and contrary to most the of critics, I found the\nfilm entertaining, meaningful and quite hilarious. <br><br>Some people seems to complain Mr. Tim Barton lost his magic compared to\nBeetlejuice, Batman, etc., but instead I find Mr. Barton has moved to\nsomewhat more emotional film. <br><br>I like the films was about family bounds, and at the end how everything\nis tide up altogether.<br><br>The pace of the film is rather slow, but I like it that way, instead of\nmaking it super fast like a video clip. I did enjoy Mr. Deep as always,\nhe brings his classical witty caricature on scene. I also appreciated\nthe rather quiet, minimalistic sense of humor of the film.\n"
"\nBarnabas Collins is a vampire cursed by a witch who is love and,\nunfortunately for him, Barnabas does not return her love. He is left in\na casket for more than a century and when released, he finds that he\nhas landed in the year 1972. Johnny Depp can play almost any role that\nis thrown his way. A pirate, a hatter, and a vampire. The latter is\nshown here and it is interesting and amusing to see him play a vampire\nfrom the 1700s. Tim Burton's macabre and creepy humor comes out\nthroughout, with Johnny Depp definitely helping with that. It is also\nconsiderably dark and while trying to maintain the comedy over the\ncourse of almost two hours, the movie has its ups and down. The sexual\ncontent is a bit much as well and would have been perfectly fine\nwithout it. However, I enjoyed it because you develop feelings for the\ncharacters and it certainly does grab you and make you want to learn\nhow it all turns out. \"Dark Shadows\" is also a perfect Halloween movie.\n"
"\nI was expecting this movie to be excellent, I love Johnny Depp so much.\nI go to theatre for his movies all most every time... from edward,\nPirates of the Caribbean(s), Alice in Wonderland, Sweeney Todd...etc.\nIn spite of no all of them are good movie, but at least I still can\nfind some funny or interesting part from them...<br><br>I was attracted by the trailer, and maybe thats why I feel so\ndisappointed. The trailer seemed to be quite Johnny style and should be\nhumorous somehow. <br><br>However, in this film...what a terrible movie...such an old school\nstuff without any surprising. If you are looking for any hilarious\nparts, don't waste your time to dig in this film... coz there is no\nblood, no sex, no funny things, no love in this movie... this movie is\nmade for pre-schooler for sure...\n"
"\nYes, it's old-fashioned (so is the TV-Gothic-soap Dark Shadows as\nwell), but the actors do so well (especially Jonny Depp as eccentric\nVampire Barnaby and Eva Green as wonderfully mean witch Angelique) that\ni smiled amused throughout the movie. Great Music (love Carpenters),\nbloody moments, playful jokes and beautiful, fantastic decor and\ninteriors make it fun. Despite the glimpse-short cameo of Dark Shadows\nveterans Jonathan Frid, David Selby, Lara Parker &amp; Kathryn Leigh-Scott\n(you catch them as party attenders at Collingwood) disappoints, the\nwhole storyline bout Jonny Lee Miller does not touched me at all and\nsome bumpy parts in the middle - still 6 out of 10!\n"
"\nJust a pastime, but one tip to enjoy this rubbish, maybe exclusively\nfor sushi lovers. All the people in the town has long been preying on\nfish, which beautifully has no appearance in any scene. Well, they\n(people) are killing them (fish) as ruthlessly as me and more savagely\nthan any vampire, who is the only exception to the human's tyranny\ntowards the nature. Laugh at the vegetarians. So, when you go to a\nsushi bar, at least just after this regrettable movie theater, say\n'thank you, fish'. This is the first work of any vampire art which has\nmade me say yes to sucking humans' blood. Oh one more good news: Jackie\nhasn't lost it.\n"
"\nThis movie was a big disappointment. The big issue is the story its\n2/10 there are many and many pointless section is the scenario. If you\nconsider this movie as a comedy its again terrible 2/10 there are\naround 5-6 comic scenes over the movie, so what ? a terribly weak\nstory, pointless characters and guess what a couple of beautiful(mostly\ntechnically) scenes. Here are couple of examples: 1- Who is David's\nmother, Why she could kill the witch? 2- Who is Dr. Julia Hoffman for\nthe movie, at the end we see that she is still alive(kind of) so what?\nHave to repeat my self, its not a comedy not even 10% its not an horror\nfilm, the story and characters are weak and its really boring.\n"
"\nI wanted to like this movie as I am a Tim Burton fan but it was a\nboring film that was visually well made and well acted but lacked an\ninteresting plot. the actors (especially Johnny Depp were fun to watch,\nas usual) but didn't have much to work with. It's almost as if there\nwas a great idea for a plot and then everyone got caught up in the\ncostumes, scenery and witty comments, leaving the plot to evolve\nthrough the scenes. I was bored about a fourth of the way in. The\nscenes where there were implied sexual encounters were pointless. I\nstill don't understand being half in with sex. Either put it in and\nit's an adult movie and we can enjoy it, or leave it out. It doesn't\nwork when it's half done. It's not cute or amusing. I rate a film on a\nlot of areas but the most important is \"would I see it again\" and I\nwill not be watching this one again.\n"
"\nMeaningless Disgusting Crap made just to earn profit. I don't really\nunderstand the concept of these movies,why are they liked in masses.\nThey just followed the trend like previous bollywoods hits i.e Dabang\nand Singham - A fruity vampire with a hair piece. Wearing Gothic garb a\nlot, English Fight action scenes. Senseless Dialogues repeated in every\n15mins. Idiotic emotional drama. Idiotic Villain. Cheap Item song to\nattract pervert crowd. Johnathan Dep is a respectable person and a good\nactor,I really used to like him.God only knows why he's selecting such\ntypes of movies PS- The movie was so dumb actually made me write a\nreview for the first time.\n"
"\nI loved this film. So funny and interesting... WELL DONE to director\nactors film crew and writer. We got it and loved it, thanks for a great\nafternoon. <br><br>Our son was put off by the reviews and missed a fantastic movie, but we\nwill be buying it and have a huge TV so a possible cult movie will be\nenjoyed by all over and over..<br><br>I disagree with previous viewers that characters were inserted without\nneed, you can't have a family without family members and I thought the\ntwists were funny and in line with current trends... very amusing. All\nthe actors got their parts and the idea of the movie and acted very\nwell accordingly.<br><br>A movie with a difference, but great cinematography and theme. Really\nenjoyable for all.\n"
"\nThis movie just does not work - although the actors all perform well.\nespecially Johnny Depp. Tim Burton tried to cram a whole series into a\nmovie - a task predestined to fail. I admit, I haven't seen the series,\nbut as I saw the movie, my first thought was: This should have been a\nseries.<br><br>A lot of very strange characters, all having a dark secret, all having\na dark history, a great setting for some \"war\" between the witch and\nthe vampire - and it is because of the length of the movie impossible\nto exploit them. Thus, the movie touches all of them slightly - way to\nslightly. The result is the constant feeling of passed chances to\ncreate something great, and putting it all to the waste - you're giving\nit all away in the end, all those about 10 plots are revealed \"using\nthe sledge hammer\".<br><br>All in all, because of good acting and some funny scenes worth a watch,\nbut I think I'll give the series a chance now - where all those great\nideas mingled into a movie way seemingly feel more complete.\n"
"\nI am a VERY easy grader on movies. As long as my mind is engaged and I\ndon't find myself wondering about something else, a movie gets a pass\nfrom me. I literally lost interest in what happened about two-thirds\nway through the movie and agree with another poster that this movie was\njust all over the place without doing anything (as far as the plot\ngoes) well. I have no problem with the performances and liked the cast.\nBut I FAR more enjoyed catching SAFE for the third time than I enjoyed\neven the first two thirds of Dark Shadows. I found The Tourist, The\nNinth Gate, and Sleepy Hollow 10 times as entertaining and would watch\nany of them over again once a year. Also, Pirates 4 which I had a bit\nof trouble with the first time through but since then have probably\nwatched it a half dozen times with great appreciation. Loved Stardust\nand even Hocus Pocus. But I see no reason to ever watch this movie\nagain. That is an incredibly harsh review from me!\n"
"\nWhen i heard Tim Burton was going to make a new film i was so excited.i\nam a huge fan and i enjoy his films very much especially batman returns\nand big fish are my favorites.And the title is so mysterious Dark\nShadows<br><br>When i read the plot i realize it is going to be the classic Tim Burton\nfilm with Johnny Depp as main star and Helena Bonem Carter.The other\ncast is very good.Personally i distinguish Michelle Pfeiffer and Chloë\nGrace Moretz and Eva Green as Angelique Bouchard who has a love for\nBarnabas Collins (Johnny Depp).<br><br>This film has all these characteristics like any other Tim Burton's\nfilms.You will find it much more funnier that the previous film of Tim\nBurton's (Alice in Wonderland).Personally i believe that he has a good\nway to tell a story without getting bored that combines it with good\nmusic and graphic scenes.<br><br>Trust me you must see it you will not regret i cannot wait to see his\nnext film.\n"
"\nYes, I was one of those running home from school to watch Dark Shadows\neach day! I bought the DVD collection and have my husband hooked on it\nnow. I was almost afraid to see this movie after reading all of the\nearly comments after seeing the trailers, but there was no way I would\nhave missed it. What great fun! Except for a few character changes that\nI was not happy with, such as Julia Hoffman and Roger Collins, it was a\nwonderful and entertaining two hours! No one will ever replace the\noriginal but this was an excellent twist. I actually hated the House of\nDark Shadows movie because it turned my favorite characters and the\ngreat story lines of the series into a mindless bloodbath. The Ben\nCross revival mini series was lame compared to the original. This time,\nBurton and Depp took a different approach and added some comedy to\nbalance the drama. Reminded me a bit of another favorite old movie of\nmine ... Love at First Bite. Add Alice Cooper to the mix and it was\nimpossible for me not to love it! Hope there will be sequels! Orlando\nBloom would make a great Quentin Collins!\n"
"\nWell, twenty dollars and two hours of my life I can't get back. You\nlive and learn - but as my husband pointed out, if I hadn't seen this\nmovie, I would have always wondered. I wish Mr. Burton had made up his\nmind to make this story either serious or campy. With Johnny Depp as\nthe star, I'd have voted for campy, since he does it so well. There\nwere some twists to the plot that, to me, didn't add anything, and\nfrankly, didn't make sense. In the original soap opera, Barnabas\nCollins looked fairly normal until the fangs came out. Johnny didn't\nlook even vaguely \"normal\", and any really \"normal\" person would have\nbeen put off by his appearance - and certainly wouldn't have been\ntempted to kiss him. Put some more thought into your next one, Mr.\nBurton!\n"
"\nUnfortunately for fans of Johnny Depp and Chloe Moretz this would have\nto be one of the worst pieces that they have made. Hopefully fans will\nforget quickly. The film had me wishing that I had bought a bigger\npopcorn. That way after about the first ten minutes I would have\nsomething to do. The scenery was excellent and gave the film a great\nGothic feel that it needed. The ruins of the mansion looked\nspectacular. Unfortunately the wooden acting and the manner in which\neach sub plot was written and resolved like a weekly TV drama made it\ndifficult to have any real reaction when something happened. The comedy\naspects that this film is supposed to have must have been playing in\nthe cinema next door. I didn't find any comedy in this film except for\nthe abysmal performance of Eva Green. Yet again another movie where the\nending is so obvious and embarrassing when it is finally revealed you\nsit cringing in your chair hoping that they really don't make the\nsecond movie. If you want to see this film wait for it to be on TV so\nyou don't have to pay for it.\n"
"\nIf the tone set in the first ten minutes of Dull Shadows had been\ncarried over into the last 110 minutes of the film, this would have\nbeen a very good entry in the Burton/Depp oeuvre. Instead, the tone\nchanges drastically from Sleepy Hollow to a poor man's Beetlejuice.\nIt's as if the opening sequence was directed by a skilled craftsman and\nthe remainder by a skilled but inexperienced dilletante. The sets are\nexcellent, as is the cinematography but the characters are\nunderdeveloped and the actors underused. Depp puts in a carefully\ncrafted performance as Count Chocula, but not Barnabas Collins. This is\na disaster and the threat of a sequel is unbearable. Certainly, the\noriginal series was a bit campy but charmingly so. This film is just\nover the top in a very underwhelming way. Guess though that as long as\nit sells seats that's all that matters in Hollywood. As it goes this\nfilm is all dressed up with no where to go.\n"
"\nIf you always have enjoyed Johnny Depp movies, skip this one, as you\nwill be disappointed. If you have always enjoyed Tim Burton movies,\nskip this one, as you will be disappointed. If you were a fan of the\noriginal television series, skip this one, as you will be disappointed.\nIf you are a fan of Eva Green, my favorite of the current Bond girls,\nskip this one, as you will be disappointed. Highly predictable and\ndull, although with a twist or two towards the end. Every funny scene\nthat you have seen in the commercials is the sum of all of the funny\nscenes in the movie. Otherwise, this is two hours of your life that you\nwon't get back. While not as bad as the third Twilight movie (from\nwhich I am still reeling), this movie was a tremendous waste of time\nand talent. I will go see the next Burton/Depp combo, but unless I am\nbeing paid or my family held at gunpoint, I won't watch this piece of\ngarbage again, even as background noise on TV.\n"
"\nI usually like the Burton/Depp combination, sometimes a lot, sometimes\nnot so much, but this, I'm afraid, is very poor stuff indeed. I have no\nidea what Burton was aiming for, but the general ambiance is of a\nlow-grade afternoon TV film aimed at the early-teen market. The female\ncharacters were straight out of \"Bewitched\", and many of the special\neffects were a mishmash of \"Beetlejuice\" and \"Death Becomes Her\" coated\nin the usual Burton eye-shadow (not intrinsically a bad thing, but now\nstarting to look like last year's \"colourway\"). There is no character\nor plot development, the film is neither scary nor humorous. Would\nuncritical twelve year olds like it? I don't know, but it's not for\ncritical adults, that's for sure. Spend your money on something else.\n"
"\nI'm seriously surprised many people don't enjoy this movie while I have\nrepeated this movie for three times. I know that movie review can be\nvery different within one another, but really, this is not a bad movie,\nvery not. This is a really fun movie. The whole scene and time I spent\nin the cinema and in the TV, i am very entertained. Maybe because I am\ninspired by vintage stuffs, and the vintage settings in this movie make\nme in love. The story is funny and again, it proves that there is not a\nsingle thing Johnny Depp cannot do. Maybe this movie is not suitable\nfor you who are too serious. All the casts can do acting well. If you\nreally need a good laugh, have it a try. And a bag of popcorn will do.\nMaybe this is all :)\n"
"\n\"Dark Shadows\" is not a great film, but it's entertaining enough to\nwarrant a watch, even if it's a bit all over the place in terms of\nquality. The movie starts off a little slow, but it's got a strong and\nvery entertaining middle that I feel elevates it enough that I can give\nit a mild recommendation. It looks great and you'll get a lot of laughs\nout of it, enough to forgive the end which sort of comes out of nowhere\nand unfortunately does not follow up with some of the charm it had\nearlier on. I had heard multiple times from people that a lot of Tim\nBurton's movies feel like the director lost his interest in the story\ntowards the end, and it really feels like that's the case here. I did\nenjoy myself while watching it and I have to say that some of the\nvisuals and the sets featured in this film are really impressive. I had\na blast just looking at the film. (Theatrical version on the big\nscreen, May 20, 2012)\n"
"\nFirst off I absolutely adore Tim Burton, and I am a collector of all\nthings Burton. The imagination of this man intrigues and excites me,\nand this film did not disappoint. It has a fabulous cast with some of\nmy favourite actors/actresses Johnny Depp, Michelle Pfeiffer and Helena\nBonham Carter, a quirky soundtrack with some easy listening sing-along\nsongs and a vast amount of dark humour which when combined make this\nbrilliant! If there was an option to rate this film 50 stars then I\nmost certainly would. The film is fun and even though it is rather dark\n(which Burton fans will be used to) it is rather uplifting. The\nstoryline isn't too heavy and is very easy to follow, there are good\ntwists in the film to keep you watching and there are many funny and\nsarcastic one-liners to keep you laughing.<br><br>This film is truthfully superb and would make a fabulous addition to\nany night in, in front of the TV.\n"
"\nI've read so many negative reviews of \"Dark Shadows\" that I just wanted\nto add my 2 cents. I enjoyed this film, especially the look of it. The\nset design, I think, was brilliant and the interior shots of Collinwood\nsimply beautiful. And I also enjoyed the cast. This film is based on a\nTV soap opera that I was addicted to back in the day. That said anyone\nwho watched Dark Shadows on television knows the program was riddled\nwith problems. It was very low budget and props gave way, actors forgot\ntheir lines, booms and lights often appeared on screen and the story\nwound its way to hell and back. But those were not the things that\nmattered to me. It was the atmosphere of the show I loved and its\nGothic theme. Yes, the \"Dark Shadows\" film is flawed but I found it\nentertaining. It captured some of the ridiculousness of the television\nshow while elevating the production value off the chart. If you like\ndarkly brooding yet luscious sets combined with well acted quirky\ncharacters and a generous dose campy humor you might enjoy this film\ntoo.\n"
"\nThis movie is for those 13 and older. This Dark Shadows shares little\nwith the Dark Shadows of the late 1960s/early 1970s except for the\nnames of the characters. Yes, Barnabas is still a vampire and Angelique\na witch. With its overly dramatic acting and dark picturesque scenes,\nthis movie comes off more like a comic book. Not the say the\ninterpretation is bad, it is just very different (no werewolf in the\noriginal Dark Shadows in the original family). The interpretation is so\ndifferent that many who grew up with Jonathan Frid as Barnabas may feel\na bit cheated. Jonathan Frid's character tried to hide his monster from\nhis family, this Barnabas does not hide his monster. Who cares if the\ncharacters are shallow or that the script is not that good. It is a\ncomic book rendition of Dark Shadows.For what it is, it works. This is\na popcorn popper and a cruncher at the end. You gotta love the sets and\nthe addition of Alice Cooper. I give it five thumbs up.\n"
"\nI cried after seeing this movie, not because i was moved, but because i\ncould not believe that Tim Burton and Johnny depp have delivered this.\nI cried because i have seen Edward scissorhands, sweeney Todd, corpse\nbride, sleepy hollow and others.<br><br>Dark Shadows is not a bad movie, but there is not much in this movie to\nreally get you excited. Johnny Depp is brilliant as he always is, but\nthere wasn't much for him to play around in this one. very plain story\nline, lame dialogs( for most part) and not many ( or none rather )\ntwists, it was more like watching an episode of those ever running\ndaily soaps. <br><br>the movie can be watched only for Johnny's charm but not much else. It\nis not a bad movie if you don;t expect anything from it, but to not\nexpect anything from Burton-Johnny combo is a blasphemy.\n"
"\nAfter seeing the trailer many times in the cinema, the film looked very\npromising and i was very much looking forward to seeing it. However,\nthroughout the entire film i found myself completely uninterested and\nbored. The film proved to be the opposite of what i had hoped. Yes\nthere were quite funny bits every now and then throughout the film but\nthey were all shown in the trailer. It was a real shame because of the\nbrilliant cast, the likes of Johnny Depp and Michelle Pfeiffer all\nbrilliant actors, and the acting was good - the plot was just a let\ndown. A little bit cheesy and over the top for my liking. I hope they\ndon't make a follow one, it is just not needed. I wouldn't recommend it\nas a must see.\n"
"\nThat Tim Burton is a source of dumbfounded creativity is no big\nsurprise. His touch and sensibility when dealing with amazing\ncharacters translate well to the screen, taking the viewer gently to a\nworld of fantasy and good entertainment. <br><br>However, \"Dark Shadows\" - although relying on a talented and capable\ncast - leaves a lot to be desired. The beginning is quite enthralling,\nas one of those children's stories that capture our undivided\nattention, building up the expectations, making me believe I was in for\na special treat. Boy, was I mislead. In fact, once you're through the\nexplanation part, everything seems to die every passing minute. The\nstory lingers on, with some passages that are pretentiously too serious\nfor this type of comedy, while others are very silly. The combination,\nas a result, doesn't work well and the last minutes are noisy and\nmessy. I was very disappointed and, at some moments, quite anxious for\nthe final credits. I love Depp, but not even his presence could stop\nthis boat from sinking deep.\n"
"\nWhen Johnny Depp and Tim Burton work together there are high\nexpectations. If you plan to see this, lower your expectations. The\nmovie doesn't hit it's stride. It can't decide if it's a comedy,\nromance or a horror thriller and in the end it comes up short.<br><br>Great costumes, interesting sets, excellent use of original and period\nmusic. The performances are intentionally stiff. There are some fun\nthings. Johnny Depp is always interesting and even as a vampire his\nhanging around is fun. There are a couple of good laughs and it seems\nthat is the direction they should have gone.<br><br>The bleeding pictures and walls, and carvings coming to life didn't\nseem very fresh. It was disappointing that the Depp character needed\nout of the blue help to dispatch the evil bitch witch. <br><br>It's not a bad movie, it's just not as good as you would expect from\nthe talent involved.\n"
"\nLiked the story. It's 90% dark comedy and it works especially with the\n18th Century vampire adapting to the 1970s. The humor is quite\nsophisticated. As expected the Tim Burton style and effects don't\ndisappoint.<br><br>Johnny Depp carries the movie. Eva Green is quite good as the witch.\nShe is better in these kinds of monstrous roles. What they did to her\nreminds me of \"Death Becomes Her\". Michelle Pfeiffer is still lovely in\na natural way. Chloe Moretz is still cute. <br><br>Some reviews say it lost steam but I think it was alright. Could have\nhad a bit more good lines from the supporting cast though. Worth a\nwatch for sure.\n"
"\nI was a kid when Dark Shadows started, and it was never on my radar.\nWhen I heard about it later I was very curious, and when it finally was\nsyndicated on TV I watched a couple of episodes and found it painfully\ntedious. A 70s daytime soap with vampires is still a 70s daytime soap.<br><br>The movie version is decidedly faster paced, aiming for campy, silly\ncomedy and cute special effects. While it's not as fun as Burton's Ed\nWood nor as deep as his Big Fish, it is a generally amusing burlesque\nof 70s television.<br><br>I felt the last part of the movie was the weakest. Dark Shadows owes\nits success to not taking itself seriously, but towards the end, as the\nvarious dramatic threads come awkwardly together, the movie tries to\nboth give viewers some flashy special effects and pull some emotion out\nof them, and it just doesn't work, both because it's not in keeping\nwith the rest of the film and because the movie doesn't try hard enough\nto create that emotion. <br><br>But overall I thought this was quite fun.\n"
"\nSo disappointing, how could you mess this up with such a great\ndirector, such amazing actors, visuals that were amazing (some SFX\nwithstanding). The soundtrack was great, the acting was great. The only\nthing that let it down, and in a major game ending way, was the script.\nMore and more Hollywood movies place less emphasis on a great script,\nand just worry about the sound/visuals, which is fine if it's a\nboneheaded action flick, but anything else it's just sad and annoying.\nThis started out strong and I was really excited to see a great new\nmovie. ended up with my finger hovering over the stop button way too\nmany times, just a waste of good talent and money.\n"
"\nTim Burton's career has been kind of all over the place. Recently his\nlast film, Alice in Wonderland, wasn't anything to get excited about,\nbut this was a welcome return to form, if he ever had one officially,\nfor Burton. The best part of the film is Johnny Depp having a great\ntime in the role of the vampire Barnabas Collins. Eva Green also does\nwell as the witch who cursed him. The film has flaws however with its\nuneven tone, not quite balanced between comedy and horror. Just a\nclosing note: I thank the film for the Carpenters references and the\nmontage featuring Top of the World. Thanks for resurrecting the\nCarpenters when they had seemingly disappeared from the modern culture.\n"
"\nDark Shadows is based on a 70s TV series, I believe. It's about this\nvampire that gets trapped in a coffin for centuries, but gets dug back\nup in the mid-1970s.<br><br>Now, Dark Shadows is Tim Burton's big live action 2012 film. Now is it\ngood? Yes, it is. It is nothing spectacular, but it is very enjoyable.<br><br>The characters are very wacky and weird in this film, which I like. I\ngenerally did enjoy Dark Shadows. There's just very little to say about\nit. While it is good, it is forgettable.<br><br>Johnny Depp is really good as the vampire protagonist. He is funny but\nalso kind of creepy.<br><br>My only true problem with Dark Shadows is the protagonist's habit of\nchanging personalities all the time. I know he's a vampire, but does he\nhave to suck out the blood and guts out of every young person he speaks\nwith?<br><br>Overall, there's not much I can say about Dark Shadows. It was an\nenjoyable movie that deserves a great score. It's nothing special, but\nit doesn't need to be.\n"
"\nI was waiting for this movie for a while mostly because of the presence\nof Johnny Depp, Michelle Pfeifer, Grace Chloe Moretz and Jackie Earl\nHaley who is one of my personal favorites.<br><br>I must say I quite enjoyed the first half of the movie but was a bit\ndisappointed by the second half by what I think was an exaggeration of\ncombat moves and curses. Grace made an excellent werewolf (according to\nmy humble opinion but then I am infatuated by her) although it was\nunnecessary for her to be one.<br><br>All in all I can't say that I think my money was better spent\nelsewhere, but I can say that I had this feeling like with Alice that\nsomething better could be achieved with the same resources.<br><br>I must add though that I absolutely loved Jackie Earl Haley's\nperformance and for me it was a reason to watch the movie.\n"
"\nOK, I'm a huge Johnny Depp fan, so I'm gonna say he was awesome himself\nas usual, so that's why I gave it 6 out of 10. I know Tim Burtons\nstyle, so I didn't go to see the movie with high expectation. I think\nthat all characters were underdeveloped. I expected little bit more\ndetailed story about each one of them and there were way to many scenes\nshowing only two people. I liked special effects, mainly towards the\nend of the movie and attention to some details (it could have been done\neven better). I have to say it was OK movie for rainy afternoon, but\ndefinitely not as good as Edward Scissorhands or Alice in Wonderland.\nBlack humour was not strong/funny enough me. I guess TB tried to please\nbigger audience and he ended up disappointing his and JD fans. 10\npeople in the IMAX theatre I went to on the opening weekend speaks\nvolume on how people feel about the movie without even seeing it. Sorry\nTB, but you should have taken your time, cause I know you can do\nbetter.\n"
"\nAfraid to say I was actually pretty disappointed by Burton. I have\nwatched every single movie Burton has made from Corpse Bride to Edward\nScissor hands. I love the cast, love the acting but the film seemed\nempty? Like there was no real story line, just about building up the\nfamilies fortune and then some interfering witch. The trailer made the\nmovie look really funny but i didn't actual laugh at all in the film.\nFor a 12A it was extremely sexual and for any one with children who is\nconsidering watching this, expect some weird questions from children. I\nam only 18 and even I sat there and questioned the age rating. They\nmade Chloe Moretz extremely sexual to the extreme it was sort of\nunnecessary? It is a movie that I would only watch once. Overall I\nthink very highly of Tim Burton but perhaps this wasn't one of his best\nmovies. Me and my friends came out wondering if we'd enjoyed it or not\nbut it is worth a watch, the special effects are very well done :)\n"
"\nDark Shadows - It's good to watch Johnny Depp on screen. His acting\ncould never disappointed you. Directing by Tim Burton - Official Page,\nthe scenes of Barnabas Collins was first time in the world of 1971\nafter centuries left in the dark, lonely coffin, reminded me of his\nappearance in Edward Scissorhands. Especially when he was taking his\nfirst breakfast on the dinner table. Of course, listing Depp in a film\nwould never make it less interesting. The other characters would\ncertainly play so good role too. It's kinda a very funny humorous film\nimplemented in a complete plot of the Collins-Witch revenges. It was a\nvery nice story, and happened to be a very good use of CGI too. You\nwould definitely find it very entertaining. Too much of funny part that\nI rather say nothing much but to ask you go watching this movie by\nyourself. It's 3 and a half stars worth. May be 4.\n"
