any movie that gets the audience involved in a positive way and leaving cheering is an excellent movie
it is like rocky on adrenaline and with a whole lot better acting
hugh jackman evangeline lilly and dakota goyo all have great performances
dakota who plays the son really makes the movie but all the actors performances are great
the guy who thought it boring
well you lack passion and your soul must be dead
real steel is the absolutely hands down best movie i have seen in a long time
you will cheer cry laugh and be thoroughly entertained
i had to sit and watched the credits at the end just to catch my breath
great movie
real steel starring hugh jackman and directed by shawn levy is an awful clichad bunch of trite
it reaches into the dozen or so boxing movies in a grab bag of hackneyed and ripoff situations from much better movies
it tries to be original by throwing in robots as the boxers but ultimately the outcome is more like a bad video game movie
the one where the story gets washed away by unintelligent and patronizing dialog
hugh jackman instills some needed energy and the scifi concept has some merit but the pg script and storyline is steaming turd
an r rating adult script and tossing out the whole fatherson mush wouldve sharpened the movie some
the music is gawdawful and brainless with a mix or rock rap and cheesy dramatic interludes from a soapopera and the romance is perfunctory
overall bad  not recommended
what a waste of 35 canadian
its not compelling or even that interesting
the bot fights are obviously cgi but the story line sucks the big one
move along dont waste your money
youre supposed to fall for the kid whos father is a screwup but its hard to feel sorry for a manipulative kid whos no better than his own father
some have suggested that this is rocky on steroids but the script is anemic at best
the closest youll get to an emotional connection is to the girlfriend running the gym
at least she knows where she stands
for the rest of the cast its like lost sheep
baah
seriously this movie despite the hype is one you should take a pass on
there are a lot of much better actions movies out there
if youre into a retro vibe then pick up some james bond on blueray sure to appeal to both men and women
any of the jason bourne idnetity supremacy ultimatum videos are far better than this piece of tripe
then again your mileage may vary
i went in to the theater expecting a lot from this movie
i was disappointed by the end of it
hugh jackmans acting was worse than the kid playing his son
evangeline lilly had a very little role a major part of which was cheering for jackmans robot to win
the plot  lots of questions left unanswered
why did the owners of zeus want to buy atom  the old sparring robot
does atom actually understand people
does he have special qualities
theres a scene where atom is looking at himself in the mirror
which builds up anticipation in the audience about atom having human qualities etc etc
which is very conveniently is left out by the makers of the movie
disappointing

i dont know what hollywood producers are thinking any more
or maybe i do cast a kid that looks like justin bieber and focus the whole movie on his constant whining screaming yelling and in general acting like a spoiled brat because apparently it sells
lines that will keep ringing in your ears for a few hours after the viewing in prepuberty whiny childish voice do something
why are you not fighting back
i dont like hamburgers
and lets not forget forced touching moments with the appropriate music tears in their eyes and the family reuniting just because some robots are punching at each other
was this movie made by disney
i dont know or care but please dont give your money to watch it
athe rest of it its just too unreal
so this proposal may work for kids and i dont disregard that fact but theres nothing solid for an adult in it other than the beautiful evangeline lilly or i guess hugh jackman for girls
and please consider i have no preconceived ideas about this movie i watched transformers and i actually thought it was pretty good and entertaining but this one here didnt feel that way
first off sentiments
if the relationship between the father and the son is important for the story develop it and if not just dont put it in there but to see characters showing great feelings for each other out of the blue and with no explanation whatsoever really reminds me of a bclass 80s action movie
well this is not a b movie given the budget and these are not the 80s
this movie spills cheese all over in the wrong decade
i need to preface this review with one statement
my skills at movie making are not even as good as uwe bolls
rather than list spoilers i will say that the ending was a twist on what i thought would happen
but the path to get to that twist was paved with glitter glue and rainbows
it is beyond me on how imdb users give movies like bloodrayne a 2
8 and real steal a 7
1
and i have not even seen bloodrayne
my thought is that 80 of the people who watch bloodrayne would know that the acting directing and plot are going to be abysmal and would then say
wow
this movie is just like what i thought it was going to be so i will give it a 5
who watches bloodrayne and thinks maybe 6 or 7 tweaks could have raised their user rating from a 2
9 to a 7
1
bloodrayne was never meant to be a 7
1
i guess i need to remember that some people may have given real steel higher scores because they were looking for cgi instead of an intriguing back story and believable characters
oh well to each their own i suppose
i have to disagree with the man who said it was an average boxing movie
this movie is a wonderful movie
i laughed i cried i cheered
i left the theater feeling great
the audience i was with actually cheered and clapped i dont know about you  but that is the first time i have seen and heard an audience get to its feet cheering and clapping while at the theater
this is more than an average boring boxing movie
it also showed me that when no one else would believe in you all it takes is one person to show you that yes you can do anything it also showed me that no matter how many punches life gives you you get back up and keep fighting dont give up  dont back down
i would highly recommend this movie
i like robots
i like robots that fight
so if i had gotten my full dose of fighting robots i mightve been nicer to this movie
but i didnt get what i wanted
what i got was a trifle of a film that pretends to give connection from a kid that i was sick of in the first 5 minutes
i really did not like that whining overacting slimy kid
the fact that i had to sit through painfully cheesy scenes with that little ham actor and hugh jackman made the whole thing barely watchable
by the way hugh what the hell kinda accent was that
so chessy acting predictable story hack writing good not remarkable special effects and yet this drivel went on to make 256 million not including licensing which i assume will be gigantic when real steel 2 comes out
im not upset just disappointed
i would enjoy fighting robots until ive seen the first hour of this movie
a few times i wanted to quit watching in that part
so many low quality dialogue nonsense up and downs and much more
how could hugh jackman agree these script
it would have been a good action movie without the script
what about robot fighting with a bull
and why zeus won at the end with referee decision
there was no need for that
i give this movie 2 out of 10
dont be fooled with the high rating
real steel is really a excellent movie ever i saw
which is most popular to children and young also
its starting to end everything is so excellent to me
a boy is changing his life with his father is so good to all father also
its also future realistic and future world is going to be like this
now we are using smart phone and later will keep a robot in our house
so all are future related also
really a famous movie to me and i always watch this movie when i get free time
other side past created robot is also showing a good image which is showing past also
past  present  future is real life which is also reality of real steel
in the near future robot boxing is a top sport
a struggling promoter feels hes found a champion in a discarded robot
real steel is one of my favorite movies that hugh jackman has starred in besides the xmen franchise prisoners les miserables and a bunch of others movies its basically rocky meets terminator and honestly who the hell doesnt love robots
this film brought some life in all those boxing movies sure it repeats some stuff from rocky like the ending for example but still one hell of an awesome movie and i would love to see a sequel after hugh is done with wolverine and i think it might happen cause the movie was directed by shawn levy the director of the night at the museum trilogy
they also did one hell of job with the robots you feel like they are real and not just some cgi or puppet in a science fiction movie the animatronics in these film are outstanding and so are the robots and the human characters
it really deserves a much high score on rotten tomatoes than just a drop dead 59 atom for the win
when a father is stuck with his son who he barely knows  a robot is found  this leads to battles in an actual arena  dont let the robot battle make you doubt this movie because it actually has a fantastic story line  by the way the acting is pretty darn good too
special effects are done quite well  and you cant help but lose yourself in the movie due to the wonderful story line  its no gone with the wind ha
but it is unique and extremely worth a watch for a father or grandfather and son grandson
lots of action  and who doesnt like hugh jackman  he plays a great mean father  but even the hardest heart can be changed with the love of a son and a passion for battle bots
came across this film a few months ago and was blown away
simple premise of lonely boy desperate for a father figure finds solace and friendship in a fighting robot
yes its cheesy and some what predictable but the whole film made me smile throughout
hugh jackman plays the wayward father looking for direction while his son is looking for the father he never had
the robot is the pragmatist that brings them together
fight scenes are good and the interaction between the characters is charming
many films of father and son coming together rely on a love interest this thankfully doesnt
so sit down and enjoy and film that will leave you feeling warm inside
real steel is the imaginary future of sports robot boxing
which why not that seems logical with the way technology has been going
they build these huge mechanical and smart fight robots from metal and scraps
even programmed controllers voice command and shadow functions
with all these parts to the robot they even made they have cool or extravagant exterior designs
the robots are from the future however the plot of the story is not
its about a dad charlie who has success earlier in his life from boxing who has now retired and is in desperate need of money
when he divorces his wife she re marries an older wealthier guy
when they leave on a trip and ask charlie a favor to watch a kid he sees as a way to get easy money from them and so with that money he receives he goes out and buys fighting robots
61 a better than most were expecting including myself family scifi action drama that has hugh jackman to thank for much of its success
jackman brings his great screen presence bubbling personality and charismatic charm lifting what could have been an unlikeable character into someone you really do root for
the plot is very similar to both sly stallones over the top and of course rocky but everything is done well enough for this to be on the whole quite exciting at times meaning this has the power to bring on enough thrills and spills along with a very enjoyable ending
so it may not have an original bone in its body but as far as well made family friendly movies go that parents will enjoy as much as the kids then look no further
this film is actually entertaining in parts
the actual fights and the robots where pretty cool
this film isnt slow to get started and there are not many lulls
jackman and dakota both give decent performances
however i found that the storyline and the way the characters interact with each other wasnt very realistic putting the giant robots a side
i didnt get why the kid stuck around all things considered
why was the kid and woman crying during the final battle
there wasnt a real explanation as to why hugh jackmans character abandoned the kid and his mother
this film could of been better but as is it passes the time
ive had this movie for quite a long time now but i thought it was going to be a cheesy film so i never watched it
what a surprise
although it feels like a very expensive kids movie i have to admit i had not enjoyed any aimedforthe adults movie so much for quite a long time
the movie and the outcome of every single match were very predictable its a kids movie after all
yet it somehow managed to get me all excited
right now im thinking if ive seen a real action movie that came close in delivering this level of joy and excitementaaafaceoff maybe
the cgi used here is some of the best ive seen
you cant tell if the robots are real or computergenerated
the actors do a really great job in showing a wide range of emotions although the ending failed to make me all emotional due to the childish nature of the movie
the fights were really exciting even though the end result was clear from the start and this has to be the movies greatest accomplishment
i strongly recommend this movie to anyone who feels heshe can still communicate with the child within
a movie that has no pretences beyond unadulterated action
this film consists of great big towering metal robots a little too akin to transformers if you ask me fighting although robot fighting seems to makes it a tad less gratuitous  but not much
real steel is yawningly predictable way too long over two hours of robotonrobot actionaayaaaaaawn did i mention predictable
after the first 5 minutes you know exactly whats going to happen so unless you like big metal things pounding each others heads for 2 hours you may as well turn it off at that point
there was a feeble attempt at a plot hugh jackman did a reasonable job of acting considering he didnt have much to work with the kid dakota goyo wasnt too cringeworthy and evangeline lilley playing bailey talet was ok in a cookie cutter kind of way
being a lifelong richard matheson fan i knew the instant i saw a trailer for it that real steel was a ripoff of his short story steel one of the greatest sf short stories ever written
by combining the idea of rock em sock em robots with mathesons notion of a world in which boxing between human beings has been outlawed the producers of this heaping mound of mindlessness aided and abetted by cheesy cgi and thirdgrade level writing thought theyd cash in
which they did
its interesting that they only approached matheson about the rights to his story after theyd stolen it
the recent first episode of the teleshow robot combat league just goes to show what can happen when people dont really have a clue as to what to do with advanced robotic technology rock em sock em the series
go back to the original astro boy tv series and youll see what it should be all about
ive never commented on a movie ever in my life however this movie was sooooooo crap that i felt like i owed it to the internet
this movie sucks
hollywood has gone crazy
nothing makes any sense
what a waste of money to make this piece of crap
loud music and big name actors dont make a movie for crying out loud
if you liked this movie your a moron
i definitely feel dumber having watched it
hugh jackman i want the last 2 hours of my life back
zero continuity zero emotional attachment between anybody why are there a thousand semifuturistic anarchists sitting around an old zoo waiting for a robot to rock up
do you control a robot with your voice your controller or what
dont watch this or you will become bitter and twisted with contempt for america although if you live in the world you probably already are
real steel could have been a really fun blockbuster for the whole family as they had the talents of writer dan gilroy hugh jackman as the lead composer danny elfman and the special effects wizards at their disposal
unfortunately the film tries to be cool and has pretty awful dialogue that distracts the viewer from watching robots fight each other
sure the story is basically rocky with robots but what person in their right mind wouldnt want to see that if only the film is well made
the special effects people did their job right and watching animatronicdigital robots perfectly mimic an actors every move in real time is really impressive
from beginning to mostly end this movie has a subtle way of getting to the punch and then it delivers time and time again with the fight scenes
real steel delivers in the same wayformula as any rocky movie any underdog movie and its exciting to watch
it leaves you smiling as you root for the father and son underdogs
but then the ending comes and the word of the day becomes c for cheese
real steel does not deliver the goods with the ending
it becomes too forcedcontrived and cheesy as heck
this movie was about a 9 for me until the ending
however overall its a pretty good movie and worth the watch
also you can never go wrong watching the beautiful and stunning evangeline lilly either
the story is another fatherhood thing a common theme for family oriented movies
and the story gets more in common with the more recent family movie where the father figure is told as a reluctant if not in denial at first as a daddy
the developed story goes on as the common fatherhood movies where the father and the kid finds the one thing they like in common and build relationship and bond more on it despite it being a long shot and eventually wins out the long shot
whats good about this one is that unlike most other fatherhood movies where its only the father that gets to do the struggle while the kid only shouts from behind to lift his spirit up this movie presents that actually the kid can do something too
jackman as always played this one nicely
its good to see dakota goyo can balance the aura of hugh jackman
also its nice too evangeline lilys earlier works here
before watching this movie i was thinking about another robofighting movie that we used to see these days but they just simply integrated emotion with it
yahhthat is true
they have showed most probably sweetest moment between father hugh jackman and son max kenton through out the movieif you a fan of transformers and expecting robots will act like human man this not the movie or you are expecting crack type action you will never get meaningless action all of a sudden
through out the whole time a viewer will see a unstoppable force that could not separate father and son how a junkyard robot became family and hope of those liveschallenging the authorityfighting against time regaining honorregaining energy etc etc
itz a full package of entrainmenti dont care even other charactershow they have done but father hugh jackman and son max kenton will make you cry and happy as well that will be the felling when you will finish this movie
rockemsockem robots meets rocky with a get the family back together theme
i got to see the movie in an advance screening tonight
the whole theater was at times applauding and whooping it up
this is not highbrow intellectual docudrama or supposed to be real
this movie is fun
it is meant to be fun
the kid steals the show
the meaning i brought home from this movie is heart
if you have heart there is nothing in this world that can stop you from your dream
just like the little engine that could
i really dont want to give away any spoilers here just advice
if you want to feel good about life and fighting the good fight then go see this movie
you will be glad you did
i am not a movie critic nor will i ever be one
but i know what makes good movie and this one has tons of heart
what can i say
i really have doubts about some of the comments
i guess movie producers must have a whole team of people leaving good comments on the forum for marketing purpose
how this movie can get such a high ranking is a mystery to me
i can clearly see what the movie was aiming at but it clearly missed
the kid kind of reminded me of the cat in shrek except it was funny in shrek
i was not expecting an oscar contender but still
the pace was completely wrong
some of the characters in the movie have no purposes at all
as somebody else mentioned in another comment the zoo scene itself represents to movie in its whole
many comments mention rocky and yes the last 20min is a remake of rocky but robot version
they even attempted to reenact the  adrian
adrian
scene
i hope for them that they made it for funny purposes
bad bad
bad
saw reel steel and enjoyed this decent popcorn flix
hugh jackman is always fun to watch and dakota goyo channels rick schroeder in his the champ like performance
jackman and goyo interacted well together and their relationship anchors the film
it is only evangeline lilly who doesnt hold her own but to her defense she isnt given much to do except where unflattering tee shirts and complain a lot about charlie in the old days
i wish they had given her more to do showed her technical expertise in helping max with atom
i have to admit that i am not a boxing fan and thought that the fight scenes were not great
they should have channeled gladiator more and cinderella man less
ok is it just me or this folks in hollywood are trying hard to make all their movies most annoying these days
this movie was clearly a combination of rocky and over the top which both have been successful feel good movies
however when you put in it the most annoying kid on the planet play most annoying rap music all the time use a lot of foul language and have grown people act like idiotic children than i am not sure whos gonna fall for it
cause i aint folks
ive seen too much of this stuff coming out of hollywood lately
are they trying to make us give up watching movies
because after watching real steel i am ready to give it all up
the whole institution
this is one of the worst movies ive ever seen not necessarily badly made however everything is played in such an annoying manner that i am really wondering if they actually wanted to annoy the audience instead of pleasing it
parts of the movie were emotional in a good way however the annoying parts were so bad that i really felt overwhelmed by it
not recommending save your time and money
i put off seeing this movie a couple of years because if youve seen the trailer you almost have seen the film
the story is one big fat lump of predictability
it just goes straight to the end without any twist turn or unexpected event
jackman plays his stereotypical roll well and the visual effects the reason i did see the film are done excellently well
the cg robots are almost indistinguishable from the animatronic ones
but besides that they just rehashed one of the blueprint scripts from the vault and added nothing to the genre cinema or the art of filmmaking in general
this movie might have some value to families with kids or kids themselves i guess they are the target audience who arent already jaded by the output of the clone factory named hollywood
this is a very good movie that tell you how to how you dont have to be the best to do your best
it has took me a long time to understand that but this movie help
you can learn a lot from watch movie like real steel
many life lessons
know that you have to be willing to take your bumps and lumps and keep going
these movie tell the story of the ultimate underdog
no one believe that he can make it
the hero get the chance to prove the world wrong
this is about a man his son that he has never met before and a robot name adam
they find these old robot and little do they know it would change there future and life forever
they take this training bot
he keep takes on the best in the w2orld and keep getting better
when they get really good have a chance to win it all
these movie is really good
i thought it was going to be lame
then i show it and like to watch it ever time it come on tv
it is very good if you dont have to like robots to watch the movie
this is a movie that will speak to people that are look at as under dogs
because we have a will of steel
its been a while since i was this entertained
the movie is brimming full of character its funny the human touch comes through and even some light drama
the lines across the film are spot on
sure the secondary plot is very lightweight but who cares
for the type of movie this wants to be
its atom
it hits the spot every time
i thought the acting added value and the whole fatherson albeit via a robot game evolved through the movie
it went from a very distant and so what to warm sentimental scenes
very good acting
on the dialogue some of the you sold me 100 miles for a kiss  was worth it they are just peppered lightly to life and amuse
brilliant
i really like the movie
i love hugh jackman and most of the films he is in
but this one is one of his best
i love the storyline of the father and son learning and growing together
i really liked the part where aunt deborah comes to get max and charlie tells max that max forgot who charlie was
when in reality charlie grew up some and become almost a whole other person
though i have to say the ending was my favorite part where charlie tries to tell max how he feels and max says the secret is safe with him
i enjoyed the action of the robot boxing but liked the human side of it better
im not much of a boxing fan
it was well shot edited and directed and all the actors were great
if you havent seen this film yet i suggest you go rent it
its totally worth watching
the reason i want to review this film is because it something that i like doing and have done well not as a robot but in eggars i was doing kick boxing as well as boxing so what the film is about robot getting trained by some people but some of the robots dont need to be controlled by a controller but atom and zeus are the ones that dont need to be controlled by anything and the reason i like the film is because towards the end it is atom vs zeus and zeus is the unbeaten but with atom he was the one who was perfectly matched for zeus because he was a fast movement robot boxer
i would recommend this film to anyone who enjoys rocky and terminator because they based on the same things mainly because with rocky it boxing and with terminator it the robot bit
i have to admit i didnt think this movie was gonna be good the first time i saw the trailer
i rented from redbox when it came out on dvd and i was totally wrong
i came from watching rocky to this
it is not as good as rocky but i can give it props for being a lot like it
the plot no spoilers is about charlie kenton a retired boxing champion is now part of robot boxing
he finds out that his ex is dead and he must go get his son
his sons an ahole to his father but charlie finds out his son loves robot boxing
so the find a robot named atom and they train him to fight
the things i love about this movie one is the music by danny elfman definitely one of his best sound jobs
i find myself listening to some tracks every so often
the story is really good it sucks you in in a blink of an eye
you feel for pretty much every character
its a really feel good movie that really leaves a great impression
i give it 8 out of 10 stars
spoiler alert this movie is just the right movie with a combo of perfect robo fight scenes and some decent characterization
charliehugh jackman is a big a who doesnt know what hes doing and the little kid is a better business man then him even though challenging zeus after one pro fight is a little extreme
the story is a little predictable and some parts that are just a little dumb like the classic stand on a clifffall downfind something valuable scene
also you might notice some cracks on atoms face which looks vaguely like a mouth and nose which might be some discreet attempt at adding more heart to the movie
overall this movie is pretty decent to watch with amazing cgi and a rank of 710 stars
when i saw the previews for this movie i thought it would just be okay
my wife talked me into watching it and i was very surprised to enjoy it so much
i think they could have developed the story with charlies son a little more but from what i understand they are planning a sequel and maybe they will build on it more then
i think they could have ended the movie with them deciding to stay together or something along those lines instead of stopping abruptly after the final fight
i still give the movie a solid 8 out of 10
i am looking forward to the sequel and think they can do so much more with the idea behind this film and hope they develop it well on the next one
this movie was completely boring
the story is boring
dakota goyo cant act and is really annoying
the relationship between hugh jackmans character charlie kenton and evangeline lillys character bailey talletis boring to say the lest
you will know how the movie ends within the first five minutes the story is that predictable and really shows how lazy the movie industry has become
the only good character in the movie is atom and thats because he has no lines in the movie
my suggestion is instead of watching lazy hollywood movies with bad writing and no originality you should watch truly original content like cowboy bebop or ghost in the shell stand alone complex
ive really enjoyed watching this amazing movie though you can find some similarity between it and rocky balboa where every champion has a last fight to fight
i really enjoyed two hours of enthusiasm thrilling and light focus on details which makes other movies boring
the movies sequence of events is fast organized and logical and emotional parts are not heavy which makes your heart pumping as long as possible
i really enjoyed the clearance of the relationship between both the father and the son when they met for the first time in the movie and the personal similarity makes it not ugly as it may looks with normal fatherson relationship
and an extra point for the good quality of movie as you dont see sexual shots which makes it suitable movie for all ages especially that it doesnt have a violent shots unless of course you have a heart problems or under 7 years old
so if you have not watched this movie yet i recommend it for you
enjoy watching
well i saw the movie expecting some powerful acting by the hugh jackman but the actor seems to be confined himself and let the child actor do his duty of acting
the movie is like a future version of rocky except in this robos will fight against each other rather than original pro boxers
i think children and teens will like this movie rather than adults
director tries to show father and son relationship but the drama is very weak and it gets boring
the child actor is ok
the lady who played the girl friend of jackman is pretty dam good
she has great expressions
i am giving 6 out of 10
go for the movie if you dont have anything special do to on that day
now that is a movie that stays with you long after its over
with the right blend of emotions and action it surely will give you your moneys worth
hugh jackman is terrific as always
even the discarded dancing robot atom is so adorable and you feel connected with the cast almost instantly
but the real find of the movie is the kiddo dakota
sometimes you wonder what is the age of that kid given the expressions and emotions coming out of that cute face
the storyline and the screenplay keep you engrossed throughout and prepare you for the final showdown
and what a climax you havei feel it was better than the fighter
in a movies warfight you always know who is gonna win
but the real talent lies in the way you win it
but it manages to win your hearts more importantly
i would recommend this movie for all age groups a sureshot entertainer
watching the trailer i felt great interest to see the movie as im fond of scifi and that trailer appeared quite like one of my favorites transformers
big robots crazy fight man with them i was eager to get a dvd of it
surprizing me my friend at home bought it for the weekend
relaxing on the couch with drinks and snacks we started playing it in our ps3
and next few hours i didnt speak a word but watching the movie enjoying its every bit the fights and most  the characters
to my opinion it is not just an action movie
besides the botfight tensions comes up the tension of fatherson relationship
i think at this point this movie becomes a meritorious one
i just loved the characterization the presentation of story though the story wasnt an epic one and the two main characters acting was superb especially the kid  his acting was so naturally flowing and spontaneous really blown my mind
jackmans talent faded to that little boys performance if we compare them considering the age and experience of acting
a great movie for all
the robots and the action in the movie meld together nicely
taking place in the nottoodistant future of about 2020 transformerlike robots spar box and fight in place of humans in events such as the wrb world robot boxing
some of the robots that fight in the movie are midas twin cities noisy boy and the worldfamous zeus
the robots all have their own uniqueness and a lot of color and wellmade action shots making the movie very entertaining for many ages
not only was there plenty of action a robot that almost takes on a humanlikeness but there are also heartfelt and touching moments that make the movie worthwhile
seems a few reviewers here are taking themselves and this film a little to seriously
schindlers list this isnt and it should be rated accordingly that said
what a thoroughly entertaining film
i watched this with a friend and by the mid way point we were both shouting come on rocky get off the ropes
come on hit him
5
4
3
2
and hes up
i got that same great feeling i had when i watched rocky fighting apollo creed awesome feel good fun
is it predictable
absolutely
but who cares
we enjoyed every minute
it ticks all the boxes for an all round action packed family film
great cast great effects and an old as time everything will be ok in the end storyline
in the words of jimmy krankie voted most scottish person 2003 it was faaaaandabeeedozee
watch and enjoy
it will make you feel good
