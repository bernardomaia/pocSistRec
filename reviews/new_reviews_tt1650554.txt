kickass 2 was definitely a film for the fans if you arent familiar with the kickass series then this movie wouldnt be for you
having said that i am a fan of the comics and this movie was awesome
the fight scenes were crazy and hitgirl always runs the show
i hate that the critic scores are low but i honestly kind of figured they would be and i see why they made it so low to a films core this film wouldnt be looked at as a masterpiece and they couldnt exactly retain the same shock factor the first one had because hitgirl was only 11 or 12 years old in it
but all things aside this was a pretty entertaining film and i think most people would really enjoy it
kickass was a pleasant surprise kickass 2 is a big disappointment
definitely not as good as the first movie
this time the jokes are not as funny there are zero surprises in the plot
creativity was left behind
apparently the producers thought that the lack of intelligent jokes could be compensated by adding gross humour people throwing up and shitting all over the place
thats supposed to be funny
i found the violence unnecessarily graphic dismemberments abound blood is shed as if it was nothing
and this is supposed to be a teen action comedy
there is no need to show all that gore
showing it as casual makes it more consumable and that is actually a very questionable proposition
what an absolutely terrible film
gone is the style the wit the intelligence of the first film
this is a paintbynumbers sequel which missteps at every point
it glories in violence instead of critiquing it
the characters are boring caricatures of themselves the supporting cast are cartoon characters  literally
kickass had real people in ridiculous circumstances  this sequel has ridiculous people doing ridiculous things for no apparent reason
hitgirls story is a weird tired high school mean girls clicha which ends with hit girl getting revenge by making them vomit and poo
huh
i could go on and on but this film is just  weird and a great big disappointment
one of the worst movies ive ever seen
there was no point to this movie
the story was stupid
i should have been paid to watch this movie
i rented it
anyone who thinks this movie was good needs to to go into therapy
it was so bad that all of the people involved in this film should be water boarded
in fact anyone connected with this movie should not be allowed to be in or make another movie ever again
the studio that made this film meaning that film is something you clean up from your sink or toilet should be burnt down demolished and then buried under ten feet of granite
my wife stopped watching in about 30 minutes into it
we left it on but was disgusted by the lack of plot and the total rip off of the first film
was it a teen movie
was it a movie comic book
was it a horror movie  wasnt batman or spiderman
i know nothing of the comic it was based on but thought the first movie was okay
i want back the time i spent watching this appalling film
okay i admit im a huge kickass fan
this is my second favourite movie of all time only to the first kickass
dave is a whole lot tougher than he is in the first one and it also shows the badass side of jim carrey
jim carrey always makes me laugh when he is in dumb and dumber ace ventura and the mask but this shows the total badass side of him as colonel stars and stripes an exmob enforcer turned real life superhero and born again christian
his dog eisenhower schvantz
was totally awesome too how she punished a villain by chomping on his balls
hitgirl was even more foul mouthed in this one than she was in the first one she is a 15 year old in this one and this one had mother russia a super villain who punishes cops very violently and with a lot of action
this has very little spoilers i guess
not sure why so many people are giving this film 1 star reviews
there are films that i cant even watch 5 minutes of because theyre so poorly produced or the acting is so terrible that it deserves 1 star
this movie is not one of them
i get peoples take on the violence etc
but the film is rated r and its based on a comic people
for fraks sake
good soundtrack great acting and a very believable and relatable to our world if there were heroes or villains
i love marvel and the xmen films for the most part but if you believe that someone getting a sword shoved through them wouldnt make them bleed profusely then youre just an idiot
the kickass franchise is actually realistic in the sense that it shows blood
if you dont like it go watch xmen first class
not ragging on first class
just saying
no blood
the hell
this was a great movie
it was nice that they carried over the story from the original
some people may think the movie was a bit stupid but this kept the character of the movie
the storyline was great and the humorous content mixed with the action really went well together
bringing in new characters was a great plus
this just made the movie more interesting as you could learn about the new characters and what there roles were in the movie
personally believe that there was more action in the movie than the last one
it helps to keep you interested in the movie
overall it was a great entertaining movie
i could easily watch it over and over again just like i did with the first kick ass movie
hopefully they make a 3rd movie
that will be a must see
its very impressive the amount of time people spend in writing reviews good and bad but theres times where certain reviews and ratings just make me angry
like in this case an absolutely amazing movie given the presence
so like the majority of reviewers i give this movie about an 8 because it kick ass
when i get angry is when i can not reply to the comment or reviews especially when you get some ludicrous rating of 1 and moronic review
for such a popular site as imdb its not fair to the movies or the viewer when you have no ability to debate a left wing or right wing review
of course this is my opinion just as each and everyone of these reviews are
in fairness though a film an acting educated opinion is worth more than a radical conservativeliberal or anyone with whacked agendas
all that being said kickass 2 was a super funny and wicked violent along with great moral story
theres not much to say about this movie
it brings just what it promises violence not too gory tough so i dont really get all the hate for the socalled extremely bloody violence in this movie because we only see a little bit of blood here and there pervasive humor and alternation between a light and a dark tone throughout
so basically its just like the first movie only with more heart and action
but then why is it just a 7 out of 10 while the first one was easily a 9 out of 10
i dont really know its a psychological thing i guess
the first one was fresh new controversial
this one is nothing but a copy of that but with more of everything
if you loved the first one you will love this one too but youll love it even more if you never saw the first one if you know what i mean
710
there is very poor writing and the director failed to lead the story anywhere interesting
there is a lot of confusion on where to set the tonesomething that the first film did very well
it felt like watching a story that a sixth grader had written
in short i wish i had not spent money to see what i saw before leaving after about an hour and ten minutes
i feel that had the original team been charged with creating this film it would have been terrific but it is a truly disappointing project as it stands
for those who need closed captioning be aware that this flick doesnt have it
that meant we couldnt watch it here but im not sure we would have stuck with it anyway as the video quality was poor and grainy
violencevulgarityhumor and suuperheroes
whats there not to like
so we have kick assaaron and hit girlmoretz who had marked the presence of superheroes and started the revolution
christopher mintz plasse reprises his role and come back as a new super villain and now consolidating a team to take revenge
hit girl tries to balance her life as a student which is a very realstick approach and i liked it a lot
there is a team of superheroes led by colonel stars and stripes played by jim carrey who totally pulled it off
the movie had emotional scenes and intense elements just like previous part
if u liked kick ass 1  you will definitely love this fantabulous sequel
truly  it is a stupendous sequel of a meritorious movie
if you enjoyed the whimsical idealism of the original kick ass youd better not subject yourself to this sequel which is an altogether different beast
in fact youd better not watch this movie too close to mealtime
the profanity is jarring and continuous with fbombs about every 3 minutes spearheaded by the idiotic name of the chief villain motherfer
the ultraviolence and ultravulgarity is reminiscent of a quentin tarantino flick
there are dismemberments decapitations explosive vomiting and diarrhea crotchmauling dogs etc
it is difficult to write a spoiler for this movie because the plot is so weak
consider yourself warned and avoid this grisly turkey
i have read the comics and have the first kickass so i knew what to expect going into this film
i knew it wasnt going to be word for word close to the comics neither was the first one
there is some stuff in the comics that wouldnt have worked for the film so i understand why certain changers were made
jim carreys performance as colonel stars and stripes was literally spot on to his comic counterpart
chloe grace moretz was great as hit girl although the van chase sequence was a little cheesy
i was disappointed that evan peters did not return in this one
however the action was good the character dialogue and chemistry worked surprisingly well
i do recommend this movie to anyone who is a comic book lover or anyone who just wants to see a fun movie
kickass 2 started out promising
the story with hitgirl being forced to retire and leading kickass to form his own team was a fine start
jim carrey was fun as colonel stars and stripes and the movie was shaping up
but from the moment chris damico arrived he was annoying and just got worse
mother russia and the other super villains were awful and the fact that daves geek friends become heroes like ass kicker and battleguy is cheap
it was overly violent and not in a fun way like the first one boring at some points and a ripoff of itself
the first one was much better
though i would recommend it to fans of the first if anything to finish the saga kickass 2 was overall a disappointment
what a complete and utter mess of a film
its all over the place and is over saturated with characters and plot lines
why they didnt cut like 3 or 4 of these plot lines and like 10 characters i dont know
had they done that they could have focused on the action and the relationship between kickass and hitgirl
that is all i wanted from this movie
but no
they had to waste my time with hitgirl having a dilemma about being hitgirl hitgirl being a normal stereotypical teenage girl kickass dicking around with some random superhero group and so much other crap like that
none of it was necessary
unfortunately they left in all of it and we are left with this cluttered unfocused crap
such a disappointing movie
definitely avoid

disappointing sequel to the comic book adaptation following the aftermath of the titular heros actions with dire consequences when his rivals villainous desires for payback comes with a dour price to pay for his good intentions
while most of the originals cast is back particularly the two leads the film is relatively less fun and more hellbent on depicting violence for violences sake yes we get it that real life violence is painful move on with the onenote screenplay by the director jeff wadlow
it also didnt help having carrey crap all over the film prior to its release for feeling the message was overwrought in the wake of current reallife violent events involving teenager but im sure the check cleared right jim
so much for a new franchise with something to say
this movie was awful i could of get my brain damaged for everything of this movie i hated it and its in my list of the worst movies of 2013 i wish this could of be number 1 of the worst list of 2013 but escape from planet earth saved this garbage butt because escape from planet earth was 1 and i hated so much i wanted to pause the movie every time i watched it it was stupid dont waste your time or money its not worth it and its a stupid movie
i dislike this movie because it was everything everything was trash the whole movie sucked no spoilers ok this review is free but yeah not worth it im definitely giving this movie 1 star for being a huge disappointment and i give this movie also an f i enjoyed the 1 movie but this movie was not worth it but yeah go watch this is the end  if they still have that on theathers  smurfs 2  i cant believe im saying this or star trek into darkness but this one was a huge mess
i liked it even better than the first movie
a starting hero and a little fighting girl was great but the second part of story was a little better
i saw more of characters every day life and they werent only superheroes anymore
but i admit that i hoped to see some romance between kickass and hitgirl because it seemed logical
but i never read the comic book before i saw the movie
costumes were awesome
soundtracks were great too
what i didnt like was deaths of daves father and of course chris
in some way it felt wrong
too bad that hit girl left town in the end kind of sad
however this ending gave the impression that i can expect the third movie too which i like a lot
i liked this film because this is one of my favourite action films of all time in 2013 what i liked about this film is that most of the scenes are mostly action in all the scenes
i would recommend this film too everyone that is in too action films
the special effects in the film absolutely amazing you will love it if you watch this film but you will have too watch the first kickass before you watch the 2nd film
the script in the film is really funny in most of the films because there is such stars just like jim carrey and there is also really good actors that are brilliant actorsactress like aaron taylor johnson and chloe grace moretz
the genre for the film is action comedy and crime
at the start of the film the girl goes to school but doesnt stay she just goes too a training centre
at the end of the film there is a massive fighting scene
this scene was very exciting
okay frankly i dont like comedy film i watch kick ass because of its gory genre
i thought that i will not laugh instead i will be mad at the comedy scene but i was wrong i was laugh so loud in my room because of the street language or slang words that they used in the movie
the movie is unique because of its genre and its action scene
i remember some gore scene in kill bill
i like the villains in the movie
but the head villain is so lame
hahaha
i rate this movie 7
1 because of the cinematography the effort and the effects
i like the bloody squirting effects and some rants that they use in the movie hence this movie is for mature only
i think if some minor watches this movie they will imitate it so please dont watch it minors
this is one of those times i have to say screw the critics
kickass 2 may not be as good as the first but it is still pretty damn good for a sequel
lots of laughoutloud moments along with plenty of good fight scenes as well
chloe grace mortez christopher mintzplasse and jim carrey all nail their roles and steal just about every scene they are in
although i did think carrey was underused and wouldve liked to see more of him
the film does become a bit too cartoonish and a bit inconsistent but i was having so much fun watching it didnt take that much enjoyment out of it
if you are a fan of the first than i can almost guarantee that you will enjoy this one as well
by far some of the most fun ive had at the movies this year and better than any other comicbook or superhero movie to be released this year as well
i was dancing in excitement through much of this film throwing punches in my living room with kick ass and hit girl
i do not understand all the hatred toward this flick
it was entertaining as frak
granted it did not have much of the originality of the first kick ass but for shats sake it is a sequel and by definition it wont be original
if i were to judge movies only on quality originality and good acting then i would have hated star wars episode iv v vi i ii and iii as the originals were based on akira kurosawas the hidden fortress but i enjoy them all episode v is the best btw
unless you are a film school student with a stick up their asx this movie is more than worth the 90 minutes it takes to watch and i doubt anybody with any clue what this film is about who watches it will be disappointed
final answer
this flick was phenomenal
im a sucker for super hero movies in which the super heroes are real people who do not supernatural abilities
thats why i liked the movies super and kickass and this sequel to kick ass did not disappoint
its very real
okay kids would not be able to take kicks and punches like that but aside from that its pretty realistic or at least realistic enough for me to suspend disbelief long enough to enjoy the movie
i love the crass humor and vulgar language
come on
dont be a prude
this is how these characters would talk
like kickass kickass 2 is a great story
then on top of the great story there is great action decent acting lots of funny lines and even a little bit of drama
i hope they do a kickass 3
that said this movie is not for kids
theres too much vulgar language and sexual references
not quite as good as the first but still one of my favorite movies this summer
the increased blood and gore were a plus and the movie takes on a more serious tone than the first one
the change in directors kinda made this one an ok film but the potential was there to be great
jim carry was really good in this you have a hard time telling its him because of the serious tone no quirky voices
the character development was good considering the time had i had a chance to do the movie i would of of made it an hour longer just so some of the scenes didnt feel rushed
if you enjoyed the first one this movie is worth watching
all in all not to shabby of a movie
810 for me
i am not going to go into detail about the plot and what not so i will just get to the point
the first kick ass movie is one of my all time favorite films and i have to say kick ass 2 is even bigger amp better than the first one
kick ass 2 has double the action great funny bits through out and the ensemble cast is amazing
the mother and jim carry really steal the show but then again all the actors were great
it seems like this movie should be getting better reviews because everyone i have talked to loved it and said they think it is as good or better than the original
so dont listen to what most critics are saying go see the flick for yourself and you might be pleasantly surprised
forget nolans batman or snyders superman
mark millers kickass is the most accurate depiction of superheroes ive ever seen
it shows you the good and bad side of trying to do what is right
after seeing kickass 2 it made me want to become a superhero but i didnt due the fear of death
everyone can relate to kickass while hardly anyone can relate to spider man batman iron man and no one can relate to superman
so far i have only read kick ass 2s comic book counter part and it was equally as good as the film
kickass is the next great hero because we all know straight out of joss whedons agents of s

e

d commercial
you dont need powers to be super
i loved the first movie and really liked this one
im rating it an 8 just because i feel like it could have been a better movie if the characters were as serious as the story line
the movie had a lot of good laughs and i really enjoyed some of the humor in it but the actual story and reason behind why everything happens in the movie is so much more serious compared to the jokes that the directors tried fitting into the movie
i mean i get it the movies supposed to be a funny view to the life and struggles of ordinary people who want to be heroes
but if they really tried hard this movie could of been almost as big as xmen or even the dark knight
great action for what i was expecting though and i really liked the blood involved with the humored violence
i kinda felt like i was watching a terantino film
must watch for sure especially if you liked the first movie
first of all i have to say i had a blast watching the first kickass film and thought it was great overall
unfortunately in my opinion the sequel fails at every single aspect that made the first one so enjoyable
while kickass 2 had a few funny bits there were too many painfully unfunny and completely ridiculous moments that made me want to walk out of the theater at times
there were also some very annoying characters like mother russia and other disposable ones who were given way too much screen time
in addition christopher mintzplasses character was pretty lame this time for me and also annoying
now the action sequences werent really as intense and interesting as in the first film and some of them had bad cgi
i hate to say this but kickass was a major disappointment and not even remotely good
was a huge fan of the first movie this one is just as awesome
the actors performances are terrific as well as the writing
wasnt sure if jim carey was right for this but hes really good in this role
also christopher plasse is really talented way beyond mclovin
overall excellent story great mix of comedy and strikingly serious evil
once again hit girl is our hero and you really cheer for her
if you enjoyed the clever writing direction and performances of the first one youll like this one as well
oh and i loved the blood an violence because its movie violence not real violence
pull your tampon out jim
kickass 2 is considerably darker than the original yet it still retains its humour
a solid cast is let down by some superhero tropes and the absence of nic cage is really felt
some of the plot has really been done to death by other superhero films its no longer shocking when a loved hero hangs up their cape and retires nor is it much surprise when a previously good hero turns to the dark side seeking revenge
there is a lot of violence and absurdity in equal measure
my biggest complaint is that jim carrey should have had more screen time
fans of the comic will be a bit puzzled at some of the choices made in the script but not a bad adaptation
enjoyable but wont win oscars
810
have to say that im not a fan of comic books and have never seen the kick ass comics but seeing raving reviews here was pretty confident the movie would be ok
well huge mistake
first thing that catches your eye is the head actresses pout
it is everywhere all over the place shes always having that fake innocent look in her eyes and the pout
im unsure if it is her natural mimics or shes thinking it is a genius idea for the role
the rest of the actors are ok but chloe moretz made it feel like the whole cast was horrible
i liked jim carrey his acting was solid and the bad guys were fine to watch too
the plot is your usual superhero thing nothing special it always is pretty bad except the batman movies
dialogues in kick ass 2 made me feel embarrassed for just being there inspirational wannabe conversations among kids are just a joke
it was better when the bad guys spoke though
2 stars for the bad guys and jim carrey
in 2010 kickass had succeeded to surprise fan boys and critics by its theme which is close to reality and teenages behavior
the movie is so fun and hilarious
also it makes its star chloemoretz and matthew vaughn popular these days
no wonder the studio is enthusiastic to create sequel for this franchise
unfortunately kickass 2 suffers from many plot holes and inconsistent storyline
there are some stupid scenes in this movie like the process of chris damico turns into the motherfcker and some scenes involved toddass kicker
jeff wadlow as director tries to make almost the same formula from its predecessor but he just fails to adapt and deepen the emotional of character which could be the influential aspect from the first movie
the only positive point from kickass 2 is the existence of jim carrey who is enjoyable to see and some bloody violent action scene although its still nothing compared with kickass
overall kickass 2 is an unnecessary sequel to be made
the movie just ruin the image that matthew vaughn has built years ago
as a big fan of the previous moviewent into dis movie wid total excitement only to see a total crap of a movie
wonder how they could mess up the sequel so badlythe whole style and tone of the first movie has just disappearedhow could vaughn let the new director go ahead wid such crapand the worst part was the climax where all the superheroes and villains just converge for a free for allughh
it was like watching a teen high school movie with a lot of cusswords and bloodlettingjust hope dat part 3 if n whenever its released gets back to the winning ways dat dis kick ass franchise truly deserves
the last movie was the jizzbut dis sequel is just pure crapperiod
offers nothing interesting clever exciting or sigh funny
in fact this is probably the least funny superhero film i have seen in years which was beyond surprising and insanely depressing
to be honest this movie doesnt just lack a sense of humor but also a pulse
i can honestly think of nothing positive to say except for maybe that jim carrey had the good sense or good fortune take your pick to enter late and exit early in what appears to be the most thankless role of his career
it wasnt that he didnt try but that he was literally given nothing to work with
you cant poor your heart and sole into a one dimensional cameo role
sorry jim you just cant
my advice to the sobs responsible behind this franchise is either bring back matthew vaughn to make a hit girl spinoff or just let this one die and get on with your lives
just chalk it up as an acceptable loss and just walk away before anymore damage can be done
after all one black eye is still better than two
for many people the first one was a bit out of the boxmany thought the young star was exploited too much well folks it is a sequel so it is worse
in the first movie there was and air of innocence about the main characters well this is thrown out the door in the first scene
the movie is full of violence full of foul language and choc block of disturbing scenes everything that was said about the first one is doubled here it holds nothing back
the story is a revenge story but the revenge is twisted and really disturbing
the scenes involving hitgirl this time around are not for the faint hearted and the scenes involving the mf are disturbing but hilarious
this movie is so much fun
if you liked the first one well everything in this one is doubled as it is a sequel but a special mention to chloa grace moretz who in my opinion is a fantastic actresses every movie i have seen her in she has stole the show
fun and violence
710
yes critics did get it right
its that terrible
the first kickass was at least novel and had some storyline and was fun
this sequel was just so boring so predictable and was just a money sucking excuse to make another
despite the fact it has an rrating you get the feel it had an intelligence level that was made just for young kids who thanks to their video games do enjoy their violence
frankly i didnt see any of them as worthy of being considered a superhero or super super villain just immature wannabes with a real lousy script
im hoping it ends here but if it brings in enough money im sure they wont let it rest
as long as it makes a buck the hollywood producerwhores would keep making it until its star becomes hitgranny not girl
p
most of you who have enjoyed the first kickass kick ass 2 is so much better
more action super funny and of course hit girl so grown up now
shes so cute
i just wished the love interest with hit girl and kickass would have gone more just hoping but aside from that even there were so many characters in the movie theyve been great from small roles to big roles
has a great plot and story line
it seems the movie was well executed
i also love the fighting scenes especially when hit girl saves kickass from the bad guys
it also has a soft side where in kickass got mad to his pops and when he was going to be arrested his dad took his place
i hope theres a kickass 3
please
in my opinion this film is even better than the first one
it is very well written with smart dialogues clever humor and very cool choreography of the fights
the actors are great in particular chloa grace moretz shes really a talented actress and she did an amazing job
i really enjoyed watching it i was gonna vote 10 out of 10 but
like in the first one they have to shoot a bad final
im gonna spoil the comics too
in the first one dave hook up with lyndsy fonseca while in the comics she humiliates him and has her friends beat him up
now this clicha final with a kiss and a character that just have to leave
face palm instead of the police that arrests everyone
by the way the flirt between hit girl and kickass it is just
wrong
he doesnt even try to stop the kiss
my sad opinion is that the production and distribution companies have forced the 2 finals because even if is not perfectly accurate to the comics as i said the movies are great in everything beside the finals that seems written by someone else
i enjoyed this film just as much as the first one however it felt like it was trying to hard
it contained lots of one liners of which were funny but it just seem too desperate
also i felt the movie was to hollywood compared to the first one i mean by this that its over the top
i really liked that fact all the heroes werenot indestructible like superman or didnt have the money to but gadgets like batman some would have to have days off just because of normal colds
most of them had meanings for what they are doing so just because of this it makes the film seem more relateable because of these problems ordinary families have to face
i would recommend this film to anyone who loves the first kick ass and anyone who enjoys comedy action and crime
its full of action and quirky costumes
did kickass really need a sequel
apparently some studio people thought there was some more money to be made so here it is
ka2 is not as streamlined or focused as ka1
besides reallife superheros it also has a lot of other themes like being popular at highschool obeying your parents falling in love etc
sometimes its really hard to see what this film is trying to be you have scenes that might be intended as comedy but arent funny the music always seems overly dramatic emotional scenes that are very cheesy intentionally
and gratuitous bloody violence a  la kill bill
the film was made for a low 28m but the vfx sometimes look fake and cheap the physical fight scenes are pretty good
i have to say that i have mixed feelings about this one on one hand i found it enjoyable to watch but on the other hand it does feel like it could have been a lot better and it didnt need to be made
the pubic seems to agree as it made only half the money of the first one so this is probably the end of the line
if you have seen and liked the first one i would give it a go
i really cannot see why this was really bad
i wanted to see this so badly but nobody would recommend it
i went to see it anyway and was quite surprised
sure its much more vulgar than the previous one but there are way more disgusting movies than this
the only thing this film lacks is a really engaging thrill that you get from the first one
i also disliked the fake blood effects that werent up to kick ass standard and that jim carey didnt really get a bigger role for this movie considering he was on the poster
the comedy is quite good and it had some great lines in there but this movie is aiming for a more serious tone and it gets there during the second half of the movie
the stupidity of the names really got me
the motherfer night bch battle guy the tumor and finally my personal favourite the toxic megacts
overall this was an effective movie and i was engaged throughout
plot kick ass joins a group of amateur superheros jokers actually lead by colonel stars and stripes where as mindy trying to become a normal college girl  but circumstances force them to become vigilantes once again
performances the lead cast tries to hard to do justice with their roles but script doesnt offer much for them
the real problem with this sequel is the script
the story has more violence and gore than the prequel
in one scene a criminal got killed in another the heros dad got killed
for a second you think youre not watching an action comedy but youre watching a revenge drama
even villain the motherfcker red myst has not much to do except only shrieking on his goons
the jokes have less humour actually they are senseless
jim carreys character is meaningless and is overshadowed by kickass
the ending is inspired from the dark knight 2008 where mindy is going on her bike so fast
do not waste your money in buying a dvd for this one
but if you still want to watch it then watch this on star movies or on hbo
kickass the infamous super hero joins a group of other masked heroes this time as hitgirl tries to live a normal life leaving her super hero days behind
the second movie was  no surprise not as good as the first
the humor was terrible bad jokes low quality scenes racist lines
the action scenes were okay could have been better though
the final battle too clicha as was the whole plot
especially the teenagehigh school drama wasnt even fit for the movie
things got better when hit girl came back and took action but before that the whole movie was one death after the other with no interest at all
the performances were okay jim carey was a nice surprise and moretz was great as well
the costumes were good too
but other than that kick ass 2 didnt live up to the expectations
it just was too soso for a sequel of kick ass
so 3 out of 10 could have been 2 if my friends hadnt insist on the union j factor
violence and use of rough language brings up same elements as the first movie
it can be really funny
even repeating some of the first movie it separates nicely from other movies of they kind
brutality and darkness can shock viewer even if you have seen the first movie
this movie has a unique way to play motions in comedy
there is also lot of scenes u cant be prepared for
how many times you stop to think what just happened
ending is the only part that i did not like so much and iwe had this spiderman theme in my head too many times
thats why i dont give 10
from start to finish really entertaining and most off all super funny
although i did like the 1st kickass a little better then this one this was still a good movie
it was very enjoyable to see chloe grace a little more grown up amp mature
once again her scenes were very well choreographed
aaron taylorjohnson did a great job in his reoccurring role as well
i liked the way the movie began
it was a fun movie to watch and not half bad for a sequel
my only problem is that the plot got a little corny at times but i guess thats what is to be expected in a superhero type movie
still it held my attention for the most part
bottom line kickass 2 kicked azz again
but hopefully it will stop at this one
lol
