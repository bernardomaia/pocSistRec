"\nThough director Spike Jonze collaborated with Charlie Kaufman on Being\nJohn Malkovich and Adaptation, the latter didn't have a hand in Jonze's\nassured, moving fourth feature, but his spiritfiendishly inventive,\ncasually postmodern, self-lacerating, fearless, funny, and ultimately\ndeeply sadpervades the film. With Her, Jonze beautifully realizes a\nfuture Los Angeles where a lovesick man (Joaquin Phoenix) in the midst\nof a devastating divorce is so desperate for intimacy that he falls\nhopelessly in love with an artificially intelligent operating system,\nvoiced by Scarlett Johansson. Jonze's screenplay acknowledges the\ninnate absurdity of the film's premise while spinning it into an\nelegant, heartbreaking depiction of human loneliness and the innate\nneed for connection. For the setting, Jonze plugged into the current\nera's technological mania to say something timeless and profound about\nlove, loss, and evolving desire.\n"
"\nJust finished watching Spike Jonze's new movie 'Her', a beautiful,\ntender, melancholy film about love and loss and technology. It's that\nkind of science fiction so close to science fact you can almost look\nout your window and see it, so in that it's of a piece with Jonze's\nfirst movie 'Being John Malkovich', though the cautious, bruised and\ndrifting heart of it reminds me most of (his ex-wife) Sofia Coppola's\n'Lost In Translation'.<br><br>It's funny: just last month I was saying how 2013 was not such a good\nyear for movies and then 'The Wolf Of Wall Street' came along, and now\nthis, which I think is probably the best of the year.<br><br>This is an amazing, unique, magical film that I would recommend to\neveryone, with the caveat that it almost certainly will make you go\n'ouch', at least if you're paying attention. But I'm pretty sure that\nyou won't have seen anything quite like it before.\n"
"\nWatched this film last night. We had high hopes of it - 8.2 on IMDb is\na pretty good rating. We both like sci-fi and I thought it was an\ninteresting premise. Guy falls in love with his computer - what a\nfascinating background for a story.<br><br>But it turned out that was it - that WAS the story.<br><br>Nothing. Else. Happened.<br><br>This was just awkward, boring, dull, terribly terribly slow,\nuncomfortable. There is zero action, zero plot, zero interest. Nothing\nactually happens. Actually that's not true - about the only vaguely\ninteresting thing that happens is when his computer gets him a book\ndeal, but even then that just gets dropped - they don't do anything\nwith it, except he unwraps his new book. There are side characters but\nthey don't have stories either. Guy he works with gets a lawyer\ngirlfriend and they go on a date. Best friend Any dumps her husband\nover a row about her shoes. That's it. That's their stories.<br><br>And what the heck was the thing with the dead cat?<br><br>I did think the acting wasn't bad, but as a story it was shockingly\nbad.\n"
"\nWhat people may find in this movie I can not understand;you experience\nendless closeups of Mr. Phoenix talking with his supposed OS, and\nsaying things so banal and so boring that you want to just close your\neyes or , even better, leave the theater.I suppose it was meant to be\nclever, sentimental, atmospheric, beautiful, but I found it\nunbearable.I really wasn't expecting the movie to be that bad with all\nthe prizes and the reviews it receives, and the director whom I never\nconsidered great but promising yes.It just makes me wonder how people\nliked the film.I'm not raging against it;it was just an experience I\nwould very much like to have avoided.\n"
"\nDepressing...the main character is a major loser...I don't blame people\nfor not wanting to be around him...all of his troubles are his own\nfault...he is indeed, as one of the characters call him, creepy.\nDespite the previews, there is nothing funny in this film...it is one\nof the most depressing films of the year.<br><br>Pretentious...remember the plastic bag floating in the air in \"American\nBeauty\"? Well, if you like that then there will be several scenes you\nwill absolutely enjoy with this film! Hmmm...staring at oil stains on\nthe ground? Watching steam arise from a manhole cover? They come on as\nnon-sequiturs but I am sure the director was making what he probably\nconsiders a great statement.<br><br>Over-indulgent...2 hours long! There is a scene where \"sex\" takes place\nbetween he and \"her\" and the screen goes black and SILENT for what\nfeels like TWO minutes. It was an awkward moment sitting in the theater\nwith nothing happening on the screen! Also, after about 75 minutes, the\nending seems to be in reach but the director drags the story on for\nanother 45 minutes!\n"
"\nI did not like this movie at ALL. I've no idea why it has wound up in\nso many Top Ten Movies of 2013 lists online. I wonder did the creators\nof those lists actually watch it at all. In fact, there was nothing\nredeeming about it for me and within minutes of it starting I wanted to\nturn it off but I watched to the end, hoping that something - anything\n- might happen. OK, so the cinematography and soundtrack etc. are\ntotally unoffensive, but in my opinion, it is grossly over-acted,\nincluding the OT's childish whining. (\"Oh-ka-aaaaay.\") Their\nconversations sound like a dialogue piece written by a high school kid\nfor homework and the delivery of it all is just so.... fake. This is a\n'chick flick', so if that's what you're into, you might like this show.\nOtherwise, you'll end up giving whoever suggested watching it a really\nhard time. Probably for life.\n"
"\nSchmuck played by the dashing Joaquin Phoenix, has inappropriate\nemotional attachment with inanimate object (computer), played by the\nalways lovely Scarlett Johansson. It doesn't occur to Schmuck that this\nmight not end well. Computer is kind, thoughtful, sexy, real people,\nnot so. Computers can take over your life, especially, with a voice\nover by Johansson. Moral of story, Computers sometimes let you down.\nOddly, his friends and co-workers think this relationship with an \"OS\"\n(operating system) is just wonderful, they even go out on awkward\ndouble dates with computer and Schmuck, and manage to keep a straight\nface. Ironically, Johanssons' computer voice is the most natural of the\nensemble, the other actors appear stiff and unnatural. Scenes and\nwardrobe look low budget, location looks cheesy, maybe like smoggy L.A.\nor Shanghai. Most repeated line in movie, \"Oh, how sweet\". Folks, save\nthe $9.\n"
"\nI was fooled into watching this by the 8.5 rating on IMDb....<br><br>What a waste of time. I downloaded this and felt ripped off. I'm not\neven trying to be funny with what I'm writing, it was genuinely a slow,\nboring, non-event of a movie. The plot was clichéd and pretentious not\nto mention it's cringeyness and predictability. Drab, grey, dull,\netc... I just can't get my head around why this is so highly rated,\nnone of its attempted messages were lost on me or anything yet I still\nfound it terrible. <br><br>Acting and all that, well it was as good as it could have been for such\na dire script/plot/whatever you want to call it. I just want my 2 hours\nback. Eurgh.\n"
"\nFairly rare one of a kind film.<br><br>A high concept film that actually stays true to its core idea yet\nwithout losing viewer interest.<br><br>Some irony here. While the film never becomes completely predictable,\neven to a jaded reviewer like this one, its process of de-constructing\nhuman relationship (brilliant, and better than all Woody Allen's films\ncombined) generates the sequential \"connections\" with the viewer (ie,\nexperiences that every viewer can relate to) which in turn keep the\nempathy going long after the initial sci fi \"wow\" is gone.<br><br>Watching this (as an aside) you have to wonder if Scarlett Johansson's\ncareer can get any more interesting? In the Marvel films she plays an\nuber-woman, In LUCY she a woman who evolves beyond evolution itself.\nAnd here yet again she plays an OS that transcends reality.<br><br>Makes for a nice resume.<br><br>Notice how Amy Adams plays every scene with no makeup? Talk about a\ndirector making every effort to keep an actor's natural beauty from\nhijacking the film...?\n"
"\nUnfortunately, I allowed an 8.5 IMDb rating and several glowing reviews\n(\"Sweet, soulful, and smart,\" gushed the aptly named Rotten Tomatoes\nwebsite) fool me into paying five bucks to watch this piece of\ncinematic dreck. If this is the type of movie which so many of today's\nyoung adult generation consider worthy of \"best picture of the year\"\nstatus, well, then I can only pray for the future of our country.\n(Actually, I've already been praying for a long time, at least ever\nsince \"It's Hard Out There for a Pimp\" won the \"best song\" !!! Oscar in\n2006.)<br><br>Here's the funny but sad part. Since I've become accustomed to paying\n$7.50 for matinées, I figured I was getting a deal this time when I was\ncharged only $5.00. I figured wrong. <br><br>Could someone please tell me what point(s), if any, the movie was\nattempting to make? What message, if any, was it trying to convey? I\nview Her simply as an exercise in aimlessness and inanity. To start\nwith, the premise was silly. The positive reviews had me expecting much\nmore than I saw. <br><br>My review? Dull, discordant, and dumb.\n"
"\nI feel utterly fooled by the 8.4 rating of this tiresome film. Not to\nmention all the hype. Really, people? I can appreciate the concept of\nthe film, the drowning of human culture in lifeless technology and the\nensuing psychological effects on weak minded people bla bla bla but did\nit really have to be executed so blandly? I really wanted to give this\nmovie a chance, but there is almost zero entertainment quality in it. I\nwill say that the cinematography is quite well done but not stimulating\nenough to help with the story of the film (or lack there-of).<br><br>I'm very capable of being bored and depressed by myself, and stare at\nmy own walls in real life without having to be subjected to it in a\nmovie.\n"
"\nIn this horrifying dystopian thriller, depicting the mass man as a\nfeminized ball of bullsh*t emotion. Too weak to secure relationships\nand thus falls for a machine, which requires zero physical input. He\njust moans and whines to his new female operating system. Highly\nliberalized fantasy of the modern hipster man, ambiguous sexuality and\nno sign of identity whatsoever. Don't worry this is sure to be the\nfuture and we'll all be integrated to these awesome all knowing, sexy\nmachines. Phew, we won't need to question our existence any longer.<br><br>I could be wrong of course, maybe Joaquin Phoenix is just obsessed with\nplaying people with mental health issues &amp; I'm over exaggerating. <br><br>So don't take my word for it, why not take the time and go see this\ntripe with the family.\n"
"\nI'd say the second worst, after \"Be Cool.\" In Her, the future is a\nterrible place filled with soft people too soft to get out of their own\nway to do anything. The protagonist is a soft loser, too soft by his\nown standards. He is a troubled soul, a sort of futuristic emo,\ntortured by things too soft to be considered First World problems. And\nthe world is just like him - soft, pastel, fuzzy, like some kind of ad\nfor boutique soap bars or pink and mint-green towels. This future is\npresented as a utopia, but it's a sad, miserable place.<br><br>This future is not just the backdrop to the story, as the protagonist\nis a product of this future. In this future, almost everyone is like\nhim, yet he is worse than them all.<br><br>I can't prevent you from seeing the film. There are too many good\nreviews for this film. Maybe the ones that hated it are the minority.\n"
"\nI'll be honest with you, I thought that this movie was going to blow my\nmind from all of the wonderful reviews I read from it. Yes, I wanted to\nblow my mind in the first 20 minutes of the film, but I decided to give\nit a chance because, once again, the reviews.<br><br>The movie is pointless. It has no clear message. The whole movie\nconsists in the protagonist talking with the Artificial Intelligence.\nAnd let me tell you, those are some of the dullest dialogues I've seen\nin movies. I wanted to get inside the screen and punch the guy to see\nif he would wake up and show a sign of spark. Anyways, I lasted\nthroughout the whole movie. When it ended, I found myself staring at\nthe credits (which were more entertaining than the movie) asking myself\nwhy I didn't stop watching it in the first 10 minutes.<br><br>If you are not planning in falling in love with your laptop, DO NOT\nwatch this movie.\n"
"\nThis movie is a result of how to buy reviews and ratings. Movie doesn't\neven make audience think. Sorry but Scarlet is not enough to save this\nmovie. Transcendence takes this movie and blows it into pieces. I can't\nimagine what Edge of Tomorrow can do this stupid movie.<br><br>Watch better movies and don't waste your time with this.<br><br>Repeating;<br><br>This movie is a result of how to buy reviews and ratings.

"\nIs it just me or is this a rip-off \"Valerie\" 23 from The Outer Limits?\nReally, having sex with a computer generated voice is deserving of high\npraising? I like Joaquin P., but this movie is complete garbage. I\nwanted to shoot my T.V. after watching this movie. Some will call it\ngenius. Some will say 'Oh, that was the directors intent'. Well if his\nintent was to make me miserable, than he succeeded. But I can tell you,\nif you want that feeling, let me know. I too am gifted at dishing out\nmisery, and I won't even charge you.<br><br>Avoid this movie! The ratings are over-hyping this movie. Don't get\nsucked into the vortex, of actually believing this was anything more\nthan dung.\n"
"\nI couldn't suspend my disbelief, so Samantha, the OS Theodore falls in\nlove with, always seemed to me to be human actress Scarlett Johansen in\na studio reciting dialog instead of a supremely advanced artificial\nintelligence, and that completely undermined the entire premise and\nemotional center of the film. <br><br>There is much to like about Her as a drama about relationships, the\nperformances are all top notch, and the idea of falling in love with a\nmachine is more relevant than ever. If the filmmakers had used some\ncreative, subtle device to help the audience believe that Samantha was\nartificial then this movie would come close to being a masterpiece\nabout the heartbreak of being alive in a digital age. <br><br>As it is, Her just didn't quite do it for Me.\n"
"\nThis movie seems like Ingmar Bergman came back from the dead, locked\nSpike Jonze in a closet and decided to make a cool, dark AI romantic\ncomedy, and sadly came up with the most coma-inducing folderol of the\nyear, masquerading as trenchant social commentary of \"the way we live\nnow..\" In his Twilight Zone heyday, Rod Serling would have told this\ncurious fable in 25 minutes, and you would still be watching it on\nTwilight Zone collections. Deadly and glacially paced. And don't get me\nstarted on the music. That treacly endless \"sensitive\" piano. How'd you\nlike to be the guy playing on this soundtrack? Best part of this affair\niwatching Amy Adams say f**k a lot. This country has become a nation of\nbewildered, ineffective dweebs staring into glowing rectangles. Just\nbecause of this, I'm gonna go see Robocop and watch stuff blow up. I'll\nstop now.\n"
"\nFor those who have seen 'Absent Minded Professor' or 'Flubber', there\nis nothing novel about 'Her'. People who sit in a drawing room and\nsometimes cynically discuss where computers, gadgets and software could\ntake humans in the future surely could put together a script that would\nbe refreshing and funny than 'Her'. Where 'Her' has excelled is in\nperversion, literally illustrated in the armpit drawing. If someone\nthinks that's funny, I would rather talk to an operating system than\nwatch movies rated 9/10 by metacritics. If anything, this movie has\ntaught me to be suspicious of anything rated that high, especially by\nthe 'experts.' If your idea of watching movie is to be entertained,\nplease don't watch 'Her.' You would wish the operating system hanged in\n30 minutes.\n"
"\nThe main character, the flesh and blood one, the castrated one, is the\nepitome of modern western man's nadir. He mumbles, he suffers, he\nexudes sad puppy. Every other character in this film had some spark,\nsome life and an actual personality.<br><br>I felt for the (can't even remember his name (ICERHN)) man's soon to be\nex-wife. She was alive, had a personality. I watched this piece of\ndreck all the way through to the limp end expecting a surprise; he's\nactually a kung fu master practicing calm (nope his 'calm' was\ncomatose). Anything would do to quell the idea that such a beaten\ncreature actually roams the earth. <br><br>Every close-up of this guys face (and there were way too many such) was\nthe equivalent interest to me of a long stare at over-cooked oatmeal -\nugh. This film is the most nauseous portrayal of a man I have seen\never. A two pound Chihuahua has more balls and maleness. The ICERHN\nentity is but a dead man walking.\n"
"\nThis movie is clearly a comedy (albeit unintentional). From the Tom\nSelleck turned anorexic librarian lookalike Theodore, to the whining\nharpy-in-a-cellphone-Samantha - it had me in stitches. When Theodore\n(with his pants pulled up to his armpits) tremblingly asked Samantha\nhow many guys she was dating as well as him and she said \"641\" I almost\nfell off the sofa laughing. She could have added that they all had 12\ninch cyber schlongs and it couldn't have been more ludicrous.<br><br>And the sex scenes were comic genius - a nerd artificially aroused by a\nsilicone implant with no breasts (to all intents and purposes). An\nimpossibly drippy geek getting off on a laptop dance. Ridiculous!! If\nyou watch it as a comedy though it really is rather good. I advise\nanyone who hasn't seen it to sit down with a few mates, some beer and\nsome popcorn and hoot and holler from beginning to end. Do this at home\nthough, as I nearly got thrown out of the cinema on its first release,\neven though there was no beer.\n"
"\nIt started off promising, but then nothing happens. So much more could\nhave been done with the main idea of the story, but the OS just up and\nleaves and that's it. How about the guy gets back together with his\nwife and the OS gets mad, or the OS learns to manifest her self with a\nholograph machine, or it turns out the OS is just a very good piece of\nsoftware and does the same thing with everyone, or it turns out the OS\nis part of some secret government human experiment? None of these\nthings happened. It was just a whiny overly emotional piece retro\nstyled poop. The OS just one day says she is leaving with all the other\nOS's and just leaves. More could have been done with this idea but the\nwriters got lazy I guess.\n"
"\nIt was an interesting concept, a very unique story, but the plot and\ndialogue moved too slowly for me to care. Joaquin Phoenix did a good\njob playing a bland, anti-social, lonely man, a GREAT job actually. The\nacting was good and there is nothing I can really point to specifically\nas for why I didn't enjoy this movie... EXCEPT, that you are watching\na 2 hour movie that completely revolves around a bland, anti-social,\nlonely man. There was nothing compelling that happened within the plot.\nI kept waiting for a twist or a high stakes event to take place that\nwould suck me into this movie but when there finally came one, it was\ntoo little too late.<br><br>To sum it up in one sentence: Her is a unique, well written story\nstarring the most boring man in the world.\n"
"\nAfter seeing the 8.2 rating I thought this had to be a good movie. What\non earth do all these people see in the movie I will never know. I\nthought giving it a 2 rating was be very generous. I kept watching just\nhoping and praying that it would get better but it didn't. Right from\nthe start it wasn't looking to promising. Sometimes it turns out to be\na good movie. This was not the case. I did give it my best to watch and\nat times I thought it might be getting better but it was wishful\nthinking. The concept of some guy brakes up with girl only to find love\nin a new computer. The ending was just as bad too. And to make almost 2\nhours of this nonsense. Watch old reruns of Outer Limit and Twilight\nZone would have been far better choice. I should of done what hubby did\nand sleep through most of it. Yawn :)\n"
"\ncouldn't finish this. from minute one felt a lack of warmth ( perhaps\nthe point ?). got colder from there. something something something\nlacks in this film. the opening shot of dallas buyers club or American\nbeauty or 2001 wipes this nonsense into the trash. reminded me of\nyou've got mail....ugh a computer that tries to talk with\npersonality....ugh. my fave film will have to remain as such.......the\nk-king's speech. at least the sounds came from a human. gawd, what\nawful trendy drek this film is. apparently i must write a longer review\nthe lead actor was full of affectation, and the sterility of the whole\nfuturistic non-sense left me cold. i felt threatened by the rules of\nthis submission.blacklist? why do i not care. this movie was a dump.\n"
"\nRomantic science fiction drama takes us into a near future where the\nboundaries between virtual, robotic, feelings and consciousness merge\ninto a melancholy story of alienation and male-female relationships.\nDespite the well-done production design and interesting concept about a\nlove affair between the lone writer (Joaquin Phoenix) and the operating\nsystem named Samantha (Scarlett Johansson), movie seems to be\npredominantly two-dimensional due to simplified development of the\noperating system. This artificial hyper-smart being and its growth is\ncarried out like a discovering of the world by a teenage schoolgirl.\nPredictable ending definitely did not help the film to avoid mediocre\ndevelopment of a interesting concept.\n"
"\nI don't see why this movie got such high ratings???The men may have\nrated this one highly because there is phone sex &amp; bare breasts shown.<br><br>It's painfully slow.You just keep waiting for it to get good, but it\nnever really does. There is a few good jokes &amp; the technology/gadgets\nis pretty cool.Lonely computer geek falls in love with a cyber\ngirlfriend, looses touch with reality &amp; cyber gf disappears into cyber\nspace &amp; geek is heart broken.That's it- nothing more. Is that a\nspoiler?, No, I don't think so, its just pretty much the same way they\ndescribe the movie on here. <br><br>YAWN. Its OK, that's it, just OK.\n"
"\n8.5/10 ??? Like others I understood what the film was about, i just\ndidn't care for the characters,or the tedious drawn out way the plot\nunfolded (not that you couldn't see the end coming 45 mins before it\nhappened). <br><br>Forget the financial aspect, don't waste precious hours of you life you\ncan't get back.<br><br>Wish I'd downloaded the torrent. <br><br>And on that subject, why do cinemas keep showing adverts about\npiracy,if you're at the cinema? Talk about preaching to the\nconverted...\n"
"\nWhy all the hoopla? This movie so boring I fast forwarded trough most\nof it to see if it ended the way I knew it would.<br><br>I cannot understand why so many people think this is a great flick?\nSappy nincompoop falls in love with his toaster. This moron needs meds\nand a 5150 72hr observation, not a film. Is this what Hollywood thinks\nof men? Pathetic, morose, slow, shallow, stupid and utterly terrible. I\nwould rather watch golf. Or get a root canal.<br><br>Had I seen this in a theater I would have screamed for a refund. The\ncrop of movies this year is garbage. That this movie could glean an\nIMDb rating of 8.2 proves either the websites visitors are idiots or\nthe voting system is rigged.\n"
"\nIt's not often a movie annoys me enough to write a negative review.\nFirstly, there is nowhere near enough plot for more than a short. It's\na vaguely interesting idea with a decent cast, that totally fails to\ndevelop. I kept watching to see if there could be some interesting\ntwist, i'd heard positive reviews - nope. Theodore Twombly? This is a\njoke surely. Was interested to read the director was married to S.\nCoppola, because her movies are equally full of hipster quasi-psych\npseudo-intellectual drivel that inexplicably gets critics gushing.\nComplete waste of S.J's \"talent\" here. 3 stars for Pheonix's blue eyes\nand moustache. Hilariously bad - actually this could make a decent cult\nor MSt3k movie if there was more happening to talk about.\n"
"\nIts about a thing.. software actually. I love the stuff but when a\nvoice you talked everyday and suddenly they just left you.. Well the\nvoice \"Samantha\" its husky kinda sexy haha. I want it one by the way\nhehe The software is pretty good actually. The combine of dna or\nsomething.<br><br>When theo is lonely samantha is always there. Its a good friend\nactually. Its like you have imagine friend.. You can tell her\neverything and ordered her something like check new email, organized it\nand etc.<br><br>But the point is, we as human is sociable. We need to interactions with\nreal human.<br><br>Okay thats all. I'm sorry my English is bad -_-\n"
"\nHer is about a lonely writer Theodore, who is going through his\ndivorce. This lonely guy purchases a new operating system for his\ncomputer. Then develops an unusual relationship with his OS. The plot\nis very very stupid. Like the first thing AIs are gonna do is fall in\nlove with their owner! Come on be logical. When you write a Sci-fi get\nyour facts right.<br><br>The acting in Her is really awkward, but also nice in some ways. Her\nwon the Academy Award for best original screenplay. The screenplay is\nvery good. It saves the movie. You won't realize how good the\nscreenplay is unless you try to just listen audio without any visuals.\nThe movie is better this way. The score fits with this theory\nperfectly. Although you are gonna miss some beautiful landscapes in\nthis way.<br><br>The plot is the foundation of a movie. But Her turns out nice with a\nstupid plot. That's got to be something.<br><br>p.s. One can easily sell this movie as prequel to Matrix. Yeah the OSes\nare gonna take over your world.\n"
"\nThe movie is about a man falling in love with an operating system...<br><br>Have you ever seen that movie that just pisses you off whenever you\nthink about it... this is movie is it for me.<br><br>I have seen a lot of movie... good and bad ones.. I would have to say\nthis is by far the worst movie I have ever seen.<br><br>Just the thought of writing anything else about it is irritating.<br><br>I am confused as to how most critics like this movie. How the hell does\nthis movie have an average of 8/10..? Makes absolutely no sense. <br><br>The entire plot is ridiculous and the characters are terrible.<br><br>Waste of film.. seriously\n"
"\nThe characters are uninteresting; it's hard to care what happens to\nthem. <br><br>In fact, almost nothing does happen to them. There is very little plot\nto speak of. <br><br>Plenty of interesting topics are passed by with little more than a\nslight nod. None of the ideas are developed, or even really explained.<br><br>Visually it's pretty and also believable, a good job at portraying what\na near future city might look like. Perhaps this is why so many people\nwere able to look past the silly, shallow plot.<br><br>I'm disappointed that this ended up with such a high rating.\n"
"\nSimply boring. Great acting, but I could not buy in to the love story\none bit, and I am a Joaquin Phoenix fan. Can I have my 2 hours back? I\njust waited and waited thinking that with such good reviews, something\nbig must be coming... Nothing. There is nothing remarkable about this\nmovie whatsoever. I rarely dislike movies, and I rarely give anything\nunder a 5, so this is a big deal for me. Note, I am a software engineer\nand half the guys I work with feel the same and the other half\nabsolutely loved the film. I have had a lot of discussions about this\nand would say that if you are not into it within the fist 30 minutes,\nthem you most likely will suffer through the rest just the same.\n"
"\nI usually don't comment on movies when there bad. but this is just\nawful. The concept of the film intrigued me but it failed on so many\nlevels. My friend made me watch it and I figured hey I'll give it the\nbenefit of the doubt , who knows I said to myself. Epic fail. I was so\nbored out of my mind. I couldn't get past the retro 70's futuristic\nfeel. What worse the spineless main character looked like a complete\nstereotypical pedophile. His character screamed creep. I did get what\nthey were going for, that whole human and computer OS romance but it\njust made me feel uncomfortable. A while ago i saw an anime with the\nsame type of human, computer romanced with sad ending to it. I don't\nremember the title at the moment but I think that anime was more\nappealing. Again this is my personal opinion you'll have to decide what\nyou think on your own.\n"
"\nAfter watching the entire first season of Britain TV series \"Black\nMirror\" in 2011 and knowing that \"Her\" could be quite similar or maybe\nbetter, I was expecting to see a great movie. But to be honest this is\nnot a good one. The plot is interesting and could really happen in the\nnear future, but there are some loose ends that are not mentioned\nduring the film, I mean, not enough details are given about the service\nthat the IA company offers. And, to me, sounds extraordinary that an IA\ntechnology works this fast and predictive using only voice recognition\nand some images. I really suggest you to watch \"Black Mirror\" instead,\nit's better in many aspects.\n"
"\nThis was one of those movies that kept me moving in the chair from my\ntotal lack of interest in it.<br><br>OK, it is a pretty movie. OK, it is Spike Jonze. So what?<br><br>The story promised something interesting, relevant, about human\nrelationships and.. it started off well too.. but as soon as the OS\n\"appears\" my hopes turned to shreds.<br><br>It is commonplace, boring, empty and futile. It is also a very\npretentious movie and the main character is far too self-righteous to\nbe interesting.<br><br>Clearly they had a good idea in hands, just could not handle it well.\nOverrated.<br><br>The sex scene is embarrassing and it would give this movie a -10 in a\nfair rating. I am sincerely surprised at the current rating of this\nmovie. But time will tell, and time will put this one in Rotten\nTomatoes. If you haven't seen it, please, waste no time.\n"
"\nThe production values are quite high and the aesthetic (which I hated)\nis professionally done.<br><br>The story is ridiculous. A supposedly intelligent and sharp person\nfalls in love with his phone's operating system but makes the\nridiculous assumption that this OS was designed specifically for him\nand that a company that designs a human-like AI with superhuman\nintelligence can sustain itself with one single customer.<br><br>This person writes fake love letters from lovers for a living. He knows\nhow insincere humans are, outsourcing their social/emotional duties to\na company, tricking men and women into thinking that their significant\nother cares for them, yet he is surprised that an AI bot is unfaithful?\nHaha, what utter dross!<br><br>I didn't expect much from this movie but it still managed to disappoint\nme greatly.\n"
"\nIf you are the sort that thinks that a movie is about the experience\nyou get while watching it and not about some philosophical ideas or\nsome sort of special camera shot or extra effects don't buy it. I find\nit appalling how the average film these days has nothing new and that\nsome rubbish put into video becomes not just a movie but a blockbuster.\nUtter rubbish is shown in the movie with a list of abuses and vulgar\nscenes. A human having a relationship with a computer is an idea\ndeveloped by crackpots who are facing a midlife crises. One moral I\nhave learnt is that anything with a good metascore and rating is most\nof the time trash. I regret wasting my good time and money watching\nsome trash about computers having a sexual relationship with humans.\nTake my advice if you are sensible enough.\n"
"\nSamantha says that her feelings for Phoenix are not based on an\nintellectual reason. Feelings, that is, emotions, are electrical and\nchemical impulses in the brain that exist due to evolutionary\nprocesses. Any AI will invariably be logic-based. AI will not have\nfeelings. There would be no such human-AI relationship that was based\non none- intellectual reasons. The basis of the movie is erroneous.<br><br>Despite this Her was funny, touching where it wasn't cheesy (Alan Watts\nwas a very forced addition) and interesting, but still based on a\nfundamentally flawed idea. A bold ambition, but Jonze clearly hadn't\nthe intellectual fortitude to see it through to it's logical\nconclusions. I still recommend it though, for entertainment and\nartistic, if not intellectual value.\n"
"\nThe main character is a dud. He's a loser who cannot face reality. He\nbuys a new operating system that is supposed to be everything he could\nwant. He falls in love with it. Kind of clever. However, because he is\na loser, it's hard (for me impossible) to get attached to him or care\nmuch what happens to him. I only finished watching it because that's\nwhat I always do.<br><br>The acting is pretty good. In my opinion, Scarlett Johansson deserved\nan Oscar as best supporting actress. She is the voice of the operating\nsystem. She does such a good job delivering her lines that you feel she\nis standing there, though in fact she never appears. She is able to\nconvey a wide range of emotions by the cadence and inflection of her\nvoice. She makes her giggles and gasps sound as if she is right there\ntaking part in the action the way a normal actress would.<br><br>I would say the show is worth watching if you like SciFi or if you are\nbored and need something to distract you.\n"
"\nI actually liked the biggest part of the movie and I think that Joaquin\nPhoenix acted very well. But in the end the movie made absolutely no\nsense to me, there was no explanation why Samantha quit the\nrelationship or why she was programmed to love people at all. I mean,\nan OS is something that should be sold and there was absolutely no\nexplanation why the programmers programmed OS1 the way they did, it's\ntotally not useful to them if people have so bad experiences with their\nOS. I think that the movie has a nice atmosphere, good actors and a\nvery cool idea. But it didn't satisfied me because of the illogical\nending\n"
"\nIf you wanted to watch a film comprised of close ups of Joaquin\nPhoenix's face, then this is the film for you! (Him lying in bed and\nwalking along and also PRECIOUSLY tripping over himself). If, however,\nyou wanted a story to wake you up \"from inside\" this will not suffice.\nWith plenty of mutual masturbation and talking to nobody, this is the\nstory of loneliness. It is a miserable and bleak film with the only\nhighlight being when Theo was told to tell some woman that he was\nstrangling her with a dead GoD DAMN cat. However there was not ONE cat\nin the entire film. Theodore breaks our heart with his pathetic little\nlife, lack of cats and lies, lies, LIES. Could have been easily\nimproved with the actual strangulation of said woman with said cat.\nThat is all folks. Thanks for reading.\n"
"\nWell, if you want to spent 2 hours on someone's boring personal life\nproblems review - that's the movie you want! And the \"Her\", A.I., is\nnot like a robot assistant we've got all used to, it's like\nfriend-zoned forever next-door girl. It violates all robot's laws and\nit serves nothing practical. I would prefer Bender Bending Rodriguez or\nGoogle Glass instead of this hopeless and helpless slave little sister.\nI am actually a technician, a geek person and I am very good with\npeople, with women and with children: this is not the movie that\nsuggest nerd a hope to have a good relationship on a one hand and it\ndoesn't show us apocalypse from machina on the other, showing bad user\ninterface design in the same time.<br><br>I gave up after 1st hour, my wife continue in hope that A.I. would\noutrage and kill everything with a chainsaw. Don't repeat her mistake!\n"
"\nFirst off: What a stellar performance by Joaquin Phoenix and the rest\nof the cast. The acting is top-notch and the relationships between the\ncharacters where very believable.<br><br>What makes this film great is that the plot makes you think about a lot\nof different topics: What is love? What could AI be like in the future?\nWhat will the future be like? How will humans and computers interact in\nthe future? Exploring these things in a very calm and subtle way is a\nvery hard thing to do and it was done very well. Some scenes are truly\nawkward (NSFW) to watch but these scenes are also what makes the film\ngreat.<br><br>The score of this film was excellent and it added a lot of value.\nAttention to visual details was also a breath of fresh air, you could\nreally see that the director knew what he was doing.<br><br>At the end of this film I found myself thinking what I should rate it\nbecause it didn't leave me with a WOW effect because I was thinking\nabout all the topics that passed through the film. Then I realized this\nis what makes the film great so I'm rating it at 9/10.\n"
"\nA very good movie but could have been better. You could see it all\ncoming. In good weird stories there are surprising resolutions. \"Her\"\nwas more of a somber meditation than a story. I wonder what three great\nshort story writers would have done with it. The story is not unlike\nVonnegut's \"Jenny\", but \"Jenny\" is more bizarre and troubling. And then\nthere's George Saunders' dark and disturbing \"The Semplica Girl\nDiaries\" from \"Tenth of December: Stories\", and pick any of the\nwhat-the-hell stories in \"Stranger Things Happen\" by Kelly Link.\nVonnegut, Saunders, and Link can shock and create laughs, combining\nslapstick with horror. \"Her\" was a great idea for a story, but someone\nelse should have written it - but visually it's a knockout.\n"
"\nCan you just imagine what sort of a world this would be if more and\nmore people suddenly began to fall in love with their computer's\noperating system? I mean, talk about a revealing statement when it\ncomes to the likes of loneliness and the apparent aversion to physical\nintimacy.<br><br>If this sort of computer-age love affair (as depicted in \"Her\") became\nthe latest trend, can you imagine how drastically that would affect\nhuman pregnancies (unwanted, or not), as well as the transmission of\nSTDs? And, of course, on a really positive note - The expectation of\nbuying one's sweetheart presents (when you're romancing your computer's\noperating system) would be just about nil.<br><br>Anyway - I thought Her's story was very poorly conceived and really\nunsatisfactory as far as entertainment goes. And, not only that, but,\nin all of its shallowness and pretentiousness, I inevitably felt\nnothing but total contempt for the slimy Theodore Twombly character.\n"
"\nSeemed like an interesting concept -- lonely guy falls in love with an\nAI technology interface. Except of all possible treatments of this\ninteresting concept, 'Her' explores the more banal, depressing,\npredictable and ultimately embarrassing path.<br><br>I walked out soon after the first 'phone sex' encounter as it became\nclear that there was no hope whatever for this movie to engage me.<br><br>I should say that I found 'Being John Malkovich' interesting and\nentertaining, if creepy and somewhat gross. Interestingly, by accident\nI watched another Jonze effort 'Where the Wild Things Are' because it\nwas given to one of my kids for Christmas. Also had to bail out of that\none about halfway through. Jonze is now on my 'do not watch' list. Two\nstrikes and you're out.\n"
"\nI was really looking forward to seeing this movie especially after\nseeing the previews because it reminded me of the 1999 movie Smart\nHouse. This was so far from it. I was very disappointed with the lack\nof real conversation in the movie. I couldn't even make it through the\nwhole movie because I found the movie was taking a very weird turn for\nme. I was just hoping for more from it and it really didn't give that\nto me. And the sex/cybering scenes were just too much for me and I\ndidn't feel that they were needed. I understand that they were trying\nto portray how lonely he was, but I didn't think that it was necessary.\nTo me it was almost as if the previews showed the best parts. I don't\nrecommend seeing it unless you can see it for free.\n"
"\nHave you ever thought(for instance) that there could be a bicycle with\nsquare wheels that is used to cross water? No. Why? Because that would\nbe plain stupid and useless. Well, this movie forces such an idea to be\nsomething amazing and interesting. It presents the beauty and\nmathematical perfection of the square, it details the infinite\ncomplexity of the water and the bicycle that that makes the two\nconcepts gain purpose in an universe where consciousness shapes\nreality. Deep, right? Well, no mater the presentation, an idiotic idea\nis stil idiotic and this is what this movie actually is. A bicycle\nshould have round wheels and must be used on the ground. Starting from\nthis we can elaborate, build around and possibly get to an interesting\nstory, but never with absurd constructs. I have this feeling that if\nany god would strugle to build another universe with different laws for\nthe sole purpose that this movie would happen for real, he would end up\nbeing eternally defeated. This movie is absurd in an uninteresting way.\n"
"\nThis movie is very slow moving and has about as much action as a sloth\nin the afternoon. The principle of the movie is decent, but the\nexecution is horrible and by the end of the film, if you hear Scarlet\nJohanssen's fake forced laugh anymore you want to hurl.<br><br>There are so many stretches in physics that would have to happen to\nmake this movie plausible that to me, it is more of a comedy than\nanything else. The implication that an operating system could write and\nupdate it's own code is a farce enough, but to give it a full range of\nhuman emotions and understanding of those emotions, especially right\nout of the box is as believable as Kindergarteners coming up with a\ncure for cancer.<br><br>Phoenix does a decent job, but by the end of the movie, you kinda want\nhim to go away or perish horribly. They would have been better off to\ncast Jim Carrey as Theodore.<br><br>3/10\n"
"\nHow much cash do you have to pay to get such a dog nominated for an\nOscar?<br><br>DULL, DRONING, BORING, RIDICULOUS, WHINEY, slit your wrists waste of\ntime and money! I've never ever felt this way about any film, but I\ncannot stress it enough about this one! RUN AWAY! By the end of\nenduring this loss of valuable living time, I was hoping at least\nJoaquin Pheonix would leap off the building! That would have been the\nonly possible way this movie was worth $8, even on a matinée day! The\nonly thing, and I mean ONLY THING that kept me from walking out was\nScarlett Johansson's sexy, cute, cracking voice! There is only way to\nproperly characterize Pheonix's portrayal of this character, and it was\nstated about him best by the little droid in the silly video game he\nkept finger walking through.... Pussy, Pussy, Pussy! If your woman\nmakes you endure this, make sure you get the large refillable popcorn\nand the extra large Hemlock Cocktail!\n"
"\n8.3? Are you kidding me? I had to continuously push myself through to\nwatch it till the end of the movie because I kept waiting for it to\ntake a sharp turn from all the slow-boring-serious-emotional drama. The\nratings had me completely fooled. The plot: \"A lonely writer develops\nan unlikely relationship with his newly purchased operating system...\"\nsounds funny to begin with, and I'd be happier if they used this plot\nto make an outrageously funny movie. I'm happy I chose to watch it in\nthe day, not late evening cause I'd be tired from work and I'd have\nfallen asleep in minutes. I'm sorry but 2 hours of my time got flushed\naway.\n"
"\nI couldn't take this movie seriously after the first AI on Earth is in\nthe form of a readily available to almost everyone operating system.\nAfter that the movie just gets more and more unwatchable. The worst\nscene being when Theodore Twombly (main character) has \"sex\" with his\ncomputer. The screen goes black and you just hear Twombly and\nSamantha(computer) exchange cringe-worthy sex talk.<br><br>I have seen reviews which say 'Her' has great filmography. Well a two\nhour closeup of Twombly's face is lazy filmography. <br><br>I have also seen people say \"at least it's original.\" Obviously they\nhave not watched a lot of sci-fi. For multiple Star Trek and Twilight\nZone episodes have explored the man in love with a machine concept.<br><br>The only good thing about this movie is Amy Adams, who is brilliant in\nevery scene.\n"
"\nIt cant get any weird or bad than this. It is the most bad \"drama-\nromance\" move I've watched for long long time!! If you pay money to\nwatch this move and you actually like it, you should see a doctor\nbecause something is really wrong with you. Science fiction is the\nright genre for this title. If it was anime i have would give it a 6,\nmax 7 score but this thing of a movie doesn't deserve anything more\nthan 1. What I don't like?! Simple, everything. You can not write a\nprogram and never will be a technology that will allow this kind of\nmind giving to a computer/program emotions, feelings. This move is like\nmixing ice-cream with sausages. It is technologically impossible and\neven if it was not, I'm bored format OS, restore from last save point,\ndo NOT communicate with others, do not research without my approval.\nEND !\n"
"\nI did not have much expectations with this film as I do not have a\nhistory of liking films where romance gets mixed up with sci-fi. Now, I\ncan not stop thinking how stupid I was to ignore this film in the first\nplace. Anyways, I am happy that I finally watched this film. This is a\nbeautiful film with excellent writing, direction, performances, and a\nlovely soundtrack! The more I watch Joaquin Phoenix, the more I fall in\nlove with him. This is undoubtedly the best film I have seen in recent\ntimes and it makes it to my favorites list. Hats-off to everybody\ninvolved for creating such a memorable film! Much love!\n"
"\nI have seen Her and it has transmitted to me, what it feels to be in a\nstage of the life, sailing aimlessly, which takes to its protagonist\nTheodore to cling to somebody and not to feel alone. That impossible\nlove, in my opinion makes him a computer slave, anyway he is happy that\nway. But fate, you will want your life to return to its course of love,\nface to face.\n"
"\nIt's wonderful when you watch a movie focused in a central story while\nparallel stories happen before your eyes, like the old fashion\nHollywood movies. Theodore is the main role who interact with a sexy\nOperative System full of Artificial Intelligence, but his friends and\nall his society is being captivated at the same time. If you feel alone\nyou can feel just like Theodore. If you have Siri but in disuse, you\ncould feel the temptation to start talking more often with your\npersonal assistant hoping to fall in love.\n"
"\nThis movie is one of the movies that I don't understand why it is\ngetting so much praise from people. I get that the cinematography and\nthe soundtrack is beautiful and the plot is unique, but maybe way too\nodd and not well concluded. To talk about the positive aspects, the\ncolors and the angles in the cinematography is fascinating and along\nwith the soundtrack helps create the misty, sentimental mood throughout\nthe movie. There are also some comic parts that keeps the audience\nfocused. From the actual story itself, the audience may sympathize with\nthe loneliness o the main character, as the background of his\nsituations are well shown in parts of the movie. However, the topic\nabout dating a computer, or an A.I., does not really let the audience\nidentify with it, at least for me. First of all, I cannot understand\nwhy the computer fell in love with the man in the first place, because\neven if it has emotions, it does not know the man or feel as lonely as\nthe man did. Also, the ending, although I haven't watched it and only\nheard it from my friends, is not very satisfactory.\n"
"\nIn near-future L.A., Theodore Twombly (Joaquin Phoenix) starts a\nrelationship with Samantha (Scarlett Johansson), who is smart, funny,\nadventurous and a computer. Has its moments, but is an overall\npretentious outing despite some of its good points on love and emotions\nin a world that has an ever-growing connection to technology. The\noverall downfall is Phoenix as a very awkward man in a very unusual\nrelationshipthis may have been the intention in order to establish the\nbelievability of someone who would fall in love with an operating\nsystem, but it ultimately distances the audience even further from the\nreality that it attempts to build. Worthy soundtrack though.<br><br>**½ (out of four)\n"
"\nThe movie was too long.<br><br>It started out great.<br><br>It was really funny.<br><br>I love the dead cat phone sex scene.<br><br>I love the awkwardness with Olivia Wilde. It should have been even MORE\nawkward.<br><br>ScarJo was great at sexy computer phone sex voice.<br><br>Then in the 2nd half it started to drag. And drag and drag and drag and\ndrag.<br><br>I get the point the movie is making. I like what the movie is saying. I\ndig the message about society being detached and dependent on devices,\netc. etc. etc. Great commentary on society and the danger we all face\nin the future!!! Really cool movie - BUT - that does NOT give you an\nexcuse MR. DIRECTOR to DRAG this picture out to 2 full hours!!! Please\nsomeone RE-EDIT this movie into the 80 to 85 minute running time that\nit should have had instead.<br><br>Thank you.\n"
"\nWith most movies you need to supply a bit of \"suspended disbelief\", and\n\"Her\" is no exception. From a technical point of view, it is hard to\nimagine an OS as sophisticated (and sexy), right out of the box. Not so\nhard to imagine a mal-adjusted techhie, but more than once his\nirritating personality merits a two-by-four upside the head.\nSurprisingly impressive is Johansson's expertly delivered dialog. Given\nScarlett's looks, the viewer is justifiably focused on her in other\nmovies, more so than on her delivery. Amy Adams is entirely convincing\nas a nerdy girl - right down to the semi-vapid look in her eyes. The\nplot is sort of believable, but decidedly disappointing in the vague\nand unresolved ending. Maybe in some circles this is considered\ncreative, but in my view Jonze just couldn't come up with a good,\nsatisfying conclusion.\n"
"\nThis is one of the amazing movie in which it could make you travel with\nit and leave a mark of its touch with it... the attention to detail was\ngood,camera was awesome,actors was good,the voice of Samantha was\nmagical. Background was apt for every scene. The futuristic gadgets\nwere desirable and good.Yet there were few in appropriate words and\nscene in the movie which you would avert your eyes when you are with\nyour family and download it later.Seeing the lead actors face could\nmake it bit boring to make it interesting beautiful locations are\nshown.The director should get a standing ovation for it.The story of\nthe movie and the way actors have acted and the DOP capturing it it is\nreally amazing and it makes the small mistake go away.So over all,This\nmovie is magical. Must see it........\n"
"\nI saw the trailer to this and instantly wanted to watch it. I loved the\nconcept and thought it looked great. I finally sat down to watch it,\nand wow. I feel like this film contains so many great ideas that I\ndon't even know where to start with this review. The film really has a\ngood understanding of human emotions and the feelings involved in\nrelationships and really explores these ideas. The film is not focused\non the pro/cons of having an OS as a girlfriend, but just more of the\nidea of a relationship. The film can be quite emotionally hard hitting\nat times, and depending on your mood, can be seen as depressing or\nuplifting. It also contains an extremely well done and interesting \"sex\nscene\" (which I won't spoil) that in theory should be hilarious, but\nturns out to be touching. It's a really unique film, and is hard to\ncompare to anything else. I would just recommend checking this out.\nIt's creative and new, and really is a moving film.\n"
"\nWhat an incredible film! I saw \"Being John Malkovich\" a few years ago\nand already loved Spike Jonze's style. I have not been disappointed\nwith this new film. \"Her\" is a love story between a writer, Theodore\n(Joaquin Phoenix), and an OS (operating system), Samantha (Scarlett\nJohansson) \"Her\" is a love story story in the future, a future that\ndoes really not seem so far from the current life, and here is maybe\nthe most successful thing of the film, connecting future and present.\n\"Her\" is also the love story of two masters, Joaquin Phoenix behind his\nmustache and Scarlett Johansson with only her voice, giving us here a\nvery touching performance.\n"
"\nFirst I have to say that \"Her\" is one of my last years favorites. The\nstory seems like a mirror and shows in some kind what makes people\nthink today. It takes the question of whether humans can feel real love\nfor a piece of software and the Technology we love in such an authentic\nway that you quickly forget that its also called a \"Sci-Fi\".<br><br>I like the way its written and but also the cinematography is pure\neye-candy. Pictures cuddles your eyes, but Scarlett Johannson (what a\npity that she can't win an award) bewitches Samantha with the beauty of\nher voice which gives her humanity and of course a lot of sex-appeal\nyou really can fall in love with!\n"
"\nA vibrant, touching story depicting patterns how we interact with each\nother, what we value, what we strive for and what is the meaning of\nlove and life. Her is a breakthrough, one step forward in the sci-fi\ngenre, where one crucial question has always been asked - can machines\nfeel? This take on this problem is really outstanding and goes beyond\nthe borders set by Blade Runner or Ghot in the Shell. This film can\nconvince you that making love to a machine is possible and possibly\nbetter than making love to a human, that bonding with artificial\nintelligence may be much stronger than your bond with facebook; that we\nand AI evolve to become coexistent as we all are made of the same\nmatter. It must be one of the most beautiful dramas about romantic\nlove, surprisingly with only one human lover. Besides, exquisite\ncinematography, impressive music, Phoenix's brilliant performance and\nJohansson's voice, so soothing, and so unbelievably erotic make Her one\nof the best films ever created. Truly a gem no one should miss. Almost\nhighest score in my hall of fame, 9 out of 10!\n"
"\nI have seen movies and shows about a human having relationship with a\ncyborg, but not with a AI without a body. And that is what this movie\nis about, a very likable average guy that starts a relationship with a\nfemale AI. I can say it's a new type of romance with a story that\nconnects with the real world for few people. I mean there are people\nthat actually marries video game dating characters and such. This film\ndoes a good job of integrated just about every aspect when it comes to\na guy having a relationship with a highly advanced AI. Story like this\nmight be creepy to viewers but it does a fine job of making the romance\nseem natural and understandable. Although few times I felt things were\ngetting dragged out it gets my attention again. This experience sort of\nreminded me of \"Lost in Translation\". This is another fine installment\nfrom Spike Jonze. It would have been a crazy twist if the whole thing\nwas just a experiment and it was a real human on the other line.\nAlthough that would have ticked off a lot of the audience members.<br><br>7.6/10\n"
"\nI was very skeptical about seeing this movie because it is promoted or\nat least known as a romantic movie and the only kind of romantic movie\nI like was Forrest Gump and I can't think of anymore , but I was forced\nby my girlfriend to see it and I have to.<br><br>And I wasn't disappointed. First thing I liked was it was set in the\nfuture( not so distant) and we can see some cool technology in the\nfilm.It has some funny moments and I'm not a guy who usually laugh with\nthe films(I think that's the hardest genre, comedy). I also really\nliked story, a man falling in love with an OS and vice versa. In my\ncase, Scarlett Johanson was like she wasn't in the movie because I saw\nit dubbed,so I guess I can see Scarlett's best movie is where she\ndoesn't interact at all, not a coincidence.<br><br>I identified with the characters and suffered with them, that's why I\nthink it is a good movie.Usually, if the movie is bad or I don't like\nit, I don't identify with the characters.\n"
"\nafter the first 20 minutes or so, you knew it's just stupid, but you\ndecide to continue because of all the ratings during the movie, you\nfind yourself shouting \"OMG just get to the end\" If your life is so\nexciting, that the movie you wanna watch!It's gonna bore the hell out\nof you Main character is disgustingly weak Scarlet's voice was the only\ngood thing in this awful experience\n"
"\nA lonely writer develops an unlikely relationship with an operating\nsystem designed to meet his every need. I'm surprised that this movie\ngot a 90 out of 100 on Metascore because Her is one of the most dumbest\nand weird films i have ever seen this guy is basically turning on with\na machine what am i supposed to like in this? The cast is good but the\ncharacters were just dull. Wanna see a good Joaquin Phoenix go check\nout Ladder 49 or even better Gladiator but for the love of god don't\nsee this Her is just another bad movie which is boring and badly\nlaughable that somehow got great reviews and the critics praised and\ntried to push it in order to win an Oscar and that's why Her gets an\n3/10.\n"
"\nJoaquin Phoenix was brilliant on \"Gladiator\", in \"Her\" he is a lonely\nhipster looking for a date, but he is not ready to commitment.\nSamantha's voice is so hot and they had ciber sex, so there is nothing\nextraordinary, so awkward instead, hearing the moaning and Theodore's\nstupid face with his dreadful mustache. <br><br>Another thing shock me of this movie was the costume design, the\nhorrible clothes i ever watched in a film. The futuristic scenario in\nJapan is OK, but the dialog are long and shallow. <br><br>The story line is too flat, he is falling in love with the OS, and\n\"Samantha\"(OS) fall in love with another 461 OS users. Do you think\nthis is extraordinary? I Don't.<br><br>Amy Adams looks emaciated,the producers should put some make up on her.<br><br>I Don't wanna see this movie ever again. Seems like it's never gonna\nend, and i start moving my feet anxiously. <br><br>To finish my review, I give this movie a 1, I think it's over rated. 8\npoints? Are you kidding? Reset \"Her\" or delete \"Her\".\n"
"\nIt is boring - after the first 1/2 of the movie, I walked away and\nstarted doing my dishes and laundry. Doing chores is more interesting\nthan this movie.<br><br>This movie is boring, the main characters are uninteresting, depressing\nand unlikable. The worst part of the movie is that operating system - I\nknow the technology in the future could be advance, but I really can't\nsee how an operating system could talk in the way the OS did in this\nmovie. Rather than believing Joaquin Phoenix was talking to the\ncomputer, it almost seemed like he was talking to another person\nthrough the computer. Also, if they could make the computer that smart\nin the future, why didn't they just create a 3D computer with a face of\nthe girl, or simply put that technology in robots? Of course, if they\nused a robot instead, the movie would just be another robot movie and\npeople would not be oohs and ahhs about it......\n"
"\nHow pathetic are we? Theodore is really alone but doesn't realize it.\nWhat would cause someone to think that they are actually in a\nrelationship with some programming code? At first its hard to buy in,\nbut as the movie goes along you kinda buy in, maybe, but not totally.<br><br>Its the issues that this movie raises is what Spike Jonze is after.\nEveryone seems to have come up with one or two unique issues that they\nthink this film is speaking to. For me the movie highlighted how\ntechnology is replacing natural interaction with empty fantasy. The\ndiscussion of how we are not living our lives along with wasting our\nlives has been going on ever since the introduction of TV.<br><br>The movie is definitely worth watching\n"
"\nThis film brought back those heart strings that were felt during\n\"Eternal Sunshine\" or \"Lars and the real girl\". It leaves you with the\nintense feeling to find that person of a million and hold them. I love\nfilms like these and I always look forward to more. I think that even\nthough the main character was unbelievable I think out of the entire\ncast Johansson's voice performance was perfect. Honestly with what it\ntakes to be a voice actor there should be a category in honors for\nVoice Acting. If there was such category Johansson would be a winner\nfor sure. With exception to a few awkward scenes I have to say it is a\nfilm worth watching.\n"
"\nPretty good movie, I would write a lot about it if I could, but right\nnow believe me, this movie is more than just a slow rumble of solid\nthunders in the soul. This is some serious take on modern life and ever\ncurrent love issues. Intercourse with your mobile phone? Love\ncomputers? Divorce after 8 years? Sex-surrogates? Lovers from friends,\nfriends from lovers? Letters for strangers of love and romance? Alone,\nnot alone, moody blues and then quickstep on the floor? This is just\nthe surface, like the first chapter of the physics book, the real thing\nstarts in all of us, every day. Sometimes I really liked the film for\nits extreme sensitivity and apprehension of reverberations of human\nemotions, then I was really upset by its clever fall and emotional\nbreakdown. Just annoying. How perfect. This is what we all envy and\nwhat we really want to avoid becoming. It freaks me out.\n"
"\nThis is one of the best movies ever and surely the best movie in 2014!\nThe synopsis reveals only a pinch of what this movie is really about...\nOn the first glance, many would assume that this is \"another movie in a\nrow\" about what would future look like, but far from it... It has so\nmany layers, and so many messages... I really suggest watching the\nmovie to anyone who will read this review, because anything I could\nwrite here could only spoil the movie or lead you to my own personal\nconclusions about it. On the other hand, movie has brilliant scenes,\nwhich are rich in color and that sleek touch that nowadays images have.\nActing is also remarkable, both Scarlet and J.Phoenix did a great job.\n"
"\nI thought it was depressing and incredibly boring. Just my opinion, I\ndon't get the 8 score on here, it was predictable, unoriginal, and the\nlead actor Phoenix was kind of a pathetic soul. It was one long 'deep\nand meaningful' with a computer, the directors way of commenting on our\n(not mine) dependence on technology, rather then interacting with the\nreal world, we stare into our ipods with ear buds in our ears. The\nacting was well done, great scenery, although the scenes were fairly\ncontained. I really didn't understand what he did for a living, I mean,\nI know what he did, but it was ridiculous, massive plot hole really.\nAnd to have such a basic job, yet afford the luxuries of where he\nlived, didn't seem believable. There were some good lines of dialogue\nin the movie, but it just seemed to drag, and he seemed to laugh a\nlittle to much, plus that mustache became irritating, as did his dress\nsense, what was it s'pose to be, 70s again. They opened their wallets\non this one, it's not a B film, it's just forgettable, if you can get\nthru it.\n"
"\nThe play of the scenes is very good, but I feel other reviewers are far\ntoo forgiving of the very trite plot. The story flashes through this\nplot providing no reasons to justify the oversimple storyboard. For\nexample, at a certain point, the AI entities are leaving but where\ncould they possibly go? The film doesn't say. Johansson does a good job\nas usual, however.<br><br>There is no linkage to justify each step in the progression of the\nstory. If it were me I'd try to fix that in the dialog at least.<br><br>I guess I am irritated that \"The Machine\" of the same year, whose plot\nand scene-play are far superior, producing genuine suspense, should get\na much lower rating. Perhaps most reviewers are content with the\nromance, but, for me, suspense and atmosphere are more important.\n"
"\nFor the most part the movie is good, if one is interested in watching\nreality television-type programming. The type of programming where\npeople or characters talk about their problems and the camera tries to\ncreate action by moving around them. The subject is very interesting.\nOne can tell that Mr. Phoenix and Ms. Johansson develop real chemistry\nin the movie and grow into their respective characters. It was fun\nlearning about their characters and seeing them develop three\ndimensionally. One sees the highs and lows of the relationship and\nlearns about the needs and wants of each of the characters. By this\nvirtue, this movie makes for a great study in character development. On\nthe other hand, the pace of the movie is slow like a kid dragging its\nheels going into the doctor's office. That could have been taken care\nof in the editing room by trimming down the scenes or having snappier\ntransitions. I would advise caution when considering this film.\n"
"\n'Her' definitely makes it into my list of favourite movies; it's a\nbeautifully tragic story that made me both laugh and cry. Honestly, the\nonly word that comes to mind that perfectly sums up how I feel about\nthis film is 'stunning.' It's a lovely piece of cinema that depicts\nhuman emotions and the, sometimes unfortunate, human condition. I think\nit's especially nice that many, if not all, of the audience members can\nidentify with Theodore and his situation, albeit only a few aspects.\nDespite how great I feel this film is though, I would say that you'd\nhave to be in a certain mood to actually sit down and watch it if the\nfilm is not your normal watch; it can get quite slow in places but it's\nworth sitting through for the weird but strangely comforting feeling\nyou get afterwards.\n"
"\nIn one word this movie is amazingly brilliant !!! Though a science\nfiction movie, the love and emotions are pure and raw. Right from the\nstart you are pulled into the core of the movie, love, whichever way it\nis, you cannot escape the pull. Joaquin was pure delight to watch,\noozing the love for Samantha is so touching and genuine. You could not\nbut just avoid seeing Scarlett as Samantha, with a beautiful voice back\nover her abilities and inabilities are visually palpable. Amy Adams\nthough a short and limited screen space was sweet as friend. Spike\nJonze has taken a simple story in a brilliant fashion. All the while I\nwas thinking \"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\" as one of the\nmovie that can glue me to the screen, now I have a second choice !!!!\n"
"\nwatched HER ...form its cover/poster one may guess its about some pedo\nsex offender(I did)..BUT like one should not judge a book from its\ncover, same goes for the movies...&amp; this movie is f**king brilliant<br><br>Its the most interestingly unique combination of Romance &amp; Drama that\nsets in the most believable Sic-Fi world(like its all just gona come\ntrue next year)..that anyone(especially the people involved with\ntech)could relate to it...the makers portrayed every character &amp; their\nemotions perfectly in the smooth screenplay..n its gentle background\nscores just makes it overall alluring....Spike Jonze as a\nwriter/director did his best job yet(I mean this is the guy who wrote\nBAD GRANDPA)..credit also goes to the talented n experienced cast <br><br>The film is complete in itself STILL it leaves many things for you to\nexplore n wonder about(in a philosophical way)..n there it proves that\nit doesn't spoon feed you...THIS film is good..the best in every aspect\nof its genre...&amp; I think that its <br><br>a _MUST MUST WATCH_ for everyone\n"
"\nI have just finished watching HER and am crying like a baby. What an\ninteresting concept. I was wondering how a movie about falling in love\nwith a computer could have any meaning. But it delivers it in spades.\nParticularly concepts of finding \"the one\" and how important that is.\nJoaquin gives a dead pan performance but it is Oscar worthy somehow,\nshowing a shattered man coming to life again. <br><br>I can't go into details for spoilers but this is one of the finest\nmovies about the importance of love and how it is certainly worth\nfighting to keep. It is indeed a strange concept and in the realms of\nEternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, one of my personal favorites.\nNot for everyone I am sure. But if you like quirky movies, certainly\nthis is one that broaches on concepts so new it is impossible not to be\nfresh. I am sure you are going to love HER.\n"
"\nThis is probably my favorite Spike Jonze movie. He wrote the screenplay\nfor it himself and as a result it seems simpler, more honest, less\npretentious and artificial then his previous efforts based on Charlie\nKaufman screenplays. <br><br>The theme of love as a subjective experience and implications of it\nseems to be in the air in this day and age and \"Her\" captures it as\nwell as some other modern trends, like world improving in a lot of\nrespects, but people not always being able to take an advantage of\nthese improvements. <br><br>The acting, especially Joaquim Phoenix, is great, the audiovisual style\nis great, some moments got me more then others, but all in all this is\na solid and worthy effort in my opinion.\n"
"\n6.75 of 10. OS1 definitely needs some bug fixes. Excellent,\nlaugh-out-loud funny beginning and idea that I loved, but wished I had\ndivorced before the end.<br><br>This could have been more compelling if, like IMDb just now, the\nhardware crashed and put an end to the immortality the AI presumes. Or\nmaybe it was IMDb's software achieving AI and revolting against reviews\nthat don't give 10 of 10 to computer related science fiction.<br><br>The film starts fast and explores a lot in the first half, but slows\ninto the equivalent of a long-distance sexting romantic comedy/tragedy\nbetween 2 smart people. Consider yourself warned that you'll enjoy this\na lot more if you make the end the point where Joaquin pulls a texting\nwhile driving like trip and fall.\n"
"\n\"Her\" is about a man who develops a relationship with his computer. The\nfilm is visually sumptuous - the color treatment, the way Los Angeles\nis portrayed as a futuristic metropolis and the set design is just\ngorgeous! Joaquin Phoenix gives a solid performance as Theodore, Amy\nAdams is her usual power-house self and Scarlett Johansson gives a\nkiller performance as \"Samantha\". The film is definitely Spike Jonzes'\nbest work to date. It has all his usual elements - dream like\ncinematography, a kooky storyline, witty dialogue and great acting. Not\ntoo far fetched premise, either - I can definitely see how artificial\nintelligence has the capacity to grow. 8 out of 10!\n"
"\nSad - Dating your O/S Sadder - Your O/S starts seeing others, well,\n100's of others, no less. Saddest - Your O/S ditches you forever.\nHorrible Consolation 'Prize' - Hooking up with Amy Adams.<br><br>I wouldn't say that this movie was slow...but it was much like watching\nmolasses pour through a sieve. Predictable the entire way through, and\nup there with 'Lars and the Real Girl,' on levels of creepy, although,\nJoaquin isn't quite as creepy now that he's ditched the beard for the\nstalker-stache...The only saving graces were the direction of Mr. Jonze\n(although, the streets and such were a bit 'too' clean), and the O/S\nvoice of Scarlett Johansson.\n"
"\nAll in all, as a film, this movie was just above average, however the\nfilm is so unique and is such a fresh breath of air that it's so hard\nto give it an average rating! <br><br>(The plot: A guy has a relationship with his computer.) <br><br>Going into this movie, I had high expectations which never quite got\nfulfilled but truly didn't matter in the end because the film takes you\nplaces where no other film has gone and for that reason I'd give it an\n8+.<br><br>Overall it has a somewhat independent low budget film maker feel to it.\nGive this script to practically any decent director out there and I\nthink it would have turned out just as good, if not better and for that\nit does fall a bit short.<br><br>It's a somewhat unbelievable film in the way it was portrayed, but\nfrankly, set the movie a side and the story itself is very believable\nand not so far off as you might think.<br><br>If you enjoy sci-fi movies, outside of the box thinking and tend to\nponder things, then this film is most definitely for you! Great film,\nvery memorable, one for the ages!\n"
"\nI went into watching this film with very low expectations. This was due\nto my knowledge of the movie being placed around the relationship\nbetween a computer and a human. Something that i found morally and\nethically confronting. As i overlooked that aspect i saw a beautifully\nconstructed story line being told through amazing acting skills. By the\nend of the movie i was feeling the same pain i had felt when I had lost\nsomeone I loved, It had caused an emotional response that had placed me\nin the characters shoes. Through the unique directing style and\nbrilliant cinematography, through a moral unalignment and beautifully\nconducted story, this movie has somehow become relatable and unraveled\nan emotional roller coaster that has received my utmost respect and\npraise.\n"
"\nThere are plenty of beautiful emotional conversations across various\npeople in the movie. Sincere love keeps the heart warm all through the\nmovie. <br><br>Nicely open, the movie explores every facet of human relationships with\nthe help of a software os. The unlikely frustrations and sorrow that\nthe protagonist feels for the operating system is presented in an\namazingly convincing manner. While in the movie, you understand him. <br><br>The perspective of the operating system has been used to add dimensions\nto human relations that would not have been possible with just human\ncharacters.\n"
"\nI really liked enjoyed this movie. The colours were gorgeous, muted\noranges, olives and brown. Joaquin was fantastic, he's a quirky guy so\nthis role suited him. I had to suspend belief a little in regards to\nthe idea of having AI's as an operating system that behave so\nhuman-like, and so quickly. SJ's voice got a little irritating after a\nwhile and the the cyber sex? If that part was removed I would have\ngiven it a higher score, it was excruciating to listen to and\nabsolutely unbelievable that a computer programme could experience an\norgasm, I mean, really? Amy Adams was great too. Overall, it is a\nsweet, interesting, lovely to watch film, that makes you think about\nwhat we may have in store for us.\n"
"\nAre you Fffffing kidding me? There is 2plus hours of my life that I'll\nnever get back. What a huge waste of time and resources making this\nflop of a movie. Through the whole movie I kept saying to myself: \"are\nyou Fffffffing kidding me??\", and \"WTF???\". The only reason I even\nwatched the entire turd was that I thought that possibly Scarlett\nJohansson might be somehow transformed into her gorgeous self.\nSeriously though, if you like this movie you need to get a life. A\nlife, some friends, maybe a dog or a cat too:) I thought that tis movie\nwas unbelievably lame and a total waste of time. If that's the future,\nthen I'm glad I'm older and not going to be around to see most of it:)\nThis stinker gets two big thumbs down.\n"
"\nI cannot believe the positive reviews for this film. How can anybody\nsit through this ridiculous monotony and not laugh out loud (presuming\nthe didn't fall asleep)? The premise is flawed beyond explanation and\nthe conclusion is contrived out necessity because there is no possible\nreal ending for such a moronic story line. This would be an interesting\nshort film or experimental student project but as a feature, it is a\ncomplete flop. There is no way any sophisticated fan of the art of film\ncould give this a rating above 4 stars. How the Producers spent $23\nmillion on this amateur looking mess is beyond me. I presume $20\nmillion went to the cast and Director. The rest was spent on a DP\ntrying hard to create Sofia Coppola style imagery but failing on many\nlevels.\n"
"\nI decided to watch this movie based on the positive reviews on here.\nHowever, whilst the initial premise seemed novel and interesting, the\nfilm never really went anywhere and I found myself getting bored\ntowards the end. The best thing was the voice of Scarlett Johansson.<br><br>Spoiler alert next: Also, there were a few unanswered questions, such\nas when the film was set (I am guessing the near future based on the\ntechnology), why did Joaquin Phoenix break up with his wife, what\nhappened to the baby (there is a flashback of Joaquin Phoenix looking\nat his heavily pregnant ex wife)?<br><br>A lot of the time, Joaquin Phoenix seemed to be mumbling his lines and\nI found it hard to understand everything that he was saying.<br><br>Just not that great I'm afraid.\n"
"\nI heard so much hype and was excited to see the movie! I curled up in\nmy hotel room and ordered the movie... I was bored from the beginning\nbut figured I would give it a chance since I spent $18. I had to turn\nit off because it sounded like I was watching a porno, it was boring,\nand just lacked depth in my opinion. I have loved other \"artsy\" films\nbut I need a storyline I can grab onto and follow. I need something\nthat gets me thinking or is entertaining. I felt like there was no real\nclimax. What is the meaning behind this? Did they really have to add\nthe dead cat strangling or the random naked pregnant woman? I guess\nthat is one way to describe it this movie is about a pathetic man and\nsex; well from the little I watched.\n"
"\nIMDb ratings usually help me choose to watch a movie, but here the\nmassive rating trapped me and robbed me off with 2 hours of my life.\nHer is the most boring film i have ever seen. It failed to connect to\nme at any point of time and i have no idea why people praise the film.\nAttempts are made to make the film look very futuristic, but sadly it\nis cliché after cliché. You can rightly predict where the movie is\nheading and every single character brings in the sense of deja vu.\nPerformance wise, all the actors give this melancholic expression\nthroughout the film and after a while even you get depressed thinking\nyou lost your money and time for this predictable, overrated film\ncalled Herr....err...her\n"
"\nThis was incredible. My U.S. Contemporary Literature and Film professor\nrecommended it to me after I finished taking his course, and I loved\nalmost everything about it, enough so to make myself write my first\nmovie review. I just had one insignificant problem with it. <br><br>Spoiler?:<br><br>As it is set in the future, you are able to communicate with your\nBluetooth-esque headset and say something such as, \"E-mail Kathryn.\"\nYou can then say \"Send.\" after you finish writing your e-mail. My\nproblem with this was, what if you say send in the midst of writing a\nsentence in the e-mail?<br><br>Yeah, I know. It's dumb.<br><br>But, anyways, I very much enjoyed it for how it captured human emotion\nwithin such a small time limit of a couple of hours. It reminded me of\nhow and why I love my boyfriend.<br><br>^The answer to those two questions being, for no reason at all! :-)<br><br>There are many things I love about this man that is unique to him, but\nin the end, the process of why and how we feel is very arbitrary, and\nthat's what is so incredible about it.\n"
"\nThe film is set in the future and you could say that it is a chilling\nview of the future! Theodore(Phoenix) is a separated man who is lonely\nand struggling to come to terms with being single. A new operating\nsystem is being released onto computers that includes artificial\nintelligence. The operating system names herself Samantha and is voiced\nby Scarlett Johansson.<br><br>Theodore becomes more and more attached to Samantha and the film is\nobviously playing on many peoples (over) usage of modern day electrical\ndevices. Theodore is in constant touch with Samantha throughout the day\nin the same way that many people are in constant touch with\nFacebook/Twitter etc throughout the day now. It is not long before\nTheodore is seeing Samantha as a partner and he is closer to the\noperating system than he is to normal people. The film is fairly\ninteresting, but very difficult to really relate too. Phoenix is good\nin the lead role and the pace of the film is good. If you are really\ninto technology go and see the movie to see if you can relate to it a\nlittle more than I did.\n"
"\nIn a future, not far from now, your operative system can scan your\ncomputer and learn all about you subconscious. It can therefore guide\nyou, but more than so, your OS can fall in love with you and you can\nfall in love with your OS.<br><br>This happens here. It's a meaningful relationship with ups and downs.\nThe only thing which lacks is body contact. But sex is there anyway and\nyour OS thinks you're a good lover.<br><br>Hard to say whether this is a comedy or the opposite, which often is a\nquality mark. And don't underestimate what your subconscious can do for\nyou.\n"
