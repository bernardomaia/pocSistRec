"\nI really don't understand all the hate this movie gets. Yeah, I get it,\nit's a reboot of a perfectly good 80s movie that nobody really wanted,\nbut it's a really good one! I expected a mindless Micheal Bayian action\nmovie and what I got was a really smart, interesting and entertaining\nlook at trans-humanism, the freedom of choice, politics and\nrecklessness in corporate leaders.<br><br>This movie really dives into the question of how a person could live\nhis day to day live with almost all of his body amputated and stuck\ninside of a machine. So when people complain about the uncomfortable\nscenes between Murphy and his wife, I can only imagine they mean what\nhappened after his transformation, and that felt exactly the way it was\nsupposed to!<br><br>So yes, the original is way more graphic and still holds up to this day\nas a gruesome action flick, but this one is smart and interesting and\nreally is a good movie in it's own right.<br><br>And by no means is it as bad as people say it is!\n"
"\nI love Paul Verhoeven's RoboCop from 1987 (which remains iconic) and I\nusually don't like reboots. But watching the new one I never got rid of\nthe feeling, that the remake is worth it. It is a whole new\ninterpretation, that sets the focus on the topics of our time: robots,\ndrones, the human aspect behind the technology, media critics, war\npropaganda. I felt, the movie has a mission to enlighten people and I\nliked that. It became even more obvious how much the RoboCop story\nexists within the topos of Frankenstein which is the story about the\nhuman devilment and the lack of respect of life. That's why Padilha\ngives Murphy more of a face, a life and feelings.<br><br>Beside that the pictures, the sound, the music is pretty contemporary.\nYou probably have to make some compromises today to get the millions to\nget the flick done. It won't become iconic, but it's the right time for\nthe right message in the right movie.\n"
"\nBy 7, it really means a 7.5/10. Not sure what's with the negative\nreviews, but I enjoyed the movie very much. It's well-executed and the\ndirection was clear and crisp. There's no distinct feel-good actions\nscenes because the pacing is kept constant throughout and I don't see\nwhy there's an issue with the pacing being that way. It's hardly flat,\nit's just a very honest, straight- flushed story-telling, and it fits\nthe themes that are underscored by the movie. Alex Murphy is a\nreluctant hero and he's ultimately a father and a husband whose\npersonal agenda serves as his existential core. I like how these themes\nare teased out and zoomed in upon throughout the movie. Also, there are\nsome absolutely delicious production details and CGIs that are just\nabsolutely feasts to the eye. Not to mention the superb cast and the\nwonderful performances. I think this is a honest and loyal reboot that\nwill appeal to fans of Robocop who fell in love with the story\nprecisely for the moralistic themes it explores.\n"
"\nI just don't see, why any other recent science fiction movie deserves\nmore respect than this one. The story is fluent, the characters are\nwell built, everyone has its own motive. Yes film is more of a personal\nstruggle journey of the main character and that is what I like. For the\nfans of action it is also good, why when (quite often) there is, it is\ngood one. The effects are quality mastership. The most memorable scene\nis when Murphy sees what he has become.For my regards it has some\nphilosophical connotation to, because it also concerns the influence of\ntechnology to the society. It clearly shows bads and goods. I recommend\nwatching this movie for\n"
"\nBefore I went to go see it, I already knew it couldn't compete with the\noriginal. But this actually was worse than I expected. What was great\nabout the original just like Terminator is that it was grimy, dark and\nalthough robot cops offcourse aren't that realistic they we're not\nbeyond belief.<br><br>This pushes everything, RoboCop has to weigh at least a couple of\nhundred kilo's but it runs like Usain Bolt. The way it jumps could\neasily make him a star NBA player. If you are a fan and actually wanted\nto believe this could be real, this alone ruins it completely.<br><br>Then there are the \"let's-make-him-modern-and-cool\" errors. Why paint\nhim black, he's not Batman. Why does his visor light up red, he's not\nCyclops and he has thermal vision so, he doesn't need a light. Why does\nhe have to recharge at least 10 times during the movie, did Apple make\nhim?<br><br>The Human Hand Pffff, Why GOD why? <br><br>Taser The original Robocop had part off his awesomeness because of the\nautomatic Desert Eagle. Everyone wanted that gun. This one has a taser.\nA taser,... really?\n"
"\nI have watched the original RoboCop movies. This remake does not come\nclose to any of them! Many reviewers here comment to not compare it\nwith the original RoboCop movies. What kind of nonsense it that!!! This\nis not a new and original story. It is a REMAKE!!!! Would you not\ncompare the next Titanic movie or the next Batman, Superman movies with\nthe previous versions?!!! Of course you will. You can't just copy\nsomething and say it is not the same as original!! If it is supposed to\nbe similar to the original at least they could make this a better\nmovie. But they did not. The whole movie was just about how RoboCop\nbecomes RoboCop and gets his revenge. So much for the storyline. That\nwas just the first 5 minutes of the original RoboCop. Bad acting, bad\nspecial effect. What a waste! A disgrace for RoboCop. It is a shame to\nmake a mockery of a classic movie!!!!\n"
"\nShort version - One ticket to Mars please to get away from these crappy\nmovies.<br><br>Long version - If Hollywood really cannot think of any more movie ideas\nthen they need to think more then taking old movies and remaking them.\nSeeing as oh I dunno majority of them suck ass. Red Dawn/Total Recall\nand now Robocop? F*CK YOU. I would like to see different movies with\ntwists in them not the same childhood/game/remakes over and over. If\nyou cannot think of anything I am pretty sure it is time to stop making\nmovies for a while and make something else. I seriously doubt anyone is\ngoing to miss movies seeing as how much they suck.\n"
"\ni think this is a totally bad reboot like \"totall recall\" ! and it was\na huge Insult to Persian people , it show Persian like taliban or some\nother crazy terrorists which is not right !!! that creepy city wasn't\neven similar to Tehran !!! i hope this movie get more bad ratings...\n!!! i mean they didn't even take a time to know what or where is\nIran!!! its right that Iran has the wrong people as The Leader or\npresident or a lots of those politicians that doesn't worth that post\nbut people are not like that and there is no terrorists in Iran , at\nleast we wont kill each other in cinema or school...!!! lets look at\nthe movie , if we just see it as an action movie it will be a OK movie\nwith a lot of problems but as a reboot of RoboCop it was totally awful\n!!!\n"
"\nAlex Murphy, damaged in an explosion to the point of death, is the\nideal candidate for a new initiative to join human sensibilities to\ncomputerised and robotic peace-keeping hardware. But Murphy has his own\nmind, which leads to conflict with those responsible for the attempt on\nhis life (plus others), which may stretch beyond the criminal\nfraternity.<br><br>The 2014 remake of Paul Verhoeven's classic 1987 sci-fi satire includes\nmost of the story beats from the original, but has quite a different\nheart. This makes it into a different film, and one which I enjoyed as\nmuch as the original.<br><br>Despite being full of action, it is a much gentler film. The violence\nis not as sadistic, there is no profanity (imagine that!), the\nrelationship between Alex and his family is much more important, and\nGary Oldman's conflicted Dr Frankenstein - sorry, Dr Norton - is a fine\ncharacter: he is the actual heart of the movie.<br><br>If you loved the 1987 version with a passion then you may hate this. If\nyou merely liked it, you may like this version too.\n"
"\nThis is a disgrace to the original, at the time it was a groundbreaking\nand very shocking film, with great actors very original and well done\nideas and such an original style to it, well this crap is exactly the\nopposite, terrible story line, very slow to start I would go as far as\nsaying boring, and for the actors in it got to give it to the director\nthe whole film is just all terrible acting, the overall very bad crime\nfeel in Detroit doesn't come across, where are the crazy adverts, where\nis the infamous bad guy, and the setup to murphys story? All missing,\nwhy mess with the story line from the original which was excellent\nanyway, this is nothing short of an epic fail, it just manages to scrap\n1 star rating as robos HUD view is quite cool but that is literally the\nonly good thing I have to say, I can't remember the last time I was so\ndisappointed with a film, please director don't do any more films, a\ncomplete waste of what could of been a brilliant opportunity\n"
"\nI really am shocked at how rubbish this was. I had high hopes from the\naverage score here. I was pleased when I heard the original theme tune\nat the beginning, leading me to expect other loyalties to the original.\nThen, nothing, no loyalties to the original, or the comics. However, I\nam good at getting over such things, I can treat new remakes as\nIndividual films. I have to say though that they just didn't do very\nwell here at all. Most of the film was contained to the subject of his\ndevelopment, more so his combat mode, where by his cyborg side killed\nso many targets in so many seconds. It seemed to me that they made this\nfilm to make video games as that is all the story line seemed to\nrevolve around. I am sorry as I really thought it might have been a\ngood one.\n"
"\nTo start, I'm a Robo fan since I was 3. Have seen the 1987 movie like\n30+ times. Have lots of merchandise and even a tattoo. Stop reading\nreviews, go to a cinema and watch it. If you can get there alone\nbetter, girlfriends don't like this movies in valentines weekend, and\nold Peter Weller fans will talk dirt about it even without watching it.<br><br>The movie is Perfect. Different than the original but it is not better\nand it is not worse. I'm not a Marvel super heroes fan but the Avengers\nmovie/IronMan3 are the top 10/10 in the scale to compare with Robocop.\nAnd Robo gets a 9/10. Forget it is a remake. Forget it is a PG13.\nForget the human hand. Forget it is not Peter Weller. Watch it and you\nwill rate it 8+/10 for sure.\n"
"\nHi, this movie is a joke, at half of the movie i left the cinema. It is\na shame to call the movie Robocop. The original movie have more love in\ndetail then this kind of waste. The $100.000.000 would better spend to\npeople who needs more money. Making movie should filed with love not\nwith the only mind how much money i can earn with this. This is the\nresult of it.<br><br>bad work Mr producer of this movie thanks that i wasted my time to\nwatch this bullshit.<br><br>sorry 1 star is to much i reduce it to -2<br><br>greets\n"
"\nThe 2014 version of Robocop was a pleasant surprise for me as it turned\nout to be a much better film that I expected it to be. Expected it to\nbe a standard remake but it's actually a very decent reboot which is\nunique in its own way. <br><br>It seemed to me like this had more of a story and we got to know the\nmain character more before he even became Robocop. The CGI in this film\nwas impressive and I thought Robocop looked bad-ass in black. <br><br>The films builds up nicely and the action sequences towards the end are\npretty breathtaking. I think a lot of people are hating on this movie\nbecause they wanted to hate it as it was announced. I say give it a\nchance. <br><br>8/10.\n"
"\nI would like to say wow to the studio executives on this film. I\nbelieve José Padilha was portraying himself as Dr. Norton in this film\njust wanting to make a good emotional film but studio executives\nportrayed as Raymond Sellars kept shooting him down saying no we need a\nmovie everyone can watch so we can gross more money. As Norton made\nRobocop emotionless with dopamine to please Sellers Padilha did the\nsame to the film with boring CGI scenes to please executives, only\ndifference being Sellers dying in the end for the attempted murder of\nAlex Murphy, were as the executives got away with the attempted murder\nof this movie.<br><br>Also did anyone else just think bet 365 every time Samuel L Jackson was\ndoing his scenes?\n"
"\nI put the original classic 1987 Robocop out of my mind when I went to\nsee this. It makes sense to me to judge it on it's own merits.<br><br>Robocop manages to fail on just about every level.<br><br>The story, which follows Alex Murphy being transformed into a Cyborg\nafter near fatal injuries from a car bomb, is very slow to get going.<br><br>At no point was I invested in his journey and his wife's character only\nseemed to be there to where tops that emphasised her breasts.<br><br>There are unnecessary, boring exposition dumps that explain why he's\nmore like an emotionless robot in this one and his quest to expose\ncorruption and bring down a ruthless corporate executive is played far\ntoo lightly.<br><br>Every action scene felt like a tired Playstation video game.<br><br>It often had the feel of a Wednesday afternoon TV movie and I would not\nwaste your money on this one.\n"
"\nI am a Robocop fan and this is just an insult.<br><br>As a standalone movie, even if it was called \"Cyborg Detective 2014\"\nand had nothing to do with the Robocop universe, it's still a waste of\ntime. <br><br>Besides the dull, stupid, anticlimactic, boring and predictable script,\nthe visual effects and artistic style are lame and look like they were\ndone for a low budget TV series. <br><br>The original 1987 version of Robocop is superior in every possible way\neven with the outdated stopmotion animation.<br><br>I really don't understand why is this happening, Hollywood is just\ngetting worse and worse these days, remaking everything and calling it\nthe same as the original like it's meant to replace it and it's\nautomatically better. This movie was just a waste of time and money and\na big stain on the Robocop franchise, right up there with Robocop 3. <br><br>If this is the future of Hollywood, I feel bad for every movie buff out\nthere. <br><br>Stay away from this garbage!\n"
"\nHow about to study first and then make a movie. In Iran people don't\ndress like Arabs, Iranian people are Iranian, they are not Arabs, not\nthat there is anything wrong with them but Iranian are different, their\nlives, culture, food and everything is just different. There are no\nsuicide bombers in Iran. We never had one and I hope we never will.How\ncan you make a movie and show a nation like that to people who pay\nmoney to watch your stupid film. I am really sorry! How dare! So many\npeople have the wrong idea about Iran because of film like this.\nStreets of Tehran are nothing like you have shown. It's just\nridiculous. Not watching this trash ever again! You should be ashamed\nof yourself!\n"
"\nI am the original Robocop Fan (NOT the 3rd movie though), and I think\nthe new Robocop is really a not bad movie. It's has a complex character\ndevelopment that I didn't expect, and the story has many twists and\nturns that you are feeling concern and worry for the main character.\nThe problem is, there are many people enjoy/used to Michael Bay and\nmany money crapping Hollywood director's Bull S**T that when they are\npresented with a good movie with good plots, good messages, and talk\nabout real issue in our society, they complain that \"the movie has too\nlittle action\", or \"the story is too complicated that it hurts my\nbrain\" this kind of s**t talk. And too many people compare this to the\noriginal movie, with biased and prejudice that make them cannot look\npast the differences in the interpretation and presentation of Robocop.\nPlease give this movie a chance!!!\n"
"\nI had to add my 2 cents to the mix, this movie sucks. It is so boring I\nstarted playing with my phone within 10 minutes. Why does Hollywood\nkeep putting out this crap. This movie has no suspense, like many\nothers have said, there is no villain, Elmer fudd made a better\nvillain. The plot holes are ridiculous. Why take the better parts of\nthe movie and trash them and replace with boring, no nonsense story\nline. The original had a way better plot and story, this movie is just\nsilly. Part of the story that helped you came about the character was\nhe didn't remember his family, they thought he was dead. Part of the\nplot was Murphy gaining control through out the movie, it moved the\nplot along. The evil corporation is not evil, it's boring. Where is the\ngritty, dirty city that was over run with corruption? Pg13 rating,\nreally, what was the point.\n"
"\nDepiction of Iranians in this movie is almost a bias! I just wonder why\ndirectors in the states do the same blunders again and again! Is there\nany conspiracy behind all of these boners to belittle Iranians?! OK,\nyour politicians have problems with ours, why you insult our people in\nyour movies and more than that, why you insult your audiences by\nfooling them to watch these images?! I lived around 30 years in Iran\nand I witnessed that majority of tourists vising Iran just get baffled\nhow Iran and Iranians are totally different than what was in their\nimaginations! What's the role of media in aberration of innocent minds\nwith these amusements? I'm recalling Einstein desperately saying:\nTechnological progress is like an axe in the hands of a pathological\ncriminal. Maniacs in both sides are ruining people's life. Don't make\nit worse than that please!\n"
"\nThis is a completely different film. I have seen it at the cinema. They\ncould have called it 'coprobo' for all I care. However, I went in with\nan open mind even-though the original was one of my fav films as a kid\nand I felt this film did not need a remake. .Its a pointless piece of\nfilth remake and should be flushed with the other loggage.<br><br>The first 15 mins are great and I really thought this was going to be a\nreally good film. I was wrong.<br><br>1. Stop rebooting movies 2. If you're to slack to do that make them\naction packed and, yes, gory and action packed. Leave the whole safe\nfor families Christian coalition crap back home.\n"
"\nTo me, heck it's my review and my piece of #### anyway... kinda\nsucks... since I am from the old school Robocop, watched and loves them\nsince I'm a kid... Watching this reboot is like \"WTH? are they just run\noutta ideas? Why couldn't they just do Robocop 5?\" With all those tech\nlevel upgraded, I can't why it isn't better to do so. A reboot, with\nthe same lousy story almost 3 decades ago (yeap, i call it lousy coz\nit's nothing new) doesn't add any interesting factor except for Murphy\ngoes transformer...<br><br>The movie itself, is good. But if u have watched robocop original, you\nwill feel this is a waste... just like TMNT...\n"
"\nI know some people say don't compare to the original but this is a\nREMAKE so you have to compare to the Original. The original was tongue\nin cheek, violent, funny, a parody on politics. The new movie just\nfailed on all those things. Cliché'd and characters didn't generate\nanything. Why movie makers agree to these poor remakes is beyond me.\nWatch this if you want to but suggest you do so before the original.\nOriginal is a far superior movie. Like Total Recall remake, again\ntotally missed the tongue in cheek humour that made these such great\nfilms in the first place. And apparently I have to add another line to\nmeet requirements for review !\n"
"\nMany already had critics about all the reasons this movie is OK at best\nso I wont ad anything on that part.<br><br>What I'd like to point out is a good example of western arrogance and\ndeep racism. This movie start with a scene where the USA seems to\noccupy Iran... Filming crew are having fun watching machines blow up\nIranian kids... Can you imagine if a country like Iran would make a\nmovie where they occupy the USA and blow up American children's ? <br><br>Then they try to sell the idea that these robots should be used on\nAmericans but they don't want to cause you know they wont let machines\ndecide if its OK to kill children's, its immoral. Yet they sure didn't\nbother about that for Iranian kids...<br><br>I can at least give them a good point for making corporations,\npropaganda medias and those favourable to the use of drones the bad\nguys.\n"
"\nThere is just no story in there. It's so awful beyond believe. We\nwatched it with a group of friends and most of them left the cinema\nafter one hour. There is just no soul in this movie. It does not grab\nyou like the first one. It's even worse than the remake of The Thing.\nFor some reason all new movies are all about special effects and\nterrible acting. The stolen oneliners from the first Robocop do not\neven make sense. How in the world could this be released? How long will\nthis go on...all remakes are terrible just terrible. But this movie is\nby far the worst I have ever seen in my life. Even my kid thought it\nwas utterly boring!!!!! I'm off .... I hope I can forget this extremely\ndull movie. It like a cheap episode of some kind of low budget series\non TV. Terrible really really really terrible\n"
"\nFirstly, the film has a great cast and good performances. Not a\nterrible film in technical or performance terms, but certainly another\npointless remake/reboot/re-imagining of a classic franchise. What is\nthe point of doing this? I know it's for money and just in hopes that\npeople recognize the name, but this movie may as well have NOT been\nabout the Robocop we know.<br><br>But even without comparing it to the original...WHERE IS THE HEART or\nSUBSTANCE in this movie? Name it. It's nothing different than the other\n100 drama/action/comedy films that have some basic evil vs. bad story.\nNothing original.<br><br>Anyways: It is The same old by-the-numbers cliché garbage. Laughable\nscript and unoriginal but worst of all: Just boring.<br><br>How many times are we going to see the same plot devices and laughable\ncliché characters in a movie? And even preaching to us, how about\ngiving us something to actually think about or discuss. <br><br>Hollywood has only one move these days: Making 1-dimensional characters\n(innocent good guy, evil for no reason bad guy)-- Wash, rinse, repeat.\n"
"\nAs an Iranian, I watched the opening part of the movie over and over,\nI'm really confused here. If the movie tries to criticize the\nmisleading role of the media, then why does it contribute to creation\nof the false media- forged impression of Iranian people, being\nextremely religious, uncivilized, poor and so on... Do they really not\nknow my people? Or, do they intentionally want to show them like that?\nDon't they really know that Iranian people don't wear Arabic clothes\nand hats like what we see in this movie? Don't they know Iranian people\nhave never committed a single suicide bombing in the world's history?\nI'm wondering what the point is in degenerating my culture and how most\nof the movies benefit from this?\n"
"\nWhile I went in to the theater with visions of the 1998 Godzilla fiasco\nlodged in my brain, I left cheering and refreshed.<br><br>Let me just make one thing perfectly clear, no, this isn't an exact\nremake of the original Robocop that I fell in love with as a child, but\nit certainly proves to me that just because something is PG-13, doesn't\nmean that it can't be gory and gritty in its own right.<br><br>To be honest, when they stripped away all of the robotic suit and\nshowed Murphy what remained of him, I a bit shocked and kind of\ndisgusted. However, it was not in the whiny protesting way, but rather\nthe \"oh gods, I just saw an animal get hit by a bus\" shocked. That\nimage of pulsating guts and organs was rather grisly.<br><br>The action scenes were a bit too fast for my taste, and I thought that\nsome of the Samuel L. Jackson scenes were hit or miss, but overall, I\nfound this movie to be as entertaining and action-packed as the\noriginal and certainly worthy of the name \"Robocop\".\n"
"\nOne wonders why Hollywood thinks bland will sell. The Verhoeven version\nwas far far better. You might as well have had Uwe Boll direct this\nmovie as soon as you decided to cripple it with a PG rating and other\nterrible compromises. There were some reasonable action sequences but\non the whole it just didn't flow. It wasn't edgy and therefore will be\nforgettable. There are a million great unused ideas out there, yet\nHollywood seems to be fascinated with trotting out the violated corpses\nof achievements past because they are just to frightened these days to\nhave an original thought. Strangely, despite \"playing it safe\" the\nnumber of movies that flop seems to be on the rise.\n"
"\nNot only is this movie sexist and extremely racist. It goes out of its\nway to establish the idea that United States is the best country the\nworld will ever see. The absurdity of the claims and complete ignorance\nhow history not matching with their fantasy of their history putting\naside, the movie subtly depicts eastern Europeans as terrorists, Asians\nas intelligent working slaves of US and Black people as all criminals.\nThe protagonist is of course a white heterosexual slim American who has\na gorgeous wife that he can have sex with anytime he wants because his\nwife his head over heels for him, a young son who sees his father as a\nsuperhero, a money crazy antagonist CEO and a side kick black coworker\nwho gets shot in the end. All in all, Robocop introduces absolutely\nNOTHING NEW on the table and even has the audacity to praise America's\nchaotic justice on earth to be the \"future\" The only thing that's\nworthwhile seeing in this movie is the spectacular performance of Abbie\nCornish.\n"
"\nRobocop?!?! What the hell did that have to do with the original?\nRobocop is my favourite film in my top ten of all time. The remake had\nnothing to do with it at all, it was sleek aimed at kids like the\ndisgraceful Robocop3. The first was a brilliant take on the ferocious\ngreed of the 80s satirical shocking and brutally honest. Violent to the\npoint of making me sick and I was shocked at the way they killed Alex\nMurphy taking off his hand and enjoying it, and laughing. That's the\nbit that stuck with me. The new one is a polished repackaged don't open\nthe packet toy, compared to the battered millennium falcon you played\nwith as a child. (Yeah some of us girls liked star wars too). Favourite\nis NOT a spelling mistake it's the English way of spelling it.\n"
"\nI just watched the first scenes of the movie which took place in Tehran\nand realized how careless the director was about Tehran streets,\nIranians Persian speaking and appearance and etc. At least he could do\nsome research or ask an expert about these things to make it more real.\nI realized that they just made something to sell out ticket. And when\nthe movie ended I became sure that it was not worth watching. Did not\nlike it at all! Just liked the special effects ,the colors and lights.\nAnd also I liked Garry Oldman, but this movie, phew, pity! I hope I\ncould see better movies of him. Personally I prefer the old version of\nthis movie.\n"
"\nI watched Paul Verhoeven's film as soon as it was released and I was\nimpressed by the violence but also by the script's intelligence. I\nconfess that I was anxious to watch the new version of Verhoeven's\nfilm, even because director José Padilha is my compatriot (Brazilian).\nHowever, I was disappointed by the weak script, the superficiality of\nthe characters and the drastic changes of the original film. You may\naccuse me of being old fashioned, but overcoming a classic lately has\nbeen an impossible mission. Another example is the classic Total\nRecall, also by Verhoeven.\n"

"\nFirst, let me explain that I loved the original version which was\nadvanced and ahead of its time. I can't watch this recent movie without\ncomparing it to the original. The original movie is a Cult classic and\nshould have been left alone in my humble opinion. In this Robocop\nUniverse I got the feeling that Robocop wasn't needed as it was for\ninstance in the original movies. In the original version the cops are\nout maned, out gunned and overburdened with bureaucracy and legal tape\nto fight crime. In this I agree the special effects are awesome but the\nplot in lacking something substantial in the script. The were so many\nwasted opportunities in this movie and the right actors were playing\nthe wrong parts. I think they concentrated too much on the special\neffects that they forgot about telling us a good story .\n"
"\nits a really awful remake of the great classic Robocup(1987).just a\nwaist of 100 million dollars.Bad acting , terrible story line and\ndisturbing interrupts of the host of a stupid show . frankly they\nshould give a golden raspberry to it. the worst actor of the the film\nwas the guy who played as Raymond Sellars he was just moving his hand\nso much during talking that you would have think he is a weather man .\nthe family of the Robocop played so icy and fake. and Alex Murphy in\nthis film is not the charismatic Robocop that we saw in the old movie.\nin the beginning of the film we see a part in Tehran that is not\nrelated to the rest of the movie and gives a false impression of\nPersian people like we are born as terrorists\n"
"\nSad to say that we actually turned this off about a half hour in. It\nwas just so boring. The guy they chose to be the new Robocop is\ncompletely uninteresting. He's so stone-faced, with the dead eyes of a\nshark, that the scenes of him trying to relate to his family made me\nwonder if he wasn't holding them hostage in some fashion. There was no\nsense of connection to his family, his partner, or his job, if they\nwanted a machine that could feel they chose the wrong guy. The global\npolice bit had potential, but there was no real through-line or reason\nto care about any of these characters. Almost kept watching just\nbecause Michael Keaton is awesome, but everything surrounding him in\nthis movie was lifeless and dull.\n"
"\n...i really don't see why people like it so much.It's a mediocre big\nbudget syfy channel movie of the week at best.The Robocop prime\ndirectives miniseries was better than this.Hell the Robocop TV series\nwas better than this.<br><br>With it's PG-13 rating and general lack of violence and profanity this\nprobably could have aired as a network movie of the week.Agents of\nS.H.I.E.L.D. held my attention more than this did and i didn't\nparticularly like that much.<br><br>I thought Joel Kinnaman had zero appeal as the lead.Weller gave the\ncharacter gravitas.He made you feel his anger and his loss.Kinnamn is\nnowhere near as good an actor.\n"
"\nJoe's Rule of Remakes. If something was good enough where you'd want to\nremake it, you probably don't need to. The original was fine as what it\nwas.<br><br>This film tried to take the material more seriously, save for the\nscenes with Samuel L. Jackson, which were not needed at all.<br><br>So let's take the basics. Officer Alex Murphy is killed, and\nresurrected as a cyborg. OCP sees him as a product while he tries to\nregain his humanity. Been there, done that.<br><br>Some of the supporting characters- Gary Oldman, Michael Keaton and\nJackie Haley vanish into their roles pretty well. Jackson doesn't.<br><br>Some of the action scenes are good, others are chewy CGI goodness.<br><br>Maybe if they hadn't called this \"RoboCop\", it might have been a better\nmovie.<br><br>Maybe.\n"
"\nInteresting remake.<br><br>Not as cartoonish as the original, and the satire is more bitter. They\nchanged the hero's dilemma, in that his humanity was present from the\nbeginning of his robotishness. Also they got in the issue of illusion\nof free will - hot topic for everyone.<br><br>The action scenes were good - particularly driving a bend on the\nmotorcycle while Robocop steers with one hand and shoots with the\nother.<br><br>The CEO was an excellent parody of marketing-as-product (Steve Jobs\n**cough**), but the TV talking head was not convincing - although that\nkind of nutty ranting is a good target.<br><br>Anyone who thinks this was unnecessary, just think - the original was a\nsatire on the corporate take over of political power in the US, but it\ndidn't make a blind bit of difference.<br><br>This one isn't perfect, but it matches the original at a time when the\nneed to break corporate power is even more urgent.\n"
"\nthis movie is just one of the worst movies i have ever seen. i could\nnot find an interesting story out of it, nothing. the actress is so\nbad, she does not know how to express feelings. when she cry it is\nobvious it is fake. i hate it so much. The course of the movie is so\nboring and out of ideas you do not feel exited for the next bit or even\nfor the end of the movie. it kind obvious what is going go and what\nkilled the movie is when he killed the one who planed for his murder.\nafter that i start believing, OK that was a fast revenge. they killed\nthe excitement out of the movie. the conspiracy theory in the movie\ncould have been much bigger and more exciting. and lets be honest, the\nguy does not have genitals or even skin how could he have a\nrelationship after all of that that part makes me angry the guy is 90%\nmachine he is not humane anymore.\n"
"\nI was sceptical about going to see this film. There are far too many\nremakes and majority of the time they are dreadful (Total Recall for\none). Actually I was quite impressed with this film. OK it is a bit\nslow at the beginning but after about 30 minutes it takes off and\ndoesn't stop. Their is plenty of decent action and the story isn't too\nbad neither.<br><br>Samuel L Jackson is fantastic. Although he doesn't have much screen\ntime, he certainly steals the show. Gary Oldman is also brilliant and\nMichael Keaton is pretty good. Joel Kinnerman who plays Murphy/ Robocop\nisn't nothing special (anybody could have played that part. (Weller was\nthe best at playing Robocop end off!(<br><br>OK so it's not as good as the original. However if this wasn't a remake\nit would be a very good film.\n"
"\nI was part of the generation who remembers those 80s movies that are\nbecoming re-made, re-fashioned, and re-booted. There was no need to\nremake Evil Dead, Nightmare on Elm Street, or Friday The !3th. So, I\nwas skeptical and had my mind made up to skip this movie because the\noriginal is already a good movie. I'm glad I didn't skip this one\nbecause it does something rare you don't really see in movies, it\nactually entertains and keeps your attention. The story is the same, a\ncop is shot and left for dead, then rebuilt into a cyborg law man. I\nfound this to actually stand on it's own two feet with some clever\nspecial effects and action. Joe Kinnaman makes Robocop human and his\nperformance is compatible to Peter Weller. In my opinion, had there not\nbeen an original film made in 1987, this movie would be okay on it's\nown. There are some pokes at today's politicians, American credit, and\nconsumerism too. This was a fun ride of a movie and before you judge a\nbook by it's cover, you might be surprised at your self for liking this\none.\n"
"\nWhat a cast! Leave it up to Oldman, Haley and Keaton to drive the\nstory, while letting Robocop do his thing. Joel Kinnaman was simply\nbrilliant in The Killing and after watching this movie, I cannot\nimagine any actor more suitable for this role.<br><br>The action sequences are believable and the suit is fantastic. The bike\nis definitely one above what Judge Dredd had to settle for, and while\nDredd was more violent, Robocop is more efficient.<br><br>The story builds on the present-day concerns over the use of drones in\nwarfare and draws the viewer into the possibility of controlled armed\nrobot soldiers being used to prevent loss of human lives. Though\nefficient, these machines would be prone to problems such as shooting\njuveniles.<br><br>The novel method to counter this issue is arrived at by a defense giant\nOmnicorp-Put a man inside the suit. From here the movie is predictable,\nbut the sequences and the acting, gave me every bit of that\nentertainment I could not derive from I Frankenstein.<br><br>It is a great movie. Definitely worth watching on the big screen.\n"
"\nI loved the original and I also loved this one too. The visuals are\ncompletely stunning and I think it is an excellent re-imagining of the\nstory. It brings loads of new ideas and gives a welcome fresh lease of\nlife adding new dimensions to an already brilliant character... Michael\nKeaton, Abbie Cornish, Gary Oldman, Michael K. Williams and Jackie\nEarle Hayley are all fantastic in this movie.. Nice to see Michael\nKeaton again! The cinematography is truly beautiful and some of the new\nscenes of Robo travelling are are so brilliantly shot they are so\npleasing to watch. A massive well done and big congratulations to all\nthat were involved in the production of this movie! Peter Weller's Robo\nis and will always be superb but Joel Kinnaman did an amazing job too!\nI really hope it does well enough so that there can be some sequels : )\n"
"\nThe film is much better than the trailer makes you expect. The story\nreally is well made and realistic. The film shows the problem that\ncompanies (like now Google)can become very powerful and develop a\ndanger to the democratic system. The reason is the financial interest\nof such companies: They have no human/emotional interest. Thats why\npeople should always remember not to believe everything which is\nadvertised and shouldn't give them to much power/control. On the other\nside I like the fact, that robots aren't the leaders in this movie.\nPeople in America still prioritize real humans for important jobs\n(police,...). Of course its kinda boring that this movie is a typical\nAmerican movie. Why wasn't it made in Russia or Europe?<br><br>At first the film seems to be a very basic and simple super hero thing,\nbut then you realize its content ;)\n"
"\nRobocop original was a satire against the dangers of private\nenterprise. It was not an attack against the use of drones or\nautomation. Rather, it was an attack on the misuse of private\nenterprise in place of government services.<br><br>This movie does a great injustice to the original in its message. In\naddition, this version is devoid of humor and satire which made the\noriginal much more fun.<br><br>The only improvement over the original was the special effects and some\nof the fight scenes. Did I go into Robocop expecting a different\nresult? No, but I thought at least it would have had more humor.\n"
"\nFor the older generation, the generation wherein I belong, we will\nprefer Paul Verhoeven's Robocop. At that time his movie was innovating\nand fresh. This version isn't bad though and for the generation that\nnever saw the original one they will probably rate it a bit higher than\nI do. I'm just not a big fan of remakes unless they're done way better.\nAnd that's rarely the case. Joel Kinnaman as Robocop is okay though.\nThe movie has the right amount of action and drama to keep you\nentertained. It's a good sci-fi story. A story that you hope will never\ncome through because the last thing we need is robots taking over the\nalready decreasing job market. And robots deciding what's right or\nwrong isn't a future I want to live in. So this Robocop is okay to\nwatch once but if I had to chose I would watch the original instead.\n"
"\nI really wanted to like RoboCop (2014), but maybe I was unfairly\ncomparing it to the original which was entertaining, prescient and\ninsightful. I know this reboot wanted to do things differently, and\nfair enough, but for instance RoboCop still keeping in contact with his\nwife and son (unlike the original) somehow took away the poignancy of\nMurphy.<br><br>Maybe the reboot will appeal to people who haven't seen the original,\nand that's fine, that's okay. But the reboot seemed to be by the\nnumbers, and it would have been better off as a TV mini-series or\nsomething like that.\n"
"\nI've never seen any of the previous movies or TV series and known the\nbare essentials about the character, but I did enjoy this movie.<br><br>I've seen Joel Kinnaman in The Killing and his character annoyed the\nabsolute crap out of me, so much that it was part of the reason I\nstopped watching the show, but I thought he was really good for the\nrole both with and without his face covered. <br><br>I really liked the futuristic look of 2028 mainly because it's a future\nthat you could see happening rather than the writers trying to over-do\nit by shoving the fact that it's the future in your face in every\nscene.<br><br>It has an amazing cast, awesome fx and a really good story. <br><br>Worth a watch, maybe even more than once and would probably be\nsomething I would buy on day one.\n"
"\nI had high hopes for this film but was left under nourished and simply\nfelt a bit \"meh\" after watching it. As expected the special FX/cgi were\nimpressive and generally a viewable reboot of Robocop but without the\ngenius of Paul Verhoeven at the helm all the humour, social digs and\ngeneral \"this is friggin cool\" was totally lacking and it ended up\nbeing just another sci-fi film that will fade into the \"oh yeah I saw\nthat...once\" category. I loved the first two movies (3 sucked) and, as\nI said earlier, had high hopes.<br><br>I can only say watch it if you have never seen the original - but if\nyou have you may not want to taint your mind with this reboot in the\nattempt to relive past glories of the Robocop ethos.\n"
"\nAs a remake, and given modern CG's, I thought this film was going to be\nan extravaganza of the programmers skills, IE, Avengers, X-men etc. No,\nthis film is a let down in that department. There are great moments of\ngraphic wizardry, but not enough to make this film as good as it could\nhave been. <br><br>The actors do there best with a mediocre script, and the premise is a\nrehash, (though slightly reworked) of the 80's blockbuster. In the 80's\nthe idea was new, and made great viewing, but this 'copy' is a let\ndown. The lead is played by a relative unknown, who doesn't really act\nwell, or inspire me to either; check out his previous films, or look\nforward to the future ones. I enjoyed watching Samuel L Jackson and\nGary Goldman, as they lifted this film, but their great acting wasn't\nenough to make this film anything more than a poor remake.\n"
"\nWell, the overall graphics was very awesome but there were a lot of\nflaws. First, it would have been good if the robocop has some\ncatchphrases or a good sense of humour. Secondly,the robocop was not\nseen taking down bad guys and showing how awesome he really is.\nThirdly, there was no actual bad guy that could match him, no real\nvillain. Fourthly, by the time, the robocop had hit the streets, more\nthen half the movie was already gone and the robocop just had a dull\nenvironment surrounding him. The makers could have done better but\nhowever the movie still gets a six because there was some cool action.\nThe robocop movie is still a good ones but don't keep your hopes up.\ncompared to some other summer movies, they are still above them.\n"
"\nAs soon as I heard about this at it's conceptual phase I emailed José\nPadilha and asked him not to redo Robocop 1 as the first movie had very\nfew flaws to improve on.<br><br>I suggested instead redoing the third movie in the series as most\npeople felt it was the worst of the three and would have been easy to\nmake a remake that exceeded the original while continuing to capitalize\non the success of the first two Robocop movies without alienating the\nfans of that original series.<br><br>Sadly, José Padilha never got my email/never read it/saw it/didn't care\nand continued ahead with this movie. Here we are a year after release\nand this reboot didn't reboot anything. There are no new robocop\ncomics, no robocop toy lines, cartoons, video-games, nothing.<br><br>As a franchise reboot this has failed because it ignored one very\nimportant basic thing! It alienated fans of the original trilogy. And\nif you are going to alienate the fans from the parts of a trilogy they\nalready like then why bother acquiring the license to that franchise?\n"
"\nWarning: mild spoilers (it's hard to really spoil this blandness).<br><br>Take a cliché, couple it with ham-fisted messages, couple it with a\nclean, actor-model style cinema, take it way too seriously, and you got\nRobocop.<br><br>Robocop isn't a terrible movie, and it's reasonably interesting, but it\nfails to deliver on its promise, to provide any manner of emotional\nengagement with its characters, or to provide any enjoyable action\nscenes.<br><br>The disappointing thing about it is that it feels that it has\npotential. Robocop's character starts interesting, but quickly turns\ninto zombie-robo, and once he magically starts \"regaining his humanity\"\nhe immediately goes off to kill his killer, then gets deactivated.\nNothing anywhere has any real consequences. Wiring his brain to give\nhim the illusion of control is an interesting idea, but has no effect\nwhatsoever on anything. Zombifying him -- life carries on as usual. His\nnever-a-hair-out-of-place wife makes some noises, that's about it.\nWhere are the emotions, from anyone?\n"
"\nThis film was done by a director who has a lot of talent, so it's a\nshame that Hollywood bombed another great classic film by taking away\ncreative freedom. When will they learn..never!<br><br>The film does have some good dramatic angles and pokes at the tech fear\nthat is fast approaching our society. But it lacks a concise plot.. was\nthe movie about a man learning to control his emotion? was it about a\ncorporation selling an image of safety? Gangsters doing business with\ndirty cops? I don't understand...My brain hurts trying to get it.<br><br>This is not the fault of the director, he stated in a few interviews\nthat for every 10 ideas he put in 9 were turned down. Not being allowed\nto have creative freedom was the downfall of this film.<br><br>The acting, CGI, and color of the film were good, but the lack of\nrampant violent crime and clean aspect of an American city leave me\nstunned! Who was asleep when they watched the original?<br><br>For Hollywood's next trick..it will ruin bladerunner and 2001 space\nodyssey.\n"
"\nFinally took the time to see this.<br><br>It was more or less what I had expected. I am not sure why Hollywood\ncan't get something original. Honestly. This could have been better if\nit was not Robocop.<br><br>When I started seeing the movie I thought to myself with a few tweaks\nthis could have been a great Deathlok movie (Google deathlok and\nmarvel)<br><br>Just like total recall this movie had too much too live up to. There\nare some decent scenes but after they show Robocop kicking something\nlike a 100 efficient military robots asses singlehandedly your\nexpectations from normal people even touching him goes out the window.<br><br>What I missed most was the amazing humor Paul put in his movie. The\ndark twisted future he made it alive.. This is but a bleak not needed\nwatered down copy.\n"
"\nI cant understand why Amaricans hate Irainians.It not being scared but\nits funny to celebrate the winning of an imaginary war.i cant accept\nthat people who says they are open-minded can accept country can make a\nchild a bomber. 300,argo,robocop2014 and etc everywhere you see Iranian\nin a film they are assassin and Americans are angel. robots kills\ncitizens but people are happy that the reporter is safe. at the\nbeginning of that ... you will see Amaricans army captured Iran and\nthey kill a boy w ho has a knife and aim it to a iron body whit no\nwarning.whats the aim off all these attacks to other countries,if its\nfor people safety,you are just killing them so you are the real\nthreat.If you want your own benefit ,why you kill your own people by\nsending then to war zone.If you believe in human right you mustn't kill\nInnocent people,and if you don't believe in that you must not speak\nabout it.the film was not fair at all.\n"
"\nThis movie took what was awesome about the original - the individual\nwho no one cares about, especially the corporation, and abusing his\nhumanity and destroying how well that worked.<br><br>Instead of the Murphy who is just that new guy who doesn't fit in, and\ninstead of the corporate America vision of not caring about anyone, not\neven board members and twists it into a feel-a-thon about how precious\nfeels are.<br><br>I think I've seen more violent, moving, thought provoking Care Bear\nmovies.<br><br>What worked so well were a lot of things. First, Murphy finds himself\nafter becoming robocop, and overpowers his controllers. Second, Murphy\nbecomes more human instead of the pawn in the system that we all relate\nto. <br><br>The opening scene of the original movie highlighted a lot of dynamics\nabout how little Big America cares not about the individual. This movie\ntook a steaming dump full of political problems on the audience\ninstead, rubbing it in to ensure it stains with the TV show like\nopening.\n"
"\nThis movie was not worth watching if you've seen the original robocops.\nThe main issue is being rated PG as opposed to it's predecessor with a\nR rating. I remember watching Robocop as a child and being traumatized\nby what I saw, this made the film serious. Robocop 2014 is just a\nsimple action flick with no meaning except for an opportunity to show\noff graphics.<br><br>If this is the first Robocop you watch, than I can certainly imagine a\nperson would enjoy the concept, but nothing will top off the original.\nThis movie could have been a great ideal and it was ruined by trying to\nplease a larger audience.\n"
"\nI saw the original when I was a kid. It was ground breaking stuff.\nUltra violent, topical and very funny. The remake couldn't hope to\ncompete, but this doesn't even come close.<br><br>This version spends most of its time in Murphy's head, looking at his\nperspective. Good in theory but quite dull as a movie.<br><br>Robo cop massively outguns the bad guys, and Detroit never looks like\nit really needs his help anyway.<br><br>There is a running theme that having robots on the street is bad - I\nwanted to agree but the film never really articulated a reason why this\nwould be bad.\n"
"\nUnfortunately this rebooted version of the 1980's classic, Robocop, was\nthe exact opposite in every way. In the original, the plot and the\ncharacters were fantastic but the direction and effects were plagued\nwith the typical 80's garbage that ruined so many potentially great\nfilms of that decade. This movie had decent effects and improved\nacting, at least from Abbie Cornish, who delivered a great performance,\nand Michael Keaton, but they ruined what made the plot fantastic.\nUltimately, a great story with terrible acting and effects will always\nbe better than a horrible story with fancy editing. Overall I was very\ndisappointed.\n"
"\nBasing the following information found on the IMDb website on 2nd June\n2014 ***Budget: $100,000,000 (estimated) Opening Weekend: $25,061,581\n(USA) (14 February 2014) Gross: $58,607,007 (USA) (16 May 2014) **\nHaving seen the figures above, it speaks for itself! Surely the idea is\nfor a \"Gross to out weigh the Budget!. The idea of a reboot was worthy,\nbut it clearly hasn't been successful enough, otherwise the \"Gross\",\nwould be bigger!! Which is a real shame , considering the cast that\nthey had. Interestingly enough, the concept of Robocop is more possible\nnow then 20 + years ago, in terms of being REAL. Is it worthy of a\nsequel? I don't think so?<br><br>If you like your sci-fi and action films then its passable, but if your\nbig into your sci-fi films, probably best to avoid it. I give this film\n3 out of 10.\n"
"\nThere's multiple plot strands gathered here into a union. I won't give\nyou any hint but you'll get it when you see it. Nowadays, movies are\nshort on originality. But, in this case, you won't give a thing about\nit.<br><br>Premise: An inexperience military officer was sent to war to fight an\nalien race invading the earth. In the middle of the battlefield, he got\ninto an accident which causes him to go robo- a loop that repeats each\nmoment when flesh becomes metallic.<br><br>The basis of the plot looks familiar... That could be a big problem. On\nthe contrary, it succeeded to provide a big summer blockbuster\nsatisfaction. The pacing is perfect, the acting is perfect. Oh, and did\ni mention the effects? It was ragin'! See this movie with low\nexpectations (BluRay or HD3D doesn't matter)...\n"
"\nSlickly made, remains reasonably faithful to the original story, but\nwrong choices of actors mark it down. Samuel Jackson as the news caster\nis so wrongly cast,and Michael Keaton just doesn't come across a a\nbillionaire - more an eccentric scientist- and the leather clad\nimmaculately made up (even when hubby is on his death bed)Abbie Cornish\nisn't convincing. In fact trouble shooter Jackie Earle Haley is the\nbest cast.It starts of pretty well in Iraq(or is it Iran)but dithers as\nit moves on.Also the special effects, considering the excellent effects\nin the 1987 movie aren't that outstanding 27 years later. All in all,\nan entertaining action movie that isn't going to linger in your mind\nfor too long.\n"
"\nLet's be realistic, if this is a remake of a blockbuster then it\nbecomes impossible not to make comparisons with the perfect version of\n80's.<br><br>The plot is clever, the special effects are attractive but there's a\nlack of emotion. It seems like characters are not felling it,\neverything becomes mechanical and fake.<br><br>There are many action sequences, maybe replace some by intelligent\nnarratives would have done better.<br><br>I missed some essential details of original version. Where's the\nemblematic gun spinning?!<br><br>So, It's a functional film but doesn't deserve much attention.\n"
"\nThe movie starts on a strong note with Samuel L Jackson playing the PR\npuppet and viewers getting the impression that a large greedy\ncorporation is willing to unleash drones on innocent people for law\nenforcement, you get a good first impression with the shot in Tehran.\nThe suspense is well maintained for the first one hour. But then the\nplot collapses as Robocop gets more interested in dissecting his own\npast and pursue those who have wronged him. I was left wondering if\nrevenge makes a better plot than crime fighting. It is also confusing\nto keep track of who is dying and who is just getting stunned. I also\ncould not figure out if the CEO was involved in the death of the Human\nRobocop. So all in all a pretty average film.\n"
"\nI have to split this review into 2 part. 1. If you didn't saw the\noriginal movie yet, then this will be a fair action movie. CGI effect\nand storyline good and acting also pass the test. The tempo of the\nmovie is good with very boring parts (seems American movies always have\nsome unnecessary love scenes).<br><br>2. If you already saw the original movie you'll be somewhat disturbed\ndue to changes (Lewis, the rank of Murphy, the base of the story,\netc.). I missed Verhoeven naturalist vision of future Detroit, the raw\nbrutality and beat-up environment. Also, while Peter Weller was ideal\nfor the role of Alex Murphy, Joel Kinnaman is somewhat easy compared to\nWeller. And one really important thing (from my point of view): the\nweaponry of Murphy doesn't has the character, the style which it has\nbefore.<br><br>At the end its worth to watch, but won't be a classic like its\npredecessor.\n"
"\nRobocop (2014) had some interesting ideas behind it but it's hard to\nkeep the comparisons to the original version out of mind especially\nwhen the original is far superior and that's ultimately the problem\nwith the new Robocop, not enough new ideas to warrant the remake.<br><br>The bad guys aren't as memorable or menacing. A real let down, there.\nThe action isn't as heavy or gore-filled but it's all very contemporary\nand fast-paced with lots of explosions, fancy gadgets and CGI which\nkeeps it from being boring by any means. The supporting cast in Gary\nOldman, Samuel L Jackson and Michael Keaton are all very good while the\nyounger and main cast just seem to fall flat and just seem to be\nrunning through the motions of a very familiar story.<br><br>Overall, it had its moments. A well-executed, but by the numbers action\nmovie but ultimately nothing special or memorable here to rave about.\nAgain hard not to compare to the original which has a ton of re-watch\nvalue, whereas Robocop (2014) doesn't.<br><br>6/10\n"
"\nI loved all the original Robocop movies. All single one of them. If you\nare like me, and compare the remakes with the originals, you are not\ngoing to like this flick. With so many FX, CGI and other endless\npossibilities of special effects, how come the FX from the original\nmovies were much entertaining than these? I'm not saying that they were\nbetter, just more appropriated to the movie and to the scenes. Someone\nthought about José Padilha to direct this movie because someone\nremember the \"favela storming police attacking scenes\" from Tropa de\nElite. It's reminds you when you watch some action scenes, multi\ntargeting and shooting, bullets flying sequences. A little\ndisappointing. A weak, non original enough, remake.\n"
"\nFirst, don't go to the theater expecting to see the 1987 classic with\nnew visuals. It is a different movie with the same core story (cop\nkilled, cop turned Robocop, Robocop solves crime) and core elements but\nwith new face. At the higher layer, it is a big social/political\ncommentary on corporate and media manipulation and politics. At the\nmiddle layer, it is a good story about instrumentalization of humanity\nand science by corporations. At the lower layer, it is about the\ntransformation of a man into a thing and the family broken by this\nprocess.<br><br>I thought this movie would be bad but it is pretty good. 9 just because\nit has a few minutes when the pace slows down a bit but it comes back\nwith guns blazing.\n"
"\nNow I've never seen the first original Robocop but by golly was it on\nmy 'to watch' list. The raving about the original made me watch this\nrevamp when it came out on Netflix in the same year of release.<br><br>I found this film to be a high budget movie with a script that doesn't\nreally have as much depth as I'm sure the original has. As a newbie, I\nwas somewhat confused why the doctor acted by Gary Oldman was so\nsympathetic, why they had to choose a 'disabled person' to enter the\nrobot and the reasoning behind the anger portrayed toward the end of\nthe film for Robocop. Yes, I understand there was some sort of dark\nbehind the books work by the cops to get the character to be Robocop,\nbut this storyline just falls a bit flat for me. <br><br>Overall, I was left somewhat confused by this film. The storyline was\ntoo much on a whim and didn't offer the depth I'd expect from such a\nbig name. Entertaining none the less, the big budget Robocop gets a 7\nfrom me.\n"
"\nAnd I totally enjoyed the ride of this Robocop. The fact that I'm not a\ndie-hard franchise fan probably helped.<br><br>What this movie promised - high concept, action, quality special\neffects, classic good vs evil story, suspense, sensory bombardment, big\nname actors, emotional engagement, good old entertainment, it delivered\nall of these. And more. The \"manned robot or not\" theme is particularly\ntimely too.<br><br>I also didn't expect any actor to shine through a veiled - as in\nhelmet-ed superhero character, and a cold, disembodied, metallic one at\nthat. Joel Kinnaman delivered not only physical action, but more depth\nand emotional content than Ryan Reynold will deliver in a thousand\nyears.<br><br>I would give this Robocop an 8 for overall entertainment value, but add\n2 to counter all the bashing.\n"
"\nIn some ways better than the first movie, in some ways worse.\nAltogether this is quite a satisfying remake, which keeps fairly close\nto the plot of the original, but with a few acceptable changes. <br><br>This is Robocop and still quite a violent film, but to be honest I felt\nthat the violence was toned down in comparison, which I was pleased\nabout since it can stand up without it.<br><br>If you take younger members, the bit where you see what is left of\nMurphy outside of his suit can be quite disturbing, so I would advise\nnot taking the more squeamish.<br><br>If people are genuinely marking this done just because it is a remake,\nthey are being ridiculous. I enjoyed the original movie, but it was in\nno means perfect and this is an reasonable remake and worth a watch.\n"
"\nermmm I went to see Robocop's last Saturday and I've really enjoyed the\nmovie. I don't understand what's the whole wining around that. It's a\ndifferent movie, a reboot not a remake. Get over it! We cannot compare\nthis one with the old one. I really love the old Robocop but I also\nthink that the new Robocop is a good movie. Lacks violence and more\nblood but it's not a kiddy movie. I bet if Jose Pandilha got to choose\nto include violence he would, that outcome is probably due to some\npressures from the studios in order to have a more \"comercial\" version.\nResuming: go and see Robocop without having to compare with the old\none. Go and see like it was a new movie. And I wonder if there's anyone\nhere that's brave enough to say that this movie is better than Robocop\n2 or 3? Those yes... are shitty movies!\n"
"\nIt was a great experience. I was waiting for this one for quite some\ntime and it almost definitely didn't disappoint. <br><br>The movie is the remake of the original RoboCop series, and proved to\nbe every bit as entertaining as the old one.<br><br>The plot is on the lines of the original movie. Based in the year 2028\nwhere a cop Alex Murphy, played by Joel Kinnaman (from \"The Killing\"\nfame), is investigating an illegal arms racket that goes real deep, and\nin this process gets hacked. <br><br>In the interim Omni- Corp (part of OCP), a robotics organization which\nhas successfully launched robots &amp; droids all over the world except the\nUS is planning to launch in America as well. And in this process are\nlooking for a human volunteer to build a cyborg; And officer Murphy\nturns out to be the final choice.<br><br>The movie is more or less the old story but with an exciting new\npackaging. The highlight is the new black-suit. The agility level of\nthis Robo is also much better along with the bike.<br><br>The action is superb.<br><br>Well done team.\n"
"\nOK giving it a 10 is pushing it, but i cant understand why people are\nhating this movie just because it is not similar to the 1987 RoboCop.<br><br>it wasn't violent enough, it was a lot of CGI, his suit is lighter and\nBLACK, the lack of a proper villain, ED-209 being a useless piece of\nequipment etc etc. well i do agree with the last point but other than\nthat there is nothing wrong with the movie. The lack of a proper\nvillain is blurs the line between good and evil and it adds to the\nalready confused persona of RoboCop, CGI was decent and didn't look\nextremely far fetched which is again not a bad thing. As for the movie\nnot being violent enough, i guess i was expecting more from a Jose\nPadilha but it isn't as bad.<br><br>its a decent action flick deserving a 6.5 - 7 My 10 rating is just a\nresult of all unreasonable 1's and 2's in the reviews\n"
"\nMost people who trash this movie hate it for the following reasons <br><br>1. Franchise fan boys Very Upset things are not done their way.<br><br>2. Not enough blood spilled. Angry children crying in protest.<br><br>3. How dare Weller criticizes Unmanned War Machines. Might makes right.\nSuck it up.<br><br>4. Joel Kinnaman is simply too hot to handle. Beta boys cannot take it.<br><br>But most people I know enjoyed this movie because <br><br>1. We are not fan boys or girls. We just want to watch a good movie.<br><br>2. No angry-vampire-feeding with excessive blood spilling. Just pure\nadrenaline-pumping action and rush.<br><br>3. Sane people understand the urgency of facing up to the Unmanned War\nMachines Situation we've been trained to avoid.<br><br>4. Joel Kinnaman is hot alright, but also one emotionally DEEP actor.<br><br>10 out of 10 for entertainment value, and public education value.\n"
"\nRobocop didn't live up to my expectation. I was hoping for lots of good\naction and some thrilling story but unfortunately title in review lacks\nboth. Movie starts well but loose it all in 20 minutes. Story has lot\nof holes and pace is also slow as compare to other movies of same\ngenre. Normally action movies don't have complex stories but Robocop\nstory it too shallow. Direction is OK but nothing special.<br><br>Acting wise, this is OK film but Michael Keaton and Gary Oldman is\nstanding out in this department. Rest look like just to fill space.\nAction stunt wise, there was nothing special at all, although I was\nhoping for something good because budget of film is 130 Mil. I don't\nknow where they have spent all this money.<br><br>Its a very mediocre film. Nothing memorable in it. Its OK for one time\nwatch but its absolutely OK if you let it pass. You will miss nothing.\n"
"\nI went to the theater and watched this movie. Considering I never\nwatched Robocop before because I never really wanted to, I decided to\ngive the remake a shot. I fancy the story surrounding his injury was\nwell done. The part of the story of him being built into Robocop was\noutstretched. I think that part could have been cut down a little. The\nend with the guy of the Corporation becoming the villain was not\ndisappointing just perhaps a little misplaced because his character\ndidn't seem like he would shoot the family just like that. I think that\ncould have been done better. The fraction with Samuel Jackson talking\nthat smack was funny and ridiculous. I gave it a B because the family\ndrama was good, the reason for his injury was good, the political drama\nwas good but I guess nothing was excellent or just sterling. Thanks for\nreading\n"
"\nThis won't win any awards or any box office weekends but it will keep\nyou entertained. I never saw the original so I can't compare the two\nbut I sat there and enjoyed the action sequences and the few comedic\nlines that were delivered.<br><br>The special effects were well done and the acting was better than\nexpected. It's a good and talented cast and I think that helped this\nmovie be better. I recently read that the director wanted an \"R\" rating\nfor this movie and I kinda wish I saw it. The action was good but I\nfeel like they could've taken in farther.<br><br>If you don't want to pay the 10 dollars to see this I understand but\nonce its out on bluray and DVD give it a shot.\n"
"\n(No spoilers) I really don't understand those whom complains about this\nfilm. It's a remake, made almost 30 years later than the original.\nCan't be the same. It isn't intended to be the same. It's more mature,\nsince the 80s had been more \"innocent\", even if more innovative for\nsure.<br><br>So that's Robocop, again, and it has been filmed to get a more precise,\nmore modern, filming of a cyborg who has been hurt maintaining and is\nasked to maintain the law. Even Detroit has changed, and this is damn a\nnews. So, I did appreciate this movie for what it has intended to offer\nto the spectators.<br><br>Criticism? Lot of. Since the theme it's more actual(military drones and\nsuch looks more realistic today than they were thirty years ago,\nright?) Then I had to expect something even more cruel and realistic\nthan this, that somehow still is romantic and utopic.<br><br>But, as a product, the new Robocop movie offers very good (science)\nfiction material to watch and enjoy. A must see for all the fans of the\ngenre.\n"
"\nI never liked the original Robocop films. That probably marks me as a\nheretic or something, but I always saw the films as mindless action,\nwith none of the draw of the clever asides of other sci-fi actioners\n(though I do love the sun screen 4000, or whatever it was - made me\nlaugh).<br><br>This one, however, was smart, at times touching, and ultimately\nrewarding. It touches on the use of robotics in modern warfare,\nAmerican imperialism, and the role of the person in a corporate world.\nIt never goes too deep, and has some lovely action sequences (the\nshoot-out in the dark was great, if completely stupid) but still\nmanages to be reasonably thought provoking. I really liked the framing\nof a modern Fox-News-Alike as the main narrative drive, and Samuel L.\nwas as fiery as ever. <br><br>This was an entertaining movie that provided a lot more food for\nthought than I anticipated - I enjoyed it, and what more can you ask?\n"
"\nThe whole movie had no head splitting or edge of seat moment; also the\nend was so predictable that you could see it 20 mins before end. The\nend needed to be more dramatic and the entire storyline needed\nsomething more AVATARISH + BATMAN. The storyline is set in future with\nall the weapon systems displayed they could have done a better research\non upcoming weapon system time-lines and predictions.\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ The technology curve\nsupport of the time-line of year 2028 is laughable at the best.\nAlthough the flip coin character us the son but the storyline doesn't\ndo any justice to David Murphy's character.<br><br>At least they could have one something equivalent if not top of iRobot.\n"
"\nNot much to say. They had a big budget, great actors in support roles\n(Michael Keaton, Jackie Haley, Gary Oldman), the crafting is good,\npacing not bad, etc. Just no plot whatsoever.<br><br>They attempted a character study but got lost along the way trying to\nmake it all about the action too. Kind of fails on both fronts. The\noriginal movie, though deemed classic by some with retro rainbow\nglasses, really isn't that great either but it does make a very strong\nstatement about society and violence and the lead actor had way more\nscreen charisma.<br><br>The movie gets better when Michael Keaton or Jackie Haley are on screen\nand you get some glimpses of what this could have been but those\nmoments are few and far between.<br><br>This comes across as a paint by numbers focus grouped affair that at\nthe end of the day has very little to say and not enough spectacle.<br><br>Save your money and skip this one.\n"
"\nYou cant see this movie expecting to see the same as the original with\nnew technology... This is a fresh view of Robocop and is intended to\nuse today's social problems to create a sarcastic one in the films.\nDetroit isn't in the same place it was when the first Robocop was made.<br><br>For me this films get more in the man vs machine fight, we see a\nstruggling fight from Murphy's side but also the wife and kid. We see\nMurphy struggling to accept that he is just 10% human on his new body.\nLike others I wanted a bit of more action but the one it had was nice\nand made Robocop a nice movie for young people, unlike the first film\nthat was a bit of too violent for kids.\n"
"\nThis movie takes some elements of the old Robocop and creates a whole\nnew story.<br><br>The city is still Detroit, the cop is still Alex Murphy, but the movie\nis based in the world we live today, not the 70's. It approaches\nsubjects such as illegal vigilance by the state, the impact of machines\nover our lives, police corruption, etc.<br><br>In a sense, I feel this movie is way more adapted to our reality than\nthe old one. It is not meant to be overly violent. It is not meant to\nbe overly goofy. It IS meant to have a storyline that makes sense.<br><br>The only ones that are bitching about this movie are the hipster\n\"fanboys\" that wanted to see everything as the original one. As Pat\nNovak said: \"Cut the crap!\"\n"
"\nwell lets just get right to it.......this movie is a waste of\ntime....don't get me wrong..i totally love the original Robocop, but\nlike always Hollywood went all Hollywood on a remake....they took\neverything good from the original and destroyed it, its 2 hours of\nboring drama and nothing good or better from the original it's well\ndone in effects but so boring at that the only good thing about this\nmovie is Gary Oldman that really does some nice acting but choosing\nJoel Kinnaman for The main dude, epic fail, bad acting and no feel for\nthe part........this is the story of everything u don't want to\nsee....its a drama about Alex family, and a boring one at that....i\ndon't have the will to get angry again...so lets just leave it like\nthat.....if u love the real one, DON'T WATCH THIS.....it's a real slap\nin the face of real Robocop fans......shame on u Hollywood.....<br><br>Hollywood=it's all about the money.\n"
"\nHi there... i wont make it long so just follow...<br><br>People are bashing this one all over the internet and i have been\nlooking here in IMDb every time I'm thinking about watch a movie, and i\ngot really low expectations on this one because of this....<br><br>This movie is not going to win any Oscars (if thats worth anything\nanymore) but IT IS A GOOD MOVIE FOR WHAT IT IS....<br><br>This is a remake of a classic been adapted to our time and with enough\ndifference to stand alone while have enough references so that all who\nloved the first one has a chance to watch Robocop in action once more.<br><br>So this is it my first and i think only review on this site...<br><br>Kinamann was good enough, he wasn't believable at first but gets true\njust fine when he becomes Robocop...<br><br>Want an advice? GO, SEE FOR YOURSELF AND MAKE YOUR OWN MIND!<br><br>ME IM GLAD AND I WOULD BuY THAT FOR A DOLLAR!<br><br>PS: sorry for my English\n"
"\nI'll admit when I first heard about this film being remade, I wasn't\nvery thrilled. To be honest, I was dreading it to tell the truth. But,\ncolor me wrong!!! lol. This version of the title character was a\nrefreshing take on said character. Joel Kinnaman did a great job as\nAlex Murphy/Robocop. What really sold this film for me was how much\nheart it has. The filmmakers never take the audience for granted. You\nfeel Alex Murphy's pain and you sympathize with him. Unlike in the 1987\nfilm, you don't really find out how his family is affected. In here,\nit's the opposite. I'm very glad the filmmakers did not go over the top\nwith the violence. Most importantly, I was most appreciative of the\ntime the filmmakers took to establish the characters. That's what will\nmake me want to see this film a second time. I think Paul Verhoeven\nwould be proud of what the filmmakers did here. I can imagine that the\nfilmmakers will want to consider a sequel at some point. If they stick\nwith the formula that made this film work, they'll be just fine.\nRobocop Lives!!!\n"
"\nI like the original Robocop and after I read the reviews for this one\nwas a little disappointed. I guess many of the reviewers were hoping\nthe 2014 version would be an exact remake of the original. I decided to\ngo watch it with an opened mind determined not to compare it to the\noriginal, and I loved it. I really loved what the movie stood for. <br><br>The portrayal of Murphy's family did seem a little insignificant but it\ntied into the bigger picture. I liked the progression of Murphy's\ndecline from a cyborg with a conscience to basically a robot with human\ntissue. What can a billionaire with everything want? More billions of\ncourse, and he will stop at nothing to get it. Omnicorp did about\neverything they could to try to convince the American people that they\nshould have androids patrolling the streets and they pretty much\ndestroyed Murphy and his family's life to reach their goal.<br><br>The movie's main goal is not about action or things blowing up it's\nabout the insatiable greed of corporate America. Oh and Samuel Jackson\nbrought his usual flair to this movie as well.\n"
"\nIts understandable the first part being slow and steady to give all\nproper meaning why Robocop is being made and then action . But action\nand chase being done just one way by Robocop and shown less was not\ngood as film makers should have devoted more time showing the\ncapabilities of Robocop a lot more, and I felt it was shown all too\nfast . Loved some thrilling action scenes and good different story . As\nI am a big Robocop Indian fan so I will give one extra rating as film\nmakers made the effort to bring him back after so long! So big thanks\nto them and would highly appreciate the second part very soon as there\nshould be one for more different action to be done by him with more\nplotting and story, with better looks of the Robocop suit .\n"
"\nThe new RoboCop is a surprisingly good and entertaining sci-fi action\nthriller that appeals to the human heart by conveying emotions and the\nhumanity side of Murphy, the main character who eventually becomes the\ntitled cyborg law enforcer, ROBOCOP. Though the story will take\nexpected turns and even if you know how the movie is going to end,\nRobocop is a must watch for some amazing graphics. Though once can\neasily tag this an action or sci-fi movie, one can not neglect\nemotional aspects of the film. Joel Kinnaman has played the Robocop\nnicely, balancing between human 'strength' and machine's 'emotions'.\nYeah, I get it, it's a reboot of a perfectly good 80s movie that nobody\nreally wanted, but it's a really good one! Though there is no\nsuggestion towards end about Robocop2, I'm sure there will a sequel\nsoon!! My rating - 7.5/10\n"
"\nThis director has no idea who is robocop,all of the new cast has ruined\nthe 1987 unique production,I am so disappointed to see the hero of my\nchildhood movie that I was watching 60 times a month in this remake,I\nwish I was the director,I would have done better!! The start has no\nclear story about the cop. Big part of the movie especially in the\nmiddle of it was very boring! The end of the movie was so bad. You get\nout of the theatre feeling something was very missing,something wasn't\nright. The movie will be making a very good profit for sure only\nbecause of its name and people got tricked thinking they are going to\nwatch an interesting entertaining remake. Also most of the people that\nthey are going to watch it are the fans of the original movie and they\nwill for sure be very disappointed. Be sure all of the good reviews are\nfrom people that do not know who is Peter weller and have not seen the\ngreat performance in the original robocop.not only the performance but\nthe directing skills and the scenes sequence. The bottom line \"This\nremake needs a remake!!\"\n"
"\nOne of my all time favorites. It showcases a future technology that may\nbe possible. A perfect blend of AI and humans; help through medical\nscience. And that will result in better security than present day. Life\nwill be much better for security personals. It also, showcases how a\nhuman brain supersedes AI, if case be.<br><br>Robocop solving his own case will be a turning point. Enjoyed the scene\nwhere he recreates his own accident. And yes he solves his own case\nsystematically, unveiling the defects in the system. <br><br>There should a sequel showcasing his current capabilities and additions\nshall be must.<br><br>Graphics is good. Enjoy the movie. :)\n"
"\nI had low expectations for this reboot, however I was pleasantly\nsurprised. It has a strong cast full of talent. Michael Keaton, Gary\nOldman, Jackie Earle Haley and Michael Kenneth Williams all have good\nto great moments in the film. The action is entertaining and the plot\nis easy to follow. The major hole in this movie is Robocop's back\nstory. The movie is about a man that is being stripped of his emotion,\nyet the director does little to establish why he is connected to his\nfamily. Overall it is a good rainy day watch. I would watch a sequel if\nit came out. I do not agree with the harsh reviews I read on this site.\nTrue it does not have the grit and noir feel of the original, however\nit is no worse than Robocop's III.\n"

"\nThis movie is the quintessential shoot 'em up of the modern age with a\nhefty dose of stealthy reverse-moralizing. Strong right-wing 'news'\nstyle pathos and false intellectualism is interspersed with patriotic\nfervor in the news segments given by Novak (Samuel L. Jackson). This is\nthat reverse-moralizing I was talking about - a carefully crafted anti-\ndrone movie. This movie is the \"logical\" extension of the use of\nwarfare drones abroad making it onto the streets of America. The case\nmade against corporate corruption and graft, interwoven with\nineffectual or pocket politicians, is strong here. But if you're just\nlooking for a shoot 'em up - this should work well for you. And if that\nisn't enough, at the very end we get to watch Samuel L. Jackson\nscreaming bleeped out obscenities at the camera. All in all, the\nperfect end to a movie like this. :)\n"
"\nDamn good movie cant understand how viewers give 1 star and beat it up?\nDon't listen to them I watched Robo 10+ times and the remake follows\ntrue to the original story. A remake isn't supposed to be a exact\nREMAKE where is the fun in that! In some ways its better than original.\nI feel this version is more dark and mysterious than its predecessor.\nActing and effects are great Joel Kinnaman plays the part so good. His\nversion of Murphy is smarter and more emotional than original Murphy.\nAlso, how can you go wrong with cast including Gary Oldman, Michael\nKeaton and Samuel Jackson. I've seen new version couple times and plan\non watching many more. Give it a chance your next Sci-Fi Saturday night\nmovie.\n"
