i love this film
it does the character of spiderman justice
andrew garfield was chosen perfectly as peter parker
after spiderman 3 we needed a change and this is a great fresh take on the character
it is more comic accurate than the raimi films such as the web shooters and gwen stacy as the love interest instead of mary jane
i liked the new suit because it looked like a teen could make it
the villain the lizard was a great first foe for spider man
uncle bens death scene made me want to cry and garfields reaction was sad
i love how gwen comforted him and flash didnt bully him out of sorrow
i love how peter went from being a vigilante hunting his uncles killer to a hero fighting all crime
first off andrew garfield emma stone martin sheen sally field and dennis are all perfect in their roles
this movie is very different from the original except for the origins which can obviously not be changed
the action is what spidey fans have always dreamed off
the chemistry between peter and gwen is priceless
new and interesting story lines are created to be explored through out the trilogysaga
the new suit is great in my opinion but it has been changed for the sequel yet either way i like them both
andrew garfields emotional scenes are unbelievable
finally i absolutely loved the humor
and the ending left me satisfied and happy yet excited for what is yet to come
overall this is an origin that succeeds on many levels and out does the previous origin which is still great and only spiderman 2 is equal in its acting style humor action and theme
the amazing spiderman came out in 2012 but i only saw it about a year after its release but before amazing spiderman 2 came out in theaters
i enjoyed andrew garfield allot more than tobey maguires performance as both peter parker and spiderman
andrew had the wise crack of spiderman because if you read the comics or watch any of the cartoons youll see spiderman as a wise cracker and as peter parker he has nerdy but he is more than just a nerd
he was also a teenager who had friends
emma stone was a much better romantic lead than kristen dunst
and i thought the action was much better than the first spiderman
overall i give the amazing spiderman a 9 out of 10 a fantastic movie
i know people spidey fans will disagree with what i am about to say but i think that the original spider man trilogy is like avatar in the sense that they are good movies but are completely over rated
they dont have anything on other superhero films such as say the dark knight trilogy the reason why i preferred the new one was because it was less corny and more satisfying than the originals
the only part i was disappointed with was the fact that peter parkers school bully became his friend at the end because i was glad to see how they made peters bully was sorry for beating him up when it came to a life and death matter but when he became his friend it was taken to far and felt to corny
other than that it was defiantly worth seeing
i enjoyed this movie because it was a superhero film with many funny bits
i like to be able to laugh while watching a movie not just watch loads of cgi action
i also liked the fact that the villain wasnt killed just defeated and put in prison giving him a second chance
however i do believe that was partially do to the fact that the producerswriters wanted something to write a future film on
i think that andrew garfield and emma stone did exceptionally in their roles
garfield really seemed to actually be peter parker and i love to see that in a film
although this movie is a superhero movie i do believe it was geared toward a younger audience unlike the dark knight
the fact that spiderman is a teenager in this one and that it is not nearly as dark as some other films certainly convinced me of this
i recommend this to anyone who enjoys action and superheroes
side note denis leary was great
this was the first super hero movie i have ever seen in theaters and let me tell you  spider man is my new favorite super hero
the plot was amazing no worries no spoilers
if you want to know the story watch it
the acting was phenomenal  my friends and i significantly underestimated andrew garfields performance before seeing the movie
i want to see it again and again and again  he is amazing as peter parker
emma stone is amazing as gwen and the other actors and actresses will blow you away
martin sheen was the one that surprised me the most
love this movie
if i could id give it an 11
a must see
the surprise hit of the summer
everyone was looking forward to the new batman movie this 2012 summer
batman turnout being a bust and spiderman is the surprise hit batman was not
i am tired of comic book movies
the comic book movie has become the seen it done it before with the same old c g i effects
however i went to see the amazing spiderman because people keep saying mike you got to see this film
after avoiding spiderman over the summer i finally saw it
what a great film
spiderman is a great film because the movie is excellently direct were the old story is excellent told with new twists
the actors blend the character development into the story perfectly
martin sheen played a perfect uncle ben
the 3 d effect added to the c g i and give a new excitement to the usual special effects
the same old story told in a better way
i give the amazing spiderman a nine out of ten
i went to the midnight premiere for the amazing spiderman
wow
i did not like the trilogy because of the lack comedy and tie ins from the comics
i also had great doubts about this movie
but all was good no
amazing
andrew garfield was an absolutely drop dead outstanding choice for peter parker
i didnt see someone try to play peter parker i saw peter parker
emma stone was also a wonderful important part of the movie
rhys ifans as dr
connors was absolutely brilliant and his transformations as the lizards could not be any more creepy
marc webb owned spiderman with the fight sequences and web slinging
the best stan lee cameo of all time
webbs version was overall way better than raimis depiction
the movie stuck with every comic book aspect including the web cartridges and peters first love gwen stacy
a must see movie and it does stick in your mind for a bit
like the raimi versions this one was just as good but i do have points that are negative
1 uncle ben never gets around to telling peter that with great power comes great responsibility this is the single epiphany of any herogood guy and the founding stone of who peter parker goes on to be
2 since in this movie a lot of work went into the stacy story line i would have like to have seen it play out the way it did on the comics when i read about the death of captain stacy
i will never forget his words please god let me not be late those who read amazing spiderman 90 know
otherwise the special effects were done well
acting was on par with the other 3 movies and marc webb did an excellent job directing
peter parker played by andrew grafield was just a teenage student at midtown science university and who was one day went to the oscorp tower to look for his father workmate but instead he found something else that would change his life forever and have to face many changes in his life and also found love with gwen stacy played by emma stone
during his change he encountered so many problem that every others normal teenagers at his age have never encountered before but he knew he alone will have to face and solve those problem at all cost and that is include the way to defeat his powerful enemy that he have never thought before to save and bring back peace to new york city
why
why this film is created
i wish spiderman 4 wasnt canceled
the script was so mess up that andrew garfield was mumbling
the lizard look like a big snake with legs and it kinda look like a dinosaur
uncle ben in this film did not say the most use words by the other uncle ben with great power comes with great responsibility
why he didnt say that
the video game is better then the film
i am a big spiderman fan
ive liked the character and the multiple different forms of media hes been in for years except spiderman 2 and 3
but this movie is utter garbage
the acting was ok i guess but the whole movie was such a bloody drag that it had me feeling slightly sick inside
its worse than spiderman 2 and 3 and i absolutely hate those movies
this one is somehow worse
mainly due to the fact that it takes a more darker tone which is something that doesnt work well with spider mans character
spidermans character is witty and cheesy and this spiderman still has that wit but theres not enough of it
the entire movie is just this really gritty and dark setting which works in some places but it isnt the spiderman we know and love so much
you know what i really want
a spiderman movie that is actually good
because we havent had one in 15 years
i do not recommend this
watch a good marvel movie or the first spiderman
everybody waits for marc webbs films
and spiderman series are the best among them
but while watching this moviea lot of times i said to myself what is going on why this idiot is doing such a thing
i think andrew garfield needs more time to develop his acting
most of the time he over reacts
he does such things that seem stupid to me
no offense but choosing him as a hero of spiderman made angry many viewers
there are different interpretations of spiderman
original being steve ditkos version and then you have others like the ultimate version
spiderman was always witty but marvel toned it up in the ultimate comics almost similar to deadpool without the crazy violence the red and black suited anti hero would bring to the table which is a good thing
parker is a clued up smart guy and when he puts on the mask he tones it up ten fold
without the mask he tries his best to stay humble
interesting concept which this movie tries to capture
maybe they should of called this ultimate spiderman and called the toby maguire movies amazing cause it dont make sense if u know what im saying
this is a decent movie with some good scenes
all the cast are good  leary ifans stone and garfield etc
fight scenes always good in a spiderman movie but there just seems to be something missing
cant watch this over and over again unless spiderman fighting lizard
maybe it was released too soon to the rami ones
this is a colourful film that appeals to all ages its light its funny and its got lots of action
the director marc webb hasnt necessarily tried to make a summer blockbuster this is a strong slice of spider man and is unique from other superhero films
some of the action sequences were a bit goofy and the story line changed little from raimis first spider man but this is a lot more enjoyable
some things have changed from the original spider man to the modern day oneobviously time has moved on so the styles have changed he has a skateboard earphones and hoods that make him more like the modern day spider man
except from the main characterthere is little character development this film is also less realistic in what would happen in the storybut in the end it is a superhero movie
this film isnt too dark or heavy so dont expect a amazing flawless piece of workbut im excited for the sequel and hope to see more of this universe
i hate to admit this but i watched this movie and caught myself quietly cheering toby
a toby
a toby
alas andrew garfield did a fine and i was cheering for his version of spiderman as well
did he do as well as toby a i wont tell a and that is not fare
my feelings on martin sheen and sally field are all over the board a both are great actors in their own rights a but tend to wear their political affiliations on their sleeves like armbands
that being said i am surprised that there wasnt any inyourfaceandnotsohiddenhidden message in the movie
well i guess there actually were some
lets see there was an antiscience  antibusiness themeabut that is the definition of a safe bad guy
the evil big bad scientist or businessman a phew a as long as real criminals are not offended a we are just plain swell
oops sorry back to the movie
the special effects were very well done but did not override the storylineatoo much
the actors all did a good job and the story did keep my interest
i would recommend this movie a highly
again in my opinion this is another movie that should not have been made
i love super hero movies especially spiderman
i really enjoyed the older movies with toby
now a new hero and it all just seemed to go toes up for me
i did not enjoy this movie
i really hate remakes and extensions of movies unless they stay close to the original and carry off the heart of the original movie like pirates of the caribbean like spiderman 2 and 3 with toby
they did not feel like a new movie they were an extension of the one we loved
some movies are just done to death and the changes in actors just seems to sour things for you
i think this is what happened with this movie for me
it becomes a completely different beast then the original
i am no way saying this movie was bad
it was a good movie it just ruined the whole spiderman hero for me
i was in my first year of school when the first spiderman film from 2002 was released
since then it has remained to be one of my favorite superhero films
the second one only got better but the third just stank from start to finish
coming off of that a reboot seemed to be the only way to go but of course they made it too early
its only been ten years since the first from 2002
thats my main complaint the film decides to retell the origin story when im sure most of the audience remembers the first film
aside from that the acting is surprisingly good the villain is pretty good and the action doesnt disappoint
just a couple dumb moments otherwise a welcome reboot that makes me want to see more but please make it better
the actors did an amazing job but have failed to portray their own characters especially andrew garfield
he just doesnt seem to fit in the character of peter parker
another big reason this movie is an absolute waste of time is that it fails to refresh the series
why
well guess what
it had no story
the plot makes it till the half in a very clumsy manner and then it just ends
andrew is an amazing actor but he is just not fit for the role of peter parker
if you are expecting anything better than the previous franchise spider man then forget about it
this one isnt even close to the awesomeness and cinematic delicacies of the previous franchise
i didnt know this but i guess just within the past few years an amazing new tool for making movies has come to the forefront computer generated images
some guy back in an office dicks around on a keyboard for days on end and never has to be at the actual set to make a movie isnt that mindblowing
think about it no need to use film no need to use lighting or makeup or costumes no need for actors no need for writers or directors just get a team of programmers together and let them cobble together a digital file
the future of film making point and click
does that in any way ring hollow to you
does some shtty future of lazy drone programmer film makers bother you at all
when did doing something for real become second rate to a virtual experience
what did you get for what you gave up
the amazing spiderman 2
how did that work out for you
i must say that the casting took a different role and did not cast according to looks
the child at the beginning of the movie looked more like the woman that parker is in love with than parker himself
one must notice that the boy had a round face and very small chin while peter parker had a long face and prominent chin
the woman had a round face and not a prominent chin
the special effects look like nothing but cartoons
i give the special effects people a zero on this film
i could hardly watch this film as it has no capacity to even keep one involved
the fact that there is a sequel amazes me
poorly writtenvery poor acting and the lack of story only shows that comic book people will love anything
this so called movie would be great if a 13 year old child had written the script
the acting is sometimes good and sometimes very bad
the man who plays the father of spidermans love is a very bad actor or he has been given a very bad script
if i was 5 years old
i would love this movie
i didnt think id like this
but i ended up loving it
all the actorsactresses in this film were so good so believable
there was something really believable about the new peter parker andrew garfield
he acted like a true awkward and raw teen
also when i watched the captain america film my girlfriend complained how unrealistic it was that cap adapted to his new body immediately
whereas in this new spiderman film peter parker was ripping out bathroom taps us faucets by accident and shattering glass whenever he shut the door hard again accidentally
it took him time to master his speed and coordination too
it was really really good  really believable
my friend  a longtime marvel fan  told me that this peter parker was more like the one from the comics a true wisecracker
i never intended to watch this film but am so glad that i did
this is a true spiderman film
though i preferred the villains in the tobey maguire films  the green goblin doctor octopus
the current film is like a more serious version of the maguire films
i like this movie very much
it was one of the best marvel movie of 2012
this movie is for the person who like action adventure and fantancy
the special effect on the movie was very nice
it was the remake of older version of spider man with few changes
it has a wonderful graphics
the acting of all the actor of this movie was great
the story was also very nice
the sets was also very nice
this movie is not a waste of time and money
you will enjoy this movie very much
this is great movie from the marvel
it is also a family type film
this movie can be seen by your whole family
so have a try and watch this movie
every thing on this movie was perfect from action to story
i liked the animation of this movie the most
as a boy i loved the first spiderman movie
it got me hyped
it got me obsessed with marvel comic movies
then the second film came around and it got better
the third
well
i liked it
when i heard they were making a reboot i got furious
but when i took some time to calm down i figured i should give it a chance
it was worth it
this makes up for all the faults the trilogy had and the effects were topnotch
granted the effects in spiderman 2 got better they even got an oscar
but the trilogy was cheesy
but it was marketed for kids its suppose to be
this film was more for mature audiences
i loved danny elfmans score in the first two movies but when i read james horner was composing this movie i got even more hyped
and yes the score rocked
the acting is solid the action is awesome the casting is perfect the villain is not overthetop like goblin and doc octopus which is better its just the right superhero movie we needed
it did spiderman a justice
i will pay to see the future sequels
well it is realistic as weird as that may sound but it was pretty good actually i didnt know how i would like andrew garfield as spiderman but he was great
not as good as toby though toby was the quintessential nerd for me
hes awesome in every movie he is in
emma stone was so much better than kristen dunst
i love kristen dunst though she is pretty and likable
a very likable movie and a very likable spiderman if i may add but no jonah jameson these days
dennis leary was a surprize as the police comissioner
i like gwen stacy more now
ive always been more of a kitty pride mary jane kind of a fan but yeah she was good in this movie unlike spiderman 3 which totally sucked i mean what is this sam rami some middle finger to everyone who has ever liked spiderman i think no i know it was
i mean they were going to make 6 of the original ones which is too many i think
5 maybe
i have to say i actually thought this was very good
some people liked it some people didnt
it definitely cant beat the spider man 1 and 2 with tobey maguire kirsten dunst and james franco however i thought that it portrayed the background of spiderman really well
i have also heard that this one follows the comic more
one thing i really liked was the background info given on peters parents
i also liked how he has the web developer in this one rather than pressing on the palm of hand or whatever tobey maguire did in the first one
i also found the villain interestingthe lizard
i thought the scenes where dr
connors turned into the lizard were cool however i do not recommend seeing it in 3d i saw it in 3d i appreciated the story and acting but not necessarily the 3d visuals
andrew garfield did an amazing job as spiderman
he embodied the role so well emma stone did a great job as well
there was good humor in it too but not as good as the original
i thought it was funny when he broke the alarm clock
i also liked the scene with the basketball
this movie was excellent and it amazes me that i continue to see negative reviews so much so i was spurred to write on myself
i really cannot see any element in which this movie does not surpass the original
the actors i believed that garfield gave a role that awesomely fits spidey from the comics he delivered wit smoothly while also embracing peter parkers nerdy persona
emma stone likewise filled her role quite well and her acting abilities surpass kirsten dunst
furthermore the action and special effects
anyone reviewing that says this element of the film is subpar is just being biased and lying to themselves
the fight scenes were incredible and there was so much suspense i was on the edge of my seat sweating
the special fx was delivered so flawlessly everything looked unbelievably realistic and not only that spider mans animations were awesome pure awesome
i had high expectations and was not let down dont let these negative reviews scare you away
this is the long awaited the amazing spiderman
everything about this movie can be summed up in one word nice it is a very elegant movie with very elegant actorsactresses everyone played their roles beautifully
andrew garfield is the next big thing emma stone is destined for greatness everything is nice but i have got to say that it was not as expected
the story line is very predictable it was not creative enough some details were actually kind of useless and exaggerated
to sum up the amazing spiderman is a nice and decent movie and is highly recommended for everybody whether you are a super hero movies fan or not
we all love the original spiderman series
the main lovable character peter parker was played magnificently by tobey macquire
when you watch this you cant help but to compare it with the other series
the new peter parker was played very well but for some reason you just cant see him as spiderman
granted this movie had a nice storyline good visual effects and even a different idea of how he learned to control his power
directing was good but like i said they tried to get us attached to this movie like the original one did but it just didnt catch on
graphics werent bad but they were good enough to make it seem realistic
overall this movie is worth seeing but dont expect it to be as good as the first
firstly i will say a massive well done to the casting director
seriously every actor was so well selected to their respective roles
martin sheen sally field rhys ifans emma stone and by no means least andrew garfield
in fact the most negative thing i will say about this movie is that i will find it hard to watch the other spider man movies the same way now
the movie plays out well and is not in too much of hurry to get to the main storyline
the effects are not too much that you are thinking cgi oh my god
andrew garfield plays spider man so well that he has truly made it his own
watch it and you wont be disappointed
i never really understood why they were doing a remake of spiderman
i was hoping for something stronger in concept perhaps better acting but i was sorely disappointed
i didnt understand why gwen who is a high school student is an intern in some acclaimed lab
i didnt understand how peter came up with that webbing or how people of the city liked spiderman enough to help him out in the end
it made no sense
however the room with the spiders spinning was pretty cool and how peter got bitten was pretty cool but that was about it
the comic relief between uncle ben and aunt may held nothing more than that comic relief
the death of uncle ben in the previous movie was far more poignant than in this movie but it does make for a logical explanation for how spiderman came into being
the back story with how peters parents went missing seemed merely an excuse to make another spiderman movie
it didnt seem all that fleshed out and peter just happens to stumble into all of that mess and mystery is just flabbergasting
so why was this movie made again
it is hard to believe that some die hard fans of spiderman have hated this film
probably because of the recasting
in my opinion it was a good film well i would say better than spiderman
yeah personally i feel what was not in the original film was in tasm
like when uncle ben dies u really feel sorry for peter
in the original one iliterallylaughed at the poor crying boy
the chemistry between emma stone and andrew was also great to watch
in terms of acting everyone played their part quite well
i personally and genuinely feel that andrew garfield is a great spider manpeter parker
it was funnyit was sadit was amazing
it has great scope as a franchise
i think sony took a right decision in rebooting the series
waiting for tasm 2
nuff said
no idea where all the negative feedback has come from
this is a great film
its brilliantly acted and the story flows
the characters behave believably and all in all its much more spider man than the previous
i suspect that a lot of the negative comments on here are due to a love of the previous series but for me they were never that tremendous
spiderman acts much more like spiderman should with his quips and attitude and is far more genuine than the last series
all in all its a great film i thoroughly enjoyed it and found far superior to the new batman that everybody seemed to love so much
would definitely recommend it to anyone
i didnt really like this version dont get me wrong the original wasnt that good either but this one was pretty cheesy compared to the first one i mean cmon
like the part where they line up the crains so he can swing pretty cheesyand the unbelievable part where he picked up someone elses badge and the guy that owns the badge comes and they dont believe its him
really
in a place where they create super spiders and grow arms back they cant create a security system that surpasses someone saying yep im this guy even when the guy came they should have immediately asked for id and then kick peter out
those are just some of the bad things oh yea almost forgot the fake looking cgi
i wouldnt waste 13 to go see this guys if you really wanna see it wait for the dvd
forgot to mention the scenes are predictable
so before i saw the movie i was reading reviews on here and they almost turned me away from seeing this film
there were a lot of bad action stupid dialogue and so forth
but i thank god that i decided to not listen to this reviews as i found them to be completely wrong
i was amazed at this movie it was beautiful in every way and compared to the past three spidey movies
well it would be like comparing george w
bush with abe lincoln it just
is so wrong
this reboot is probably one of the best i have ever seen
the acting was superb andrew made toby look like a horrible actor and emma
well everything she is in is so amazing
and well it doesnt help that she is absolute eye candy and yes she beats out kirsten easily though i do like kirstens acting just not in the spidey movies
after watching sam raimis previous 3 versions i had a lot of expectations on this amazing spiderman
but did this satisfy me
definitely not
first of all there were many scenes which we have already witnessed in the previous trilogy
eg living with uncle and auntuncle diesa scientist mistakenly becomes a bad guy etc
so you want find anything much new hereeven the cg isnt good enough
to maximize the thrill the villain should have a deadly rolebut here dr
corners just makes us laugh at him bcoz the lizard looks funny
why do all villains transform after an experiment getting failure
we have already witnessed it in the previous trilogy too
anyhow im a big fan of spidey
expecting a lot from amazing spiderman 2
the other movies are ok
they stick to the original storyline and the acting was fine  it involved quite a few of my favourite actors
but for me the movies lacked the engagement i had with the comics as a kid when spiderman was my favourite superhero
therefore i got bored to the point that i didnt even bother watching the third film
i am pleased to report that for me this is the spiderman from the comics come to life on the big screen
andrew garfield plays the geeky hopeless clumsy hero who even though he has amazing powers is still a nerd at heart
i did prefer willem dafoes green goblin but i do love rhys ifans who does a great job
the storyline he is attached to is modern and relevant
martin sheen is always a pleasure to watch and i shed real tears when he inevitably dies
i had been put off by the last movies but this was much better than i expected
the only thing that puts me off is that garfield looks so much like tennis player andy murray its weird to see him smile
i came into the theater on the 4th of july and i was so pumped my childhood was spiderman with tobey maguire but then i saw this was a magical film andrew garfield did a wonderful job as peter parker but a magical job as spiderman he was perfect i heard there was going to be a trilogy so i thought lets see if he can pull it off for 2 more films then theres the gorgeous emma stone playing gwen stacy i thought she was so adorable in this film her and andrew are so cute together and im a guy the best part was the acting and the effects are great the lizard just pops out at you and i saw this in 2d so amazing the one thing i hated was it felt like they skipped like 20 scenes
prepare to be amazed
well i certainly was
this was an awesome reboot of the movie franchise and i was very impressed
i have been a spiderfan for years now and was highly anticipating spideys new release
andrew garfield does a better job than tobey maguire simply because garfield looks more like peter does in the original comics it was also lovely to see gwen stacey introduced in the beginning like she should have been in the tobey trilogy
beautiful plot line nice level of sarcastic humor brilliant cg and stunts awesome costume redesign hilarious cameo by stan lee simply amazing
i loved the film
well done marvel
lt3
let me start off by saying i will not spoil the film for you by going into great detail
this movie has been criticized for what i dont know this is truly a masterpiece
the movie stays true to the comics with gwen stacey being peters first love and not mary jane
also his web slingers are introduced because in the comics spidey couldnt create webbing the movie shows peters struggles and build up to become a better person and a great hero just like in the comics
he is also comical and arrogant just like the comics so why hate just because its true to the comic doesnt make it bad the acting is great and garfield played a better spiderman than toby
the action is great and not overly hyped and the story is true and believable
well more believable than tobys spiderman movies
all around this is a great movie and one of the best super hero adaptations of all time
i must say i didnt have much faith but was a bit excited just to know if they would be able to impress me with yet another spiderman
yes loved garfields nerdy clumsy character evolve into a modest hero
two thumbs up for me it was a wild ride 8 always love emma stone although not as a blonde so much but she was a cute match for the movie
i had the opportunity to see garfield in a movie called never let me go
so i knew that he would handle a part like this with ease
it took me a minute to get used to his smaller physic not the muscular toby maguire but yuck who cares about him anymore short cringe i am happy that marc web was able to clean up such a pitiful excuse for a super hero movie blah
so i must say well done
nothing but a remake  nbar
maybe it was just me but since the first spider man was still modern still relevant on the heels of toby macguire and cliff robertson why did we have to make the same ol thing over again
what to see if there was an upside down kiss
cmon
i expected more
the spoilers are
wait
only everything you saw in the last one
thats all
the kid gets bit on the back by a spider albeit digital one kid meets girl  falls for girl uncle gets shot dead etc
etc
couldnt they come up with some creative ideas enough to write a new flippin story
like after several batman movies we were treated and rewarded with batman begins
as a great example
this spider movie version because of the disappointment of watching the same old plot lines makes this nothing but a quick spin with a few new faces and a few changes with story and villain  this ends up being nothing but a cash cow for the production executives and all yall have fallen right into their trap
yes true
me too
except i got in free
the main actor for sm was much better than toby
they girlfriend was a lot better looking than kirston durnst
but the fact of the matter was that the script was terrible
there were a few bit and pieces of action but the main story was a love story or no story
i would recommend you go see the avengers again or wait for batman
or just rent it
i almost fell asleep
i have most likely seen 90 of every movie ever made and am a huge fan of superhero films
saw the avengers 3x in one week
this film is a total yawner
the main villain is just hard to believe and was poorly cast
special effects were ok sound was ok
i was forced due to times to see it in 3d which i hate
but the 3d was actually decent for this film
this reboot had a different feel then the other spiderman movies
the reason being is that this reboot felt more directed towards adults
this is not to say its not appropriate for younger viewers because its perfectly fine for most youngsters
this spiderman has very little scenes that grab at children rather more of a straight action film with no comedy
spiderman was much closer to the original hero in this film and i can and did really appreciate that
i found that spiderman 4 would have probably done just as well as the amazing spiderman
the movie seemed to drag on much longer then needed with a very slow start
i think the only real thing that would appeal to people is that spiderman is not played by tobey maguire which in itself is worth at least a watch
