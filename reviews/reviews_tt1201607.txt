"\nEven though I consider myself to be a huge HP fan I never thought I\nwould actually give a movie from this series straight 10 out of 10.\nJust saw the movie today and the word epic is almost an understatement.\nThis movie really lives up to the promises that have been made. Further\nmore it is (in my opinion at least) the movie that stays most loyal to\nthe book. I did miss some scenes from the book yet nothing relevant was\nleft out. I don't want to give out any spoilers 'cause I don't want to\nruin it for you but if you have read the book it will be very easy to\nfollow and if not - well I think it still makes sense most of the time.\nI highly recommend you to watch it whether you're a fan or not. 10/10\n"
"\nThis movie could not do any better, it ended the Harry Potter series\nwith a bang. It is a good balance from the first part of The Deathly\nHallows. The first part was more of a drama, while part two was action\npacked left and right. This may be my favorite movie of the series,\nthough all of them are equally amazing. I have read the books, and\nthere are definitely major changes in the movie, but I find they fit\nperfectly well with the story, even if it isn't the original plot. Even\nfor those who haven't read the books (why wouldn't you?!), it is\nequally enjoyable. This movie, along with the rest in the series, will\nbe loved for years and years to come.\n"
"\nDeathly Hallows works all right as a film, I suppose. My enjoyment of\nit was just spoilt by the total lack of respect shown by the director\nand scriptwriter for the source mat√©riel. The book had a rather good\nplot and not bad characters. Would it have hurt the film that much to\ninclude any of that. No, all of that was junked to put in scenes that\nhad nothing to do with the plot of the book, twist and slant other\nparts of the book plot, ignore quite a lot of important book points and\nsimply never refer to the main plot point of the book at all. Does\nanyone recall anything about what the Deathly Hallows actually were and\nhow many Harry had, if indeed he had any?<br><br>So OK film, terrible, terrible adaption.\n"
"\nSPOILER ALERT<br><br>I can't believe the way they ended the movie, and when the epilogue\ncame i got up from my seat and walked out early. I hated the epilogue\nin the book, so I decided not to relive the horror. WHY DID THEY NOT\nSHOW HARRY FIXING HIS OLD WAND??? They just forgot that he needs a real\nwand and the one he has that works he breaks in half(elder wand). Well,\nthe movie was so far off from the book... i left angry... angry is not\nthe feeling I should have felt; i am part of the Harry Potter\ngeneration and i feel cheated. I know that many people love the movie\n(most of the people in the theater) and maybe if i see it once more i\nwill enjoy it more. I really hope that they have an alternate ending in\nthe DVD or something to semi redeem it. Why did they add more action\nand take out little things that really made a huge difference to me\nwhen i read the book? This ISN'T supposed to be an action movie, but\nthey sure seem to think it should be...\n"
"\nThe movie is emotionless. And in the climax the movie really lacks of\nheroic feeling, rejoice &amp; hype. Actually the movie is only 2 hours,\nstill got some free time to extend, maybe 10 more minutes in the scene\nwhen Harry Potter died, more time to explain about Master of Death &amp;\nDeathly Hallows. It's so shameful, the essence &amp; main story of the last\nseries, like in the title \"Deathly Hallows\" has no portion in this\nmovie. That's the climax part that should be has some heroic feeling,\n\"wow\" feeling and eager but it's just flat in this movie!<br><br>I understand that they can't put all stories to the movie because of\nthe time limit, but that's one of the main story beside hunting the\nhocrux, ooo my :(<br><br>Through out the movie, I didn't feel anything, sadness, rejoice. It's\njust a flat movie with great action :)\n"
"\nThey went for dramatic visuals and effects rather than follow a good\nstoryline.Lots of changes to the books and scenes added for cinematic\nview.They do not care about the books or the storyline as long as it\nlooks good and they can get in 3d shots.You also wont see a more anti\nclimatic end to a film ever.After a decade of movies they finally kill\nthe most dark evil wizard of all time and nobody gives a monkeys.Well\ndone David Yates for ruining the harry potter franchise.YOU directed 4\nmovies and ruined everyone of them.Order of the phoenix was the longest\nbook but the shortest movie.Half blood prince was butchered beyond\nrecognition.Deathly hallows part 1 was dragged out too long and was\nboring.Lets hope you do not get a chance to ruin anymore movies.\n"
"\nThe series ends, at last. Good riddance. (Until JK Rowling needs money,\nI guess).<br><br>The first Harry Potter was interesting, and good fun. Much of this was\ndue to the novelty of it all. The first Harry Potter introduced us to\nthe characters and concepts of the series.<br><br>The second used that template and provides another plot. The plot was\nfairly mundane and overwrought. At nearly three hours it was\nridiculously long for a linear plot-driven kid's adventure story.<br><br>This is all said, there was a momentum that kept it going. There were\nsome new concepts and characters. All this was enough to make it\nmarginally likable.<br><br>By the third, however, it was a tired formula. From then on it was all\nabout gouging more money from kids and nerds.<br><br>Rating for this last one should be lower, but it gets a bonus point for\nfinally ending this seemingly-never-ending,\nsequels-for-the-sake-of-more-money series.\n"
"\nI have always been a huge fan of the books. The movies have always been\ngood as well, although they have been in steady decline since the\nthird. The story was good, and followed the books reasonably well.\nHowever, its production was over-dramatic, to the point where it was\nquite cheesy at times. I found myself laughing at parts that were meant\nto be taken seriously, as they were too drawn out and tried too hard to\nbe gripping. I also felt some of the acting, particularly that by\nMaggie Smith (Professor McGonagall), was quite horrible. A\ndisappointing finish to the series.<br><br>4/10\n"
"\nit was very much disappointing. the first 5 parts were taken nicely,\nstarted very well.<br><br>in order to make more money, the last two parts of deathly hallow was\ntaken giving out just disappointments.<br><br>in previous parts it took more time to find the ho-crux. it took time\nto find how to destroy it. in hp7 every 15 to 20 minutes ho-crux was\nfound and destroyed.<br><br>hp7 was confusing to understand. my least favorite part is the ending\nwhere harry defeats Voldemort. I was expecting something more. the\npoorest by director David Yates.\n"
"\nAlan Rickman did an awesome job with his portion of the story - his\ncharacter was never separate from the book character. But the story was\nso rewritten as to miss many points that were important to the story. I\nunderstand how writers want to make the story their own from the\noriginal book writer but the value in the story comes from characters.\nHarry Potter was an introvert played by an extrovert actor. There were\nbits of the story from the book such as the final between Voldemort and\nHarry that went so much deeper to me in the book. Some of that value\nwas lost in how the film portrayed the scene.<br><br>Many shots were filmed so dark as to be almost too dark to be seen. It\nwas a dark story but did not need this lack of creative styling. As\nmuch as I love the books is how much I hate this film.<br><br>The only other positive credit I would give this film was to return to\nJohn William's music for the final scene into the beginning of the end\ncredits! Because I appreciated Rickman's and William's parts, I gave\nhigher points than this film deserved.\n"
"\nIn some cases it is unfair to compare a movie to the book from which it\nwas adopted, but when you split a movie into two parts to get as much\nof the story onto the screen, I see no excuse for a bad adaptation.\nAfter waiting years for this finale and after reading all the books, I\nwas sure nothing could be bad about this, until I started watching that\nis. The first half hour - hour or so is not only quite accurate, but\nalso really good, but as the Battle of Hogwats begins everything go\ndownhill. It is all just a blur of people running around screaming and\nshouting inaudible curses at each other until all the character you\nshould care about, but can't in this mess, are dead and not even after\nthe battle has ended do we get to see what happened to all the people\nwe worried about and that at least I felt sorry for while reading the\nbook.\n"
"\nIt is better then the other films by a million (not including deathly\nhallows part 1 which I enjoyed). The basic plot is that Harry,Ron and\nHermione have to find the remaining horcruxes, but the final battle is\ncoming near.When Voldemort dies at the end of the film no one cares\nwhich is really stupid, considering that Voldemort is the reason that\nall those people are dead. Also the bond between Harry and Tom Riddle\nis not explained as well as it is in the book. And the old magic inside\nHarry given to him by his mother, is not explained well enough for\nsomeone who hasn't read the book.Daniel Radcliffe is getting to be a\nbetter actor then he was in the dreary fifth movie. This movies biggest\nproblem is that the battle of Hogwarts <br><br>is way to long, most of the movie is that battle. And even bigger\nproblem then that is the epilogue which dosen't need to be in the book\nor the film and is just a piece of cheese.Overall this movie is a solid\none.\n"
"\nSpellbinding books and boring movies that's how it goes.If you have\nread the books then you wouldn't like the movies.The director tries to\nmake the movie a good watch but it just cant match the books.<br><br>In this last harry potter movie Harry Ron and Hermione search for the\nremaining souls of Voldemort and of course in good vs evil the good\nside always wins.the story has a twist and some nice effects which make\nthe movies a worthwhile watch.<br><br>I would give the movie a six star rating but if you really want to see\nthe movie then go ahead.But,believe me the books are better than the\nmovies.\n"
"\nIt's been 3 years now since I first saw this, but after the very strong\n\"Deathly Hallows Pt. One,\" this movie came off as a rushed and\nincompetently written and directed mess (ironic considering they\ndirected part one). I'm shocked J.K. Rowling put the stamp of approval\non this heap.<br><br>This review won't be long because my complaints with the movie are as\nfollows: Dumbledore's back story was given no attention (hugely\nimportant to the story). the Battle of Hogwarts (pivotal in the book)\nwas glossed over with a few sweeping panoramic shots. Finally,\nVoldemort and Bellatrix's death was ridiculously anti-climactic and\nstupid- looking. I was ready to walk out when Voldemort did a Microsoft\nPowerpoint transition, but for whatever reason I stayed. <br><br>The epilogue was \"cute,\" but still couldn't excuse the mess that was\nthe rest of the movie. I know they were strapped for time, but this\nmovie seriously did nothing but tick me off. I remember people shaking\ntheir heads as they were leaving the theater because they thought the\nending was so bad.\n"
"\nI have been a huge fan of the series for 10 years. I waited so long to\nsee this final film. When it finally started, I felt...almost nothing.\nEverything felt so rushed and all of the actors acted like they just\nwanted to get this film over with. I wanted it to last so much longer,\nbut sadly it didn't. Pretty much all of the important details were cut\nout and barley any of the others characters other than the trio had\nlines. <br><br>Even though it's been a year now, I finally have the guts to say that\nit was a failure and a complete slap in the face. It's something that\ncannot be fixed, all thanks to the director who ruined it. I really\nwanted to love this film, but I couldn't because being the fanatic I\nwas I didn't want to admit how awful it was. I think it's unfair that\nother famous movie finales got to be way longer and more detailed than\nDeathly Hallows Part 2. I will always love the books, but as for the\nmovies, just the first two.\n"
"\nI really trust IMDb for movie rating but for this one... no! thats just\nimpossible too much fanboy! Have you just read the book? Everything is\ndifferent from the book it's a terrible movie and it'S definitely not\nworth the 8/10 that people give. The first 7 movies were really decent\nlike 7/10 not perfect but still really enjoyable but this one is just\nbad. It feel rushed and the ending is terrible because they changed\neverything. I don't get why people love this one so much its just not\ngood at all. There so so much better movie that came out in 2011 and\nthey don't have as much place as this one. I'm disappointed and I hope\nthat eventually the rating will be corrected. I think this movie is\nworth a 5/10.\n"
"\ni was looking forward to seeing the last part of harry potter, i've\nread all of the books and they're amazing. movies have never been as\ngood as books are, but still, i enjoyed watching them, when i saw Harry\nPotter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1 - i was surprised, how good that\nmovie was and was waiting for a better one.<br><br>visually movie is perfect, there are very beautiful colors and\ncinematography is also very nice. although, it's one of the best 3d-s\ni've seen lately. visual effects were very good and i think it's the\nbest part from harry potter series by all means.<br><br>actors were just as usual, not very good, but not horrible. but, i must\nadmit, Ralph Fiennes did awesome job as voldemort.<br><br>it is just what i expected after deathly hallows: part 1, and i'm glad\nharry potter has such an epic, interesting and nice conclusion. i\nadvice everyone to read books at first and then watch movies. you won't\nregret, this is AWESOME!\n"
"\nHarry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part II needed more improvement.\nHarry Potter and the Deathly Hallows is a great book but the movie is\nso horrible but it is good at the same time!<br><br>Harry Potter is a great franchise there are some movies that are\nhorrible and boring like this one and the Half-Blooded Prince.<br><br>Even though I didn't enjoy Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, I was\nwowed in some parts it was great but not so great at the same time. It\nis stuck in the middle.<br><br>I do recommend you go and see it since it is the last movie but don't\nblame me if you are upset by wasting your money, Thank you!\n"
"\nI thought for the final film it was a huge let down. ( i haven't read\nthe books so I'm just seeing it from film perspective) certain scenes\nthat you would expect to see in the film weren't like deaths or certain\nmain characters (Ron's brother) and the length of those scenes we did\nsee were really short so had no emotion (e.g the death of snape,\nbellatrix)....the fight and the death of voldemort should have been\nmuch longer considering we have been waiting more than 8 years to see\nthat happen. the battle scenes were short too and it jumped from calm\nto fighting really quickly...there was hardly any build up. And when\nharry goes to heaven or what ever that was...was just plain silly. The\nworst of all...Daniel Radcliffe was so wooden and boring to watch! I\ndid like the bit where we saw Snapes memories that was well done. Think\nthe film was more of a money maker than a film to signify the end of an\nera.\n"
"\nUgh! This film has as about as much drama as a phony halloween costume\nparty.<br><br>Know there's a lot of Potter fans, but this film just jumps from one\nload of super effects to another complete with crap music. HUH? WTF is\ngoing on aside from looooong drawn out scenes (violins), a few quick\nback flashes, and then it hammers on the audience with who's bad and\ngood.<br><br>What an over-produced load of SH*T! No drama here--except for a\ndisabled 6yr old.<br><br>It's really about as exciting as Ralph Fiennes' nose.<br><br>A nonsense parable (insult to the word) where even someone very high\nwould hit \"delete\".\n"
"\nYes, I would've liked to have seen more scenes from the book. But I\ndon't fancy spending 6 hours in the cinema! I love Harry Potter, but\nhonestly, I have spent enough time reading the books!<br><br>Go to the cinema and watch it, give our British Film Industry some well\ndeserved cash.<br><br>Personally, I would've liked to have seen Voldemorts face when Molly\nkills Bellatrix. I wanted to hear more about Dumbledore's life and it\nwould've been good to see Percy make up with his family. Even though it\nwasn't a big story in the films anyway. I didn't really like when\npeople got killed they burst into confetti (taken from X-Men Last\nStand, I think.) No doubt it won't end there though, they will probably\ncreate a film based on Rita Skeeter's book and another film about\nVoldemort (as they didn't use all the material from The Half-Blood\nPrince book.)<br><br>But all in all a good film, the acting has improved tenfold and the\nspecial effects were amazing.<br><br>I will leave you with one word for all people who will not stop\ncomplaining: \"ADAPTATION!\"\n"
"\nThe movie does not cover most of the important plots of other\ncharacters. The movie only only tells the story of harry Potter whereas\nthe other character are far more interesting but the movie leaves their\nstory out completely.It is not just this movie but the whole series was\nnot made well. They have spent too much time trying to show harry's\nemotions instead of showing more about the magical world. Primarily the\nmovie is shot for kids and not for mature adults unlike the books. The\nspecial effects are good but was highly disappointed by the story. The\nmovie might be worth watching for the people who haven't read the book\nbut i would recommend everyone to read the books instead of seeing this\nmovie.\n"
"\nCompared to all the others it lacked detail and the plot was thin. It\nbrushed through subplot by sub plot (destroying holcruxes) so quickly\nit was hard to follow, and I have read the book. The battle for\nHogwarts was anticlimactic and lacked focus. The best part of the movie\nwas the memories Harry watched from Severus Snape. Lastly, the 3rd\ndeathly hallow, the resurrection stone, was found dropped and then\nnever mentioned again. They made no reference to it when Harry\n\"amazingly\" awakened from the dead and won his battle.<br><br>I think the others were excellent and really draw you into the story.\nBut, unfortunately I had to rate this one at a six.\n"
"\nThe end of the book, from a fantastic series, was incredibly\nexhilarating. None of this was brought forth in this series ending\nmovie. The ending was off from the book and frankly, just not very\ngood. Even for someone that didn't read the books which is probably\nrare, the anticlimactic ending was a letdown.<br><br>The good. Some better acting overall. The effects were more on cue and\nthe feel was pretty good. <br><br>Didn't Neville kill the snake at Harry's awakening from feigned death?\nDidn't Harry and Voldemort circle each other in front of the students\nand teachers. And wasn't there a big hurrah after Harry killed him?<br><br>From poor acting and character building, this whole series of movies\nwas a general letdown. I understand the need to put all the major\npoints of the book onto film but why stray at the end and change the\nending. The very awesome ending.<br><br>I don't know. I give this whole series a \"C\"\n"
"\nI enjoyed it because I enjoy Harry Potter, but overall the last book\nwas lame and the movie was even lamer. When I re-watch the series I\nusually skip Deathly Hallows.<br><br>I may be alone in this, but it would have been awesome if J.K. Rowling\nhad the guts to kill off a main character. I was kind of hoping Ron\nwould die. Not that I have anything against Ron, I just thought he'd be\nan excellent choice. And the epilogue is so unnecessary. I hoped the\nfilm wouldn't include it. They lived happily ever after. We get it. I\nthink if we can imagine magical creatures and a school in the sky that\nteaches witchcraft, we certainly can imagine how their happy ended\nwould go.\n"
"\nPerhaps more than any other of the series, this movie has no standing\non it's own. While better viewed in order, any of the first six could\nbe viewed and enjoyed on their own with someone unfamiliar with the\nbooks or previous movies. This movie requires having seen the seventh\nmovie at the very least, and probably really needs all the previous\nmovies to be enjoyed (but those that have seen those movies are the\nprime target).<br><br>The movie contained your typical good/evil battle, with no real\nsurprises amongst the characters. Yes, I know that.... Again, obvious.<br><br>There was lots of action, lots of explaining. Just not a lot of fun.\nAlthough it would have been rather long, the final book as one movie\nwould have been better, with the explanations woven in the longer\nmovie, rather than needing to dominate this movie. But that simply\nwould not be as profitable for the Potter industry.\n"
"\nOf course one day the Harry Potter movie saga would come to an end also\nbecause the main performers are becoming older and sooner or later\nwould not be able to act the characters of the children student\nwizards. With the books by J. K. Rowling it's different since they have\nno images. I must begin to say that I have not seen Part One therefore\nwhat I am saying here must be read having that in mind. This movie\nfavours violent action and a lot of destruction to the detriment of the\npoetry of magics we have seen for instance in the H. P. AND THE\nPRISONER OF AZKABAN movie. However we must recognize that the special\nvisual effects are unbeatable, thrilling and of excellent quality. The\nstory is not very rich and original in terms of suspense but we can be\nproperly entertained while watching all the adventurous scenes. One\nlast word to the final scenes that re-establish the above mentioned\npoetry.\n"
"\nWhat 8.5 for this movie seriously.... common guys are everyone in this\nworld are harry fans.movie is not bad, it has its moments we all know\nhow it ends.i heard its a epic,excellent and frankly i am fed up this\nmovie or the whole series lost steam a long time ago.If u r extreme\npotter fan and u even dream harry then it will good other then that\nthere's nothing much to see in this one.There's nothing new in this one\nall parts are covered by previous parts.tell me one person in this\nworld who don't know that harry will defeat the dark lord but the way\nYates should portray the film should have been better. Ya i watched the\nfilm as it ends the series.i will not deny the fact that i saw most\nharry movies and liked some of them. I follow IMDb .. been following it\nfor the last two or three years if a movie is rated 7-8 or above i\nwould run to theater or buy a DVD but fans giving movies like this 9 or\n10 disappoints me a lot.i suggest watch the movie only if u love harry\nseries other then that prefer captain America or horrible bosses or\nTransfomers 3\n"
"\nThis movie (the 2 parts) is an absolute disgrace. It does not respect\nthe book, it does not respect the world of Harry Potter. It's just a\nbig joke, they decided to cut half of the book, including some\nimportant scenes, but they also decided to change what happens and when\nit happens. They added stuff and made some impossible things possible\nin the movie. In the end, it's a movie showing off all you can do\nspecial effect-wise, they focused on that and chose the scenes they\nwould do from the books based on whether they would allow theme to show\noff or not, and left big chunks of the story. I re-read the book just\nbefore and it's just a shocking movie in the end. I can not believe JK\nRowling said yes to that. She must really like money. But it's not like\nit's a new thing in the Harry Potter series. Half of the movies are\nlame, disrespectful to the original world, and focused on minor parts\nwhile leaving important story parts left abandoned.\n"
"\nI don't normally do movie reviews but the other non-reviews are all\nabout how it deviates from the books. <br><br>The discussion to whether it's faithful to the source or not is\ncompletely separate to the quality of the movie, and this is simply a\nvery very bad one. <br><br>The movie keeps trying to find a ground between a cheesy teenage drama\nand a boring action movie. It's obviously trying to appeal to the\nlowest common denominator and in the end it can only be enjoyed because\nthat even below all the bad writing and directing the source dimly\nshines out.\n"
"\nIt should be noted that I haven't read the books.<br><br>I've enjoyed the series up to Deathly Hallows, Pt. 2.<br><br>Great effects, as usual, but little tension, there were no surprises,\nno edge to the story. Such a big build up to this conventional, happy\nending? I'm glad I didn't invest time to read the books. <br><br>I know a lot of people love the series, the books and films. I'm glad\nthere are fantasy films of such high quality. I hope there will be more\nfantasy films in this vein. But I feel let down, by all the build to\nthis conclusion<br><br>Lots of sound and fury...followed up by nothing interesting. I was\nreally looking forward to more from this.\n"
"\nI'm a big harry potter fan since the first movie, it gave me thrills\nand excitement. It was so sad that this is the end of the movie series.\nDaniel made an incredible job in portraying Harry Potter. Rupert is so\nfunny, he made Ron Weasley a great man. Emma as Hermoine is the BEST!\nShe did an amazing job in every movie especially in this movie where\nshe gave 200% of her effort! The sounds and the visual are great. The\neffects are so amazing, every scene is worth the watch. The other cast\nis great as well as the main characters. Everything in the movie was\nmagnificent! The directors, producers and every staff made a wonderful\njob. If I were you, I will watch it in cinemas and buy a DVD. It will\nnever get old even you watch it 50+ times.\n"
"\nHarry potter and the deathly hallows part 2 is a great movie as\nsuch..........high on action and great acting performances , everybody\nshould give it a try and not discard it by saying \"who cares , i'm not\na harry potter fan\" or \"it's kids stuff\" ...........don't miss\nsomething for such lame reasons.........give the movie a try and there\nis a good chance of yours falling in love with the movie . i might also\nsuggest , the movie is good as a solo movie as well.......the story is\napparent once you are 10 minutes in the movie , so no need to care a\nlot about it's being a part 2 movie ,although if u catch up with the\nstory so far ,it will only help you enjoy the movie more . Do see it in\n3d for full experience , it had nicer effect on me than when i saw it\nin 2d the first time around .\n"
"\nWith the amount of money thrown at this franchise, David Yates had\npractically anything he wanted at his disposal. This definitely goes to\nshow in the visual and technical elements of the film:- great sets,\nprops, special fx, visual fx, camera-work, music.<br><br>What always lets a film down? Storytelling.<br><br>So many missed opportunities and odd decisions.<br><br>Perhaps my biggest 'er, why?' moment was when I realised they weren't\ngoing to take Harry &amp; Voldy inside, but no, just have him dissolve into\nlittle pieces without anyone watching. It had so little impact I felt\ngrumpy right then! This was the moment that 7, yes SEVEN films have\nbeen building to!!! This is not LotR but take a cue from Peter Jackson,\nDavid Yates! This moment is meant to be EXPLOSIVE!<br><br>I'll leave it there as others have pointed out the rest of the pros and\ncons.<br><br>See excellent reviews by DoctorBatmanPotter &amp; akash_sebastian for a\nfull list of the Good, the Bad and the Ugly.\n"
"\nHP7-Part 2: The wait for every HP movie was long and this one seemed\neven longer as this is where it all ends. But the wait was worth it.\nProbably the best of Harry Potter series. Yes, Harry is back one last\ntime and in a way which we all waited for so long. The Movie works like\nMagic, especially in 3D. Loved every bit of it. It had everything we\nwant in HP series, thrill, action, magic, fun. <br><br>One important thing for anyone who reads this review. Please understand\nthat don't expect any movie to be exact replica of the book. That is\nimpossible to create. So please don't expect the same amount of details\nfrom this one as well.<br><br>But the point is you will love what you will see. Every scene is so\nwell crafted, so well drawn and so well enacted. Every character gets\nits due and bring the best to us. <br><br>This is one of the best special effects movie you will ever see, so go\nfor it and enjoy!!<br><br>And yes I will miss HP like millions of other HP fans!! Sob Sob! 10 out\nof 10. Go watch it..!\n"
"\nBest movie since i was old HP series is my life best movie series.\n10/10 Rating and in movie the school is best. BEst. KING OF MOVIEThe\ngood: <br><br>- Neville. He was perfectly perfect. I really wish they gave him more\nscreen time because he was adorable.<br><br>- The Gringott's scene. Very well done.<br><br>- The emotion we are shown from Snape. Throughout the series, he's been\nrather monotonous and emotionless. In the pensieve, we see a different\nside of him and it is a refreshing change.<br><br>- The battle at Hogwarts. It was intense and wonderfully done.<br><br>- Helena Ravenclaw. It was very emotional and creepy. Although they did\nnot tell us her back story with the Bloody Baron.<br><br>- Rupert Grint and Dan Radcliffe shirtless. That's certainly a plus.<br><br>OK you know it's bad when I resort to writing about that.<br><br>.\n"
"\nJust the necessary end of a book adaption which goes worse and worse\nwith every part. For example, the first and second have been good\nmovies. But then the third which turns the book with the, in my\nopinion, most exciting story into a boring whatever. The fourth could\nbe named as a \"nice try\" but everything after that was just boring\nstuff with exaggerated and obsessive special effects. One could get so\nmuch more out of this story, but also the last part was full of these\nthings I've sad before: groundless protracted, useless effects, lame\ngags and a final battle that could'nt be more unspectacular; by the\nway: no more ideas since the fourth part, except this strange black and\nwhite smoke flying thing which is just ridiculous. no innovation, no\nprofundity, no good film<br><br>sorry for some grammar mistakes, but English is not my native language\n"
"\nIt was an amazing title for an amazing book. Even though I was a fan of\nthe \"Lord of the Rings\" and I never was actually into \"Harry Potter\", I\nbelieved in the power of this author and this masterpiece; after\nreading the book. Extra-ordinary work of character development,\nrelations and creativity. Extra-ordinary work of humour , fantasy and\nimagination. The power of mankind in terms of how different could it be\nfrom other creatures in expansion of such beautiful art-works was\nobservable within this book. Oh, Should I write about the Movie here?\nWell I have to confess like this: It was just the best way of spoiling\nsuch an amazing novel.\n"
"\nWell I watched this last night and left the cinema feeling a but\nunderwhelmed. Its seems to be me like they lashed this movie together\nknowing full well that it was always going to be a sellout. If you have\nbothered with the last movies then you find yourself wanting to just\nget to the end. Its hard to pick 1 particular scene out but to me it\ndidn't flow well and the script was very wish wash. I could give\nexamples but I don't want to give anything away to those who have not\nseen the movie. I never found myself once feeling sad that it was the\nfinal movie. It failed badly to get the hairs tingling and the lump in\nthe throat effect most saga's have. Very disappointing but hey, this is\njust my opinion. See for yourself. I would wait for the DVD tho.....\n"
"\nNo i didn't love it cause its the last one, but out of all of them i've\nseen, this is probably the only and the first out of all 8 of them i\nactually really enjoyed.<br><br>The beginning- Bang Bang good! <br><br>The Middle- I'm on the edge of my seat! <br><br>The End- I jumped out of my seat and screamed, eff yeah!<br><br>I in my 2 years of being a Rookie Critic have never done that watching\na Harry Potter Film.<br><br>Don't let anyone spoil it, it doesn't need anymore to say But\njust\"WOW\"! <br><br>My first 10 out 10 of all the Harry Potter Movies<br><br>It deserves nothing more than at least \"Worthy Best Picture nomination\"<br><br>It may be late at night but heck, this is really rare from me to\nactually remember a Harry Potter Film.<br><br>Farely well to Harry Potter, this outstanding film will be remembered,\nSincerely.\n"
"\nAs a kid Harry Potter was one of my favourite childhood movies growing\nup. I loved the cinematography,the characters,the score by John\nWilliams(who did it until I think 2009),and as well as this it\nintroduced me to Emma Watson(who is now in Beauty &amp; The Beast as\nBelle). This last installment is all about Harry(played by Daniel\nRadcliffe)who goes head to head against his long time nemesis Lord\nVoldermort(who wants him dead,and he is played by an unrecognizable\nRalph Fiennes)and its a battle against evil with Voldermort's\ncompanions(one played by Helena Bonham Carter and Jason Issacs)and\nHarry must try and save Hogwarts from the deadly hallows.<br><br>After 10 years debuting on the Big Screen,this final film was very\ngood. The story was good and the whole film was pretty intense. We also\nget to find out that Snape(late Alan Rickman)was in love with Harry\nPotter's mother Lily Potter who died from Voldermort when Harry was a\nbaby and Snape seen Lily on the floor and was crying hysterically\ncradling her in his arms. <br><br>Overall I enjoyed it\n"
"\nI think \" Harry Potter and the Deathly hallows Part 2 \" was better than\nPart 1.whatever I didn't quit enjoy it because : 1- there were no\nDialogue in this movie just actions , if we count how many time they\nspoke in this movie it will be less than 10 minutes. 2- i don't know\nwhy this movie is so dark, i saw it twice in cinema and on my PC and i\nBarely could see anything. 3- i didn't like when they make them came\nafter 19 years, i thought it was just for reading and not to see, it\nmade me lose the spirit of voldemort's death.4- i think it was a bad\nidea that they made the movie on two parts, it should have been only\none part in 3 or 4 hours like \" Lord of the rings \" it would so much\nbetter. some people may ask why i gave it 9\\10 and i will answer it is\njust \"HARRY POTTER\", i read the all the seven books 3 times, i saw the\nmovies thousands of times, i saw 4 of them in the cinema, i am a huge\nfan of all the actors and at last i thanks J.K. Rowling. {sorry for my\nTerrible grammar}\n"
"\nWell I'm a little late on the review, but I am a huge fan of Harry\nPotter. All the actors bring there \"A\" game for this final movie. All\nthese actors give groundbreaking performances in making this the final\nmovie. The movie definitely executed the main points of the movie, and\nmade it feel so real and touching. Harry Potter fans and non Harry\nPotter will definitely love this movie. I was given the advantage to go\nto the midnight showing and the whole theater was in complete silence\nthe whole movie, and you could even hear and see people shedding tears.\nIt is an AWESOME movie, and it really does justice for the end of Harry\nPotter. I have read all the books, and seen all the movies, and this\none has to be the best movie. I knew what was gonna happen and still\nhad me on the edge of my seat, and I suggest this movie to everyone! It\nwill not be a waste of your money. Great movie, great people, great\nending. Harry Potter will live on forever.\n"
"\nthis was a great great movie my son says his favorite 8 movies are the\nharry potter it was a great ending even with the sad deaths it was\nepic,awesome,perfect ending,and one of the best fantasy films ever\nusually the endings aren't good but this was awesome.Definitely the\nbest movie of the year a must see for all ages the best of the potter\nfilms great movie no disappointing parts at all a great movie its one\nof the coolest movie battles ever a perfect ending and will not\ndisappoint anyone its a great,great movie its awesome you will love it\nno matter who you are it will make you see films in a whole new way it\nshould never get a bad review.\n"
"\nI never thought I'd see the day where there is a movie that makes me\nlaugh, cry, and scream all at the same time. The Harry Potter series is\none that has touched the hearts of millions of people on this earth,\nand I am one out of those millions! The film Harry Potter and the\nDeathly Hallow Part 2 is truly epic. Joe Rowling created a world that\ntouched the hearts of millions, and David Yates brought that onto the\nscreen for ALL to see. Even though there were many 'liberties' taken by\nthe director, it didn't even effect the grade of quality. The plot of\nthick, the effects were top-notch, the music out OUTSTANDING, and the\ncast had the great chemistry that makes you fall with love with their\nwork. Over-all, the final installation of the Harry Potter series truly\nhead up to its expectations. I watched it eight times in theaters, I\nown it on DVD, and the soundtrack is next on my list. If you are\nlooking for a movie that fulfills expectations, and you can watch again\nand again¬Ö Pick up Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2!\n"
"\nI love this movie and the whole series to death. Amazing close to the\nseries, could of have more but AMAZING! Only big thing I hated was the\nromance. Ginny was annoying and Harry and Hermoine are perfect\ntogether. But aside that, AMAZING MOVIE. Hope to see a 1-8 movie\ncollection. If you have not seen this movie and you are just the little\nof an Harry Potter fan, see this movie! I didn't get to see this movie\ntill today and after I wished to see it at premiere. The best movie and\nthe series and the best series of movies and books. Long Live Harry\nPotter. We will all miss you Harry Potter. Thank You J.K. Rowling.\nEpic.\n"
"\nWow just wow. This is definitely the best movie out of the films by\nfar! Everything that happened in the series truly lead up to this\nmovie. This was the perfect finale for the MOVIE series. The Deathly\nHallows book was the perfect finale for the BOOK series. Don't let the\nlength of this movie fool you for this is an extremely fast paced movie\nwhich keeps you on the edge of your seat from the very first second.\nThe movie was just perfect in all aspects of what a film should be, and\nI am proud to say that I find this superior to \"Return of the King.\"\nHowever if you are an extreme fan of HP you might tear up once you\nrealize its all over. WORTH THE WAIT! <br><br>(P.S. It's even better if you view the rest of the films before this\none)\n"
"\nAll those Harry Potter movies were okay. The books were funny enough,\nand all the movie adaptations were decent and satisfying. I'm not a big\nfan of those book, but I liked them. Daniel Radcliffe was a very good\nchoice as Harry Potter, he is very handsome and talented. The\nperformances, the script and the special effects were good enough, not\nas good as better films as \"Avatar\" and \"Watchmen\", but were good. My\nonly problem with all the Harry Potter films is that all of those\nmovies are pretty long. Since those book and movies are aimed to\nchildren they should be shorter, I guess. All the Harry Potter films\nare good, but this was easily the best of all the Harry Potter movies\nin the franchise, being the most entertaining and satisfying. I really\nliked the last scene.<br><br>The second part of \"Deathly Hallows\" was a great ending for the Harry\nPotter Saga, and it made me appreciate even more the story and the\ncharacters.\n"
"\nOh My God. This film is just fantastic. it makes you cry, happy and\njust scream with joy. I thoroughly enjoyed this film so much. The\nacting is top notch, the effects are dazzling and just the fact it's in\n2 parts is awesome. Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson and Rupert Grint were\nagain amazing as the three heroes Harry, Hermoine and Ron. But, Matthew\nLewis (Neville Longbottom) and Julie Walters (Molly Weasley) had their\nbig moments in this film. I cried when people died and had to close my\neyes when my favourite character dies. The beginning with Grainsgotts\nwhat fantastic and the end with the Hogwarts Battle was just Epic! I am\nalso happy that they didn't use different actors for the 19 years later\nscene.<br><br>I cant wait to get the DVD and i shall have a Harry Potter Day!\n"
"\nHP7-Part 2: The wait for every HP movie was long and this one seemed\neven longer as this is where it all ends. But the wait was worth it.\nProbably the best of Harry Potter series. Yes, Harry is back one last\ntime and in a way which we all waited for so long. The Movie works like\nMagic, especially in 3D.And this was my first 3D experience also, Loved\nevery bit of it. It had everything we want in HP series, thrill,\naction, magic, fun Smile Overall, it may be said that the movie was\ngood. The direction,the special effects were brilliantly executed. The\nacting was good too. The children have grown so much.hop every one also\nenjoyed like me!!\n"
"\nit was great i am a fan it was cool i thought it was great harry potter\nis great it was a good movie it was scary it was really scary it was\ncool you will like it a lot it was one of the best movies of 2011 i\nliked it a lot you will like it too it was just a good movie. it was\ngreat it was cool, it was great, and it was great i loved it a lot\nharry potter and the deathly hallows part 2 was just a really good\nmovie it was enjoy able to enjoy harry potter movie are good it was a\nreally really good movie you will ilk it too it was a great movie i am\nglad it is a PG 13 movie there was action violence and just a good\nmovie to enjoy it was good it was just a great movie it was long it was\ngreat it was a great movie i liked it a lot it was really really great\ni thought it was good harry potter rocks it was not funny but good it\nrocks it was really really long for a PG 13 it was a really good movie.\nit was cool it was a good 3d movie i saw it ad it was a great movie it\nwas cool it was not funny but it was a good movie to see it was a blast\n"
"\nI went to this at midnight and it was super worth it!! Between Mrs.\nWesley's special line and the fighting, it was just like the book. You\nshould go see it if you haven't!! It was an epic ending to an epic\nseries and I don't know if there will anything as epic ever again. I\nbegin reading these a while back and now I own all the movies and books\nplus a tee shirt. I never imagined I could be so hooked. So if you are\na fan, or you're looking for a movie to see, I recommend Harry Potter\nand the Deathly Hallows: Part 2. The ending death was epic, along with\nthe sadness of losing Tonks, one of the Wesley twins and many more. So,\nsit back, relax and enjoy it. It will last for generations to come.\n"
"\nWhat a remarkable film Deathly Hallows 2 was,it is definitely\nmesmerizing but i wish there was more war sequences,otherwise i am\ncompletely satisfied with what the film had to offer.the film was\nstrong in all sectors not to forget the performances from the veterans\nlike Maggie Smith and Alan Rickman,simply out-shown the rest of the\ncast. the film is full of 'edge-of-the seat' moments and keeps you\nglued to the screen through-out the duration of the two hours. it is\nvery difficult to direct a war-film and David Yates does deliver given\nthe fact that he had to tell a story running in the background at the\nsame time.Voldemort's weakness, prince's tale, king-cross are worth\nmentioning and so is the pale white dragon locked in the\nunderworld.there couldn't have been a better ending to the series.It\nwas emotional and deserves a best-picture nomination at the Oscar's.\n"
"\nThis is the last Harry Potter film and what a way to end it!<br><br>I was originally expecting the film to be better as it was a bit boring\nto start it off, but when you come to the battle of Hogwarts you just\ncant help sitting on the edge of your seat with your mouth hanging\nopen, and as for then end of the whole Harry Potter franchise you will\nbe impressed with this film! If you want to see one of the best films\nof this year then I recommend you see this one! I was, after watching\nthe film amazed for weeks and wanted to see it again, I guess I'll have\nto wait for it to come out on DVD to experience one of the best Harry\nPotter films ever made! One of the best I've seen yet!!!!!\n"
"\nThis is the last film of the worldwide franchise. If they had to make\nthe film in a way like this, then one film was better than making two\nfilms. David Heyman is an amazing producer but David Yates a completely\nfowl director. He ruined the fifth sixth and seventh film and so he did\nwith the eight film. He cut of everything. The beginning was very good,\nbut the battle was quiet miserable. Most of the things was shown in the\ntrailer , what happened in the battle and there was too much Harry in\nthe film. Ron and Hermione even didn't appear much and the stupid David\nYates deleted many things from the memory of Snape. The dead scene of\nFred was also omitted. Ariana's story gone!!! Duel of Hermione, Ginny\nand Luna with Bellatrix gone. And the battle of Harry &amp; Voldemort\nthough they made it a bit longer it was still disappointing. There was\nno one to see and and thus what is the proof that Voldy is dead???? The\nfilm was good and enjoyable but I think a lot more could be expected\nfrom this film.\n"
"\nAs an eight part in the series there's not a single reason to explain\nthe story or its characters, they've been defined. And so this film\nstarts running, and doesn't really pause until the very end of it. As a\nbook translation I guess it doesn't do too bad of a job - most events\nof importance get a glimmer of screen time. I have no idea how it works\non people that haven't read the books though.<br><br>As a film it's dark, literally. Too dark to my liking, it's a good\nthing to express the dark and grim feeling of the book, it's overkill\nto make the film look like everything was shot between dusk and dawn.\nThis effect was even worse in 3D - which again turned out to be a dud.<br><br>Overall the film felt rushed - as if the maker was done with it, glad\nto have the series end. As part of the audience I now feel the same -\nit was a good series to watch through the years but I am happy it is\ndone now.<br><br>Adding that all together makes it the worst part in the series to me,\nfitting but not fitting, pleasing and not pleasing.<br><br>6 out of 10 last rites\n"
"\nThroughout the series every movie had something missing. Of course\nevery movie had parts that were cut because they simple didn't have\ntime to show everything. All of that has always bugged me until this.\nThis movie was everything the book couldn't be. While it did have to\ncut out parts that really were important, it said everything it had to\nsay. It finished everything that had to be finished. This movie tied up\nall the loose ends and it did this with a flourish. The action was at\nthe amazing pace that only that 8th instalment of a long series could\nprovide (without disregarding the story). Still a two hour movie of\njust thrills would have been a bit too much and it certainly provided\nsome breaks. Emotional scenes, like Neville coming full circle, showed\nthat as much as the series was about magic none of us could wield, it\nwas also about character that the best of us could aspire to. It was\nbreathtaking. It was triumphant. It was to the fans, to the books, to\nHarry Potter and all the faithful at Hogwarts: Justice.\n"
"\nI haven't read all the 7 harry potter books but i'm a big fan of all\nthe harry potter films. The last scene of Harry Potter and the Deathly\nHallows: Part 1 I was so angry at the film because I wanted to see more\nof what will happen to Lord Voldemort when he took the wand of\nDumbledore from his coffin.<br><br>well, that's the point of having two parts. It makes the audience to\nwant to see the 2nd part of film. A very smart way for the Warner Bros.\nto earn money.<br><br>I like how the movie ended and very well acted!<br><br>my score is 8.5 but there is not half point in the scoring system in\nhere. but it is close to a 9.\n"
"\nThis was a great movie i really loved the acting. The death of Severus\nSnape really got to me thae way he had acted to his last words to Harry\nand the way he put on a dieing expression.<br><br>The movie throughout was more than excellent and i can say i will watch\nover 5 more time even more perhaps.I have to say I was disappointed i\ncouldn't get the midnight tickets! I am just not being able to take the\nfact that the series has ended,i have been a fan for only 5 years but\nharry potter means everything to me and I do not look at myself as some\nharry potter not-know-it-all.I also seem to be amazed with the make-up\nand acting of Lord Voldemort played by Ralph Fiennns (please excuse me\nif i spelled his last name wrong).\n"
"\nI will agree that i am a big Harry Potter fan so when i watched Deathly\nhallows part-2 for the 1st time I was disappointed but on watching it\nfor the second time, me being a film study student i could appreciate\nall the aspects of film-making involved in this particular film, and\nthus when I walked out of the theater i was happy and content.\ncompletely satisfied...<br><br>i will give a full 10 for direction 10 for cinematography 10 for\ntechnicalities 10 for editing 10 for acting/performances 10 for\nscript-writing 9 for back-ground score<br><br>Deathly Hallows Part-2 stands its own ground and is a beautiful\ncommentary on the work from which it is adapted...<br><br>I wish this movie all the success, and i hope fr the best for this\nfilm. deathly hallows part-2 is cinematic, stunning and\nsatisfying.Befitting ending to the Harry Potter saga.\n"
"\nHarry Potter and The Deathly Hallows Part-2 is of the right duration,\nwith dazzling visuals and top notch performances from the Veterans. the\ntone is perfect,the music spells doom even before the battle starts and\nthe omissions from the actual literary work can be ignored as the movie\nstands tall and strong on its own.<br><br>it will satisfy audience of all ages. there couldn't have been a better\ndirector for the final harry potter film, David Ytes bids good-bye to\nthe series with style.<br><br>a must watch for all, something which with the coming years will be\nwatched again and a again.\n"
"\nThis movie was overall really good the art direction, the casting, the\nacting, the cinematography it was just top-notch and it seems like it\nhad the perfect ending to a franchise I grew up with and loved. <br><br>But the only thing that bugged me was that they had to many attempts at\none liners and not so funny jokes. I realize that the harry potter\nfranchise still have a big fanbase for kids so that's probably why they\nkept having a comic relief so the movie wouldn't be to dramatic for the\nkids, but still its have been 10 years and the kids that watched the\nfirst harry potter movie 10 years ago (myself as well) is all grown up\nnow so we don't need so many \"comic relief moments\" We can handle the\ndrama people! But if you look pass that it's a really good movie\n"
"\nFor the 100235th time,the movie ISN'T supposed to be EXACTLY like the\nbook! If Inception was based on a book,and they had changed some plots\nfrom the book,people will still go crazy,saying that the movie sucked\nbecause it wasn't exactly like the book. The movie was intense. The\nmusic,cinematography everything was just...perfect! This movie,was the\nbest in the series. Prince's tale was portrayed so beautifully,it's\nhard not to cry during this scene(I don't wanna spoil anything).The\ncast gave their best,especially,Alan Rickman. They DID go out with a\nbang. It's emotional,action packed,epic and funny at times.A perfect\nsend off,one could wish for.Long live Harry Potter! IMHO 10/10 It was a\ngreat MOVIE!\n"
"\nThis is what all had been waiting. The end is here and it comes with a\nbig bang. This is the best installment of the series excluding Prisoner\nof Azkaban. Finally its Harry vs Voldemort. With the beginning only its\nquite understandable that all we're gonna watch is a lot of action. The\ndirection great, the script is written pretty well and I just loved the\nscreenplay. Its stunning visually and the effects are commendable. One\nmore thing is that you will find your heart pacing as more and more\ntime passes. Definitely all you think is that its gonna end now. I\nwatched in 3d and didn't find much use of 3d except 2-3 good scenes. So\nits moreover kind of same if you watch in 2d. The truths when unfold\ndelivers a shock to us. Although the ending scenes don't fit well but\nthe climax is superb and it couldn't have ended better. Just loved it\nbut sadly the series is over now.\n"
"\nI didn't particularly like DH Part 1 (see my review), but I DID like\nPart 2! All Hell breaks loose as He Who Must Not Be Named and his\nlegions fall on Hogwarts in an attempt to destroy Harry Potter. It is\nall out War! There is a very high body count....<br><br>This film is a blur of battle scenes, which are very very good and dark\nconversations and broodings. Central characters come to their full\npowers and interact well. The main themes of the whole epic saga are\nmaintained, served and played out to fitting conclusions. It's all\nactually pretty darned good! There's not much I can say or want to say\nabout the detail of this movie. The whole vast scale of the \"Harry\nPotter Project\" comes to fruition superbly here.<br><br>I would definitely recommend this film.\n"
"\nI thought this film would be a fitting first review for me as I have\ngrown up with this film series. Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows\npart 2 was a great film. In my eyes maybe the best of the lot. We see\nmore emotion from characters in this film than any other, particularly\nfrom Severus Snape, Alan Rickman does an excellent job. The action\nscenes are also spectacular and all the money spent on this was\ndefinitely worth it. I also watched this film in 3D which was another\njoy as the effects were fantastic. Also credit has to be given to the\nwriters of the film who tweak some of the plot that was originally in\nthe book but readers should not worry as the scenes that have been\nchanged are still fantastic. Overall I think this film is an excellent\nending to an excellent series and does the story of Harry Potter\njustice.<br><br>Great way to end an era.\n"
"\nAfter seeing this movie in fake 3D at my local AMC theater in NJ, I\nenjoyed this fitting end to the highest grossing movie franchise of all\ntime. It begins where part 1 left off, when voldemort opens up\ndumbledore's grave and raises his wand into the air with a lightning\nbolt into the air. Harry Potter is on a mission to kill Voldemort and\nthose who obey him. Ralph Fiennes' character Voldemort lies about Harry\nPotter being dead, which shows his excellence in acting, then harry\npotter comes back to life and defeats voldemort. There is a great\nflashback scene, and an epilogue set 19 years after the events of the\nmovie. Whether you see it in 3D, 2D, or IMAX 3D, HP7.2 completes the\ncircle.\n"
"\nI saw this at a midnight viewing in a packed cinema. Perfect way to say\ngoodbye to a great series of films.<br><br>The film was fantastic and a great ending but people who have read the\nbooks will notice several points missing. Sadly some of the points that\nwere included were cut shorter and were not done as much justice as\nthey deserved.<br><br>Although there are some negative points to the finale for the most part\nfans of the book and films will be more than satisfied. A touching and\ncomplete film with lots of emotion and more action in this sitting then\nall its predecessors combined! It deserves multiple watches.<br><br>Goodbye harry potter! You will be missed!\n"
"\nSo after ten years the Harry Potter film series is brought to a climax\nwith this eighth film.<br><br>All the tension builds to a close in this film with the fate of the\nwizarding world being solved in a bum-numbing two and a half hours. <br><br>Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson and Rupert Grint give their beloved\ncharacters one final run out and as ever play them to perfection.\nRadcliffe in particular does very well and holds the film together at\ntimes. Credit should also be given to Alan Rickman who gives a\nfantastic performance as Snape whose true colours finally get revealed\nin this film.<br><br>Yes there are parts of the original book that were missed out and yes\nnothing can replicate the imagery that fans have in their heads when\nreading the book but by and large the director David Yates has\nconstructed a fitting end to the saga and there can be no doubt that\nthese films will long live on in the memory.\n"
"\nThis movie is really close to my heart for the reason that this is the\nlast one from Harry Potter. Overall, the movie was really enjoyable and\nthe action scenes were perfectly portrayed. <br><br>But, the only bad feeling is that the movie was a bit short. Not\neverything in the book were mentioned. That was a slight\ndisappointment. But, David Yates did better in this movie. <br><br>I must say this. 3D experience has been so good. I really enjoyed it\nduring the title. Look out for the \"WB\". Its a great new experience in\nHarry Potter. Thanks for considering 3D option in the last part at\nleast. This comes as a treat for those who have always wanted a 3D in\nHarry Potter. <br><br>A must watch !!\n"
"\nHarry Potter and The Deathly Hallows:Part 2 is the final installment of\nthe Harry Potter Series. I was so excited to see it and had high\nexpectations, as usual these expectations were met. The movie kicks off\nright where Part 1 ended and there is an intense atmosphere from the\nvery beginning as Harry and his friends know what must happen. There\nare lots of emotions running throughout this movie as an avid fan would\nfeel for each character as the story unfolds. The effects are great!\nThe 3D didn't really add much however it didn't take anything away\neither. The music and sound is superb as usual. The script was well\nwritten and the acting was great. When you grow up loving Harry Potter,\nthis is the kind of ending you expect to see and I must say David Yates\ndid a phenomenal job! Its intense, it emotional and it sure is\nthrilling which makes this movie the Perfect Ending.<br><br>10/10\n"
"\nI've grown up with the books and it's nice to see the end of Harry and\nhis friends' magical journey. It's well adapted and portrayed by David\nYates and the cast that I'm familiar with and love since the first\nmovie.<br><br>The movie is of course not at all like the book and has many plot\npoints skipped but also introduced some very nice additions. I'm not\ngonna go into details and spoil it, but if you have read the book\nthoroughly and watched this movie then you'd know what I mean.<br><br>Overall, the last movie is a great experience. It's dark throughout the\nmost part but the bright ending leaves you with wonderful feelings of a\nbetter future for our main characters and their offspring.<br><br>I'm a bit sad to see a conclusion to HP movie series but like all\nparties, there is always and end. Time to grow up and move on to\ndifferent things, I suppose.<br><br>Other thoughts: this is by no means my favorite HP movie but it's\ndefinitely in the top 3.\n"
"\nTaking the wand sealed the villain's fate. You know it begins, you see\nit as part of his ignorance towards what is to come.<br><br>The journey, the trip, the flight to the country. Going to the place\nwhere it all begins. There is too many actions, words go mute.\nImpressive scenes, innovation from the original text kept to it still\nvery close. Moments of great emotion, silence. Taking the last of the\nbad cretin's lives makes it happen. You're driven onto the perfect\nclimax, and like it's said it all ends. And new beginnings are\nwritten...<br><br>Future writers and literature makers will have a huge creativity\nchallenge. Harry Potter's generational legacy is still in its infancy.\nNot bad to also recommend to read the books, it will make a very\ninteresting cultural plight. <br><br>Loved it, simply loved it.\n"
"\nAfter burying Dobby, Harry Potter asks the goblin Griphook to help him,\nRon, and Hermione break into Bellatrix Lestrange's vault at Gringotts\nbank, suspecting a Horcrux may be there. Griphook agrees, in exchange\nfor the Sword of Gryffindor. Wandmaker Ollivander tells Harry that two\nwands taken from Malfoy Manor belonged to Bellatrix and to Draco\nMalfoy, but Malfoy's has changed its allegiance to Harry.<br><br>In Bellatrix's vault, Harry discovers the Horcrux is Helga Hufflepuff's\ncup. He retrieves it, but Griphook snatches the sword and abandons the\ntrio, leaving them cornered by security. The three release the dragon\nguardian and flee on its back. Harry sees a vision of Voldemort killing\ngoblins, including Griphook, and learns Voldemort is aware of the\ntheft. Harry also realises there is a Horcrux at Hogwarts somehow\nconnected to Rowena Ravenclaw. The trio apparate into Hogsmeade, where\nAberforth Dumbledore reluctantly instructs the portrait of his deceased\nyounger sister, Ariana, to fetch Neville Longbottom, who leads the trio\nthrough a secret passageway into Hogwarts.\n"
"\nby far one of the best endings to a series, it wasn't flawless, but it\nwasn't horrid, much like goblet of fire (which took out too much of the\nbook and added hardly anything. this movie is my all time favorite\nPotter movie, well until Fantastic Beasts and where to find them comes\nout, that looks so good that it might get close to this amazing movie.\ni love how they brought this story together, mostly stayed true to the\nbook and just amazing acting. Emma, Daniel and Rupert just blew me\naway, as did all the other actors, especially Alan R. hope i get blown\naway by the spin-off that i mentioned before. J.K. Rowling i thank you\nfor making this awesome story and allowing the movies to be made.\n"
"\nwell, it all end, then. harry potter won the war against the evil and\nsaved the world. well lets start with my bad comment about it. so\nvoldamort finally got harry potter and did the death spell on him which\nhe thinks that it did not kill harry when he was young, and he knows\nthat harry is the only one who can have a chance vs him, so after doing\nthe spell which did not kill harry the last time,he sends a follower of\nhim to See if harry died ???? like he is just like 5 meters away from\nharry and he has been searching for him for so long and in the end he\ndoes not bother enough to see by himself if he died ? sigh. anyway, i\nloved almost everything else about the movie. it is good but could have\nbeen better.\n"
"\nOne of the great films ever<br><br>i think its the best movies series ever along with lord of the rings it<br><br>contains 90 percent of fantasy movies i love this film<br><br>so Voldemort is one of the best villains ever in the history of cinema<br><br>and j,k,roaling is for me the best author in the modern time<br><br>she actually invented a world of her own and made a laws evil and good <br><br>harry represents good it self denial radcliff is a very good actor<br><br>as for Emma Watson she is beautiful and one day she will be the best\nactress ever in Hollywood <br><br>so the movie is great for me <br><br>other movies of the series also great like the philosopher's stone and\nthe chamber of secrets and the prisoner of azkapan and the goblet of\nfire and the order of the phoenix and the half-blood prince and the\ndeathly gallows part one <br><br>the director made a great job <br><br>but i think if someone like peter Jackson was the director or James\nCameron it would have been far more precious movie\n"
"\nI totally liked it. The complete series of Harry Potter is awesome! It\nneeded a awesome ending.. The final part of this series should be like\nthis. HP8 deserved to be the final part of HP series because of its\nawesome direction.. Acting is awesome! Casting is awesome! Story is\nawesome! Music is awesome! Action is awesome! Direction is awesome!\nEverything is just Awesome!! I totally liked it. The complete series of\nHarry Potter is awesome! It needed a awesome ending..

"\nWhen I watched this film for the first time, my expectations were\nactually very low, since I knew what they've done to the books in film\nsix and seven. You have to know that I'm always quite finicky about the\ncorrect transcription of literary material into films. But compared to\nthe former Harry-Potter-Films, this one is quite close to the book on\nwhich the film was based (comparatively).<br><br>All in all this last film is fairly good. It is thrilling, the effects\nare great, the book was not completely shredded. So even if you don't\nlike adaptations, this one is quite viewable.<br><br>I hope there are not too many mistakes in my text. If there are, I'm\nsorry, but I'm no native speaker.\n"
"\nA must-see end to the series of the magical Harry Potter world. I\nrecommend it to all ages, all genders and all expectations. This grand\nfinale starts off where part 1 of Deathly Hallows finished, with Harry\ncrouching besides Dobby's grave. It is showing how the good is weak and\nevil are getting stronger, but Harry, Ron and Hermione are determined\nto hunt down the remaining horcruxes. After a heart-stopping trip to\nthe bank, the threesome go to Hogwarts for the final battle. Many\ninnocent lives are taken, with some main characters getting killed.\nDaniel Radcliffe and Rupert Grint make an excellent job portraying\ntheir life-long characters, and though it's Emma's best film, she still\nlacks the chirisma from my point of view. The movie ends really well,\nbut I'd have liked more of a bang at the end so the viewer could have\nbeen left wondering what was going to happen next.\n"
"\nI thought the deathly hallows part 2 was up there with one of the best\nHarry potter films made , however I thought we didn't get a chance to\nenjoy certain parts as they put so much into the film. <br><br>My Favorite part of the film was how snape was portrayed as through the\nother 7 films we don't really understand snape and after the half blood\nprince seeing him kill dumbledore I couldn't understand why he done it\n, until we find out he was good all along and dumbledore set it up. I\nalso liked how we got a sense of power voldemort has , as we see\nbellatrix who is a feared character so nervous around voldemort\nespecially when she trys to help him up after he falls.<br><br>Overall I thought it was a very good film with plenty of action ,\nalthough some parts could of been explained a little better , but still\na really good movie! I did read also that J.K rowling wants to make a\ndirector's cut of the movie.\n"
"\nWow! This movie was fantastic. Alexandre Desplat's soundtrack was\namazing, really captivating audiences into the most powerful scenes in\nthe film (Courtyard Appacolypse, and the Resurrection Stone scene). The\ncinematography and visual effects were amazing. Director David Yates\nand Screenwriter Steve Kloves stepped up their games and really brought\nthe best out of the actors. There were a few things I would've liked to\nsee them include, but overall good job.<br><br>The acting was superb too. Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, and Emma\nWatson had once again proved to be marvelous as Harry Potter, Ron\nWeasley, and Hermione Granger. But two actors that stood out for me\nwere Matt Lewis and Alan Rickman who brought emotional and heroic\ndepths out of their own characters: Neville Longbottom and Severus\nSnape. <br><br>The journey may end, but the magic will always live on.<br><br>No, WB: Release the extended editions! <br><br>LONG LIVE, HARRY POTTER\n"
"\nIs the movie end? NO!Please Direct more parts of Harry Potter like!\nwith some miracles dumbledore comes back and Harry teach some subjects\nin hog warts! like this type of story please direct more parts!........\nand the all parts of Harry Potter which i was seen on my computer is\ngreat i love Harry Potter and i want that direct more parts of this\nmovie and direct it until the director not died plz ! sorry for these\nbottom lines i post it because of IMDb not allow me to post the comment\nless then 10 lines!(By submitting this review you are agreeing to the\nterms laid out in our Copyright Statement.

"\nAn amazing and epic cinematic conclusion to the Harry Potter series. Of\ncourse, the books were far superior in every way but these last couple\nof movies really did do an amazing job capturing the meaning behind\nevery scene which the earlier films couldn't quite do. The acting\ncontinued to improve in every film as did the development of the\noverall story arc and characters. I also felt like this was the best\nmovie in terms of not needing to have read the books in order to fully\nengage in the story. Overall, I am very glad that I was able to\ncomplete the book series and films. This entire process has been an\nenjoyable one and that is the ultimate point of all mediums of\nentertainment, isn't it? To enjoy it? That's always been my belief and\nthis story was absolutely captivating. I can't wait until the next time\nI can make it to Universal Studios to check out what I've heard is an\namazing job at recreating the environment. Thank you J.K. Rowling for\nproviding premium entertainment for my mind!\n"
"\nI love this movie so much..... but there were some parts that i felt\nthat was kind of unfair...<br><br>Now, You guys remember the scene where in deathly hallows, the death\neaters v.s the wizards and everyone is fighting on harry's behalf now\nat the end of this fight harry breaks the elder wand and throw it....<br><br>Then it shows 20 years later OK.. now the part that annoys me so much\nthat 20 yrs later Harry,Ginny and Ron,Herminoe and Malfoy,Pantsy had\ntheir kids but what about everyone else and their kids....<br><br>i believe that the other students wanted to see their kids grow up and\nattend Hogwarts themselves......\n"
"\nwhat a movie!!!!after watching this movie i suffered from two things.\n1.extreme happiness(was giddy) 2.sadness(was sulking)<br><br>now before u think i have gone mad let me explain i was happy cause\nthey couldn't have put a better end to this epic best sellers\nnovel....incredible visual effects,performance,sounds....i can go\non....it made me feel like i am at the hogwarts battle.....running from\nnagini.....the landscape was very beautiful.....so hats-off WB for\nthis.<br><br>now i was sad cause..THERE WILL BE NO MORE HARRY POTTER.....really i\ngrew up with harry potter.reading books ......waiting for the\nmovies..now it's all over.There will be no more new\nthrill,anticipation....BooHOO.<br><br>anyway i am looking forward to the hunger games*wink*\n"
"\nI've been a fan of the Harry Potter series from the start. Not a huge\nfan, but I've watched them all and I've enjoyed most of them.<br><br>If I were to the describe this movie as short as possible, I would say\nit's \"a Harry Potter movie\". It's almost a niche genre. You know what\nto expect at this point. The movie doesn't stray away from the others,\nand it doesn't try anything knew. But it wraps up the story quite\nnicely in a believable way.<br><br>There are a few things that were a bit unsettling, but I wont spoil\nanything.<br><br>If you are like Harry Potter movies and some intense wand action, give\nit a watch!\n"
"\nThe movie is epic ,enough said ...............we all know how much\nharry potter means to us, we share our childhood to this bespectacled\nwizard boy.........there are so many scenes including the one from the\nroom of requirement which justifies it's post 3D\nconversion..............all i want to say is , this is the last time u\nwould ever see potter on the big screen unless a few generations from\nnow when another big movie franchise gets the opportunity to film a\nremake if at all.........don't be choosy to settle for a 2D\nversion.......who knows when something as epic, as popular and as\nequally loved character will ever greet the big\nscreen.....................HAVE FUN !!!!!!!\n"
"\nI'm so glad the last Potter film is finally over with and there will be\nno more of these big budget, boring movies. There was nothing in this\nsequel that I liked; no memorable moments or funny scenes. It was all\nbland, and that is such a shame since the books were so good. The\nPotter movies just got worse as it went along. And in this movie there\nwasn't even good special effects. Like in the beginning, Harry,\nHermione, and Ron use magic to disguise themselves to break into a\nvault at the goblin bank. That's already been done in the series. It\njust wasn't interesting.<br><br>Plus, I've never any of the actors in these movies have been very good.<br><br>FINAL VERDICT: I'm so glad it's over and no more Potter films.\n"
"\nI've watched the movie in a 3D version. During the movie I noticed that\nquite often you see a sort of Schiller like theater setting in layers\nappearing on the screen. First layer is sharp, other layers are often\nnot sharp. In photography terms we call this the depth of field. I\nactually haven't given 3D a lot of thought since it came available, but\nseeing The Deathly Hallows I realized that when you watch a 3d movie,\nyou want a high level of dept of field. In that case most layers will\nbe sharp giving you a good 3D experience of the movie like looking\nthrough a window. Lot's of detail become visible. As the Deathly\nHallows don't often use a high DOF, I can't recommend the 3D version as\nan extra feature to the movie experience, often it's rather annoying to\nwatch this version compared to the 2D movie.\n"
"\nI'm not a die-hard fan of Harry Porter, I'm not even a fan of Harry\nPorter series. But I have watched three Harry Porter movies. They are\nall OK for me. I'm impressed by the first movie,\"Harry Potter and the\nPhilosopher's Stone \". When I heard the news of \"Harry Potter and the\nDeathly Hallows: Part 2\" record-breaking weekend box offices worldwide,\nI think I should watch it as soon as possible. I watched today, I have\nto admit that Deathly Hallows Part 2 is the best-plotted,\nmost-entertained one compared to its previous series movies.However,\nit's not as good as the ratings here IMHO, someone might say i'm being\nbiased, but if you look at those top 50 movies which got the same\nratings, i don't think this movie stand a chance to be equally great as\nthe others.\n"
"\nI have seen this movie twice. I liked it MUCH better the first time\nbecause I watched all the Harry Potter movies before this one and it\naffected me so much...even more than \"Return of the King.\" The second\ntime I saw it was great but not as powerful. It was not just because I\nhave already seen it,but because I didn't get that feeling of \"Oh man.\nI would do anything for this series NOT to end.\"<br><br>First time viewing: 10/10 <br><br>Second time viewing: 9/10 <br><br>You MUST watch the rest as well. I guarantee it will be such a\nsatisfying experience. <br><br>HARRY POTTER FOR THE Oscars\n"
"\nI'm out of words to describe this masterpiece.Sadly after 10 amazing\nyears we say goodbye to characters we have grown to love like\nrelatives.First of all I'd like to congratulate David Yates for\ndirecting this in the best possible way he could and for making one of\nthe most spectacular finales ever seen on screen.Daniel,Rupert and Emma\nshine as always but Alan Rickman is very deserving of an Oscar for his\nperformance which completely stole the show.The score is great,the\nscript is great (very good twists for those who didn't read all of the\nbooks) and the action scenes are fantastic. Overall this film created a\nbar and reached it with great style and I think it could be capable of\ngetting an Oscar nod for best picture and more than capable of being an\nunforgettable blockbuster.So to finish it all off I'd like to say\nRon,Hermoine,Harry you will be missed.\n"
"\nI have now been to see the second part of harry potter twice and both\ntimes have been impressed with how good the graphics and acting of the\nthree main characters are, however i was disappointed that it did not\nstick to the book as much as part 1. My main problems were:<br><br>teddy lupin is barely mentioned Freddie's death is barely seen <br><br>snapes memories are rushed<br><br>not enough screen time on professor mcgonagall or snape<br><br>my least favourite part is the ending where harry defeats voldemort and\nafterward he goes back into the great hall but nobody says to him well\ndone or finally voldemorts dead which is a little bit weird.<br><br>However it has some great music and brilliant acting especially by Alan\nrickman who is portrays snapes emotions brilliantly and shows a more\nvulnerable side another great performance was by Mathew lewis who plays\nNeville, Neville steals the show for me being the surprising hero.<br><br>overall this is a must see film but if you are a big fan of the books\nyou may find the film slightly disappointing\n"
"\nI don't usually review Harry Potter titles although I'm one of the\nbiggest fans. I went for the final installment first day first show\n(couldn't wait any longer like I did for the others) and I wasn't\ndisappointed at all (I never have with this franchise). <br><br>The movies have gained as much of a following as the books itself, but\nthis one takes the cake. I'm assuming that the Director, story-writers\netc all worked under a lot of pressure as they had to live up to the\nexpectations of millions of fans worldwide, and they did a hell of a\njob of it. The visuals are excellent, and since this movie only\ncaptures the second part of the book, there wasn't any need to gain\nmomentum as the story progresses; the movie had us enthralled from the\nvery beginning.<br><br>I'm thoroughly saddened that this is probably the last Harry potter\nmovie that came out (fingers crossed). It's like there's nothing more\nto look forward to. Yet, J.K. Rowling and everyone have enchanted us\nbeyond our dreams all these years, so I bid adieu to you, Harry Potter,\nthe boy who lived. Excellent. 10 on 10.\n"
"\nThe film was epic. I am a huge fan and arrived at the theater at noon\ndressed up in anticipation. However, nothing could have prepared me for\nthis. It was incredible. Enjoy and savor it. You will not be\ndisappointed in a single performance. The kids have grown so much over\nthe years and Alan Rickman gives one of the performances of his career.\nVery very rarely do you gerecieve the opportunity to witness the total\ncompletion of something that you have loved for more than 10 years.\nEspecially on screen. While many tears were dropped, it is a feeling of\ncompleteness. Those who worked on it should be more than proud as it\nwas an honor to watch.\n"
"\nHarry Potter and Deathly Hallows: Part 2 is an Outstanding Movie. <br><br>Many surprises gonna shock audience in this part. Specially real\ncharacter of Snap is revealed in this part, i think which is the best\npart of the Movie. The secret of the death of Headmaster(In Harry\nPotter 6) is also shocking. Death of some characters is not so\nappreciable. But all over the final part will be the biggest hit of the\nseries.<br><br>It's Oscar Winning Movie. Acting of all the actors are outstanding.\nDirection of the movie is very good. Music and Special Effects are\nreally mind blowing.<br><br>The Perfect End of the series of Harry Potter. I can say that \"It\ncouldn't be better End than this\". It's really a must watch movie.\n"
"\nHad I not read the book I probably would have loved this movie. In the\nbeginning it follows the book well even if the pacing is kind of\nuneven. However, when the battle begins it starts to slowly stop using\nwhat was already well written in the book. The part that really got me\nupset was after Harry died. 1. He doesn't hide under the invisibility\ncloak and reappear later. 2. They drag out the snake killing, but\nthankfully Neville still kills it in the end. 3. Voldemort and Harry do\nnot get the epic showdown in the Great Hall. Instead they fight\neverywhere and the Elder Wand explanation is dragged out. All in all\nthe movie was very disappointing because of how much of the end they\nreplaced. It's like they took the major plot points and threw the book\nout the window.\n"
"\nI loved it. It was a great ending. But I kind of hoped Harry and\nHermione would have gotten together (please don't argue because even JK\nRowling acknowledged that she made a mistake). No, I haven't read the\nbooks. SO unlike the BOOK's fans I can tell that THIS WHOLE SERIES IS\nWORTH WATCHING AND IS A MASTERPIECE.\n"
"\n\"Harry Potter. The boy who lived, come to die.\" - these words from\nVoldemort 'll stuck in your head if you're a true potterhead. <br><br>It's the most epic 'n heartbreaking part of the whole series. <br><br>Every potterhead 'll cry like a baby watching this part. <br><br>They'll watch it again 'n again I bet.\n"
"\nThis is how you end a franchise!! This and the Half-Blood Prince will\nalways be my favorite Harry Potter films!!! The story does come to an\nend so well and you get to see so many characters grow and be stronger!\nthere is so much energy in this film and I believe so many actors cared\nabout how it was going to end as much as the fans did. Harry Potter\nwill always be an icon, a classic, and a brilliant book series by such\na powerful and intelligent women known as J.K. Rowling. Spoiler\nWarning: I loved it when Hermione and Ron kissed, the whole theatre\nclapped and I loved when Neville killed Nagini. Aaah! It was so epic!\nLoove it and will always love it!\n"
"\nGreat ending to the series I thought it was quite good, but they missed\nsome crucial bits out, and altered quite a few bits, it was quite\nentertaining, I think that the battle scenes, and stunts where done\nquite well. I found the scene in pensive, the best part. I think is not\nas good as Fantastic Beasts, is because the visuals are more up to date\nand there is not much to be disappointed with because the book\nFantastic Beasts does not have an actual plot. However I think it is\none of the best out of the HP series, and to be honest, I don't think\nanother director could have done as good a job as David Yates, and the\nrest of the film crew!\n"
