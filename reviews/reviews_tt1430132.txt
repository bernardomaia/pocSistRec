"\nAre you kidding me??? I mean seriously almost everything out of\nHollywood lately seems to fall prey to the same qualities as this\nmovie. Completely unbelievable, unrealistic, CGI overload, cheesy, and\na horrible plot that absolutely insult's the intelligence of it's\naudience. If you are on drugs I'm sure you will like it because it's\nobvious the writers wrote this garbage stoned. This is the first time I\nhave ever written review for any movie on this site which should tell\nyou how tired I am of seeing the same junkie pathetic movies of late. I\ndon't know the gentlemen that reviewed this movie from LA but I can't\nbelieve he gave this 10 stars. Must have been paid handsomely.... I\nwouldn't be surprised if this movie was written by the same writer as\nthe Lone Ranger.......blah\n"
"\nI can'y start to explain how much disappointed I was after watching\nthis movie. As many of the x-men fans I too like the Wolverine the\nmost. Having said that and given how much exciting the trailer looked\nfor this title, the movie to me was a big let down. Its slow moving,\nnot as much action packed as I hoped it would be. And plot to me made\nno sense. {Spoiler Alert} I don't know if I got it wrong but in the\nmovie it has been portrayed that removing adamantium from Wolverine's\nbody deprives him of his healing power. WTF ? More so it has been\ndepicted to give the grandpa his(wolverine's) healing powers ! utter\nbullshit. Wolverine(Logan) was known for his healing power and that was\nthe reason striker chose him for injecting adamantium. Did i miss\nsomething there ? There wasn't a single scene in the movie that I\nwished I could watch again, which is generally not true for a Wolverine\nmovie. Can't believe how Jackman agreed to do this movie.\n"
"\nI've been a fair fan of the series of the whole. Even the weaker\ninstallments I thoroughly enjoyed, so my review is already weighed in\nfavor of this film. I will say even from a critics point of view I\nthought it was really well done. It's not the standard comic book fairy\ntale, but more of an intrinsic study of the Wolverine character. He\nshows a lot of depth and vulnerability in this outing, far more than\nprevious installments. It's a risky but necessary move to see him\noperate on a balance challenge where he really is prone to death at any\nmoment. The humor is matched well with the drama for an interesting\nviewing all the way through. All the supporting roles I found\ninteresting as well. I really enjoyed the presence of Yukio who\nprovided invaluable aide despite Wolverine's incessant protests. I\nfound it nice to see his character finally develop some closure after\nall the time we've get to see him in all his cinematic installments.\n"
"\nIt's like they didn't watched the movie before releasing it. <br><br>There's no explanation for Viper's motives, and why did she change her\nskin in the middle of a fight scene, which didn't made her stronger at\nall. It made no sense. <br><br>They should be a lot clearer in let us know the time line. After\nsearching Google, I found out this is after the third movie, X-Men:\nLast Stand. Wolverine has a lot of dreams/hallucinations about Jean.\nThey should have started the movie with a scene right after the ending\nof Last Stand, so the audience would get a clearer picture of what was\ngoing on. Not just a scene where he wakes up in the woods after ??\nyears after a war.<br><br>Also when Wolverine's powers was disabled, he took a lot of bullets and\njumped from a high building, but he just kept on running like it didn't\nhurt him at all. <br><br>Plot holes and an overall boring move makes me give this movie a 2/10\n"
"\nThe only thing I can really say about Wolverine is that it's good. It's\na fun personal tale with great acting and fun characters and even if\nWolverine can't die which was a problem with the last film there was\ntimes in this movie where you were like maybe he could die but no they\ndid the safe thing but that's fine. It learned form the last film and\nwas able to give the comic fans what they want but at the same time\nmake everyone else happy.<br><br>The plot follows Wolverine meeting a Japaneses solider who is near\ndeath and that solider wants to thank him for saving him as shown at\nthe starts of the film. He then dies and at his funeral they are\nattacked by some mysterious gang who are trying to find and kill his\ndaughter.<br><br>The movie is really good and you should watch this one over X men\norigins Wolverine.\n"
"\nI'll admit it, I didn't care for the last solo Wolvie film (but I'm not\nalone in that one...I just can't forgive the treatment Deadpool got)\nbut you can't really compare the two because this one is lightyears\nbeyond that one.<br><br>I walked into the theater with minimum expectations--I wasn't expecting\ngreatness but wasn't anticipating failure either--but this one blew me\naway.<br><br>Once again, Hugh Jackman proves that like how Downing is to Iron Man,\nhe is to Wolverine but what I really liked is how the film takes Wolvie\ninto a new direction and provides a character-driven story that sees\nLogan dealing with inner demons and new challenges that go beyond just\nslicing up as many people as possible with adamantium claws.<br><br>Then the action they toss in is just a delicious added treat! Just a\nreally great X-title and comic book movie in general!\n"
"\nAfter the debacle that is 'Origins: Wolverine,' the character has\nfinally been given the proper treatment all fans have been waiting for.<br><br>In 'The Wolverine,'a tormented Logan must come to terms with the loss\nof Jean Grey,the love of his life. After years of wandering, he meets\nYukio, an assassin from Japan who is sent to fetch Logan on behalf of\nher master (Yashida), who Logan saved during the attack on Nagasaki in\n1945. Here is where Logan meets another possible love interest, who he\nstrives to protect from the Yakusa.<br><br>Throughout the film, Famke Janssen's Jean Grey appears--guiding and\ntormenting Logan until he finally learns to accept that the past cannot\nbe undone. 'The Wolverine' breathes new life into the character,\nresulting in one of the best superhero films--one that actually tells a\nstory and keeps its audience watching for that reason, not so much\nbecause there is explosive, nonsensical destruction every 2 minutes.<br><br>Go watch 'The Wolverine.'\n"
"\nThis is a really good movie of Wolverine here and definitely better\nthen X-Men Origins Wolverine. This movie contains Wolverines own story\nand the main villain he has to fight is called the Silver Samurai. Now\nthe Silver Samurai's main goal in this was to suck the healing factor\nout of Wolverine and make him young again. The Silver Samurai in the\nend was defeated though and Wolverine lived on. We also see Charles\nXavier and Magneto at the end of this and they warn him of the deep\nthreat of all humans and mutants that's coming in the future and that\nthey need his help in on it. Very good movie here anyway and beats the\ncrap out of X-Men origins Wolverine.\n"
"\nHugh Jackman and cast is great, and did a lot with what is truly an\nawful script and production.<br><br>The series of events is predictable. It's essentially the remake of\nmany many movies before, with no originality whatsoever. <br><br>Then the production reminds of fx seen in the 1980's with people having\nfights on bridges periodically covered in steam/smoke and then the\nviper deciding to shed her skin. This would have been staple food of\nthe sci fi of yester year, and the worst is that the make up etc is on\nequal par with movies of those days.<br><br>Rather rent a beta-max version of The Terminator. It would be\ncinematically a lot more realistic and entertaining even though you'll\nhave to rewind the tape.<br><br>I am being kind in awarding this a 4.\n"
"\nI saw the movie yesterday afternoon. For the most part; I thought it\nwas an \" OK \" movie. Not great, didn't knock my socks off. But the\nfight sequences were something to see. <br><br>Wolverine's fight with the animatronic samurai was worth the price of\nadmission alone. You can only see that close up. <br><br>Wolverine's a soldier. Plain and simple. He's not so much a protector\nof the innocent young flower child. <br><br>The plot twists and turns were pretty much predictable. The old man\nrevealing his true colors at the end was somewhat surprising. <br><br>As for what everyone's talking about - the bonus scene: <br><br>I admit; even I was surprised to see Xavier back in one piece. From the\nthousands Jean Grey blew him into during X-MEN The Last Stand.<br><br>Can't wait for Days of Future's Past. <br><br>If Wolverine can have his hands full with one metal samurai; he's going\nto need a little more help battling Sentinels.\n"
"\nThis movie was excellent but in some parts I found myself craving more\nintense action even the fight between The Silver Samurai and Wolverine\nseemed really long and boring except for when he cut off his claws. The\ntwist in the end was surprising but a lot of people had predicted it\nfar before the scene came. Viper's presence in this movie was not only\npointless but boring she could've done more than just poison a couple\nof guys and walk away with a name like Viper I expect a fast striking,\ndangerous, venomous character all we got was venomous. Overall action\njunkies like me might not have enjoyed the lack of action but the movie\nitself is gold.\n"
"\nThis is a great movie. The first five X men movies are good this is\nbetter. This movie has a great story line. It also has great acting. It\nalso has great special effects. X men day of further past is better. X\nmen apocalypse is also better. But still this a great movie. See it. It\nis one of the best action movies from 2013. It is a must see. It has a\nlot of action. 6.7 is a good ratting. But this is such a great movie\nthat 6.7 is underrating it. I give it a 9. Because it is a great movie.\nSee this movie. It is a great movie. I do not no why any one would not\nlike this movie. And if they do it is because they do not know a good\naction movie when they see it.\n"
"\nI'm not sure why this movie has the same score as Origins, it was a\nmuch stronger movie imo. I didn't like Iron Samurai or the Viper but\nsomehow this movie worked even with weak antagonists. Some character\nmotives weren't true to themselves but overall this movie was\nentertaining and a bit different from the rest of the superhero films.\nThis is definitely underrated and what I call a slow burner. The worst\nof the bunch imo is Origins, X3 and Apocalypse. Days of Future past was\nneither good or bad from what I remembered (the worst offense lol). I\nreally enjoyed X1, X2, First Class, Logan, The Wolverine and Deadpool.\n"
"\ni am not sure if i should say that this movie is good or bad,it is a OK\nmovie i am a huge fan of the xmen series and a die-hard fan of\nwolverine, i went in with a lot of expectations but i was almost\ndisappointed, there were a lot of plot holes and many parts in the\nmovie just didn't make sense, sometimes it makes you go like \"how dafaq\ndid that happen\" but there is a solid cast and Hugh Jackman's's acting\nis topnotch the action sequences are actually a stand out and the\nending is something which you wont expect, some people would love to\nhate the climax the movie is pretty decent though i felt it has a week\nstoryline the after-credit scene makes you jump up the seat and wanting\nto wait for a sequel it isn't a bad movie, i would just say to maintain\nyour expectations this is just a movie you could watch once, it ties\noff quickly than you could expect\n"
"\nI don't understand the hate aimed at this movie, as I find it vastly\nsuperior and a lot more enjoyable than its prequel \"X-Men Origins:\nWolverine\" and X-Men: Last Stand.<br><br>Plot In A Paragaph: Following the events of \"X-Men: The Last Stand\"\nLogan (Hugh Jackman) lives a lonely life in the mountains, haunted by\ndreams of Jean Grey (Famke Jenssen) He is located by Yukio, Rila\nFukushima) a mutant with the ability to foresee peoples death, who asks\nhim to travel with her to Japan, where he is to meet an old\nacquaintance who is dying. In a struggle that sees him stripped of his\nimmortality, Wolverine must battle deadly samurai whilst trying to\nprotect his friends granddaughter, Mariko (Tao Okamoto)<br><br>Hugh Jackman is in the best shape I've ever seen him and is charismatic\nas always, He will forever be linked with the role of Wolverine, I\nshudder to think what will happen when he stops playing the role, as\nfor me he is irreplaceable, he is the definitive Wolverine as much as\nChristopher Reeve is the definitive Clark Kent/Superman.\n"
"\nLogan travels to Japan in the Wolverine --- the film is all-round\ndifferent, and better than the first stand-alone Wolverine film (X-Men\nOrigins: Wolverine) as it adds more excitement, action, better acting,\nand more complex fights. <br><br>Disappointingly enough, there's not much different in terms of dialogue\nas it's simple and not done very well. Also, a few of the explosions\nare irritating as the first one, at the start, looks as if it was meant\nto take off the literal second in which Wolverine takes cover, and\nthat's very annoying. <br><br>The end scene is pretty cool - in which Wolverine faces more than he\nbargains for - with a slight twist here and there. <br><br>7.7/10.\n"
"\n.. i must admit that X-Men: The Last Stand and X-Men Origins: Wolverine\nhad left a real bad taste in my mouth with regards to anything related\nto this character. <br><br>X-Men: First Class was a good step in righting the franchise again, but\nwhen i saw there was another Wolverine movie i had zero motivation to\ncheck it out.<br><br>Found the Blu-Ray on-sale for 10 bucks, however, and being the comic\nnerd that I am, i finally decided to give it a chance.<br><br>Colour me surprised to say I actually quite enjoyed it. It's much less\naction-oriented and more on the character-driven side, which was\nrefreshing.<br><br>Mariko and Yukio were both really well-realized characters. I really\nenjoyed the by-play and chemistry between Wolverine and Yukio. I was\nhappy to see the setup for them to be adventuring together moving\nforward. Hope that Mangold and company stick with that.<br><br>Good film! Hopefully X-Men: Days of Future Past can build on this and\ncontinue the upturn.\n"
"\nThe Wolverine is a great movie with a very well written storyline and a\ntalented cast.My was very pleased with this movie,Wolverines first spin\noff film was extremely mediocre and had so many flaws,this movie made\nup for that,I'm not saying its perfect but it certainly is the solo\nmovie that Wolverine deserves,he's a great character and Hugh Jackman\ndoes a great job playing him.The ending is without a doubt my favourite\npart,it was just such a fun and unexpected scene,I won't spill\nanything,but it is definitely a set up for X-Men: Days of Future\nPast.Fans of the X-Men series and Wolverine in particular will be very\npleased with the Wolverine and I would definitely recommend it.<br><br>After Wolverine ends up in Japan,he gets caught up in some major forces\nthat causes to face his own inner demons.<br><br>Best Performance:Hugh Jackman Worst Performance:Tao Okamoto\n"
"\nThe love for Hugh Jackman aside, this is easily the most profound\nWolverine movie (profound in a Marvel comic sense, that is) that had\nbeen shot and produced. The film was quite well-balanced between action\nand character building; it depicted how the tragic hero battled\nmortality and his own dark demons whilst also slicing open the chests\n(and other body parts) of countless opponents with ease and grace. <br><br>The rhetoric: is it really good to get what one (believes) one craves\nand yearns for? I think the movie did a pretty job of illustrating that\npoint. One drawback (spoilers warning!) - I dislike the way they\ntainted the friendship which lasted half a century. Another comment\n(spoilers again!) - I really don't feel too comfortable with the bone\nclaws (which according to Marvel will be here to stay for a while yet)\nso am eagerly looking forward to the next X- Men movie.\n"
"\nI liked this movie a lot. It was slick, intense, good action, good\nacting all around, well directed and one has to respect the decorum of\nMr. Jackman. He was in amazing shape for this movie, his chest and abs\nwere insane, and one has to respect that transformation. That's a lot\nof work physically, mentally and spiritually all around. I liked where\nthe story went, I thought it was the best one out of the X-men series\nand the last Wolverine movie.<br><br>You can never go wrong with Samurai's and pretty Asian women either who\ncan kick some butt. James Mangold is a fantastic director and I can\njust imagine he was fighting the producers to keep that ending out of\nthe movie, I won't say the ending, but it was an ending that took away\nfrom the movie and I can imagine Mr. Mangold was furious for having to\nkeep it in there. Good movie all around though.\n"
"\nIf you thought X-Men Origins: Wolverine sucked prepare to be wrong\ncause The Wolverine rocks. Hugh Jackman returns as Logan and totally\nnails it i love the great sense of humor, the cgi is amazing and the\nenemies don't need to be mutants every time you have Yakuza, Ninjas,\nViper and the Silver Samurai i also loved the little redhead chick she\nkicked a lot of butt. The cast did a good job and i think James Mangold\ndid a pretty cool job on directing the film he also directed Sylvester\nStallone in Copland another movie i absolutely loved. Also the End\nCredits scene picks up for the events of X-Men: Days of Future Past and\ni also thought the Soundtrack was amazing. Also The Wolverine picks up\nsome years after X-Men: The Last Stand and it's a sequel to X-Men:\nOrigins and by far my favorite X-Men film. Can't wait for Wolverine 3.\n"
"\nJames Mangold directed this sixth \"X-Men\" entry, though the second to\nfocus primarily on Wolverine(Hugh Jackman) which is set after the\nevents of 'The Last Stand', as Wolverine, now living a nomadic\nexistence in the wilderness, is located by a Japanese woman who tells\nhim that a (now) wealthy Japanese man whose life he had saved in\nWWII(when the two atom bombs were dropped) is now dying, and wants to\nrepay his life debt by offering him a chance to relinquish his\nimmortality by transferring it to him through a new process. Wolverine\nrespectfully refuses, but events spiral out-of-control as someone wants\nthe man's daughter and heir dead, and also wants Wolverine's healing\npower, which threatens his indestructibility... Hugh Jackman is more\nthan capable of carrying this interesting picture alone with nice Japan\nlocations and story, which will push him in a new direction, and(if you\nstay through the end credits) into his next \"X-Men\" adventure.\n"
"\nIt starts off exciting enough but by midway through it fizzes out and\nends up just making a mess everywhere. Jackman is great as Wolverine\nand his dedication to the role is admirable. I would have liked to seen\nthe story grounded a little more as the world this movie exists in is\ndefinitely not a real one. Fight scenes are abundant and well done but\na little too numerous and non-consequential. Plot annoyances arrive in\nthe form of an unnecessary love interest and a giant ninja robot. Also,\neveryone in this film is a ninja because, you know, everyone from Japan\nis. If you like ridiculous action and overly staged fight scenes, then\nthis will appeal. It feels like something a 15yr old would like, and I\nsuppose that is where the target audience would be. Not a bad flick and\nworth the view if you are a fan of the Wolverine.\n"
"\nAnd putting him to sleep too, if you will. You've probably seen the\ntrailer, but even if not, the movie itself is very predictable. You\ndon't have to think too much to come up with what is going to happen.\nBut the movie is still a lot of fun to watch. Has character moments and\nseems to be detached from the other Wolverine movie. Which means you\ndon't have to have seen that.<br><br>It actually does tell a sort of stand alone story. And since I'm not\nvery familiar with the comic books I can't tell you, how close this is\nto them. Or if this is something that spans more than one story in the\nbooks or is made up. What I can tell you, is that it looks amazing and\nour hero does find himself in a predicament, that he himself created.\nHugh Jackman is amazing once again\n"
"\n(67%) A refreshing change of pace and tone from all the other superhero\nmovies that are relentlessly made these days that focuses as much\nattention on character as it does action. This is a well made leap\nforward over the last Skip Woods written Wolverine picture, with a lot\nmore depth, ideas, and purpose, with Jackman fitting into the role\nperfectly as he always has from the beginning. The story is pretty\nsimple, yet there are complexities in there dealing with loss of loved\nones and human mortality which is handled well in a movie that could\nhave simply not bothered. Overall a good, solid superhero entry to go\nalongside the best of the bunch.\n"
"\nthis movie is really what an action film should be all about . Muscles\n, male presence , testosterone releasing , adrenaline bursts . starts\noff slowly but eventually grabs u and u r lost in wonderful world of\nwolverine (only could be imagined in a movie).<br><br>The Nagasaki bombing scene is really a masterpiece , Japanese soldiers\nhaving suicide was heart breaking . then story takes a twist and takes\nto gripping world of Tokyo .the Japanese ninja actions were awesome ,\nCGI at it s great . disappointing though was typical plot of a girl\nbring abducted by a dozens of bad guys in the presence of army of good\nguys .<br><br>The Bullet Train sequence was best i have ever seen in cinema it was\nfast , electrifying and got heart to pound at 300 miles an hour .<br><br>mid part was usual as a action film would be.end was disappointing. why\nwould a person try to kill the very person who saved his life . thats\ntotally rubbish . CGI Ninga was best of its kind though\n"
"\nAfter the first hour I wanted to walk out and every 5 min that past\nfelt like an eternity, it was a snore fest. Zero action, horrible\nstory, made no sense, no explanation of characters, no reason to care\nfor them or about them or anything in the movie really, just a horrid\ndisappoint all around. I have lost all faith in any future Wolverine\nmovies.<br><br>The story was predictable, easily. Wolverine was an idiot in the movie\nbeing taken down easily at times, with zero fight. There were so many\nstupid moments, so little explanation for what was happening, why it\nhappened, why we should care, who was who. I wasn't expecting the best\nstory, etc. I figured it would be worth watching for the action alone,\nbut there was practically none, and nothing good that's for sure. No\nwonder they didn't show it in IMAX, it's not worth it. I would have\nrather watched Man of Steel again, or Pacific Rim again.<br><br>I will never watch this movie again. I recommend you save the 2 hours\nof your life, because you will hate it. Anyone who says its good, is\nretarded.\n"
"\nHugh Jackman is simply wolverine i have seen in 2 D its great story to\nfollow on from the origins it has great character study of wolverine in\nhis vulnerable state there is great action but doesn't distract you to\nmuch away from the story line its not distracting you just feel his\npain frommissing jean Grey and wanting to not be a hero of the hour i\nthink he just want to be left alone but his past haunts him and he\ndoesn't know how to get past it this i gave the film 7 out of 10 the\nfilm last 2hrs i doesn't fell long i think the director does a great\njob in keeping it all together roll on the next wolverine film the\njapan setting is great from a point of that it gets away from the USA\ntheme great ninja warriors in the film\n"
"\nTwo is probably one star too many, but that's for the effort Hugh\nJackman put into a weak, disjointed, ludicrous plot. The camera work on\nthe fight scenes were obviously an effort by the director to promote\nthe efforts of a normal 3-year-old...although either of my girls were\nbetter at that age than whomever they let do the filming. Be nice if\nfilm makers would stop having their idiot camera men run down the\nstreet, jump over objects and crawl over broken glass when they were\nfilming action scenes. They totally suck. As for the plot, everyone is\ntrying to kill the girl Wolverine decides to protect. However, any one\ncould have killed her at any time during the drug out, unbelievable\nfights...which Wolverine seems unable to win. Good thing they didn't\nuse X-Men in the title. They would certainly be facing a lawsuit by\nevery other respectable X-Man.\n"
"\nI'm not really good with reviews so I'll just share my thoughts. <br><br>I loved the way the movie started and that was about it. Die hard\nWolverine fans will probably like it more, but I think X-men movies are\nmuch more interesting. Hugh Jackman plays the role great and I can't\nimagine another actor replacing him. The fight scenes were also very\nentertaining and well choreographed, but there was something missing\n(more mutants?) and I don't know what. There were a bit too much\ncliché's both plot and character - wise too.<br><br>That said - I would gladly watch another Wolverine movie and hope it\nturns out better than this one. I would recommend the movie, but don't\nexpect \"A man of steel\" awesome effects and dramatic storyline. Just\ngrab some popcorn and enjoy, BUB!\n"
"\nThe 2nd worst movie not far behind \"Now You See Me\" in 2013, directed\nby James Mangold atrociously goes to \"The Wolverine\". This is a\ncomplete dud of a movie managing to be dull and full of American\nStereotypes of Japanese, and probably at it's worst with cringe-worthy\nacting from most involved save Jackman. Most of the fault goes to the\ndirectors and script writers. This movie is a failure on several\nlevels. It starts out promising enough with a quick montage from WWII\nsupposedly, and then State-side, but degenerates badly when the main\nstory starts, and the horrible dialog, direction, and acting that the\nJapanese actors have to put-in and up with. Like \"Pacific Rim\", it's\nmore Asia-philia but without Rim's fun and spectacle. The action is\nmostly poor and weakly shot and realized. Jackman obviously got pumped\nup again, and the filmmakers overdo his shirt-less scenes, but I kept\nwaiting for the movie to get more intense or infuse itself with energy,\nbut it's pulse-less. Not even worth a rental, sad to say unless your a\ndie-hard Jackman fan. 4/10\n"
"\nThe Wolverine - a more deep side of Logan(much better than the last\none)<br><br>So this was actually the sequel to X-Men: The Last Stand which\ncontinued the story of Logan in Japan.. This one was much better than\nX-Men Origins: Wolverine as there was much of script and soul about\nLogan than just an action flick. There were not much of 3D scenes but\nthe action sequences were clean and natural and fast paced..specially\nthe \"BULLET TRAIN\" sequence was mind blowing..........well acc. to me\nthis movie was just as lovable as all other X-Men movies.<br><br>Although there was too much Japanese, other than that it was a great\nfilm. Even if you are not X-men movies fan then also you will enjoy\nit..\n"
"\nMaybe I was expecting too much from The Wolverine. Like a plot, a\npurpose. This was a film for the sake of a film with too many dodgy\n(why?) moments. Opening scene was spectacular! And then nothing.\nAwkward love scene was truly the lowest point of this movie...or was it\nthe Ironman type old guy. . I think my 4 stars are more than generous.\nBeing a HUGE fan of The X Men movies I knew to stick around after\ncredits rolled. I cannot stress enough to you all to do so. The only\nsaving grace for this sloppy, crappy film. I'd give 10 stars to the two\nor so minutes of story/ teaser that followed. Let's hope for a much\nbigger effort in plot and character development in the next one. Logan\nthe loner needs no more spin offs. Ciao.\n"
"\nWhen going to see an X-Men film I always expect interesting and intense\nfight scenes, a collage of new characters/powers and the occasional bit\nof wry humor. The Wolverine did not disappoint on any of those fronts.\nIf anything it took said criteria and honed them to a sharp point.\nRather than blasting us with a slew of new faces and abilities I was\nintroduced to only a few additions. What, might you ask,filled the rest\nof the film? Depth, this film delves into Logan's emotions in a way\nnone of the others have before.<br><br>Personally, I found this to be a positive factor. While the previous\nfilms were indeed favorites of mine, I always wished that we would get\na better chance to \"know\" some of the more prominent characters. In the\nprevious wolverine film the story revolved around explaining his past. <br><br>All in all, this film is a great representation of a Logan's personal\nstruggles with the added benefit of some great secondary characters.\n"
"\nI've been a fair fan of the series of the whole. Even the weaker\ninstallments I thoroughly enjoyed, so my review is already weighed in\nfavor of this film. I will say even from a critics point of view I\nthought it was really well done. It's not the standard comic book\nfaire, but more of an intrinsic study of the Wolverine character. He\nshows a lot of depth and vulnerability in this outing, far more than\nprevious installments. It's a risky but necessary move to see him\noperate on a balance challenge where he really is prone to death at any\nmoment. The humor is matched well with the drama for an interesting\nviewing all the way through. All the supporting roles I found\ninteresting as well. I really enjoyed the presence of Yukio who\nprovided invaluable aide despite Wolverine's incessant protests. I\nfound it nice to see his character finally develop some closure after\nall the time we've get to see him in all his cinematic installments.\n"
"\nPossible spoilers included. I do not have the patience to outline all\nthe details of why this movie was bad, but ultimately it didn't make\nsense. So many unanswered questions and basically unbelievable scenes.\nSince when does Wolverine have to fight someone with a Samuri sword for\nseveral minutes clashing blades together and not immediately cut\nthrough the blade? He fights on top of a bullet train with some yakuza\nthugs for several minutes, slashing long gaping holes in the top of the\ntrain, but no one in the train notices anything. Much of the story is\ndependant upon Wolverine actually sticking around in Japan. You know\nwhat, I said I wasn't going to do this, so yeah, the story sucks.\n"
"\nI am a fan of Wolverine, however i do feel the movie is rated way\nbeyond it's caliber. The movie starts with an inner struggle brewing\ninside our Hero. how he is taken off the worldly ways, and trying to\nforget the past. To suppress its vulnerability as a soldier, to protect\nthe weak and stand for what is right. It takes a turn to fatality, with\nWolverine landing in Japan. And then movie starts to tumble, where the\nyakuza,the Ninjas, Samurais and what not are thrown in like a\ngarnishing on a typical Indian Masala movie. The Movie could use some\nmore editing, the storyline a little more tightening. It sometimes make\nyou lose plot, who is fighting whom and protecting whom. Even if it is\nmeant for casual viewer ship, it drags at some points and go haphazard\nat others. Its not a great movie,but hey we just want to see the\nwildness unleashed on the screen,could be watched once, if you are\npatient enough and an action fan.\n"
"\nThis will once again divide many, as in my opinion, the non-comic book\nreading fans wouldn't like this as much. I, on the other hand loved it!\nVery dialogue driven &amp; story based. <br><br>Logan is tested emotionally &amp; physically in this movie, and Jackman is\nonce again in his element, it is as if, he was made to play Wolverine.\nThere is lesser action &amp; special effects compared to recent superhero\nfilms, which is refreshing. <br><br>The absence of mutants apart from Wolverine &amp; Viper though is a small\nletdown. The treatment &amp; ret-conning of The Silver Samurai is also\nsomewhat a bust, as they take a totally different route as opposed to\nthe original source.<br><br>However, I'm pleased by the film on the whole, in fact I would rate\nthis as the best among the 3 superhero films released this year, yes\neven above Man of Steel.<br><br>Do wait for the credits to roll as the post-credit scene is a doozy.\nMany who were silent throughout much of the film were cheering and\nwhooping while I let out one too many vulgarities!!\n"
"\nwhat the hell Hugh Jackman and marvel was thinking of when they took\nthis project? Personally if I had some power in the higher ranks of\nHollywood.I would have denounced this franchise.I would have taken away\nall good reputations won by wolverine as a character.<br><br>The only good thing coming out of the movie is the train fight\nsequence.I would vote for more such action scenes. But there was none.\nAdd to that the hollowness in the story. There was no punch in the\nstory. whether it was there in the comics or a new story i don't know.\nBut it certainly lacked good things of a movie. It was overall a flop\npackage. If you want to spend your worthless time then this movie is\nfor you. Happy wolver-whining.\n"
"\nI'm not a big fan of the x-men franchise but this movie had be thinking\nI'm gonna like it and I did, for the first half that is. The movie\ntakes off pretty well, attains cruising altitude and then suddenly\ndrops like dead weight. They had everything going well for this movie\nuntil Wolverine decides to let his balls do the thinking for him. Half\nway through the movie they must've remembered that sex sells and so do\nunnecessary explosions and stunts. From what I understood, old man had\nalzhimers, cute babe had obsessive compulsive disorder, the cute doctor\nhad PMS and wolverine had a mid life crisis. By the time I got to the\nend I was only waiting for it to be over.\n"
"\nGo pure Asians, or pure Hollywood. Combination of the 2 always sucks!<br><br>I'm not sure if all can relate, but watching this movie is like\nwatching a Filipino action film with an upgraded CGI. I think that said\nit all.<br><br>It's full of ninjas and samurai. What year is it??? The robot got\nconfused when he is hitting the claws because of a girl's shout??? come\non.<br><br>It's just bad. Really bad.<br><br>I was really looking up for this film. Marvel films doesn't disappoint\nuntil now.\n"
"\nBecause of all the hype created around the film the expectations became\nhigh for the film but sorry to say movie was bad, not like SUPER BAD\nbut was bad. After X-men: First class i thought some good work would be\nimplemented on this film but the scenario remains same as ORIGINS. I\ncall this movie bad because of the Boring pace of the film. The romance\nbetween Wolverine(Hugh Jackman) and Mariko(Tao Okamoto) was so not\nrequired but still it was present and to test the patience, was also\ngiven a large importance. We like Wolverine Cut through but not make\nlove to. And the fight sequences were so exaggerated pre-release but\nthey fall flat. Without giving out much i'll sum it up. Watch it if\nyour a fan of X-men series and Wolverine else AVOID. Expecting\nsomething big from DAYS OF FUTURE PAST.\n"
"\nThis is not another light and fluffy comic book super hero movie. This\nmovie actually has depth and substance to it, and there are not fight\nscenes taking place every few minutes like in most comic book movies\nlately. It is more of a deep character study of the Wolverine. I\nthought it was unexpectedly good, with Jackman doing a superb job in\nthe lead role, as a tortured hero, who seems as if he no longer wants\nto go on living his near immortal existence because of deep regrets and\nguilt he is feeling about things that happened in the past.<br><br>But it is not all doom and gloom, there are indeed fight scenes, and\nthey are what you would expect of a summer blockbuster type movie. The\nlast fight scene involving a giant robot-like Samurai is especially\nspectacular. Just don't expect the fight scenes to be the main focus of\nthe movie, this is more about the Wolverine and his inner struggles of\nconscience. I liked it very much.\n"

"\nThe movie was going good and would've gotten 8 stars from me if its\nthird act was consistent with rest of the movie.Performances were\nfine.The camera-work and score was really good and the action was\nfun.There were some average acting at times though.It was an enjoyable\naffair overall and definitely worth seeing.\n"
"\nThe problem with this movie is how does the re-imagined Wolverine ever\nmake a difference? He's barely able to hold his own with normal humans,\nand that's even when Wolverine has his healing powers. This guy has\nfought the likes of the Hulk. The \"The Wolverine\" Wolverine wouldn't\nlast a second against the Hulk.<br><br>This is mostly a slow paced character movie, but it doesn't develop or\nreveal any interesting character.<br><br>There's a guy desperate for immortality as he faces death. Wolverine is\nthe immortal guy tired of life. Gee, those aren't too cardboard, are\nthey? Why don't Wolverine's claws slice through swords? Why doesn't a\nsuper heated Adamantium sword cut through flesh? Why did the bad guys\nlet Wolverine walk away from their control only to spend the rest of\nthe movie trying to lure him back into their control?\n"
"\nThe Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) for the first time is pushed to his\nlimits. Logan (Wolverine) is taken back to modern-day Japan to say\ngoodbye to a wartime nemesis Yashida (Hal Yamanouchi). Supposedly on\nhis deathbed, the Japanese business magnet requests that Logan protect\nhis granddaughter Mariko (Tao Okamoto). The story line is pretty simple\nalthough special effects are fantastic. Fight sequences are masterful\nand actually sustain the movie. Wolverine is back in the fight for\nsure; he finds himself vulnerable and must battle against his own\ndemise, foreseen by a young lady, Yukio (Rila Fukushima), who can see\nthe future and actually becomes a much needed ally.<br><br>Also in the cast: Hiroyuki Sanada, Brian Tee, Svetlana Khodchenkova,\nWill Yun Lee and Famke Janssen.\n"
"\nA lot of reviews on this site mention that they don't understand how\nthe grandfather/robot samurai was able to cut Logan's adamantium claws\n. . . however, in the movie it is pretty clearly stated that the\ngrandfather bankrupted his company stockpiling adamantium, which was\nlater used to build the robot and its its weapons. While adamantium is\nstrong, and supposedly cannot be broken, it is theoretically possible\nto damage it with something else made out of adamantium. It's been a\nlong time since I've read the comics, but I think it's canon that\nweapons used to defend against the Wolverine had to be made out of\nadamantium (e.g., Gambit's bo staff, etc). <br><br>While I don't think that this particular point is a plot hole, I was\nreally disturbed at his losing his metal claws. I'm considerably less\nexcited about seeing any sequel where the Wolverine doesn't have them. <br><br>Also, while I can't attest to the accuracy of the bombing sequence at\nNagasaki, it was (disturbingly) beautifully shot, adding to the\ncollection of rich visuals found throughout the movie.\n"
"\nExcellent movie with incredible scenery and spectacular actors. This\nmovie gets my vote as the best X-Men movie of the franchise. It gets\ndeep into the story of Wolverine and does a really good job at keeping\nthe entertainment at an all time high.<br><br>Wolverine is trying to decide if his powers are a good thing or a bad\nthing. His powers can be very stressful as those around him are not\nable to keep up with him and be by his side as he wished. The problems\nwith this film and why I did not give it a 10 is the Logan and Mariko's\nrelationship. I was thinking Logan had more chemistry or it would make\na better story if he hooked up with Yukio. I just think the chemistry\nwas not there for Logan and Mariko.<br><br>The other problem with this movie is after watching it I cannot enjoy\nX-Men Days of Future Past.<br><br>The only thing needed after this movie is an Origins made about the\nJean Grey character. I do believe she is the strongest character in the\nX-Men and she deserves her own standalone movie.\n"
"\nThe first Wolverine film (2009) was much better than this one. It was\nsimply more entertaining and \"cool\". This one is, quite frankly, boring\nand forgettable. The story-line leaves something to be desired. I was\nnot satisfied with the script. That being said, the film wasn't\nhorrible either. Personally, I just cannot find any concrete reasons\nfor watching this, since the entertainment factor is just not there.\nHugh Jackman is a good casting choice for the role of Wolverine and his\nacting is what saves this film from being a total bore. That and the\nfemale eye-candy, if you're into that sort of thing. All in all, I\nwouldn't recommend this flick to people who are not fans of the X-men\nuniverse. Those 2 hours it takes to watch this are better spent\nwatching something else.\n"
"\nIf you are an X-MEN fan and you'd like to preserve the sweet taste of\nprevious films in your mouth, don't watch this movie. It's entertaining\nonly if you're 10 years old and like Jackie Chan. Basically the story\nis nonexistent, it has one ridiculous twist and you have that\ndisappointed look on your face the whole trip and the ending doesn't\nsave the day, in fact your brain cells start killing them selves for\nhaving them watch this. <br><br>I think that crew behind this film is very well aware of it and that's\nwhy they put Famke Janssen in several scenes just to remind you: Hey\nthis is some kind of sequel of X-MEN! See? That's Jean Grey we put in\nfew non related scenes with the film whatsoever. <br><br>I hope the saga ends here and that they won't mud the memory of X-MEN.\n"
"\nMarvel has got a lot of heroes but most popular and maybe most liked is\nWolverine.I like wolverine too but not much as Professor X.If we touch\non movie,not brilliant story and only good acting coming from Hugh\nJackman,boring and similar action scenes.First hour of movie is boring\nand ordinary.Everybody can understand Haruhiko's last wish not to say\ngoodbye to wolverine.And the end of the story was terrible and viper\nwasn't enough to be archenemy and silver suit was very familiar.Logan\nalways see jean at his dreams and that was very upset to me but in this\nmovie this feeling of compassion used too much and I was bored about\nthat.To sum up movie was boring and full of ordinary action scenes but\nIf you liked wolverine like me you can easily finish the movie.It\ndeserve five points from me because It came to me very ordinary and\nboring just scenes with Yukio was good and new or fresh.At least we\nhave seen wolverine in the Japan.I congratulate Hugh Jackman and Rila\nFukushima.I really want to see a new Wolverine movie without an\nordinary story.\n"
"\n\"The Wolverine\" is the new story of Wolverine and how he is today. He\nlives a nomad life but when he summoned to Japan by an old\nacquaintance, he is embroiled in a conflict that forces him to confront\nhis own demons. In this movie we watch a little bit from the history of\nWolverine but with some differences and some new information come out.<br><br>I really liked this movie but not as much as I liked the \"X-Men\nOrigins: Wolverine\" which also had to do with Wolverine's history and\npast. I also liked this movie because of the interpretations of Hugh\nJackman, Tao Okamoto who plays as Mariko and Svetlana Khodchenkova who\nplays as Viper and we watch this character of Marvel for first time.<br><br>Finally I believe that everyone have to watch this movie because it\nshows us the after X-Men story and life of Wolverine and how the story\ncontinues.\n"
"\nOne of the opening scenes in THE WOLVERINE probably does the best job\nof showcasing the title character that we've seen thus far on-screen.\nHe stumbles upon a dying bear, tracks the killers to a nearby dive bar,\nand strolls in with malicious intent. Even though he doesn't end up\nkilling anyone, it's a fist-pump of a scene to see the man in his\nelement, doing what he does best.<br><br>As superhero movies go, this one feels like a breath of fresh air; a\npersonal story that brings Logan face-to-face in Japan with his past\nand getting mixed up with the yakuza. It's a slow burn but certainly\nnot boring. Hugh Jackman slips back into the role with ease, carrying\nthe character's baggage with sardonic wit. The fight scenes are\nlightning fast and hit hard, especially the zonked-out boss battle. And\nthe story leaves Logan in an interesting place, character-wise. <br><br>This totally makes up for X-MEN ORIGINS.<br><br>7/10\n"
"\nAfter X-Men 3 and Origins I really wasn't expecting much from The\nWolverine, even the trailer seemed predictable.<br><br>What I watched was a fantastic, deep and moving action movie that made\na seemingly immortal character vulnerable both physically and\nemotionally. The supporting cast were all excellent and the plot moved\nat a great speed through several twists and turns to an ultimately\nsatisfying conclusion. The inclusion of Jean Grey was magnificent\nworking to great effect and Hugh Jackman's performance was gripping in\na role he is clearly not bored with yet. The Wolverine will get fans of\nthe character and the X-Men who have been disappointed with Fox's\ntreatment of the series back on board and chomping at the bit for Days\nof Future Past. Well worth the money.\n"
"\nI'm not going to say that \"The Wolverine\" was the best X-men movie\never, I probably X2 the best, but I do think that it the best in a long\nwhile. Fine writing, very little of the corny special effects we saw in\nthe X-men movies and Origins, and an interesting idea to fight\nWolverine. For all the people out there who say it makes no sense,\nespecially on one review, saying that it's stupid that his claws can be\ncut, think before posting. If diamonds can cut diamond, iron can cut\niron, then shouldn't it make sense that adamantium can cut adamantium?\nSense nothing is stronger than this fictional metal, it makes sense\nthat it can cut its self right? And then with the heart bug. All that\nbug was doing was suppressing Logan's powers not taking them away, so\nwhen he destroys the bug, his powers kick back in and that's how he\nheals. All in all, \"The Wolverine\" was a pretty good movie. Sure it\ncould have been could, but look at the other X-men movies, it did\npretty good compared to them.\n"
"\nThe Wolverine is a competent movie but not special in any way. The\nacting is okay. The special effects are okay. The story is okay. Since\nour time is limited, is that enough?<br><br>You'll be entertained but what will you remember after a week? Probably\nnot much. The plot isn't especially creative (no spoilers). The twists\nare somewhat predictable. At times you might think you're watching\nPacific Rim, a Transformers movie or even The Matrix. Those comparisons\naren't compliments but point out how this movie feels formulaic. <br><br>If you like the X-Men, you might as well watch this movie too.\nOtherwise, you can safely ignore it.\n"
"\nThe beginning and end were good, but the rest of the movie was\nhorrible. Wolverine got his rear end kicked the whole movie. If I\nwanted to watch a drama, I would have rented one. W is supposed to be a\ntough super hero that dominates his enemies, not some drama queen with\na broken nail. At least the end gave notion to a sequel, which better\nbe on an action film or I am done with W. Waste of money and time. What\nwhere the creators thinking? <br><br>Wolverine couldn't fight worth a darn, gets his blades cut off, he\nmight as well been a mortal. Maybe that was the point, but it made me\nthink worse of him not better. I was hoping that the final fight was\ngoing to make up for the lack of good action, but all it did was annoy\nme. This movie was a complete let down and I wouldn't waist any money\nto watch it. Wait until it airs on HBO you can get it for a Dollar on\nRed Box before you watch whatever comes after.\n"
"\nAm amazed at the current IMDb rating of 6.9,the Wolverine fans must be\non vacation. I have never read any comics or books on the \"Marvel\nSuperheros\" I am from the \"Older\" generation of Superman and Batman &amp;\nRobin days Pre 1970's,having said that I really enjoy a good action\nfilm with a reasonable storyline and fair quality acting,I am pleased\nto say The Wolverine delivered all that for me and a bit more\nespecially some of the location shots which were excellent along with\nthe \"Fight\" scenes. Sure some will find a flaw here and there with the\nproduction/acting/character's, but hey people it's a superhero movie go\nwatch our Hero get beaten then recover and beat hell out of the \"Bad\"\nguys and sometimes get the girl. Hugh Jackman delivered as usual -\nother standout's for me were Rila Fukushima(The Body Guard)and Svetlana\nKhodchenkova (Viper) I have a feeling some smart producer/director will\npick up these two ladies in the future.Gave this 8/10 now go watch THE\nWolverine to see if he gets the \"Girl\" at the end.........\n"
"\nI'm a die-hard superhero fan. I love the x-men movies and enjoyed the\nfirst Wolverine very much. This movie was really enjoyable too, but I\nexpected it to be a bit better. The action was fun just like any other\nx- men, but I didn't feel a connection with any of the characters like\nI did in any of the other movies. Some parts of the movie also seemed\ntoo predictable and a bit cheesy. I don't wanna bash on the film, cause\nI enjoyed it and thought it was good, but it could have been much\nbetter. If you like superhero movies as much as any other geek at\nheart, watch it. It has really cool action scenes and you might even\nlaugh a few times. Just try going to the theater with low expectations,\nor at least a lot lower than what I expected. You might enjoy it more\nthan I did.\n"
"\nKicking off where The Last Stand ended, The wolverine, running out of\nany motives in life(so much he starts taking revenge for the death of a\nbear) is summouned to Japan by a figure from his past whom he saved\nduring world war II. Planning for a simple visit and return things\ndon't go quite as expected..... <br><br>A significant improvement over the origins movie, this is an\ninteresting film with enough action and suspense to get you going.\nJames Mangold has directed the movie quite stylishly with great action\nscenes, beautiful scenery shots and an interesting plot. Performance\nwise Hugh Jackman delivers another great performance as the X-Men\ncharacther, it is safe to say that he has completely taken over the\nrole, the suppourting cast also do their job well. <br><br>It is a simple superhero movie with nothing so happening, but with\nenough flair to keep you entertained for two hours.\n"
"\nThere is a reason why X-men is not mentioned in the title and that is\nbecause 'The Wolverine' speaks for itself. After a disappointment with\nX-men Origins: Wolverine, Hugh Jackman finds redemption as this broken\ncharacter that we've never seen before is thrown into the strict,\northodox setting of Japan. Though not Jackman steals the screen but\nalso Svetlana Khodchenkova who brought the sexy, villainous Viper to\nlife. But I was a little down on some mediocre acting especially by\nRila Fukushima as her emotions joggled my understanding of Yukio. Even\nthe ending drew me away as well the new twists and spins that came out\nof a back-up plan jar. \"The Wolverine\" is not the worst or the best of\nthe X-men franchise so go see it and have an entertaining action-packed\nride with Logan aka The Wolverine.\n"
"\nLike James Bond in You only live twice, Wolverine turns Japanese which\nadds some exotic Japanese locations and actions to the mix but the plot\nis so hackneyed and nonsensical as it makes no sense whatsoever and it\nreally lets the film down.<br><br>The X-Men universe is getting to be tiresome despite getting\nrejuvenated a few years earlier in X-men: First Class only then to make\nanother stand alone Wolverine film which reverses the good work they\ndid in the prequels and quickly sours the freshness.<br><br>Hugh Jackman might have got comfortable with his hair and claws but he\nneeds better material. The action scenes are good with plenty of CGI\nand special effects but the story has been sliced and diced by a\nHattori Hanzo Samurai sword.\n"
"\nThis film does something new with Wolverine, it gives him some emotion\nand some feelings, this is actually good, but even though the film\nstill has a lot of action and fighting, it didn't really live up to my\nexpectations.<br><br>I liked the film for the new twist and the story, I liked all the\naction parts, lots of good fighting scenes and different kind of action\nthen we usually see with the Wolverine. But I liked the first Wolverine\nbetter and it set my expectations a bit higher then they should have\nbeen maybe.<br><br>I was entertained and liked it, but something was missing, something\nwasn't right with this installment of the franchise.\n"
"\nI love Hugh Jackman and the character of the Wolverine, but this movie\nwas terrible. It starts out cool with Logan in Japan during World War\nII and saving the life of Yashida. Then it's present time and Logan is\nliving in rural area. Yukio, working for Yashida, brings Logan to Japan\nwhere the rest of the story takes place. Yashida wants Logan's ability\nto heal and live for many many years, since he is dieing. He hires\nViper to steel Logan's healing power. Also Logan is protecting\nYashida's granddaughter, Mariko. So a lot of the movie is the bad guys\nchasing Mariko and Logan protecting her but without all of his\nabilities. And then you could see the surprise ending coming a mile\naway with Yashida. The whole story was just not that good.<br><br>FINAL VERDICT: Wolverine is better in the X-Men films then this. You\ncan skip this.\n"
"\nEvery single x-men movie that has been made in the last 10 years has\nbeen ruined by women characters, too many closeups, and time wasted on\nnonsense that doesn't have anything to do with the x-men and their\npowers. It's like the people that make these movies have no real\nconnection to the subject matter. Just another Audi commercial and\nshameless cash grab for the Asian demographic. Get rid of women and\ntheir lame dialogue. This girl power crap in Hollywood needs to come to\nan end. Overall, just another x-men movie that fails to deliver. Wow,\nwhat a terribly executed plot. This movie is pure diarrhea. The guy\nthat wolverine saves ends up trying to take his powers. It takes 2\nhours of women rambling to get this point across. A terrible movie. The\npeople who produced this movie had one thing in mind. That is,\ncapturing the Asian demographic and sucking cash out of them simply by\nsetting the movie in Japan and including some ornamental samurai\nswords. I will never pay to see an x-men movie again.\n"

"\nI am huge fan of Hugh Jackman and that's the only reason i have given\nthis movie 3 star.<br><br>Let's start with the movie, well there is a start but what's the end is\nstill a limbo state for me. OK if the Logan is going to Tokyo i can\naccept that but can't the screen writer name the characters properly\neven when they are Japanese. Every name is similar to one another\nYashida, Harada, Mariko, Yukio, etc. I was just opening the IMDb page\nagain and again to get the characters name in the middle of the movie.<br><br>The story is pathetic, in this also your mind will take backseat and\nsay What is happening can't i get a less twisted story of my favorite\nactor.<br><br>Truly disappointed, Thank God they have not attached X-men name with\nthis movie otherwise it would be unfair to me and all the fans out\nthere.\n"
"\nThe Wolverine was quite good until the final act. In that final act, it\ntook on the characteristics of a Roger Moore variety Bond film. After a\nvery suspenseful build-up, the climax got a little silly. Despite the\nsilliness, the movie wasn't destroyed, just diminished.<br><br>Advice to people who haven't been following X Men or Wolverine,\nfamiliarize yourself through some internet searching with the\nWolverine's back story. It will help you figure things out in the\nmovie's flashback scenes.<br><br>Speaking of flashes, the atomic explosion (I won't say when or where)\nwas a little underwhelming. It looked more like a hydrocarbon explosion\nthat a nuclear pop. Its effects seemed muted and slow motion also.<br><br>There was a dandy battle on top of a bullet train. Very exciting and\nwell done. There were a lot of fight sequences that were well\nchoreographed.<br><br>The cast was good at their jobs. The dialog seemed muffled, but that\nmay have been the theater in which I saw it.\n"
"\nWhen it begins a new saga, there is much pressure involved and almost\nalways a strong tendency to doubt the overall quality of a film.<br><br>This movie, however, is an example of how one can achieve with a\ncharacter who is apparently closed and raise the story to a fresh\nstart, even if some of that watched it, especially not a connoisseurs\nof Wolverine could ask \"where it came from that? \".<br><br>For anyone following the Wolverine since its inception, knows his saga\nin Japan and that it is what animates the see it. View the Samurai of\nSilver and the other characters of Wolverine comics complements the\npart of 'anxiety'.<br><br>Still, the film could be better. Part of the story was lost in some\nmoments, and other was exaggerated.<br><br>But in overall, it's fun and different times \"WTF!\", Including the\npost-credits scenes, which made me ask what more is to come.\n"
"\nThis is the best Wolverine to date. It's fast paced full of action and\nthe story keeps flowing with a few good twists and turns. Hugh Jackman\nis back to his best with a story following his past present and future.\nIt follows on from an event in Logans past where he is given the chance\nto have a taste of mortality but obviously at a price. It is mostly set\nin Japan with stunning sequences and breathtaking scenery. Without\nmaking it too complicated the movie flows through the gears and gives a\nfew flashbacks to previous movies. Whereas previous versions have\nlacked in seriousness this movie maintains a good rhythm throughout.\nWith a good blend of martial arts, samurais, mutants and robots yes\nthat's right robots its an altogether fun action packed film with well\ndirected fight scenes that you'll enjoy immensely. There is a bonus\nscene for the die hard fans after the credits well worth the wait.\nEasily watched without having seen any of the previous movies its very\nenjoyable. Most probably better watched in 2D but I've not had a chance\nwith the 3D yet.\n"
"\nUnfortunately the very -considerably- good X-men series are culminating\nin a series of rather disappointing and uninspired wolverine tribute\nwannabes. This movie leaves so much to be desired, that at some point\nyou cannot help but wonder: \"where are they going with this?\". The\nanswer only reveals itself in the last 3 minutes of the movie,\nfollowing the first end-credits. I wouldn't want to spoil it for\neveryone who has not seen the movie yet, so I have this to share: this\nis a watchable movie, entertaining as far as effects go, filled with\nplot-holes, leaving you with a taste of\n\"we-had-to-make-this-movie-as-stipulated-in-our-contract\" in the mouth.\nI would not recommend it, but I would not deter anyone from watching\nit.\n"
"\nWe all compare The Wolverine to the previous film - Origins. And we\nshould. I was afraid it will be a disaster like that. We all were. But\nit turns out it was better, it was a lot more exciting and \"realistic\".\nAnd it's not only me saying it. The plot was a lot deeper. It's quite\npopular now to have a plot where the main character goes back to basics\n(Dark Knight Rises, Iron Man 3), but either way, it was still fun. You\nsee Wolverine after the events of X-Men 3, after his loss, after his\ndeparture. He does not want to be the Wolverine anymore, but he just\ncan't stop being a hero. Don't compare it to the comic books, don't\ncompare it to previous films. It's a good sequel and it was the movie\nwe wanted. They've learnt from previous mistakes, listened to the\naudience. <br><br>And even if you didn't like some bits, when you see what's just before\nthe credits, you will get a silly smile on your face. Go Watch it!\n"
"\nAs with any Marvel Movie they tend to Drastically Change the Comic Book\nOrigins and History. Saw this and thought, wth? After about 30 years\nworth of backstory and in-depth focus on wolverine's life, they do this\nagain. Marvel must be money hungry and let the studios greenlight\nanything just for the buck. I'd avoid watching this. The Asian Actors\narn't that bad, but stereotyped as usual. most everyone is a ninja or\npart of a gang. Viper is a mutant, (in the comics she's not. What about\nHydra, Ogun, Kitty Pryde? Lame. I'm watching this and every scene is\nlike, NOOO!!, WTH?! I can hear the toilet flushing of all that work\nmarvel didn't do right down the drain. As With the Last movie same O\nsame o. Oh and How Many punishers and spidermans are they going to be?\nAnd Who approved the Twisted Character timelines of x-men origins?\nTards.<br><br>Watch it with apprehension.\n"
"\nI checked the box that says this review might contain spoilers, really\nif you don't know what's going to happen 20 minutes into the movie then\nyour just not paying attention, in your defense, it is pretty hard to\nfocus your attention on this movie. Let's get the one bright spot out\nof way, Hugh Jackman gives another solid performance as Wolverine,\noutside of that this movie is BAD, the writing was horrible, the plot\nwas horrible, there were a couple of new special effects. I couldn't\ndecide in the last 20 minutes of the movie if they were ripping off\nIron Man or Cletus the NFL robot you see every Sunday.<br><br>Honestly I wouldn't recommend wasting your time with this movie, it is\neasily the worst of all the spinoffs of the X-Men, and that's saying\nsomething because the Last Stand pretty much stunk it up as well.\n"
"\nThis is a potentially career-killing film.<br><br>I don't know where to begin, except to say that the production quality\nof the film is evidently lacking. It feels like a bad TV movie of the\nweek.<br><br>The film is strangely quiet, and lacking a musical score. The dialogue\nwhich attempts to replace it, fails miserably. The film plods along,\ntaking seemingly forever to get to the end.<br><br>Another problem is that Wolverine has no charm. His lines are all\nwooden and emotionless. Honestly, while I like Hugh Jackman, I never\nthought he made a good Wolverine. The comic character was more heavy\nset physically, and less of a gentleman.<br><br>No one can seriously claim that \"Wolverine\" is a good movie. Marvel\nshould aim a lot higher.\n"
"\nIt was one of the best movies I've seen this year. It wasn't a really\ncomplex movie or a deep movie but just a cool fight film. I loved the\nfinal scene we're the wolverine fight against the old man who tried to\ncut off his claws (it wasn't a really nice shot). That moment in the\nbunker where wolverine defended the Vietnamese was really awesome and\nheartbreaking. But sometimes it was the same over and over again but\nbecause of the fight scenes I forgive it;). The shot where the\nwolverine gets tens of arrows in his back was also not a nice shot and\nsad but it displayed the movie good. He got shot over and over again\nbut stood up and survived.\n"
"\nI went souley because I'm a huge Hugh Jackman fan. But the movie I\nthought wasn't bad. I love Hugh of course and thought that he put his\nall into it, but I also think that all the other actors did too. I\ncould have done without the bear scene. I'm not really sure I\nunderstand the point in that was, but oh well. I enjoyed the action and\nhumor in it, and thought it was a well put together film. But of course\nmy favorite part was Hugh. It's a movie that my little brother who\ndoesn't like the X-Men movies loved this one. It's definitely a movie I\nwould recommend to anyone wither or not you've seen the other X-Men\nmovies or wither or not you are a fan of the other movies or not.\n"
"\nThis is just, simply bullshit! Can't be worse.<br><br>You will never want to see it.<br><br>It's just Logan sleeps with a hot Asian chick.<br><br>F*ck this yellow fever. Nothing more.<br><br>F Off, stupid movie.<br><br>There is no worse movie than it.<br><br>I don't like it.<br><br>I hope i can rate 0 star stupid silly movie stupid director.<br><br>How canthey ruin the Xmen series like this?? I need an answer! I REALLY\nNEED AN ANSWER WHY THEY RUIN XMEN LIKE THIS?\n"
"\nAl in all i thought this was very poor quality. <br><br>The acting all round was pretty bad (I like Hugo but he has made much\nbetter performances). The characters seemed ridiculous too, with the\nrobotic samurai, Mrs I dress up all in green, don't ever say much and\nbring nothing to the film, the ninjas too (I study and practice\nNinjutsu, and these guys did not operate at all the way the did in\nMedieval Japan), and that Japanese actress with her \"Logan\" exclamation\nat the end of the film while he is being attacked....haven't seen\nanything so cheesy in a long time!<br><br>Overall this film was BORING and UNVENTFUL for me, and I don't\nrecommend it to anyone, apart real Wolverine fans who like the story.\nFilm-lovers - don't go there!<br><br>I don't actually know the entire history/story behind Wolverine's\ncharacter, but if the producers accurately followed it, then thumbs up,\nbut why make it such a cheesy and poor act?\n"
"\nHigh expectations after reading some of the reviews, made this movie\nrather disappointing. And a bit dull. In every scene with Hishida (I am\nnot even sure of the name, and I just saw the movie) he looked so\nplastic and CGI that it was very distracting) And don't even get me\nstarted on the strange ending with the robot suit fight. There was a\nfew cool scenes though. The heart one was good and I really liked the\nred headed side-kick. And the best was the throw-back to the\nbone-claws. That was actually pretty cool. On another note - when he\nwas captured by all those ropes and arrows - Why did he not use his\nclaws? My friends and I just looked at each other and mouthed the same\nthing. \"Use your claws, stupid\"<br><br>OK so this is turning out sounding like a pretty bad movie. It is not\nexactly bad however the story itself was rather weak and more as a\nspringboard to awesome action-sequences. And let's be honest, who goes\nto a Wolverine movie expecting lots of deep storytelling, no we go\nthere for the action. I had just hoped that those where not mutually\nexclusive in this case.\n"
"\nI would have loved to write a detailed and analytical review of this\ntitle but it is not worthy of my effort so i'll just explain how it is\nthe worst movie I have ever viewed in cinema, here it goes.<br><br>1.DREADFUL DIALOGUE, WOLVERINE IS LIKE \"ERR YH YH...SHUT UP I'VE HAD\nENOUGH\" 2. STUPID as F*** \"Villain\" dumbass snake-woman shoots out\nvenom, pthoop. 3. incoherent storyline, CHEEESY AS F*** 4. illogical\naction sequences ninjas mircously appear out of no where and start\nfighting. 5. WOLVERINE IS NOT A BADASS HE IS A BIG PU**Y IN THIS MOVIE\nHALF THE TIME HE GETS OWNED AND DOESN'T HEAL BECAUSE THAT DUMB VIPER\nWOMEN OWNED HIM\n"
"\nThis movie is the worst movie of X-men Series. There is not much of a\nstory in this film, in it there is a superhero(Wolverine) who saved a\nsoldier in a war and then that soldier in return wants to thank him on\nthe spot but as the time pass he grew jealous and want to have the\npower of his savior. Wolverine having bad dreams from it's past, in it\nthere is no explanation how that piece of technology is extracting the\npowers of wolverine, while those powers are his mutation which he is\nborn with, it is a mutation of gene and now that evil grandfather has\naltered his gene by drilling holes into his (adamantium) bones..... In\nthis movie there is no good story a superhero succumb to his need of\nbeing loved and follow Mariko the granddaughter of the man he saved the\nlife of and he(grandfather) wants to gift mortality to Wolverine and\nwant to be immortal. In all this is not the movie I was waiting for.\nTotal DISAPPOINTMENT......\n"
"\nI am certainly not an expert on X-Men and the Wolverine. I only wished\nI had read some reviews before I went to see this. I like Hugh Jackman,\nbut the plot and the pace of this film were too boring. It starts out\ninteresting enough but it is downhill from there. 75% of the film IMHO\nis violent. The fight scenes could have been shortened for at least 30\nminutes. The film is 126 minutes long. I could have tolerated it better\nif it was 96 minutes long. I left it feeling I had wasted my time, and\nI would definitely not recommend it to my friends. I am not a fan of\nviolence coupled with a non-engaging plot. I found myself wanting it to\nbe over long before it was. The action scene fight on the Bullet train\nmade me think of Skyfall the James Bond movie which had a train scene\nfight as well. That movie was so much better than this. The PG-13\nrating should be more of an R because of so much violence and adult\ntopics. It's best for the over 17 audience, not the early teens.\n"
"\nThe movie is a step backward from the 2009 Fox Movie X-men Origins\nWolverine. With a weak story, poor adaptions of characters from the\ncomic books and other flaws, this is a waste of 11 dollars. It paled in\ncomparison to other summer blockbusters like Man of Steel. This Movie\nshould have never been greenlit for production and was not worth it.\nThe movie centers around Wolverines adventures in Japan and about a man\nwho he saved from Nagasaki, I had no idea what was going on until a\ngood 40 minutes into the lackluster film. Overall, with the poor cgi,\nspecial effects and lacking story, (story 4/10), this was not worth my\ntime or my money and I advise you not to go see it. I will not go see\nX-Men Days of the Future PAst if this is the best FOX can do.\n"
"\nWhatwas that friends? Was there a scenario in this film? any 15 year\nold teenager can write this script. And i should say i even can direct\nbetter when i have this cast. Hugh was walking as if he was going to\nfaint when he was climbing up the plane's ladders. Who checked the\nediting of the scenes!<br><br>Girls were very bad in acting. I try to understand the mystery under\ntheir cold looks. <br><br>Even great Hugh Jackman cannot save the movie. I was about to run out\nof the theater any time. Where was the action? Where was those great\nscenes from fragment.!! I will check the fragment again and try to\nunderstand what did i miss? I had great hopes even until last 15\nminutes.. <br><br>What a fiasco..\n"
"\nI want to start off by saying that read my title and trust me look at\norigins as never having been made. The Wolverine is a Xmen movie i can\nfeel good about again because quite frankly ever since X2 and \"maybe\"\nLast Stand (yes i like last stand) all xmen movies were very shall i\nsay slow and boring. Origins was by far worse then First Class but\nFirst Class i still felt was rather slow paced and kinda bland acting\nfor the most part. Now that we have Wolverine i feel like the films can\nget back on track with what made Xmen and X2 so much fun to begin with.<br><br>Of course there are some points in the movie i found somewhat \"cliche\"\nbut still Wolverine is definitely Marvel's answer to the Dark Knight\nwhere its a movie about dark times and superb acting not just blowing\nstuff up.<br><br>So even if your not an Xmen fan you still should look at this movie as\npure summer fun with a brain not dumb summer fun with bad acting and no\nplot\n"
"\nIf you like \"pow\" \"kabam\" \"zap\" \"bam\" and kick + punch with dumb moves\nin between this is the movie for you.<br><br>There's no history, logic or reason for this movie.<br><br>I could not believe my eyes when I saw they accomplished a far worse\nmovie the the 1th (origins). C'mon. If you got any brains left you can\nsee that both movies are even worse than Dare Devil.<br><br>I f. love wolverine and ain't aiming for a perfect movie, but PLEASE\ndon't be so dumb Hollywood. Take your time and hire real writers, who\nlove, indeed, the HQ.<br><br>I strong believe that hiring monkeys and paying w/ bananas would result\nin better movie/script than this; shame on you.<br><br>What's the logic here? If you can not make a decent we just make a\nHUUUUGE DUMP on it?? Is that it? Well done, well done.... can't believe\nthat movie has more than 2 stars on IMDb... for god sake...\n"
"\nHugh Jackman is fine in the role, as always, and some of the action\nsequences are good (though I hated the fight on top of the bullet train\n- it struck me as incredibly stupid), but the story is fairly cliché\nand there's just no flow. The story has Wolverine summoned to Japan to\nsay goodbye to an old acquaintance whose life he saved in WWII (Hal\nYamanouchi). There he gets pulled into a web of intrigue and ninjas.\nRila Fukushima provides able support as a red haired martial artist\nwith superior sword skills. Tao Okamoto is pretty but dull as the love\ninterest. Svetlana Khodchenkova is embarrassingly bad as a prostitute,\ner, doctor who is also not very secretly an evil mutant. She feels way\nout of place. Marvel has done such a good job with their Avengers\nfranchise, and the last X-Men movie was pretty good, but this is a dud.\nA lot of the critics who liked it liked it specifically because it\nseparated this hero from his milieu, and I think that's partly why I\ndidn't like it much at all.\n"
"\nBIG NO... definitely this one is not even close what i expected from\nWolverine. If you read any critics review please don't listen to that.\nIt is seriously waste of time. If i did not read any of the reviews\nabout the movie before watching it i would have give it 5 or 6 out of\n10. But going with big hope and waiting than something will happen it\nis better to go and watch he previous one. Writing down here any more\nit's look like waste of time i don't know why Hollywood is going to\nAsian countries for making any sequels. The best part in this movie is\nwhen the movie ends because after the credits gone there is a big\nsurprise for every X MEN movie lover so if it is possible you can\nforward the whole movie just go in the end. With some loose action\nsequences and little bit twist in the end i does not understand what\npeople see in this movie as we are getting this high rating. So don't\nspend your time and money in this movie. There are so many movies\nalready lined up so a BIG NO to wolverine.\n"
"\nI don't understand how this movie is getting a 7.3 rating. I think a\ncollective 5 would be more suitable. By the first hour I was wondering\nwhen it would be over. The only redeeming character was the little red\nhead Japanese girl. Every body else was unconvincing as heck. Oh yeah\nand the acting sucked.<br><br>I feel sorry for Jackman that he had to endure this script and be\nassociated with this flop. Oh yeah and the grand, the silver\nsamurai......oh what a great disappointment. This seems to be a\nrecurring theme with super hero movies. th first 2 are mind blowing and\nthe third is and abortion.<br><br>This movie was not even memorable. As soon as I walked out of the\ntheater I forgot what it was about.\n"
"\nWolverine is by far my favorite X-men character. So I had high hopes\nfor this movie. I went with some friends and my brother to this movie.\nWe did ask ourselves why the movie wasn't in the biggest salon. After\n40 minutes I knew why it wasn't in the biggest salon. I'm sorry but..\nthis movie is super boring. The story isn't catchy. You don't have\nfeelings for any of the characters they are hollow. After a while when\nI was trying to keep my eyes open the only taught I had was \"Plz end\nthis please end this even if it kills Wolverine\". This was a cheap\nmovie to get some more money out of the Wolverine legend. It's a pity\nbecause I think the movie killed the legend.\n"
"\nI think this Wolverine meets all the expectations of a Hollywood action\npacked movie. Stunning visuals and great fight scenes all throughout,\ncoupled with a gripping story. <br><br>Director James Mangold really managed to bring this comic book\ncharacter and story to life, and Hugh Jackman was absolutely brilliant.<br><br>In this film the Wolverine is verging on becoming mortal (as the\ntrailer suggests, so this is NOT a spoiler) so Jackman is not the usual\ninvincible superhero we're used to seeing. This makes the story really\ninteresting and keeps you constantly on edge. Let's face it, no one\nlikes to see the good guy die! <br><br>Overall this has got to be one the best action movies I've watched this\nyear.\n"
"\nJust a few things I don't like but primary it was entertaining (without\nto tell something about the story here).<br><br>The only thing I didn't liked is, in some action scenes / fights - for\n3D - the camera shakes to much.<br><br>But I like those things what does happen to Wolverine. And yes - don't\nleave to movie theater during the end titles because there comes one\nscene more for a coming movie.<br><br>Its a movie based on a comic, its fantasy... (common, don't ask stupid\nquestions), its entertaining and there a different tastes of course.\nIts just one more story about Wolverine. It was entertaining and lets\nhope for more Wolverine.\n"
"\nAs the title says i thought this was good but not great. I didn't mind\nthe fact the film felt a bit slow in parts, I didn't even mind that\nmost of the action scenes were already shown in the trailers it's just\ni felt there was something missing from this.<br><br>I felt the Viper was a bit weak and the way the ending came about with\nthe Silver Samurai was a bit predictable. I will say i thought Yukio\nwas excellent and Jackman as Wolverine was excellent as well. I\nunderstand why Jean Grey was in his dreams, To show the anguish and\npain Logan goes through but i did think the film could have done\nwithout it.<br><br>I love the whole Samurai thing, The Eastern culture fascinates me but i\ncan't seem to put my finger on what stops this being anything above a\n7/10 for me. It may be that i will enjoy it more on the second watch\nbut there is still no doubt that it is better than Wolverine: Origins\nwhile possibly on a par with the best X-Men film.\n"
"\nI was waiting so long to see this film. The only reason I disagreed\nwith the negative reviewers is because some of them don't have much\nknowledge about the character Wolverine. For example, their confused of\nwhy doesn't he age because they clearly discuss this in the first X-men\nfilm when they find Logan. I'm a huge fan of X-men and I loved X-men\nFirst class. Anyways The Wolverine film that was shown in cinemas\nwasn't that great it was missing some explanations. Then I watched the\nExtended version which had an additional 14 mins and they've added\nblood to the fights. If you know the character Wolverine from the\ncomics then you will fall in love with this movie. The extended version\nwas the best superhero movie I've seen this year. Lastly without\nspoiling anything this version has something special after the credits\nshowing a scene that takes place two years after the film. I give this\nmovie a 10/10 because it is pure badass . Definitely waiting for the\nsequel.\n"
"\nThere's not much negative that can be said about the Wolverine. If I\nHAD to complain about something then I guess a little more action\nwould've been nice. But all in all this movie was nearly perfectly\nexecuted. Hugh Jackman really got in touch with making Logan a real\nperson. Having him deal with the emotional consequences through out the\nmovie instead of him just looking sad for the first 15 minutes was\nreally a great choice. I will say that the plot was very predictable. I\nknew immediately who would wind up being in the Samurai armor. However,\nthe movie was a lot of fun and easily one of Marvel's best. Viper was a\nterrific villain and the actress playing her was great at making her\nmenacing without going over the top. If you haven't seen this movie,\nit's worth the ticket price.\n"
"\nUnlike the previous movies there is no threat to mutants are humans the\nstory is personal and we get to see Logan as more of a person than a\nkilling machine.But I felt something missing I think the screenplay is\na bit dragging since we got used to fast paced story telling of\navengers and man of steel.<br><br>The scene after the credits that heralds Days of future past was a\npleasant surprise. I didn't expect at all they will cut off wolverine's\nclaws in the movie I hope they somehow give it back in the next movie.\nUnlike Xmen origins there is no one in this film to complement\nwolverine like sabertooth.\n"
"\nIf you read the critics you would think that this Wolverine movie was\nbetter than the last; well they're wrong. I had high hopes after\nreading mostly positive reviews but after actually watching the movie I\nhave to say that it was ridiculously boring. I am so tired of superhero\nmovies that go from one fight scene to the next without any\nexplanation, character or plot development. This movie suffered greatly\nfrom overkill with fighting. Also this movie suffers from confusing\nfemale characters. Mariko who we are suppose to like comes off as\nannoying. The Viper comes off as creepy. The only good female character\nis Yukio who steals the movie from wolverine every time they appear\ntogether. The plot was thin and any ending surprises projected\nthemselves almost from the beginning of the movie. Poor Hugh Jackman,\npoor wolverine.\n"
"\nThe Wolverine is a great film! the people who think that Origins was\nbetter have no idea what the whole x-men universe is .This films\ndelivers what wolverine fans always wanted to see the japan saga. Sure\n..it can't stay true 100% to the comic but you have to adapt the story\nchange it so that it can make sense. People don't get that comics are\ndifferent from movies. For me The Wolverine had great story, great\ncharacters, great action ...it's different from the other x-men movies\nand that is why i enjoyed it so much it's fresh we get to see the\ncharacter of Wolverine vulnerable and at it's lowest point.Hugh Jackman\ndid a wonderful job !thank you Hugh! people can say bad things about\nthe movie ..but the true fans will appreciate it!\n"
"\nThis film was awesome and blows \"X-men Origins Wolverine\" out of the\nwater, everything about this film was amazing, I loved the fight scenes\nthe one on the Bullet train was brilliant, so was the one at Yashida's\nfuneral.<br><br>One of the things that made this film so good for me was how for the\nmost part of the film Wolverine/Logan (Hugh Jackman) doesn't have his\npower of regeneration so he's just a mortal with awesome claws.<br><br>One thing I wasn't keen on with this film was Jean Grey (Famke\nJanssen)presence in this film I thought she was stupidly pointless and\nif anything brought unnecessary complexity to the plot.<br><br>I loved the end credit scene this just wrapped it up as Logan was\nleaving with Yukio(Rila Fukushima) on a plane and then he's in an\nairport in the end credit scene. The end credit scene has left me\nfeeling really excited for \"Day's of Future past\" and I cant wait for\nthe 23rd of May 2014 to see that.<br><br>10/10 Thanks for reading :)\n"
"\nBy interval I was actually contemplating walking out of the theatre. It\nwas so boring. You just cant relate to the total unnecessary love angle\nintroduced in the movie and as soon as the girl make appearance, movie\nstandard just plummets. Story becomes too slow for a wolverine movie.\nAwful script writing. Why they brought this stupid love angle in the\nmovie is totally beyond me. The girl initially acts so stubborn for\nreasons best known only to her and then suddenly makes a total u turn\nand decides to fall for Wolverine.<br><br>In my honest opinion, its not what you are expecting. <br><br>Please save you money !!!!\n"
