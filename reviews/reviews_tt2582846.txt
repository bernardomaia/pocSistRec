"\nI went into this movie not having read the book and not knowing\nanything more than the overall plot. I am a sucker for a good love\nstory, especially love that I can relate to. The pain and emotions felt\nby the characters felt so real, as if I was feeling the same emotions.<br><br>Though this was THE SADDEST movie I have ever seen, it was also one of\nthe most beautiful, as it truly showed how exhilarating and comforting\nand exciting love is. <br><br>I probably cried throughout about half of the movie, along with the\nrest of the audience. I cried to the point of heaving out loud and\nneeding more than the 2 tissues I came in with. Again, the actors\nreally expressed the emotions of the characters well and I felt that. <br><br>I am going to see it again for sure.<br><br>GO SEE IT IF YOU LOVE EMOTIONAL MOVIES!\n"
"\nWow. Being an avid book reader, I'm always skeptical about watching the\nwords of my favorite books transformed and materialized on the big\nscreen... but TFIOS stayed true to the book. The movie was absolutely\nlovely from beginning to end. The young actors were great. The comedy\nhit on all the right notes, the romance made your heart smile and the\ntragedy pulled at your heart strings. It really was a wonderful\nadaptation, and I believe it stayed as true to the book as possible\nwithout many changes where there were any. The minute it was over, I\nwanted to watch it again. Upon leaving the theater, I looked around and\nthere was not one dry eye. Not even the men. If you are a big fan of\nthe book, like myself... and are skeptical about whether this stays\ntrue. Don't be. Kudos the John Green on his first film adaptation. It\nwas an absolute success. I'd give it a 10 out of 10 if I could... but I\ndon't believe in \"perfect.\"\n"
"\nI was touched by the concepts and situations on this film, being myself\na survivor of 48 chemotherapy treatments, I can somehow understand the\nfeelings.<br><br>Is not a pretentious film, however full of little moments that creates\na very good and convincing environment.<br><br>I like both main rolls. The story is completely credible, it can happen\nany time to anyone.<br><br>It is an Ode for Life, it tell us that \"We can and should have moments\nof infinite joy within a limited time\" It is our choice!<br><br>I liked very much this film!\n"
"\nI don't really cry in movies unless they're really, really sad. And\nthis movie is bound to get you crying like there's no tomorrow. I\nbrought a box of tissues and I used about half of them. I have never\ncried so much in my entire life. Being an avid fan of the book, I was\nkind of scared that like some of my other favourite books, the movie\nwould be ruined. But no, the movie had all of the book's materials in\nit (except for one thing). I never thought Shailene and Ansel would\nplay Hazel and Gus, but when I watched it, their performance blew me\naway. I think Shailene's ability to cry got ME crying, because that's\nhow real it felt. It is an amazing movie, and I'm sorry to say that\nit's even better than A Walk to Remember. Go see this movie, and if you\ndo, maybe read the book first so that you can be somewhat prepared!\n"
"\n'Some infinities are bigger than other infinities' says my favorite\nquote from the movie (and the book) and its true because I am going to\nlove this movie for the longest of the infinity. I am a huge fan of the\nbook and one thing which really makes the movie stand out is an amazing\nperformance by Shailene Woodley. She is outstanding in every scene she\nis and I have to say I am kind of in love with Hazel. Even though its a\nlove story of a girl who has terminal cancer I wouldn't say that the\nfilm is tragic rather the film is about living your life to the fullest\nin your 'little infinity' If you have already read the book, the film\nis true to the book and the great acting, directing and music adds\nanother dimension to the story. The Fault In Our Stars is definitely\none of the best romantic movies ever. When you see this movie you are\ngoing to laugh and you are going to cry and when the end credit roles I\ncan guarantee most of you are going to be completely in love with this\nlove story.\n"
"\nI cannot believe that this tripe has 8.5. I was unfortunate enough to\nto see it!!<br><br>The acting is terrible, probably the worst I've ever seen.The film is\nsilly and frankly ridiculous.<br><br>The worst thing in the entire movie was in the scene inside the Anne\nFranks home when they kissed for the first time after a long, tough\nclimb for who never seemed to end. Not only was it really predictable\nthat they would kiss but...oh my god... then the tourists started to\nclap...why? Because they kissed inside Anne Franks home? They didn't\nknow that they had cancer... Don't get me wrong..I wanted to leave the\ncinema after ten minutes so unfortunately it's not the only scene that\nis bad. <br><br>If this doesn't get you to skip this film I don't know what will...\n"
"\nShailene Woodley and Ansel Elgort both have arrows strongly pointing\nupwards. Both shine brightly in this movie and suck you in from the\nget- go. Following up their (sibling) pairing in Divergent, they both\nflash a wide range of chops here. Woodley is charming and smart, and\nElgort majorly surprised me showing off a comical side. Also very\nsmart.<br><br>I won't spoil anything, but I did not read the book so I had no/low\nexpectations and was sucked in early on, and definitely was attached to\nthe characters throughout. It's a great story and it tugs on your\nheart. Loved it.\n"
"\nThis film is horribly cheesy. Hollywood does cancer very very badly.\nThe male lead could not act and therefore I was not convinced and\ntherefore I did not cry. I cry at everything usually but this film is\nnot convincing at all. It was definitely the male lead that spoilt it\nfor me. I just didn't understand his naked obsession with the female\nlead. From the minute he sets eyes on her, wham he is in love! I found\nthat very strange, or maybe it was just the way he did it. I know love\nat first sight happens but this seemed way over the top. If you watch\nLove Story from the 60's which features cancer, it has an authentic\nlove story and build up but this film does not seem to be that genuine\nso you don't really care about the characters. To be frank, the whole\nthing reeks of cheese. Stay away.\n"
"\nWithout me blabbering on, I would like to give my complements to John\nGreen and his Team. The Fault In Our Stars is a fantastic book which\nhas a really sad ending (I'm not going to say it to you). As the quote\nsays \"Some Infinities are bigger than others\" however, Hazel and Gus's\nlove was quite an extraordinary one. It must of been hard living with\nCancer. The book was different, but it still had the same story to the\nfilm but with more parts. I got the book after the film came out so my\nbook has the photos in it. I have to say I did cry at the end but I\ncouldn't stop blabbering through the film. Too be honest, Hazel Grace\nhas inspired me. Not everything in life is perfect and people are\ndying, this book showed the good and bad sides to cancer. <br><br>Like the book says, pain demands to be felt. It touched my sad side.\nThis book is one of the best. Thank you.\n"
"\nOK, so typical sappy romantic BS, but this time they have cancer? Oh\ngive me a break. Yeah, thank god they're wealthy, attractive white\npeople so they could have their little romantic adventure. My cousin\ngot lymphoma at age 16 and could barely eat because of medical bills,\nhis parents are so deep in debt they had to sell their house as no\ninsurance would cover him. But the \"tragedy\" here is that pretentious\nd-bag Gus (and his cringe worthy pseudo intellectual metaphor) died\n*after* traveling to Europe and banging a hot girl. Oh the humanity!\nThis is a love story written for the 1%, where the biggest tragedy in\nlife is that spoiled little daddy's money babies Gus and Hazel couldn't\nlive to 90 off their parent's dime, probably in some Malibu beach\nhouse.<br><br>If you're a rich white person with no concept of real life, you will\nenjoy this. Otherwise steer clear of this formulaic love story tripe.\n"
"\nWhy does this film have such a high rating? I've been tricked so many\ntimes this year by high-ratings and rave reviews to films which have\nturned out to me absolutely atrocious that I'm losing my faith in film\ncritics and the cinema-going public alike.<br><br>I was promised this film would be a tearjerker, but the only thing that\njerked was my gag reflex. I have never met a more obnoxious and\nirritating character as Augustus Waters and the whole script was\npainfully cheesy for about 80% of the film.<br><br>I strongly recommend you do not see this movie.<br><br>Ever.<br><br>Even if you are paid to watch it.\n"
"\nWhy anyone would care to see this 'play on emotion' junk movie, I have\nno idea. Full of obvious heart-string pulling scenes fit for 12 year\nold girls. I wouldn't suggest this garbage be watched by anyone(unless\nyou are that 8-12 year old girl that find badly written scripts\n'good'). You get more content from a Maury 'who's my baby daddy'\nepisode. If you find yourself with nothing to do, avoid this movie!\nEven as a last resort! It would leave you empty inside from the hollow\nacting, all the way to the bad script and plot scenes. Should you have\na daughter that wishes to see this, prevent that from happening at all\ncosts. This will only succeed in diminishing their intellect and giving\nthem a false sense of reality with life and relationships.\n"
"\nThe Fault in Our Stars was good. It was funny and certainly heart\ngripping. I thought Shailene Woodley and Ansel Elgort did a great job.\nOverall the story itself was magnificent, albeit there were several\nfaults in the film itself.<br><br>The editing was awkward at times and there were noticeable\ncontradictory mistakes that I will not dwell on other than to say\n(without spoiling anything) that there is a teleporting basketball\ntrophy... See if you can spot it!! I also felt that the framing was too\nnarrow at times and some of the two frame shots were unnecessary and\ndistracting. My last and largest problem was that there is a huge\ndifference in what works in a book and what works on film. Some scenes\ncan feel odd  and that is because they are out of place. In addition,\nthe themes could have been much stronger and left us in really\nthinking. Sadly the film did not quite make it.<br><br>I may be focusing too much on the negatives. I did rather enjoy the\nfilm and thought the book was fantastic. I would recommend it to anyone\ncontemplating. Enjoy!\n"
"\nFor starters, the only line of dialogue that came out of people's\nmouths were \"Okay\". Seriously if I had a dollar for every time they\nsaid \"Okay\", I would be a damn rich man. The whole idea of the story\nmade me laugh, honestly. Not only was the acting horrid, the music was\nvery boring, and the writing was noting short of a magnum opus.\nAbsolutely freaking horrible. There were a couple scene's where I\nactually burst into laughter because it was just that stupid. The only\npeople who awed and cried over the film, were a bunch of 13-16 year old\nteenage \"tumblr\" girls, who nobody can stand by the way, and they were\ncrying and screaming the entire screening. My friend says he'd wish to\njust kick them out of the theater himself. In the end, everyone was\nannoyed, and I will do the best I can to lower the rating of the film\nso that everyone could see that this is the worst movie ever made.<br><br>Want quality cinema? The Godfather.\n"
"\nThe Fault in Our Stars is my personal favorite movie of the Romantic\ngenre. This movie shows the meaning of love and life. With some twists\nand turns, it also shows the beauty and the bitterness of life. After\nwatching this movie, you will learn to love and live fully or at least\nremember your first love. <br><br>I didn't feel like I loved the movie or the book better. Both are\nextraordinarily great. And the movie keeps the heart of all the lovers\nof the novel: The Fault in Our Stars.<br><br>I wouldn't feel shy at all telling that the movie made me a cry-baby\nfor 126 minutes (Oh no! My eyes were just wet). It unfolded so many\nemotions and feelings. It seriously touched my heart. <br><br>Overall, it is a must-watch movie.\n"
"\nObviously, Mr. denizmoraligil, you had not to deal by proxy with no one\nsuffering of the \"much the same in the movie\". Because if you had,\nnothing but \"that much the same\" would be important in your life.<br><br>You have 24/7, with luck/ 364 days to think \"much in the same\". There\nis no future to plan, there is no happiness to program and pursue,\nthere is not even joy in watching a sunset, or in listening a symphony.<br><br>And if you are lucky enough in finding love and have the valour to let\nyourself immerse in the feeling, it will never be without remembering\nthat \"to get a Rainbow you'll had to do with the rain\".<br><br>So, Mr. denizmoraligil, may God forbid that you experience that \"much\nof the same\", but also may God grant you a bit of charity and\nunderstanding to be able to discover the hidden beauty that some people\nhave the heart to let out and accept even in the dreadful monotony of\nevery one of their days, hours and seconds.<br><br>To me, this movie is a \"master piece\" that shades feelings, worthy of\n10*.\n"
"\nOK so here's the thing. I was so not going to bother writing a review\nfor this movie. Yes I loved it however there were things in the book I\nthink should have been in the movie. That's why I give it a 9 not a 10!\nNow the reason I'm writing this review, this movie is sad. It promises\nto be sad just by the decription and the trailer. Looking at the cover\ntells you that it's going to be romantic. If you do not like these\ntypes of movies or you are a heartless bonehead like the guy that gave\nthis heartfelt movie a 1 and wishes he could have given a 0, do not\nwatch this movie. My fiancé put it right, this movie (and book) is The\nNotebook on steroids! You will cry.You will get mad at the crying\nbecause it won't stop. And above all you will watch it again and again\nthinking each time you'll make it without a single tear. That will not\nhappen but you'll try anyway. Hazel Grace and Augustus Waters will\nsteal your heart and the end is the hardest part. Yes someone dies but\nwho I won't spoil that. Its not who you think btw.\n"
"\nWatched The Fault In Our Stars Featuring Shaliene Woodley(The\nSpectacular Now) as Hazel Grace Lancaster ,Ansel Egort(Carrie) as\nAugustus Waters, Nat Wolff(Stuck In Love) as Issac also Starring Laura\nDern(Jurassic Park) as Fran Lancaster,Sam Trammell(True Blood) as\nMichael Lancaster , Lotte Verbeek(The Borgias) as Lidewij Vliegenthart\n,Mike Birbigila(Girls) as Patrick and Willem Dafoe(The Grand Budapest\nHotel) as Peter Van Houten.

"\nThis movie will remind you about how special is your life is and helps\nyou embrace your life with good deeds. Its a one time must watch movie.\nGo watch it and find out how lucky everyone is in this world. This\nmovie can make you sad for character's but if you think deeply u will\nfind out that its true happiness of life that those characters feel in\nthe Amsterdam trip. Whether you got this happiness for small time or\nfor whole life ,it doesn't matter its just that you should feel like\nthat once in our life. The end was also good I like it when author Van\nHouten comes to meet Hazel and give her that letter its awesome. So\nsummary watch the movie and fall in love with your life,this two hours\nof movie is worth of your time.\n"
"\nAll I can say it was a wonderful story plus a box of Kleenex and it was\nworth it.<br><br>I think the actor and actress and wonder as I watched this how they\nwere able to get through this story? One has to give them 10 stars for\nthe acting alone. I do think it should be watched by one and all.<br><br>I will tell my friends of this movie and myself and many friends are\nsurvivors. I am so glad I rented this movie. I hope to read the book in\nthe future, if I can find it.<br><br>Some times I think we need more of this kind of movie, a REAL story,\nthere are so many violent stories on the screen these days.<br><br>god Bless the cast and all that worked on this movie.\n"

"\nThis movie ??? This movie is a masterpiece, I don't have any words\nregarding this movie this movie is a massage for those who don't\nunderstand the meaning of love. Scene to scene this movie just manages\nto suck me into this beautiful world of Hazel Grace Lancaster and\nAugustus Waters. The pain and emotions felt by the characters felt so\nreal as if I was feeling the same emotions. It was also one of the most\nbeautiful, as it truly showed how exhilarating, comforting and exciting\nlove is. I probably cried throughout about half of the movie. Please at\nleast sit with a packet of tissue's while watching this movie .\nHonestly, this is the best movie I have seen all year.\n"
"\nI went into this movie expecting a stupid teenager-drama. I haven't\nread the book and I'm not really a love story type of guy. And although\nmany people may see it as just that, a stupid teenage love story, I was\nvery positively surprised. It was actually cute and funny, and I really\nenjoyed it. It might still have a few klischeè teenage movie things,\nand it might try to be all inspirational, but It felt real and\nheartfelt. I was also positively surprised by the performances, which\nwere nicely and lovingly done. It was sad but at the same time gave you\na warm, chummy feeling. So if you like a good love story that has a\nlittle humour to it, but manages to crush you a little as well, I\nhighly recommend this movie.\n"
"\nI've been trying to figure out why this movie is so highly rated, and\nNot sure why or how anyone could sit through this nonsense. All around\nhorrible acting, and predictable storyline from start to finish . I was\ntricked into seeing this, and by far, the worst movie I've seen since\n2004. Highlights all the narcissism and self entitlement problems\nfemales today bring to the world. Princess syndrome at it's worst. Two\nsick people and a family, and one individual spends the entire time\nonly thinking of herself and what she wants, how these other person can\nimprove her pitiful life while she does nothing to contribute back.\nThinking they need her and won't be able to cope or survive without\nher, come on. Just Terrible, avoid this and movies like that, stop\nmaking this unequal nonsense...stop supporting it, but then again, I\nguess some people really aren't as committed to equality as they claim.\n"
"\nHazel... Hazel... Hazel...<br><br>Like the character, the courage to accept the truth that one has to\nlive with what they have.. accepting this fact is difficult.. living\nwith it and that too living happily...oh Parameshwar !!.. unbelievable\nthought!!!<br><br>Another best scene was talking about your funeral, planning and\ndiscussing it with your only loved ones...like it.Its a very good movie\nnot only for the people who know the value of LOVE, but especially for\nthe Humans who want to be loved but do not have an idea about the want\nthey have ??\n"
"\nBack when the film came out my girlfriend pretty much said I had to go\nsee this with her after her having read the book. I however had no idea\nwhatsoever what it was about or anything.<br><br>I absolutely loved it. I'm a pretty emotional person and this hit me\nhard. I was sobbing away along with everyone else in the cinema.. It\nreally isn't a film I would normally go see but i'm glad i did because\nit was very touching. What a beautiful film, even from a male's point\nof view. It really was one of my favourite films ofthe year, one of my\nall time favourites actually. I actually bought it when it came out on\nDVD to watch again at some point. <br><br>Brilliant.\n"
"\nThis film is a love story about two teenagers with cancer, however the\nfilm may be about cancer there is so much more than just cancer. It's\nabout two teenagers who who meet each other though a support group and\nexcept that they have to deal with their illnesses. This film is filled\nwith all sorts of emotions from happiness, and laughter to anger and\nsadness. It has amazing actors and actresses in the film and you feel\nlike you actually connect with the characters and feel their emotions.\nIt is an amazingly powerful story that's full of surprises. It's not\nyour every day love story, it's a story that will stay with you forever\nand leave your mind wondering after the film has finished. However I\nwould really recommend reading the film first, firstly it may help you\nto understand the film and secondly the book contains more of the story\nand more characters. Overall it is an amazing film and book that is\ndefinitely worth a watch.\n"
"\nBefore I saw this movie, I had a feeling the guy Gus dies in the end. I\ndidn't know how he died but I just knew well that this film won't have\na happy ending.<br><br>I thought Gus and Hazel were so cute together like they couldn't get\ntheir hands off each other! It's so sad how cancer just kills you\nsilently and loses a loved one that you have been with for so long. I\nwas gutted that Gus passed away and I was thinking at the end of the\nfilm that Hazel could've died too when she was looking at the stars\nlying on a field. <br><br>This movie is really good but if you have a softie personality, then I\nsuggest you get ten tissue boxes lol!\n"
"\nI always find IMDb reviews to be a very useful indicator of whether I\nwill enjoy a movie. I checked the review here only after the movie got\nto the slow clapping and when I found the rating was 8.1, I actually\njoined the site to help lower the rating into perspective.<br><br>This movie is very very predictable, boring, slow and in places cringe\nworthy.<br><br>And to crown it ... she leaves a pack of cigarettes on his coffin ?? I\nget that its supposed to be a metaphor but .... seriously ??<br><br>So bad .....<br><br>And the predictable irony, she is dying but he dies<br><br>*sigh<br><br>Another sad case of the emperors new clothes.\n"
"\nFinally someone realize and i am agree with you ( o_oraculo ) its the\nugliest movie adopt from bad bad book i wonder do the reader and movie\nlover understand how to pick a good movie and a book.<br><br>They try to make a sad ugliest story and to fool lots of movie lover..\nthe story line is so boring, mentioned she red the same book like an\nidiot.. <br><br>How they can generously giving a high score to a junkies movie like\nthis, i would never ever recommend IMDb again for a movie review.<br><br>Very Very Ugliest movie ever.... Do not watch the movie or you will be\nregretting.. no refund lol\n"
"\nWe forget about people struck with illness, and this film came along to\nremind us about people who are in the midst of it all. I liked this\nfilm. Acting is truly excellent, you can feel the chemistry between two\nprincipal actors. Plot is interesting, although I am not sure is it\nrealistic, with going to Amsterdam and all, but you have to make\ninteresting film like this for the wider audiences. Otherwise, it would\nnot probably be interesting for them.<br><br>I also liked the music.<br><br>If you have a sick member in your family this is a film for you,\notherwise you could watch it for fun, you might like it like I did.\n"
"\nWhen I was begin to watch this movie I think this is not good movie.But\nafter i saw this is excellent movie.It is so realistic movie about\ncancer patients.Then I saw this movie written about book.I watched this\nfilm over and over.Its so romantic film together drama film.Its\naffecting you for some days.But the end of this movie isn't bad end.I\ncan say its happy end to.Hazel will not die virgin,Augustus too.and I\ndidn't understand IMDb's 10 line review thing.Im not living in country\nwhich language is English.So my English is awful.If anybody try to\nspeak this thing I know you are feeling this.There are 1 more line away\n.And its over bye bye\n"
"\nAdaptation of the bestselling book of the same name about a terminally\nill 17-year-old who falls in love with a cancer survivor that she meets\nat a support group. All cast is very likable, with admiral performances\nby leads Woodley and Elgort, and an exceptional supporting appearance\nby Dafoe. A real plus for not spoonfeeding the audience; but for a\nstory that insists on being honestly sad, it certainly lines itself up\nfor convenient tragedy with a turn-of-events that is quite predictable\nto the more observant viewer. Title comes from Shakespeare's Julius\nCAESAR.<br><br>*** (out of four)\n"
"\nI watched a movie called The Fault In Our Stars. I hope it won an Oscar\nand any other award it could. It addresses and embraces terminal\nillness and death with ... beauty is the word that comes to mind. You\nwill cry. You will laugh.You will rage. And it will all be very real\nHow do I know? I'm terminally ill. I am have sever COPD (yes, like\nLeonard Nimoy) and I could die literally at any moment. This film is a\ntrue representation of what dying is like; of the sorrow and terror and\nsilliness. I LOVE this movie! Every single person in the world should\nwatch this movie. This movie is the absolute best of the film\nmakers/story tellers art. I would have given it twenty stars, but they\nonly give you ten slots.\n"
"\nBy far the saddest movie I've ever seen, never cried so much in my\nlife. It's by far the most beautiful and heartbreaking movie you will\never watch. If this movie doesn't move you then there's something wrong\nwith you! A love story that will last the ages. You will instantly fall\nin love with hazel grace and Augustus waters as they bring you into\ntheir world and teach you how to love and cope with loss. The\nperformances by both main characters were spot on and the chemistry was\nindeed touching. I cried from the beginning the end and this truly was\nthe saddest ending I've ever seen in a movie. It has a brilliant\nsoundtrack to add to it. All in all this is a movie that will make you\ngo through all the motions from laughing to crying. The best movie I\nhave seen!\n"
"\nMovie is simple, sweet, fluent yet a remarkable one. You can afford\nmissing this one.<br><br>The movie starts in a typical fashioned love story. No points for that.\nBut as the movie continues, the plot actually makes you feel its\nweight. A lot of appreciable work is done on that part. Though I didn't\nunderstand the Genie part (where and how did that come from), but it\nwas nice watching that.<br><br>Love stories are meant to be exclusive, and this movie clearly explains\nyou that. Nice job everyone there.<br><br>Okay? ;)\n"
"\nThere are always some small things that ruin my opinion of a film which\ncould have been perfect and would get a ten from me. This movie is\nreally great - has a great story, the acting is very well done and\nbelievable (something I always search for in a movie, even if it is a\nsci-fi), the scenes of Amsterdam are beautiful... but... although in a\nfilm he has one leg, it was kinda obvious in most of the scenes that\nhis legs are just fine ... also, the scene in a car after the funeral\nis a bit unrealistic to me and the way she treats the writer ... of all\nplaces in Amsterdam - Anna Frank house and kiss with an applause ???!!!\nA bit cheesy ... but all in all, has some really great lines which do\nstick in your thoughts.<br><br>Certainly, do watch it!\n"
"\nFirst of all, I would like to say I was completely torn by this movie\nfrom the perspective of this young boy who is desperate but so singular\nand unique, and this beautiful young girl, also somewhat desperate, who\nthinks her insecurities and cancer make up the reason she had no\nfriends. The movie completely did its job overall, and split me in two\nwhen one was pulled away from the other in agony. I would've and didn't\nexpect anything less than what I got, a beautiful, meaningful, very-\nbelievable movie with one of my favorite actresses and actors. If you\nare sitting at home reading this, there is no reason you shouldn't\nwatch this movie. It changed my outlook on love stories forever.<br><br>Amazing book and movie, and I think the actresses and actors used to\nportray the character couldn't have been better picked. Absolutely\nstunning lines to rip your heart out, and an amazing story.<br><br>This movie was amazing and awful and happy and terrible in the perfect\nways. 9 1/2 out of 10. Great job, and I can honestly say I have never\nseen anything like it.\n"
"\nokay, so before i saw this movie i read the book, and I LOVED it , the\nmovie was a bit different and some characters weren't in the movie, but\nit was good, no i mean it was great. It's one of the best movies i've\neven watched, it made laugh and cry, it just simply made me happy. And\nit's really amazing. I've given almost half the movies i've watched\n10/10, but this is the one that truly deserves it. And if i could give\nthis movie a 100 i would, i got so obsessed over it. If you want to\nwatch a romantic movie that'll just make you smile and cry, i really\nsuggest this. It's not like all the cancer love stories or whatever.\nIt's just kind of different, people might say that i'm over rating it,\nbut i sure am not. Everybody has a different taste in movies. But if\nyou like romance, you'll love this movie, i hope.\n"
"\nI watched this movie today. I already knew the story from the book\nwritten by John Green 'The Fault In Our Stars' that i have already read\nbefore. As i expected the movie would be, it was worth my expectations.\nThough some facts are skipped in the movie, the movie is incredibly\nawesome and the part played by the Shailene Woodley as the Hazel Grace\nis perfect including her voice. It reminds me the quotes in the book.\nIndeed, John Green's writing is adorable that contain much of\ninteresting and funny quotes. I was much eager to watch it, and now i\nam curious to read its story again and to remember its quotes. As i\nfinished watching it, i jumped into IMDb to write a review about it. I\nrecommend this movie.\n"
"\nI can say that this movie is beautiful. I read the book and it took me\na few hours. I just couldn't stop because of the story. Maybe someone\nwill say that the plot is too predictable, but I will answer them that\nmost of the movies are. And who said that it is bad? If you can predict\nthe end it means that you were listening and watching every detail. <br><br>Actors were playing amazing. I believed every moment, every step.\nActually I am that kind of person who doesn't cry. Especially when\nsomeone is next to me. But this time... I couldn't hold myself anymore.\nFor a moment my eyes turned into a waterfall. The way Hazel and\nAugustus found a way and a REASON to be happy... No matter how bad\ntheir situation was. <br><br>I really don't understand why some people don't like it. Tastws differ\nbut I think that even if someone is saying THIS IS A CRAP, in their\nheart they WERE crying. <br><br>I give this movie 9 from 10.\n"
"\nThis is better than A Walk to Remember, not that they should even be\ncompared. I was opposed to the concept of the novel, and waited until\nlong after my friends raved about it to read it. Then I did. I absorbed\nit in one night. I say absorbed because this story is not one that\nempties you, takes your tears and leaves you devoid of emotion. This\nstory fills empty places that you didn't know you had. It reaffirms\nthat life is precious and shot. Love is pure, timeless, knows no\nboundaries. All of the complications we make our lives have are not\nnecessary-- we should all look at the world like Augustus Waters, size\nwhat we want, and love it with everything we have.\n"
"\nI am completely out the demographic of this movie but I ended up\nwatching this.<br><br>This is obviously a tearjerker meant for primarily teenage girls, so\nadjust accordingly.<br><br>But I will say this movie has a really good heart and solid message.\nIt's refreshing to see a female teen character who attracts a guy\nthrough her smarts and wits. It's also refreshing seeing a male\ncharacter who isn't all horned up and actually believes in courtship\nand respect. <br><br>A special shout out to Shailene_Woodley, who has an amazing and\nconvincing performance. <br><br>If you are parent of teenagers, I this would be a mostly positive movie\nfor kids to watch. There is just old-fashion courting that you never\nsee in teen sex comedies. It almost has a religious feel and overtones\nbut avoids that path. This will certainly be a 'classic' movie in a\nyoung adult genre.\n"
"\nSuch a boring movie. Terrible casting, terrible acting and so many\nthings that do not fit into reality like underage kids drinking\nchampagne in the park which is not in a paper bag and champagne cork\njust pops open when you pull? Or a suitcase that looks giant and the\ndriver lifts it up like there is nothing in there ! Details are\nimportant to make movie believable. Both main characters did a terrible\njob acting, you can't feel chemistry at all they're just reading lines.\nConstant staring which is creepy and empty and weird not romantic.\nBoring. Would be better if with someone else as main characters and\nbetter job in directing. I understand the girl is sick but a little\nmake up wouldn't kill her or girly clothes. Something that makes it\nwork.\n"
"\nI strongly dislike this movie. The love story physically makes me Ill!\nI wouldn't recommend it to anyone (unless you are a desperate and sappy\nteenager) It is based on an extremely unlikely romance between two\nyoung teenagers who obviously only like each other because they come\nfrom similarly rough backgrounds, and are so desperate to have a\nrelationship that they start seeing the first person they bump into. In\nall fairness, I did find the acting in this moving (particularly from\nhazel) quite good. Her pain when gus dies is quite convincing. But\nunfortunately, good acting in one scene is not enough, and this movie\n(and book) turned out to be a complete waste of time. Please don't put\nyourself through the pain of watching it.\n"
"\nOK...so I saw this movie...what I think about it?..It was awful...like\nthe summary says: \"one of the worst movies I have ever seen\". The story\nit's pretty simple...with basic ideas..she's dying...for like 7 years\nor so..because of course..her parents have money and manage to give her\nall that she needs. From my point of view it has too much drama.Of\ncourse, I spilled some tears but just because it's all about dying in\nthis movie.How can you not cry a little?... The only brilliant thing\nabout this story is that writer who says the things as they are right\nto her face..the first time they meet because, the second time (at the\nfuneral) he just becomes part of her drama, trying to help her and all\nof that. I didn't forget about Gus..the boy (of course there is a boy..\nher boy). They \"where together\" for a couple of months before they\nkissed..and that kiss..just gave her her breath back after she climbed\nall of those stairs..classic.. I could talk all day about this\nmovie...but the idea is that it's to long for the small idea they are\ntrying to show.\n"
"\nThis movie is not what it pretends to be. It's yet another teenage\nromance tied with cancer this time around to make the audience invest\nin it and get depressed and cry their eyes out. Guess what? It does a\nvery bad job of it.<br><br>The story is completely bullshit and makes no sense whatsoever. You\nwill get that point if you are living in an actual world and not in the\nmake believe world of Hollywood. <br><br>The trailers I watched which made me compelled to see this movie are\nway better and interesting than the movie itself! And the run time of\n150 plus minutes is something I don't even want to talk about because I\nhave already wasted enough time of my precious life.<br><br>Trust me there's nothing in this movie which is something you should\nsee. It's boring as hell and utter nonsense.\n"
"\nFor the type of movie this is, it's not half bad. Slow moving at times\nand some the the dialogue doesn't ring true. Sad tale of two young\npeople who have cancer....not a comedy for sure. Depressing in fact.\nWell acted by the leads and especially Laura Dern as the mother.\nWonderful performance and wanted to see more of her.<br><br>As a realist and difficult to take 'theatrical' license, I'm wondering\nhow Gus and Issac got to that church toward the end. Issac is blind and\nGus is dying and in a wheel chair. How in the world did the get to and\nfrom the church??? Would have been more realistic if one of Gus'\nparents had been sitting in the back somewhere. Then you'd know how the\ntwo boys got there. Also, at the end when the mother tells Hazel that\nsomeone is here to see you. It's Issac. How did he get to the house.\nJust little quibbles like this kind of spoil the whole thing.\n"
"\nI have never seen a worse movie. The acting was the worst i have ever\nseen the dialogue was horrible and it is unrealistic i mean seriously\nstar wars is more realistic and i'm not the biggest romance movie fan\nbut it is still not good I can deal with it if there is good acting,\ndialogue and is realistic but it has none of those factors. It is\npredictable because they try to make it unpredictable but it doesn't\nwork it gets worse and worse they try to be funny but the jokes fall\nflat. Ansel elgort was the worst actor in this and i just wanted\neveryone to die in this movie. it is even worse than titanic 2 and that\nmovie was not good it at least had people die that i didn't like this\nonly had one so it is obviously sucks\n"
"\nSo for starters I didn't plan on watching this movie. Me and my\ngirlfriend tried to watch 22 jump street but it was sold out so we\nneeded up having to watch this. If you're past the agar of 15, please\nsave your time and money. This money if for those little helpless\nromantic girls who enjoy a tragic love story, which is what this movie\nis. The only reasonable that it was bearable was cause at least the\nactors did a good job, but it's still a very predictable movie, and\nsorta boring too. Oh man Some of the things in this movie were flat out\nstupid, like for example, Gus, the guy who falls in love with the main\ncharacter hazel. He's a survivor from cancer but lost his leg, yet he\ndoes this stupid thing were he buys cigarettes, keeps them in his mouth\nbut doesn't light it up. His reasoning is this \"it's a metaphor, you\nput the thing that kills you in your mouth, but you don't give it the\npower to kill you\" it's definitely the little stupid things like this\nthat just made this movie dumb.\n"
"\nAm i the only one who did not like this movie? I mean I looove the book\nbut the movie was a disappointment, I'm not trying to be rude or\nanything I just thought the movie would be better, the actors are good\nbut I still imagined them being different I thought that they would ...\nIdk what I thought I just think the movie was a disappointment and when\ni read the book I cried towards the ending when agustus was dying, but\nin the movie I was not even bothered, like my eyes were not stinging or\nanything I think that the movie could have been better if it had a more\ntouching ending and also I did not fell in love with agustus like I did\nin the book , idk I'm just sayin this movie could have been one of my\nfavorites but it's not, honestly thou I just think that the book is too\ngood to have been made into a movie caus I'm in love with the book. I'm\nnot trying to say that I hated this movie I just didn't like as much as\nI thought I would.\n"
"\nI can't describe how let down I feel There is so so much attention with\nthis movie that I had to go and watch it so many people talking about\nit, adverts everywhere, ,I was so excited to see this cause I am a\nmovie and especially a love movie sucker even better sad but I could\njust predict everything that was going to happen next in the movie like\nevery little bit I've seen already before like much of it from \"my\nsisters keeper\" - which I did have tears to whereas not a tear shed\nwith this movie I just felt like the acting wasn't very good either\nlike shailaine (however u spell it) I absolutely loved her in\ndivergent! But in this movie I couldn't feel her or her character :-((\ni want to watch it again and see what I'm missing , this has such a\nhigh rating :( I'm so disappointed that I left the cinemas with no\nemotions from the movie , I mean I couldn't even feel my eyes water\n(forgive me for my errors)\n"
"\nI am open minded enough to watch/read a work of art that is not in my\ntypical favorite subject. That's why I watched a film with a 8.2 rating\ndespite that being under the \"romance\" category. <br><br>The dialogs where 100% not teenagers, despite the fact that they may be\nmature because of their life experience... Have you heard a real\nteenager speaking? The whole movie is so surrealistic that it would be\nthe same if the characters were blue and could fly. <br><br>And by the way, not less important, the movie is disrespectful to real\ncancer patients and their families. <br><br>But, if you like to cry for some sick fiction teenagers for\nentertainment, because you can't feel a s**t in real life, this can be\na good pick.\n"
"\nI was totally spellbound on seeing an 8.2 rating for this movie.IMDb\nrating has nowadays become wholly untrustworthy.The whole thing seemed\nlike a soap opera series with crying tears and sentiments.If so much\npeople are giving this rating I believe it is only for the sob.In real\nlife this is really heartbreaking but for a movie it is sick and\npathetic.The heroine does not deliver anything and the hero seems\nworst.The whole movie does not even require a review.It does not do the\nmain basic reason for a film--TO ENTERTAIN(whether for crying or for\nlaugh or for horror or any other emotion.This movie is for immature\npeople who like to cry on seeing rubbish sentiments.....\n"
"\nI've created an account for the sole cause of writing a review for this\nfilm, as I'm stunned by the fact that very few people seem to notice\nthe flimsiness of the script.<br><br>Although this is obviously a teen movie, it starts OK with a good level\nof irony to balance out the profound underlying subject, not to make it\ntoo sentimental. This balance is totally lost after about 45 minutes.\nAnne Frank comes in out of nowhere, just to stir up the emotions a\nlittle more. This (along with some other plot twists) came across so\ninsincere, that I decided to leave the theater half an hour before the\nfilm ended.<br><br>The fact that tear jerking seems to be a higher priority than offering\nsolace and a good movie leaves a bad taste in my mouth.\n"
"\nEvery girl I know was obsessed with the book. And then the movie. I\nfigured that it had to be good, with such a high score. Makes sense,\nright? Man, was I surprised. The movie was awful. The majority of the\nactors weren't at all believable and those who were played annoying and\ncheesy clichés. Many scenes made no sense and were unrealistic. The\nwhole experience was bad as well. The audience that went to see this\nfilm is made up of teenage girls who ignored all the faults in the film\nand gave it a 10. I hope someone like me is reading reviews here. Then\nmaybe they could avoid ever paying to see this movie. I nearly left the\ntheatre towards the end when pretty much everyone in there started\nsobbing uncontrollably. It was too cheesy and bad to be at all\nemotional. There was nothing I took away from this film. I wouldn't\nrecommend seeing it. I was extremely disappointed.\n"
"\nTake out cancer and they are left with a hollow storyline. The movie is\nsimply not believable to me. I know it is fiction but fiction can be\nmade into a very believable film if it has relatable characters or\nstoryline. Not to mention, I find Gus' character rather simple- minded.\nHazel's parents characteristics are contradictory too. They are\nportrayed to be protective of their daughter's well-being and safety\nbut this conveniently dissipates when Hazel wanted to fly to Amsterdam\nwith Gus. Sorry, I think this is not for a more realistic/mature\naudience, don't get me wrong, I love romantic films but this is sadly\nnot my cup of tea.\n"
"\nThis book touched many millions of teenage hearts around the world, so\nit's not surprising then that eventually Hollywood came calling wanting\nto adapt John Green's words to film.<br><br>And it's an honest attempt actually. Yes, there are slight changes,\nthere has to be really, but on the whole this is a well made, and well\nacted film, that will bring more people's attention back to the book,\nwhich is not a bad thing at all.<br><br>It's not the best book adaptation in the world, but it captures the\nmessage of the original, and I have no doubt will become as beloved.<br><br>Not bad at all.\n"
"\nwow, such great acting and such great and simple dialogue. The\ncharacters have such great chemistry. I love that in this story that\nyou got to see the characters grow to being friends into loving each\nother. The characters really care about the people that they are\nportraying and they try to be as real and authentic as possible. This\nis such a sweet and great love story. Spoiler Warning: The ending to\nthis movie is so rough and so hard. We all know that he is gonna die\nbut when it happens you can't help but feel so empty and heartbroken.\nThe Ed Sheeran song to this movie alone is so sad as well. I love this\nmovie and I want to read the book and compare both. such great acting\nand Shailene is such a talented actress.\n"
"\nTwo teenage cancer patients begin a life-affirming journey to visit a\nreclusive author in Amsterdam. The Fault in our Stars was way too\npainful for me to watch you have this 2 kids that are sick and they\nhave cancer and then they fell in love and they try to live every\nmoment as their last and from out of nowhere one of them dies and it\njust hit me right in the feels. Shailene Woodley and Ansel Elgort in\nthis movie are fantastic the same goes for Willem Dafoe and although\nhis role is kinda small it still has to do something with the plot and\nhe gives a good performance too and honestly the whole cast is great,\nthe movie is touching, it's funny and it's a sweet romance for the\nwhole family Okay? Okay.\n"
"\nThe Fault In Our Stars is a fabulous book about a young teenage girl\nwho has been diagnosed with lung cancer and attends a cancer support\ngroup.<br><br>Hazel is 16 and is reluctant to go to the support group, but she soon\nrealizes that it was a good idea. Hazel meets a young boy named\nAugustus Waters. He is charming and witty. Augustus has had asceticism,\na rare form of bone cancer, but has recently had the all clear.<br><br>Hazel and Augustus embark on a roller coaster ride of emotions,\nincluding love, sadness and romance, while searching for the author of\ntheir favorites book. They travel to Amsterdam in search of Peter Van\nHouten the author of An Imperial Affliction. While on their trip\nAugustus breaks some heartbreaking news to Hazel and both of their\nworlds fall apart around them. I have now started finding better movies\nthrough www.flickstree.com. It not only suggests great movies to watch,\nit also tells where you can watch the movie online.. Highly\nrecommended.\n"
"\nFirstly, this film is an adaptation of John Green's book. Before\nwatching the film I read the book, and from my point of view, the book\nis better than the film because you can observe the little details\nquite a bit better. In this film we can also see the power of\nunconditional friendship and the importance of support when you really\nneed it. The teenagers who fall in love in the film are called Augustus\nWaters and Hazel Grace Lancaster, and we can know that their love is\ngoing to be everlasting in spite of at the beginning we couldn't think\nit. If you have girlfriend or boyfriend this will be a very interesting\nfilm to see with him or her.\n"
"\nOK, I saw this movie tonight. Alright, not really anything new than\nothers I had already seen. A few things bugged me.<br><br>1) There were too many references to her time when she almost died...\nthis implied something later in the story would be related, which it\nwasn't. 2) Was not real enough. After they had met, there next months\nwere almost perfect with a trip to Europe (when the doc said s*** no)\nand free meal with champagne etc.<br><br>I was expecting something a lot more twisty at the end than what\nhappened. <br><br>If I could re-write the ending, this entire movie would have been a\ndream of the girl after she closed her eyes on deaths door in hospital\nwhen she was 13 as she went into a coma. THAT would have been a great\nending, dreaming your last days of an amazing love experience that you\nnever got to have and then slipping away into the ether.\n"
"\nI'm really glad I didn't watch any trailers for this movie because I\nprobably wouldn't even have watched it. They look so damn kitschy but\ngladly the movie isn't. The best thing are the characters. They feel so\nreal, it's like watching the everyday life of real people with real\nproblems to live with. Mainly because of the smart dialogue which is\nfilled with beautiful metaphors about life and the incredible acting\nespecially by the main character played by Shailene Woodley. This is\nunderlined with a great score and some little turns within the story.\nIf you don't need action or a lot of suspense to enjoy a movie I can\ndefinitely recommend seeing this one. If you are a sensitive person\nchances are high that you'll end up crying although the movie is very\nlife affirming for the most time. Enjoy.\n"
"\nIf you enjoy a movie blatantly marketed at a 13 yr old girl, then I\nwould absolutely recommend this movie, because you'll barely get\nthrough the opening credits without being reminded of who the target\naudience is. It features fun bubble texting effects, lots and lots of\napple products, and of course, parents far better looking than any that\nexist in real life. Everything that made the book so great has been\nstripped away, and the result is a movie that in its most \"heart\nwrenching\" moments is merely funny. It has no depth, no reality, and 2d\ncharacters that struggle to get their best lines out. If you've read\nthe book, avoid the movie at all costs, because you'll never be able to\nread the book again.\n"
"\nFirst I watched this movie on my second screen when I was playing\ngames. After moment I dragged movie to my primary screen and I shut\ndown my second screen. I started to really respect the movie.<br><br>The story of this movie was so touching that I cried almost 4 times and\nI'm still touched.<br><br>I can definitely recommend this movie for anyone, who loves touching\nstories.<br><br>I don't have much to say, because I'm so all mixed up with my feelings\n:D<br><br>Thank you for reading :) I'll give 10/10 for this movie.\n"
"\nI know, many movie goers are probably sick of hearing that from book\nlovers, but it is a fitting statement for this movie. <br><br>John Green's descriptions are just so beautiful and eloquent and at the\nsame time really easy to read. I seriously could not put this book\ndown. I started just browsing and I couldn't stop reading. It was\namazing. <br><br>Which was why I was quite disappointed that some of my favorite lines\nfrom the book were not in the movie. <br><br>I also found it hard to see the two actors as lovers, after seeing them\nas brother and sister in Divergent. <br><br>Overall there wasn't anything bad about this movie, it just didn't\nquite do the book justice, and dragged on a bit towards the end. <br><br>If you have not read the book, I think it is very likely you will enjoy\nthis movie much more than I did.<br><br>If you have read the book, I don't think it's worth seeing the film. <br><br>But if you have seen the film, it is definitely worth getting your\nhands on the book! It will just add so much to the story and\nexperience.\n"
"\nFrom the starting till the end the movie was epic, each line and scene\nhad its own meaning. This movie relates to my life as I have a friend\nlike hazel who was suffering from a blood cancer but when she told her\nboyfriend he left her in her bad time.At that time she wanted to die\nbecause everything was going all wrong but i supported her too much at\nthat time and finally she get rid off from the cancer after suffered\nfrom an year same as i was suffering from the same thing after that and\nshe do the same as i do. The movie reminds both of us who you actually\nare and never loose faith. I never drop a single tear from eyes in any\nmovie and this is the first movie my eyes were wet while watching.\nReally an epic and tragic love story.\n"
"\nI entered the mania for this movie about a year in, and let me say I\nwas seriously disappointed.<br><br>This movie, and the novel it is based upon, illuminates the hardships\nof a cancer patient and the necessity of love. Or at least they claim\nto.<br><br>I know many cancer patients, and not a single one displays the mindset\nof either of the primary protagonists. Nor do they display the level of\nintelligence that the children do. I found the dreary mindset to be\novershadowed by humor and felt no attachment to these characters.<br><br>Many people cried when Gus died because of sadness. I cried over having\nwasted the better part of my afternoon.<br><br>This film was boring, banal, close-minded. I would not recommend this\npiece even to my most hated enemy.\n"
"\nThis movie is just perfect in my view, everything fits so nicely\ntogether. The story, screenplay and above all the acting.. just\nfantastic. I have never written a review before, seeing this movie just\nmade me to. The cinematography is just great, it is not in your face\nand helps you to feel part of the story. The casting is so natural\nespecially the lead actors, very well done. the story feels so natural\nyou can relate to, the initial text exchanges, Amsterdam visit,the\nauthor's character all feels very realistic. There are so many lighter\nmoments which makes the movie more enjoyable given the subject, I\nhaven't read the book but I am sure I am going to.. Highly recommend\nthis one\n"
"\nI was really looking forward to this movie, having never read the book,\nthe premise seemed to indicate an emotional roller-coaster. In the end\nI felt shortchanged.<br><br>Perhaps it's meant for a certain audience, but it has certain ludicrous\nmoments, the worst being the scene where those three are throwing eggs\nat the girls car. You wouldn't believe it was written by an adult.<br><br>I found the ending a bit surprising. Is Gus' eulogy supposed to be\nenough? I don't see how a few good words from a dead lover can be\ncompensation for his death. They maybe could have done more to create a\nsense of transcendence but again, I have not read the book.<br><br>Overall,I did not care for the characters, did not feel anything when\nGus died. Couldn't have cared less about how Hazel would cope, the\nwriter did not do enough with the characters to make me route for them,\nbut maybe I'm a psychopath?\n"
"\nTwo teenage cancer survivors find each other and fall in love  sort of\nsounds like a trashy romance novel, an After School Special, or a\nLifetime movie. Yet, somehow, this adaptation of the best-selling novel\nmoves beyond those melodramatic hazards into a touching portrayal. <br><br>Shailene Woodley continues her string of good to great performances and\nher march towards stardom. Ms. Woodley and Ansel Elgort provide the\ngrace, charm and lift which takes the storyline (and sometimes dialog)\nladen with potential pitfalls into an engaging film about growing up,\nlove and loss. The supposed twist at the end is not very hard to\nforesee but still it does not take way much from this well-crafted\nmovie.\n"
"\nMovie runs at variable pace. Sometimes, the story runs too fast so that\nyou are not able to feel what characters are feeling. Other times when\ndirector wants to throw some solid dialogues and wants the viewers to\nappreciate them, he makes it go slow. He cuts way too many scenes but\nnaah... not the dialogues. He adjusts the dialogues of those deleted\nscenes elsewhere. Many a times, he desperately put okayokay thing to\ncreate the effect even when it is not fitting the situation. Secondly,\nthe movie is too straight forward. Everything is served on a plate for\nthe viewers so much so that they are not required to think what is\ngoing to come-up next. In short, this movie is made for dummies.\n"
"\nWhen first viewing this movie, it is as if your heart is a balloon.\nDuring the movie, the balloon inflates to grow larger and larger and\nthe entire time you know that this balloon is going to pop. When it\nfinally does, though, you aren't mad. The explosion is so beautiful\nthat it doesn't matter. The movie is set up to lift you up and then\ndrop you, but it does so perfectly. The movie never seems to force the\naudience to feel a certain way; it never pauses to say, \"now you are\nsupposed to cry.\" It balances the good and the bad so that no one\nleaves the theater feeling depressed. You may be sad, but not\nhopelessly depressed.\n"
"\nI have refused to watch this movie ever since it came out . I guess it\nwas because I thought it was one of the cheesy romance dramas that have\nbeen flavored with classic cancer story. I could not be wronger. This\nmovie not only exceeded my expectations but it made me regret every\nsingle second that I wasted with not watching this movie. It is not a\nclassic cancer story. It has twists and turns. It has the element of\n\"the unexpected\". It is one of the movies make you happy and sad at the\nsame time. John Green did an outstanding job with this story but I\nbelieve the movie also deserves credit. I think the is well-shot. The\nactors chosen for this movie could not be any better. Also I believe\nthe director did an amazing job.\n"
"\nI give it 4. I never wrote a review before, but seeing the average of\n8.1 gave me the feeling I never will be able to trust IMDb User\nRaitings again. 2 hours an 6 minutes of common places, rigid dialogs,\nbad acting, predictability, round of applause and trips to Europe: this\nare the ingredients of this film which abuses the resource of the drama\naround a serious illness and turns it in to a cheesy movie with no\nbreakthrough-message at all. I rescue Willem Dafoe's character, Van\nHouten. Mr Dafoe is an amazing actor and he plays a round, solid and\nbelievable character with an interesting unexploited story. I haven't\nread the book, maybe it is bearable. The movie is just a low punch.\n"
"\nThe Fault in Our Stars is a 2014 American romantic comedy-drama film\ndirected by Josh Boone. The film stars Shailene Woodley, Ansel Elgort,\nand Nat Wolff, with Laura Dern, Sam Trammell, and Willem Dafoe playing\nsupporting roles. Woodley plays Hazel Grace Lancaster, a sixteen-year-\nold cancer patient who is forced by her parents to attend a support\ngroup, where she subsequently meets and falls in love with Augustus\nWaters, played by Ansel Elgort. Hazel and Gus are two extraordinary\nteenagers who share an acerbic wit, a disdain for the conventional, and\na love that sweeps them - and us - on an unforgettable journey. Their\nrelationship is all the more miraculous, given that they met and fell\nin love at a cancer support group. THE FAULT IN OUR STARS, based upon\nthe number-one bestselling novel by John Green, explores the funny,\nthrilling and tragic business of being alive and in love.\n"
"\nWhat do you get if you combine \"A walk to remember\" and \"My Girl 2\".<br><br>You get this unoriginal piece of crap. The man who wrote the book this\nmovie is based upon, have taken key story lines from better films, and\nthen written an under preforming story, that for some reason made it to\nfilm. Despite the actors best effort, all characters comes off as\ncliche's that predestined to just be there because the plot demands\nthem to be. They authors idea of how teenagers behave is ludicrous and\nfrankly just made me laugh. Besides the plot holes and random\nbehaviors, like egging cars for no reason and letting your child travel\nalone to another continent. You can clearly see where the author have\nstolen things from better work, and then had nothing to full the rest\nof the story with. I have never wanted the lead characters in a film to\ndie so badly as this one just so that I wont have to see a sequel.\n"
"\nBefore watching this film I read the book upon recommendation from\nfriends. I hated the book. It was unrealistic (I can't relate to any of\nthe characters), depressing (in that they had cancer) and boring. With\na 12 hour flight across the pacific I decide to give the story another\nchance and watch the film. Exactly the same thoughts.<br><br>However, alongside the dull story line you are also faced with the\nterrible acting, out of touch music and redeeming cinematography. If\nnot for the cinematography this film would be getting a 1/10 rather\nthan a 2.<br><br>Overall, an easy way to pass a 12 hour flight. Don't waste your time on\nwatching this film unless you are a stupid 16 year old girl.\n"
"\nThe fault in our star is based on the best-selling novel by John Green.\nIt's the best book to movie adaptation I've seen in a long time. I was\ncurious as to why this movie is so good and at the same time makes you\ncry. I don't regret watching it at all. It is very satisfying movie,\nthat will bring you to tears. Every time I watch it, it does really\ntouch my heart. It shows you the meaning of life. The movie is\nhilarious, beautiful and heartbreaking all at the same time. The\ncasting is great, the acting is great and it feels real. The acting was\nbrilliant and made the whole film work. Each character was likable and\nhad arcs. The effects are great as well. It is one of my favorite\nmovies of all time. I've read and watched the movie many times but I\nstill won't get bored. I have to give most of the credit to John Green\nfor writing an amazing book. I highly recommend this movie to everyone\nespecially teens. See it! Don't miss it! Or you will regret that you\nmissed best movie of all time!\n"
"\nI've watched many movies in my life. None of them were so close to my\nheart. I have not had movies with a \"not so happy ending\" in my best\nmovie list. But man, this one's different. To me the movie, characters\nare all real. And I will continue to think so and feel so. Although the\njourney was short, the couple had sweet time unlike most of us ever\nhave. Trust, joy, love, hope, care, beauty, pain, loneliness... is what\nthis life is. Thanks a lot to everyone who have been part of the movie.\nI wish them a happy life and am eternally grateful. I hope we learn to\nendure the relationships in the best possible way. Let us not forget to\nremember that we need not necessarily be in pain to realise the value\nof life. This movie is a God's message to all of us to change for good.\nTo live the only life we have in the best possible way we can.\n"
"\nI had no expectations towards this film, based on the reviews I thought\nit's the kind of movie you have already seen without actually seeing\nit. However, falling in love is so beautifully depicted in this movie\nthat I'm not sure I have seen anything like this in recent films. The\ntwo main characters (and the actors) are absolutely lovable just for\nwhat they are, for their silly jokes and meaningful thoughts. Some\nscenes are so powerful that you'd want to be in their place despite the\ncancer/dying background. It certainly had an impact on me, at least.\nAnd I was once again persuaded how great actor Willam Dafoe is, and it\nwas also nice to see Lotte Verbeek from Nothing Personal\n"
"\nSuperficial and dull, despite the topic.<br><br>A story of a relationship between two teens who both have terminal\ncancer. Should be an engaging and emotional tale, but is strangely\nempty. Just feels like a paint-by-numbers midday TV movie, complete\nwith one-dimensional, stereotypical characters and Disney-like lack of\ngrittiness. <br><br>Had potential initially, but quickly just fell into a pattern of silly\nsub-plots and style over substance. Ultimately doesn't go anywhere new\nand ends quite predictably, and inevitably.<br><br>Has its moments though, and poses some questions regarding life and\ndeath. <br><br>Good performance by Shailene Woodley. She is one of the few bright\nlights in the movie. Ansel Elgort overacts and is irritating.\nSimilarly, Laura Dern. Willem Dafoe provides the only touch of edginess\nin the movie, but his performance feels a bit forced.<br><br>Really a death and faux emotion movie for teenagers.\n"
"\nA fairly unique take for a teenage love story but, nothing to\nspectacular. <br><br>Personally I didn't find it to be as big for a sob fest as it was made\nout to be. Partly because after reading the plot you have a good idea\nwhere it is heading and partly because... well I have seen other\nlove/tragedies before and other the teen cancer survivors... this one\ndoesn't bring anything new to the party. <br><br>The notebook was much better and had more believable dialog. and a\nbetter storyline. <br><br>overall good but nothing special.\n"
"\nWell I didn't read novel before watching this movie like many of the\nothers had done so. A film was recommended to me by a friend with a\nnote \"A love story you want to never miss\".<br><br>Well I am not a big fan of love movies and rarely I saw love movies\nwhich has good ratings and heard from too many people about it.<br><br>First of all the story was sublime. Then it looks like that the\ncharacters chosen were really themselves in the movie not performing or\nacting. Then in the start it feels little boring but once you start\ncatching hold of the story than its like you are feeling what they are\nfeeling.<br><br>The great thing which I liked about the movie is that the director had\nkept it simple and had not included too many glamorous details as the\ncurrent trend is.<br><br>This movie gives the great insight of the lives of teenagers suffering\nfrom any kind of such dangerous disease. There parents insight and\ntheir feelings.<br><br>Overall I would like to say that I am impressed by the movie and not\nlike other love stories.\n"
"\nA beautiful movie if ever I've seen one. Honestly, one of the best I've\nwatched since watching perks of being a wallflower. The characters are\nconvincing, the chemistry between them is palpable and even though you\nonly know the characters for 2 hours, the ending is enough to make even\nthe hardiest of men with a smidgen of a good heart cry. The story\nunfolds without flaw and takes you through a journey of love and loss,\nmaking you understand the harsh realities of life, while also showing\nto you the beauty that can be found in even the smallest of infinities.\nAll in all an excellent movie and a worthwhile watch for anyone seeking\nto find a diamond among the movies of 2014. And to any person who has\nthe gall to give this movie a 1, I say you must have absolutely no good\ntaste and do not have mental capacity to grasp the deeper and more\nbeautiful things in life. Though I have not read the book, I am\ndefinitely going to. I am certain that the director and the actors did\na brilliant job at bringing the book to life for us. Hats off to all of\nyou :)\n"
"\nI didn't read the book... But I did watch the first movie trailer and\nknew I needed to see this movie! For me - it was excellent beyond\nbelief. I have been graced by many loved one's and friends whom\nhave/had cancer, some of whom have passed. Shailene Woodley's\nperformance in this movie was Spectacular! Akin to Tom Hank's\nperformance in Forrest Gump! Ansel Elgort's performance is equally\nSpectacular! Nat Wolff's performance was Great too! Shailene's\nperformance was what draws people into the movie. She becomes and\nultimately IS Hazel Grace! With a few True Stars you can see it in\ntheir expressions and mostly see it in their eyes. Rowan Blanchard's\nperformances as Riley in Girl Meets World is similar. Shailene is a\nstar that has not reached her full potential! With her performance\nhere, I really would love to see another book and/or film that\ncontinues this epic story!\n"
"\nThe movie was okay. No reality in emotions. The acting was below par as\nwell and the main issue was that the storyline sucked big time! There\nwas no real conviction that where this movie is going or what does the\ndirector aims to portray. A good romantic movie with love as center\nwould be the eternal sunshine of spotless mind. there is marked\ndifference between the two movies and the latter clearly outshines it\nbig time! The actors did try to do justice to the scripts given to them\nbut it's way off from the actual story being told in the book. Those\nwho read the book don't watch the movie please as you'll be really\ndisappointed so save your time folks\n"
"\nFew movies have had the ability to move me along the emotional line as\nflawlessly as this one has. The love story of Gus &amp; Hazel was young,\nbut wizened, poignant and funny, and classically modern. The director\ndid an excellent job with each scene, each contrast that made me want\nto watch it just a little more with each passing minute. As Gus hoped,\nI hoped; as Hazel hoped and dreamed, and cried, so did I. In many ways,\nit was an exploration of all our selves; insecurities and death,\nliterally and figuratively. What made it incredibly relatable was the\nage range of these actors through which the story was portrayed; were\nit an older cast, it would not have been as impactful.\n"
"\nI'm not generous to give this movie 10/10 cause it's totally worth it.\nIt has been a while since The Notebook that I cried a lot watching a\nmovie. Beautiful quotes and scene, adorable couple and their unfinished\nepic love story are the highlights of the movie. They also teach you\nhow to appreciate life and people around. I love all the characters in\nthis movie.Hazel is sensitive and smart. Gus is sweet and funny. Others\nare all lovely. Although I kind of hoped it would have a happy ending\nand was sad when Gus died, it did not ruin anything.In fact, it\nactually made the movie become more \"real\", like it was supposed to be.\nIncredible !!!\n"
"\nBeing a massive fan of the book, and an avid reader, I was worried that\nthe film wouldn't do the book justice. Oh how wrong I was. The movie\nstuck to the book the way any adaption should, and the actors were\nperfect for the parts they were chosen to play. One of the few movies\nadapted from a book that I have thoroughly enjoyed just as much as when\nI read the book itself, as it wasn't butchered when made into a film as\nmany book to film adaptions are. This is a story that shows the harsh\nrealities of living with cancer, and what life is like for those who\nhave to live with it everyday. Heartwarming and emotional, I doubt\nthere are many people who have watched this movie, and left with a dry\neye at the end.\n"
"\nThe film speaks about the unexpected love between two teenagers\nsuffering from cancer. They met at a cancer support group. It's a\nromantic drama from Josh Boone with Shailene Woodley and Ansel Elgort\nas main actors (they did another film together : Divergent). It's\nprobably one of my favourite films because the story looks so amazing,\nhe makes me dream even if the teenagers are sick. I enjoyed this film,\nI found it hard to put down because the story is gripping. I found it\nso sad but also beautiful. The film is inspired from a book and even\nthe book is gripping. I'll read it as soon as possible! My only\ncriticism is that I found it too short! You must see this movie if you\nlike this kind of films, you'll not be disappointed !\n"
"\nThe Fault in Our Stars is one of the best movies I have seen this year.\nIt's simply brilliant, it is written beautifully and the acting is\nabsolutely flawless. This isn't a sappy teen romance movie, this is a\ntrue masterpiece!<br><br>I felt attached to every character, I was very invested and by the end\nI was in a complete emotional roller-coaster of sadness, happiness,\ngrief and overall satisfaction that a movie could create this feeling\nin me. There is not a single point in this entire film where I thought\nsomething could have been done better from writing to direction to\nacting, it was gold. It took a serious subject and showed a side to it\nthat many never see, a positive part of a negative, that cancer can be\ndefeated even if it's not survived.<br><br>The Fault in our Stars is a beautiful film and is easily worthy of a\nten star rating, and that's only because the scale caps there. I would\nrecommend this film to anyone and everyone.\n"
"\nBeautiful Love Story of Beautiful Hazel and gus.Though the Actors are\nso young their acting is really praiseworthy. A New And Beautiful Love\nstory.I liked the movie more than the book..The Emotion and feelings\nthat the movie expresses is just speechless..The Bond between young\ncouple is beautifully depicted.Got Tears in my eyes..It is a must watch\nMovie with Beautiful story line , amazing actors , wonderful places.\nThough Is not a pretentious film, But is full of little special moments\nthat creates a very good and convincing environment and make you smile\nby the chemistry between the young couple...<br><br>LOVED IT\n"
"\nI can't believe the ratings this film has on here.<br><br>While not a terrible film as such. The whole point of the this film is\nover sentimental rubbish. And i love sentimentality, but the whole\npoint in this film just seems to be to try make you cry!.<br><br>The Acting apart from Shailene Woodley (Hazel) is mediocre and\nespecially Gus (Ansel Elgort) who i thought was terrible. Shailene\nWoodley i thought was decent enough however.<br><br>The film obviously has some intended messages, but its so dumbed down.\nI can only think that the ratings have been boosted by the fans of the\nbook.\n"
"\nWhen I see a movie so grossly over rated, it makes me remove some\npoints from my actual score. This is to me a 6. But at 8.2, this movie\nis way over what it should be. But I understand perfectly why so many\npeople were moved by it. And it what I want to discuss here. ATTENTION\nSPOILER. When the protagonists go to Amsterdam, as if it was the place\nwhere they would find the answer to the ultimate question in their\nlives, the character played by Wilem Dafoe tells them basically that\nthey are not special because they have a terminal illness, but that\nthey are like all other human being faced with the hand they were dealt\nby life. I suspect the author of the best selling novel to have used\nthis character to expose this truth which is hard to accept. But with\nappropriate music and endearing moments, we forget that unpleasant\nencounter until this character comes back to tell us he lost a loved\none to terminal disease. As for the actors, only Shailene Woodley does\nher job. The sloppy acting that surrounds her is a little irritating.\n"
"\nEverything about this flick sounds phony, from the dialogs to the\nreactions of all the people involved. For instance, what kind of a love\napproach is this ? Don't underline all the time that they are talking\nabout this particular book. What amazed me was the mother in front of\nher sick child saying \"I will never be a mother again\". What mother\nwould be so selfish in a situation like this ? Evry mother would, first\nthing first, think about her child. That quote ruined the moment and\nthe mother's every appearances. Te father is there, but absent. Both\nparents spent their time running in the stairs with a would be sad\nface. The worst part is that I never felt emotionally connected to the\ncharacters besides at the very end. The movie is supposed to be funny\nat times but with the kind of goody Christian jokes. Good story with a\nbad scenario. It could have been done with less pathos, less clichés\nand... less music which is redundant with the emotions.\n"
"\nThis film reminds me why I love watching movies, it's that simple.\nMaybe I'm slightly biased because of a really good friend of mine died\nrecently the age of mere 24 in cancer, but he was brave, admirable and\nloving until the very end, just like Gus. <br><br>Just like in this movie and the lost of my friend I have learned that\nnever take life and love for granted. So please watch this movie\nbecause you will love it in a bittersweet way, but I promise that it\nwill leave you with a smile on your face when the credits will start to\nroll. All in all this movie will have you in a turmoil of feelings, but\ntrust me that it's accurate portrayed and it leaves you thinking and\nthen some.\n"
"\nI was quite disappointed in this movie. And surprised at all the 9-10\nstar reviews. I don't want to repeat everything people with 1 star\nreviews have said, but totally agree with most of them. Bad acting. I\nmean... where is the chemistry between these two people? Where does\nthis great 'love' come from that they keep talking about but are not\nshowing? 'Love' story? Not on any level. And how many times can you say\nOMG in a movie? Was there some kind of Guinness World Record attempt\nhere? It was very distracting and so shallow. I had watched The Good\nLie just before this and was bawling my eyes out. This just felt like a\ncheat after that great movie (great, because it was so real.)\n"
"\nSomehow, this unabashedly manipulative film has become a runaway\nfinancial success, and I have to say I don't get it. All of the\ncharacters are nothing more than quick sketches that are never fleshed\nout, right down to the main romantic couple. Heck, even the characters\nfrom the blandest dime-a-dozen big-budget action film you can think of\nhave more dimension and personality than the ones paraded across the\nscreen here. <br><br>Make no mistake: This movie's screenwriters didn't set out to write a\nstory about Hazel and Gus. No, they set out to write an Emotional movie\nwith a capital \"E.\" I have nothing against those movies; as a matter of\nfact, I absolutely eat them up. But the thing is, in order to be\neffective, you need characters that people care about and identify\nwith, not cardboard cutouts with about as much depth as a single sheet\nof paper.\n"
"\nSo.. I loved this. Just so dreamy and full of insight on life and\ndeath. Is what I would say if I was a 14 year old girl with a crush.\nspoiler alert. CHICK FLICK... of the worst sort. Girls and women, You\nwatch this movie and love it. You will love it. Guys you will watch it\nbecause they want to watch it. Your flesh will crawl, and the logic\nparts of your brain will liquify with emotion. <br><br>I am going to have to go watch All of Archer to reset my brain now. But\nthat's just me. <br><br>On the plus side. Its very well acted, good character development, Some\nreal touching and funny moments. The script is a bit blah, but no ware\nnear most of the Hollywood tripe so it can be enjoyed. <br><br>The cigarette thing is irritating as hell, metaphor or no.\n"
