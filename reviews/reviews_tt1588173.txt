"\nThis movie was great! I brought my friends and they thought it was\ngoing to be lame but they ended up loving it just as much as I did! Go\nsee this movie, its adorable! I loved how its dark and gory in a cute\nway. This movie is funny, suspenseful, a little bit of a horror and\nromantic; its the perfect date movie! I don't get scared easily but\nthis movie made me jump a few times... The whole movie i was\nentertained! I was very impressed with the way the make-up and hair\nteam were able to make the zombies so realistic! R was very easy to\nrelate with and this movie has a little bit of everything for everyone.\nI suggest going even if your a bit skeptic about it. Go out and see\nthis movie!\n"
"\nWhen I was going to see this movie, i was thinking that it gonna be\nanother teen movie about a girl that's discover the natural identity of\nher boyfriend, but it wasn't like this, it was so much better, with\nalternative focus and interesting events this movie comes with a brand\nnew type of history, a very well produced time line that will keep you\nwith your eyes opened until the last second, it's simply awesome, great\nfor family, adaptable for all ages, and will touch even the youngest\nand the oldest person that goes to see it, it's not a reflexive movie,\nthat will be in your head for a long time, but it's a huge font of\nentertainment, i recommend it for all the people in the world. Of\ncourse, this movie has a lot of existing elements, that make it a\nlittle boring to see, but it's a great film for a Saturday night, to\nsee with your friends. Thanks all of you, and sorry about my English,\ni'm from other country.\n"
"\nThis movie was a lot of fun to watch. It is a twist on the zombie genre\nunlike anything you have ever seen. There is nothing too offensive or\ngory in this - the creators kept it clean and not too scary for a\nfull-on zombie flick. There are your typical shot to the head to kill\nthe zombies but those quick scenes are nothing compared to watching 10\nminutes of The Walking Dead or the like. I am always concerned because\nI have seen so many movies over the years where the creators did not\nknow how to properly end the story. So many movies are great the first\nhour and then end poorly. I thought this had one of the best endings I\nhave ever seen. Enjoy!\n"
"\nThis film isn't your usual Zombie film, yes there is a load of zombies\nin it but it is with a twist. This time it is about good zombies. There\nis still quite a few fight scenes but nothing over the top/too gory.<br><br>I didn't think this plot could work, a zombie and a human forming a\nrelationship? it sounds silly but it actually works! The excellent\nNicholas Hoult portrays 'R' the zombie extremely well and the on screen\nfriendship he forms with Julie (Teresa Palmer) is really touching. OK\nit is a bit predictable but the way it all developed is great and we\nare left with a great ending.<br><br>I think this film will really surprise a few people, it is definitely\nworth watching. A romantic film which includes zombies and is also\nfunny, a winner for me.<br><br>8/10\n"
"\nYES..it is another vampire love story movie, but guess what? There's\nbetter humor and of course the point where its definitely a unique type\nof story. The part of the movie that makes it more interesting is they\nmade it to the way comedy/love/vampire gore and most of all action\nscenes to were they should be placed at the right moment. Although, its\nthe typical zombies eat human, who would ever thought of why not making\na Romeo and Juliet zombie kinda movie. Its pure genius, Better\nyet..Props to the person who wrote it. This definitely makes that\nOVERRATED Twilight series SUCKS MORE after watching this. I would\nreally recommend watching it.\n"
"\nFirst: Zombie with white teeth. Because if there's one thing the human\nflesh eating undead care about, it's dental hygiene. I'm in the first\n37 mins of this movie and I can only ask myself why I wasted my time\n(seeing it free so not my money). And what is Hollywood's obsession\nwith trying to make young ladies like me fall in love with zombies,\nwerewolves and vampires. Are they just setting us up to lower our\nexpectations about all men? Choose between an animal, the undead or the\nactual dead. Honestly, I'm watching this movie as a parody because I\ncannot see how it can be addressed otherwise. I will not address the\nplethora of faults in every scene and in the plot because my fellow\nreviewers have done it justice. Skip this movie. To my friends who are\nmaking me watch this un-ironically; we might have to reconsider our\nrelationship.\n"
"\nOld conception, new point of view. Anyone who wishes to discover in\ndetail the future universe in which zombies are crowding the planet,\nanyone who claims elaborate answers for the hows, whens and whys should\ngo elsewhere. This movie is sweet, funny and entertaining. It possesses\nall the elements a good romantic comedy should and still it's not too\ncheesy. The performances are decent, not very memorable but believable.\nNicholas Hoult's performance is beyond average. The soundtrack is\nexcellent, it fits the movie's style and mood perfectly. All in all\nthis one works much better than the similar-themed Twilight saga but\nit's not a big miracle considering that the latter doesn't work at\nall...<br><br>I recommend it to those who wish to be entertained by a well-thought\nout, funny romantic comedy with a lot of action and originality\nconsidering it's genre. I don't recommend it to people who long for\nlong, meaningful conversations and a memorable experience because this\nmovie is not going to give you one.\n"
"\nMy mom was the one who wanted to watch this. I didn't really want to, I\nthought it'd be cheesy and not my kind of my movie. But hey! it ended\nup being of my favorites. I loved that this movie had it all; action,\nromance, thriller, comedy, etc. It wasn't a \"chick flick\" and it wasn't\na movie girls would roll their eyes over because of the action. I loved\nit because I was so engrossed in the film. During the action/thriller\nscenes I was at the end of my seat, hoping everything would turn out\nokay. During the comedy scenes I was falling back laughing at what had\njust happened. During the romance scenes, I was tearing up and even\nthinking of how much I love my boyfriend. I believe any movie that can\nencompass that many emotions into a couple hours, is a movie worth\nwatching.\n"
"\nBeing a big fan of Walking Dead television series, my review for \"Warm\nBodies\" is undoubtedly positively biased. It was a good watch with\nseveral good laughs. It also has a nice to see some originality.\nIndeed, I'd rate the movie between a 6 and 7 - closer to 7. Young lead\nNicholas Hoult does a good job with his line-delivery and zombiness.\nThe movie is especially witty and clever in it's initial third or so.\nBeautiful young Teresa Palmer is up to the test to be the lead love\ninterest. She is a bit Tom- boyish, the right amount so. On the lesser\nside John Malkovich has a bit role, maybe not even needed - part of the\nweaker side of the story involving human fighters. Worth a watch,\nespecially for zombie fans.\n"
"\nWARM BODIES marketing campaign probably hurt it cuz you couldn't tell\nif it was a romantic comedy WITh zombies or a zombie movie WITH comedy.\nBut we finally watched it and I thought it was very clever and funny.\nHoult &amp; Palmer were terrific. The opening monologue was hilarious and\nimmediately showed how funny sharing the inner thoughts of a zombie\nwould be. LOVED that John Malkovich was the militaristic leader.\nHaven't liked most of the other films Jonathan Levine has made but this\nwas very well done. Romeo &amp; Juliet with a BITE! They satirized\neverything from makeover montages, sidekicks, zombie folklore, etc. And\nthe music used throughout was GREAT! Bravo! Hoult has really grown up\nsince being the little kid in ABOUT A BOY!\n"
"\nI feel like most people missed the connection between this movie and\nthe classic romeo and Juliet play. Obviously all the names R, Julie,\nPerry, M and the plot with opposing families give this away. The real\ndifference is that instead of dying together in the name of love, they\nbecome alive together. With R being a zombie his coming to life is\nliteral but even Julie who was sad and lonely in this post-apocalyptic\nworld finds herself at the end because of R. This movie is the untragic\ncomedic zombie romance version of Romeo and Juliet. I think if they\nwould have advertised it more so in this way people would have\nunderstood it better and probably enjoyed it more. As for the movie\nitself the effects were good. Music was fun. Kept me interested the\nwhole time. Just a fun zombie romance for people who are tired of the\nsame old stuff.\n"
"\nA movie with the potential of creating a new genre, with the\nmaincharacter being an actual zombie... Which could have given some\nvery needed depth to the hackneyed groaning creatures we all know and\nlove. However, sadly the movie ends up just being another romantic\nflick with supernatural elements for teenagers. I also feel like the\nzombies are very loosely defined, can they smell human flesh? Can they\ncommunicate with each other ? How and when do they become \"bonies\"?\nEven though the movie sometimes tries to be self-critical and even make\nfun of the genre as a whole, I think, just because you know your movie\nis bad, it does not become better. I LOVED the concept, but HATED the\nimplementation.\n"
"\nloved it from start to finish, great acting all through,Its a totally\ndifferent take on the whole zombie genre. Its about zombies changing\nand thinking instead of zombies being the bad ones and getting killed\nNicholas Holt did a great job definitely going to recommend this movie\nto friends,family etc, anyone who rates this movie bad is wrong watch\nit, its a feel good romantic,comedy loved it...i am going to watch this\nagain cause thought it was great, it was awesome 9/10 best romantic\ncomedy I've seen in a while all films out now are just alright but when\ni saw this i knew i was going to love it, give it a go it was GREAT. I\nwatched it on good quality too wish i saw this in cinema would've been\nmore amazing, john malokovich did a great job and so did the lead girl,\nnever seen her in anything before, don't want to write any spoilers so\nbetter leave it at that overall feel good movie, lovely romance and\ncomedy, leaves u smiling at the end, lovely movie.\n"
"\nI rented this film because of the trailer. I'm not a zombie fan, in\nfact this is the first zombie film I've seen, but the trailer was funny\nand I thought, why not? I totally enjoyed this film. It's a sweet, well\nacted, little gem. Analeigh Tipton is brilliant! I will be looking for\nmore of her work in the future. I'm not sure that this film will please\ndie hard zombie fans. Not much gore really and it is more of a love\nstory but it is amusing, down right funny in places, and the characters\nare all likable.\"R\" is not only charming and handsome, the inside of\nhis plane is fabulous, a set that's little bit of paradise for \"quirky\nstuff\" mongers, like me. So overall I certainly recommend this film\nwith the caveat that it is subtle. If you want buckets of blood, a lot\nof violence, amazing CG gore and wild, over the top laughs this\nprobably is not for you, which is fine because I highly recommend it to\njust about everyone else.\n"
"\nA Zombie finds love in the shape of a victim's girlfriend and feels\nsomething 'stirring'. Underneath the smart Alec jokes, grim setting and\nZombie 'frolics' what you have here is basically a morality play that\nproves the old adage that 'love conquers all'. The film starts off in\nfamiliar Zombie Apocalypse territory with hordes of the reanimated\nshuffling around an airport then we meet Hoult's 'R' a Zombie clearly\nstruggling with his new found place in things. The most refreshing part\nof the film is not the Zombies and the Land of the Dead-esque situation\nbut the blossoming love story between the leads which is handled\nbrilliantly and sets up the ending very well. All in all a good\n'Rom-com' that plays on its strengths but will probably annoy the hell\nout of hard bitten (heh) Zombie fans.\n"
"\nWhat can i say if you are a zombie fan then this is a must, and even if\nyou not you probably be pleasantly surprised. Finally an original\nzombie movie with a different plot to the normal run or get eaten and\nthen more running.Acting and special affects were great what can i say\ni loved every minute of it and one of the first zombie love stories you\never watch. As well as being really funny it gives you a different\nperspective on what it could be like to really be a zombie, an area\nwhich hasn't been explored yet which is why i am so excited about it,\nand is as action packed and Gory as most of the other zombie flicks.\nWatch and enjoy.\n"
"\nI watched it yesterday. At the beginning i was a bit bored but it\nactually gets really better after a few minutes.<br><br>The guy just keep talking about his zombie life without really\nexplaining how he got into a zombie. But awkwardly he fell in love with\na girl and that chemistry between them was so beautiful. Most zombie\nmovies I have watched(resident evil,I am legend...)portrayed them\nnegatively. But that's the first time you can see walking dead actually\nhaving a heart and can love. <br><br>At the end that was the cure LOVE.Overall a really nice movie for\neveryone that conveys more than just being cliché romance. A good\nfamily-movie!.\n"
"\nLoved it, its funny and the story is really good. Made something\ndifferent from 'zombies' and i loved it. Defo would watch it again. I\nthought the actors were brilliant and the story line was well thought\nout, it was quirky but a little bit scary at the same time. All in all\ni think its prob one of my favorite zombie movies and i do love that\ngenre. it was different but it worked it really did. Trust me - watch\nit and you wont be disappointed. I had never heard of it before we\ndecided to watch it, but I'm really glad we decided to. From watching\nthe trailer we thought it could have been a trailer kinda good movie\nbut no it was brilliant didn't wanna stop watching it.\n"
"\nwell i had this movie with me since days and hadn't seen it,and for\nsome reasons preferred other movies over this and saw this when i had\nnone more to see and must say i liked the movie a lot ,the starting was\ngood and different and shows u the world from zombie perspective , the\nconcept of airport occupation,bits of zombie comic dialogues and\neveryone walking abouts was something we don't normally see in regular\nzombie movies. the screenplay is simply wonderful and Nicholas Hoult\nhas one justice to his character. the soundtracks used throughout the\nmovie makes you appreciate and enjoy the situation even more its really\ndifferent and cute in a way and i wouldn't mind seeing it again some\nday soon . give it a try and you will love it .\n"
"\nIt was not formula. Kind of a strange way to start a review, I know. I\nwas expecting a blood-and-guts horror comedy with a sadistic and\ntwisted ending, probably with our star-crossed lovers both zombies at\nthe end reminiscing over a shared brain. But that would have been\nformula.<br><br>As a die-hard zombie fan who has enjoyed everything from Fulci to\nRomero, every blood-soaked, entrail littered set and corny line, this\nwas not what I had expected. It was much better than I had assumed, it\nwas something thoughtful, not strictly a romance or a horror flick. It\nhas a heart and a soul, which is what this world around us has lost.\nAnd what this movie is all about.\n"
"\nI watched this film because my teenager wanted to watch it, but I\nwasn't expecting much. I thought, \"Oh, it's just Twilight but with\nzombies.\" Boy, was I wrong.<br><br>From the first few moments of R's voice-over narration, you can tell\nthat it's actually not cheesy. He sheds a humorous light on his\npredicament and you're immediately rooting for him. The actual plot of\nthe movie, while not totally unique, is oddly refreshing. You get the\nsense that both R and Julie are sincere &amp; not that much different from\nany other teens their ages. They're just in another place and time.<br><br>Warm Bodies has elements of sci-fi, action/adventure, romance, drama,\nand comedy. Even if you don't like sappy romance movies or don't think\nyou can sit through one more zombie movie, see this one. You won't be\ndisappointed.\n"
"\nI'm a guy that loves his zombie flicks. A few of my favs are Romero's\nzombie franchise, Shaun of the Dead, Dead Alive, Planet Terror, and\nZombieland. It could be argued that this movie is the 'Zombie Twilight'\nIn a way, it is, but it's actually done very well. The acting is good,\nand the characters are likable. It has a few cheesy and funny moments\nsuch as R telling Julie to act like a zombie so the others won't eat\nher. Our male protagonist is a zombie named R. He can't remember his\nname or what happened before the apocalypse. He lives at an airport\nwith his other zombie friends. On the prowl for human flesh, R runs\ninto a beautiful girl named Julie. He begins to fall in love with her,\nand it slowly makes him human again. Their relationship is very sweet\nand adorable. Their new friendship is soon threatened by the skeletal\nzombies called bonies. The humans and the zombies must team up together\nto rid the world of the real monsters. If you love zombies and love\nstories, I'd definitely recommend WARM BODIES!!!\n"
"\nContradiction, Ironic, Draggy, Corny. I would have gone into the movie\nand murdered all of them, that would have made it more entertaining.<br><br>Started with R saying that zombies can't walk fast, then later jumped\ninto action trying to save human life! Saying Zombies really can't\ntalk, then started to talk more! Girlfriend being kidnapped by lover in\na plane and felt so at home....reading books, listening to music....oh\ncome On!<br><br>And those white teeth R has after eating human brains.....Don't know if\ni miss a scene of R brushing his teeth after every meal.<br><br>Lucky I walked out, would have gone mad seeing them kiss in the end.<br><br>**warning** this movie murders the walking dead TV series... if you\nwatch the walking dead, DO NOT WATCH THIS.\n"
"\nIt was awful. Hell, the word \"awful\" doesn't even begins to describe\nhow I felt watching the movie.<br><br>It's like \"what if deadheads wasn't funny and it's ending was stretched\nto the whole movie\".<br><br>Cheesy, uninteresting, bad special effects &amp; action scenes, idiotic\nsolution to the whole mess. \"Make zombies feel emotions and they'll\nturn human yeehh\" NO. Know what? I would have accepted the solution if\nthe movie would have executed it well. But it didn't. God awful movie.<br><br>You'll like this movie if you're a 13yo girl with \"pale guys\" fetish,\nor something of the sort.\n"
"\nWhen looking for horror this did not look like a good choice. The cover\ndid not feature some creepy mannequin or demon. <br><br>The film from the word go entices you in with the characters and\npsychologically tests your preconceptions about zombies and the\nparanormal. You will be taken on a journey building understanding and\nempathy for the characters along with a healthy degree of gore and\nhumour. <br><br>The characters and plot clearly have been well thought out and the main\nactor and actress are stunning and dramatic in performance. The flow of\nthe movie is great since it is not slow to pick up the story line. The\nstory line is unexpected and interesting and keeps you guessing\nthroughout and changing your own perception of good and bad. <br><br>I certainly do not regret sitting down and getting thoroughly\nengrossed.<br><br>Well planned, well played, should appeal to many\n"
"\nWTF! This is one of the weirdest movies I have ever seen and it was\nactually pretty good. I'm not sure I knew what to expect but it was\nnice to see the zombie's perspective this time. Who would have thought\nthey had such an internal conflict going on. Aside from the absolutely\nludicrous concept you have a movie with a lot of heart not much\nsubstance but I guess you can't have everything.<br><br>I'm glad I watched this movie but I don't think I need to ever again.\nThey put it all out on the screen with no hidden messages that make you\nwant to come back for more unfortunately. Best part was the awesome old\nschool music. So good try, talented cast, nice idea but once was\nenough.\n"
"\nWarm Bodies opened quite cleverly with humorous dialog and an\nunderstanding of characters. However the direction of both the story\nand humor seemed to go only downhill from there. Ultimately in the end\nthe combination of zombie horror genre and romantic humor just did not\nseem to mix well. <br><br>Shuan of the Dead is an fantastic example of a mix of genre done well\n(Zombie Horror and Humor) and has a good build up of characters.<br><br>Warm Bodies provided characters that were shallow stereotypical teen\ntypes and really everyone just seemed to shallow to care about. I must\ngive credit to the FX peps who did the Skelton Zombies they looks scary\nand if the movie had involved more action it may have been better.\n"
"\nTo paraphrase the oft moaned female lament, \"He couldn't keep it up.\"\nZombie film as told from a detached, wry, dryly humorous soul. Hmm, do\nzombies even have souls? Pointedly funny, satirical contrast of\ndisconnected vs dead. Brilliant flash of the zombie recollection of\n\"happy\" disconnected humanity, lurching their ways, eyes glued to\ncellphones and similar devices. Thirty minutes on, love enters the\nnarrative and the overall edge wilts. Movie turns romantic, then\npreachy. Rom com, at least in this movie, does not equate to razor\nhoned satire. The story gets mushy. For zombie gourmands, very few\nunhappy meals.\n"
"\nA zombie horror-drama-romance? Really? Sounds cool. Was it? In all\nhonesty, I didn't believe it could become my favorite movie of 2013,\nbut it did. The scenes, the sets, the dialogue, the acting, the plot\n(it actually had a Romeo and Juliet plot with highly spiritual themes),\nthe truly frightening scenes....Brilliant...Still, no matter how well\nmade, the movie was over the top great not because of all the reasons\nlisted, but because of the score. The music was perfect, blended into\nevery scene, and was truly meaningful. Zombies communicating their\nfeelings to living humans through old records was brilliant, and the\nrest of the score amazingly relevant at every scene. This was the final\npiece of the puzzle that planted this movie in my mind enough to watch\nit over and over. The Hollywood elite will never give it the credit it\ndeserves, but it was better than any of the Golden Globe winners.\n"
"\nI am a big fan of zombie movies. This was a cute movie, however a bit\nslow, the romance between the two heroes of the movie was dragged out\ntoo long and made the movie a bit slow and kind of boring. I think they\nshould have shortened the scenes on the plane where the Zombie R is\nliving and added in a little bit more action. However,there were some\nexciting parts where they are battling the zombies. Funny parts too\nwhich are cute. I think it may have also needed a bit more history of\nthe characters. The parts with John Malkovich were really good, because\nJohn Malkovich is just awesome. Nice movie to rent on a Saturday night,\nbut not in the same league with Resident Evil zombie movies. However,\nthis movie is a bit more heartwarming rather than bleak, there is hope\nfor the zombies.\n"
"\nYou have to decide. You can chose to be someone better than who you\nare, or you can give up and be a walking corpse. You can either help,\nor stand in the way. These are the core ideas Warm Bodies is built\naround.<br><br>Personally, I love extended metaphors, all the better when they're\nwritten as a comedy/horror. <br><br>If you've read this far, you know what the movie is about. What I want\nto tell you is how good the performances are and tell you that when the\nzombies don't live up to the rules they laid out, that it ties back to\nthat central theme. <br><br>If you watch this -- I hope you do -- remember that this is the first\nzombie film that isn't a statement about consumerism or retribution for\neverything humanity has gotten wrong, rather it's a film that says we\nhave within us the ability to change the world even after the\napocalypse.\n"
"\nThis is the craziest zombie movie of them all. First just forget\neverything you think you know about zombies because this movie throws\nall that out the door. R is a zombie that can think and he eats the\nbrains of Julie's boyfriend, hence getting all his memories, that's one\nof the new zombie twist. So when R has a chance to attack Julie, he\nrecognizes her and begins talking and gets her to safety. How is this\npossible? Well it seems the zombies are coming back to life, of course\nthis is never explained. They are the walking dead, but come back to\nlife, really far fetched. Of course, Julie's dad doesn't understand the\nblossoming love between her and R, but it's easy for her friend to\naccept. And the bad guys in this are the bonies. Zombies that have\nripped all their flesh off and look like skeletons.<br><br>FINAL VERDICT: This movie makes up a lot of new rules about zombies.\nThe plot is too much to take, skip it.\n"
"\nTo begin with ...<br><br>It is the craziest idea, to cure zombies with love, but well hats-off\nto the team to make it believable, everyone, from director to actors\ndid their job nicely.<br><br>Story - Its crazy, refreshing and adorable.<br><br>Acting - Nice, everybody is almost good.<br><br>Direction - Amazing, it wasn't slow, and didn't miss out any front\n(emotional or thrill) you may not like it only if you think love is\nlame.<br><br>Verdict - Its a movie wroth watching, and can be enjoyed with everyone\n(not with kids of course), well i loved it!!\n"
"\nwhen i first heard about the movie through friends and the internet i\nwas thinking \"Oh no,just not another twilight movie and zombies it\ndoesn't even make sense HE IS A ZOMBIE!!\" and as a big zombie fan i was\ninsulted by the idea even<br><br>me and my friends decided to watch it as a joke just to pass the time\nby and 10 minutes after the movie started we all had the same\nexpression on her faces for misjudging a movie so good before even\nwatching it<br><br>great movie watch it don't listen to people who didn't even watch it<br><br>fucnny a lot of wit great fun<br><br>AND STILL ABTEER LOVE STORY THAN TWILIGHT :S\n"
"\nI have heard about dozens of zombie movies, but I am not eager to watch\nthem as I prefer evil being purposeful, not doing harm involuntarily or\nfor plain survival. But I heard lots of good words concerning Warm\nBodies and I watched it today... Well, better than expected. Although\nthe plot is not smooth and has some logical caps, the presence of\ndiverse zombies, inclusion of boneys, use of varied music, and some\nfine acting (particularly Nicholas Hoult as R - Hoult should obtain\nmore praise for this role - and John Malkovich as Colonel Grigio -\nwell, Malkovich is always pleasant to follow). The idea beyond is nice\nas well, the ending is expected, but warmhearted; a twist could have\nbeen included, however.<br><br>All in all, the 1,5 hours pass without blah! feelings, and Hoult's\nfacial appearance and expressions are something not to be missed.\n"
"\nFirst off, Warm Bodies is a wonderful movie. Well made, great acting,\ngreat scenery, hilarious dialogue, and a lot of heart. Second, it\nintroduces a new concept into the zombie genre: What if by interacting\nwith humans, corpses could somehow turn back human?<br><br>This is the story of R, a young zombie who meets a human girl and feels\nthe need to protect her. The more time they spend together, R develops\nmore emotions, thoughts, dreams, and ability to speak.<br><br>I highly recommend this movie. I'd be going out on a limb, but I'd say\nthis is the best zombie movie I have seen. Sure, I enjoy the\ntraditional zombie stuff. But as all other zombie movies follow the\nsame trend, this is a nice change of pace.<br><br>I was skeptical of the PG-13 rating, but less blood and gore does not\ntake anything away from this movie. It's perfect the way it is. 10/10\n"
"\nWell I watched this film about a month ago, and it's interesting how it\nshows you how the zombies feel and not the humans for a change. It's a\nlove story combined with a horror comedy, it's different funny and you\nreally should watch it if you haven't already! It's good that they\nstill eat humans, but they also still have feelings, and I really liked\nthe idea of a zombie eating a human brain and then they could see the\nmemory's and everything that person has been through. It's a great\nstoryline with good makeup, and you can tell the director has put lots\nof effort into this film. I would rate it 9 out of 10 because of the\nstoryline, and the acting is good too.\n"
"\nI was kind of thinking about leaving my seat after the first 5 minutes\nwhen I saw John Mlakovich name ... \"Malkovich won't do s..\" So I\ndecided to wait and now I can tell you that i do not regret been\nwatching until the end !<br><br>For once, the zombie story is different, it's not the traditional alert\nand kill them all..now we have a sweet story with a message\nbehind...well hope you are at least open mind to find out the message\nand understand it.<br><br>Sure this is not the dirty comic style but it full of ironies and\nhumor. I felt relax and happy after the movie. I give a 8\n"
"\nThis movie is pretty good, would probably not watch it again but it's a\ngood one view, time filler kind of movie. The story is okay, I guess\nthe moral of the story is that anyone can be redeemed from an evil\npast. Some of the acting is pretty inconsistent. I was just expecting\nmore comedy and maybe better acting. I think the overall story is\npretty good and the 3 or 4 times there was a funny part, it was REALLY\nfunny. I think the trailers make it seem a little more hilarious than\nit actually is. And the trailers are cut in a way that are not accurate\nin the movie. The best part of the movie is the guy who plays Marcus.\nPretty hilarious and one of the few with consistent acting in his\nprogression from zombie to.... you will see :)\n"
"\nTo keep it short:I love this movie. The reference to our zombie-like\nsociety makes this comedy deeper than you'd like to think at first. The\nsoundtrack is great. The plot is simple, but it's touching. It makes me\nthink about whether or not we can change, as human beings. I have lived\na zombie-like life myself, and I don't think I am the only one. Losing\ncontact with my body, my feelings. So to me, this movie is about Waking\nUp, and it serves a much greater purpose. So goddamn good it's a funny\nand somewhat ironic movie as well. The main characters do a good job.\nThe only downside I can think of is that the movie seems too \"filtered\"\nsometimes. It would be good to see everyone looking more real. But it\ndoesn't kill the overall impression. Check it out.\n"
"\nThis is something different, a zombie movie but a Romantic Comedy at\nthat, and a movie where it for most parts take the Zombie side, shows\nwhat he/they think and do and how they live.<br><br>The genre being comedy might be a bit off, yes it has humor and funny\nmoments, but it is mostly small laughs not big ones, and there is many\nmoments where it is more in drama mode and maybe even action mode, well\nmaybe comedy suits it all right.<br><br>This is a new good twist on the genre, there are good performances by\nall the actors, especially the main characters R played by Nicholas\nHoult and Julie played by Teresa Palmer do a very nice job, but also\nthe side characters have great personalities and characteristics.\n"
"\nThe movie uses forbidden love between two persons who present two\ncompletely different worlds which is not a new method but love with\nzombie, that is insane ! Recently, ghosts, vampires, and beasts have\nbeen noticeable as wonderful lovers in chick flicks. Nobody would think\nzombie would stand out (or fit in) as such sweet, attentive, WARM\nlover. Zombies in Warm Bodies are far from their relatives in The\nWalking Dead which people have been familiar with. Zombie R aka the\nnarrator, for example, is a very good-looking, insightful, lovable\nbrain-eating creature. The horror and romantic implements tremendously\nparallel throughout the movie. The love story of R and Julie is very\ninteresting. The movie is funny and cute, not a bash of romance but\nfull of optimism and actually clever. Teenagers swoon over Twilight,\nyou should watch this !\n"
"\nA weird combination of romantic drama and zombie apocalypse movie, Warm\nBodies certainly covers new ground. It wasn't a great movie and the\nplot certainly has some elements that leave you scratching your head\nand/or make you sick. Still, it succeeds in being funny at times and\nemotional at others.<br><br>The story is told from the point of view of a zombie. His inner\nmonologue is pretty hilarious. He can't speak, or do much of anything\nbesides shamble around and eat brains, but it's like he has this\nlonging for something greater. Then he manages to fall in love with a\nhuman being.<br><br>Squick? Well, there is no necrophilia here, though it's sort of implied\nby the story. The romance is actually pretty romantic, though that\nmight sound strange.<br><br>The bad guy is the girl's dad, played by John Malkovich with a\nveteran's stoic confidence. He doesn't approve. We get a Romeo &amp; Juliet\nstory.<br><br>Still, it's a B-movie with poor action sequences and some stuff that\ngot thrown in when it should've been cut.\n"
"\nRomantic comedies are particularly difficult to reinvent. They are\ntypically a formula of \"boy meets girl, boy looses girl, boy wins girl\"\nwith some variations. There is usually another romantic interest. \"Warm\nBodies\" adds a totally unique and fresh twist to the formula. Boy meets\ngirl, but he's a zombie.<br><br>This movie is very much based on Shakespeare's \"Romeo and Juliet\".\nInstead of the Montagues and Capulets it's the living and the zombies.\nThere are many more subtleties that reference Romeo and Juliet.<br><br>The music in the movie is incredible! It is used very effectively.<br><br>There are also several scenes that are far more artistically filmed\nthan one would expect in a romantic comedy. <br><br>Before seeing it, my teenage son was very critical of a romantic comedy\nzombie movie. He found it to be nearly as enjoyable as I did. It is a\nfeel good fun movie. It is well worth seeing. <br><br>I should note that I gave it a \"10\" rating because it currently is\nbelow 7 on IMDb (which it shouldn't be). In my opinion it should be in\nthe upper 7's or low 8's.\n"
"\nits an interesting re-take on the classic romeo and Juliette. Did\nanyone notice the similarity? R-Romeo Julie-Juliet. Two enemy clans..\nhumans n the zombies.. nice one though..

"\nWhile this is above the Revenant level of humor/horror (conceived as\nPG-13 mind you), it still is unable to reach the heights of a movie\ncalled Deadhead. Still if you are looking for a romantic zombie comedy\nand you have already watched the \"Deadhead\" movie (which also includes\nthe \"road movie\" aspect), than there aren't that many movies to chose\nfrom anyway.<br><br>The lead actor is good and his \"side-kick\" is pretty funny too. Our\nfemale lead is as beautiful as it gets and while not all of her\ndecisions seem rational, this still is a movie and shouldn't be\nmeasured to hard on that front. The internal logic is working and the\nmovies pace is good enough. Of course it is predictable, but that\ndoesn't mean you can't have fun with it\n"
"\nI felt that this movie was a great movie, it had parts that didn't make\nsense to us as people who know what a zombie is or does. As you watch\nit you slowly your mind starts to accept whats going on and you find\nyourself encouraging \"R\" silently. You want him to succeed. I found\nmyself in certain points nodding my head in approval of the things that\nwere going on and hoping for a full change, Willing him to not\n\"relapse\" into zombie mode. This isn't the walking dead. Know that\nbefore you go and see it. walk in with an open mind and you wont be\ndisappointed. To the cast of this movie. Great Job! Bravo. I love this\nmovie and I WILL be buying this movie when it hits stores.\n"
"\nI am surprised at the people on here saying they wanted to walk out of\nthe theatre part way through the movie. I don't know, maybe some folks\nare so used to having someone else do their thinking for them they've\nforgotten how to and this movie does require you to think a little. The\nbasic premise of the movie was pretty clear in the trailers so it\nwasn't to hard to work out what the movie was about really. It makes me\nthink of the parents who took their kids to see Jurassic Park years ago\nand then complained that it was scary, ridiculous. Also I agree with\nprevious posts on here saying if you walked out part way through your\ncomments are not valid, that's like walking into a restaurant, smelling\nthe cooking food then leaving and declaring it inedible.\n"
"\nWhen I first heard about this film it didn't really appeal but a friend\nwatched it and told me how good it was so I gave it a go and I'm really\nglad I did! It's such an original story, a zombie love flick! Who'd\nhave though it? It's not even a spoof, although it does have quite a\nfew funny moments it does actually take itself quite seriously, the\nstory really draws you in and you find yourself actually caring and\nrooting for 'R' (zombie lead character). I've never really been a fan\nof Nicholas Hoult, I guess I still picture him as that annoying little\nkid in About a Boy, but he plays this part really well and comes across\nas (I know this sounds daft) but a really adorable zombie! You can\nkinda compare this to Twilight, there are a few Twilight-esque moments\nin there, Terasa Palmer even looks like a blonde Bella but to be honest\nit's no bad thing and if your a Twilight fan you should give this a go,\nit's just as good if not more so just for its originality!\n"
"\nI like zombie movies with some humor. This had a ton of it. Best zombie\nmovie since Shawn of the dead. The entire cast was fantastic. Palmer is\na doll. Could not keep my eyes off her. Great movie over all. Great new\ndirection for the zombie genre. You should see it. You won't want to\nmiss it. So entertaining. You will laugh. You will cry. I mean it.\nShould not be missed. I need more lines in my review I know. But this\nis all I have to say. Still need more lines. No more to say here. You\ncan stop reading. Just see the movie. I will have to recite something\nif this is not enough. O.k. Four score and seven years ago. Our fore\nfathers brought forth.\n"
"\nI thought it was great, a very sweet touching and gently amusing movie\n- although, at it's (undead) heart this movie is a romance first and\nforemost. There's a bit of 'horror' (that would be the zombies and\ntheir bony frenemies) and a bit of comedy (if you count the deadpan -\nno pun - monologues from R and a few nice one liners from M) but\nthere's a whole lot more romance. I think many viewers mistook the\nmovie to be more horror/comic than it actually aspired to be.<br><br>I really enjoyed it - because I'm one of those people with a guilty\npleasure that is romantic comedy - and found the lead actors very\nconvincing. R's self musings were wonderfully written and I also liked\nthat Julie wasn't the kind of girl that inevitably falls over, while\nwearing underclothes, during a chase scene or screamed every 5 minutes\nfor no discernible reason. Overall is it clichéd? Sure - but who cares?\nIt was a cool take on an old theme, with a couple of chuckles and nice\nundead makeups thrown in.\n"
"\nWarm bodies is now one of the best movies I've seen this year. The idea\nwas great. In all other zombie movies, it's always about how zombies\nare disgusting and for the amount of blood you see. But in this one,\nthe zombies, they hate their life, they want to change back. At first,\nI wasn't to sure about always hearing R (Nicolas Hoult) speaking to\nhimself, but as the movie continued, I thought is was very interesting\nidea and that was the comedic aspect of the movie.<br><br>I am a big action-horror-comedy movies fan, so I adored this movie. You\nlaugh, there is the horror part when the zombies attack the group in\nthe pharmacy and of course the action part during the movie.<br><br>So I advise you all to watch this movie, it is so good.\n"
"\nNot a great zombie movie.A type of unusual kind of movie you could\nwatch it just one time. plot-The plot was not well designed.keep some\nzombies keep some humans make some romance .This was the whole idea of\nthe movie.The movie was not at all scary.of course you would find the\nboonies(zombies who have eaten their own skin)look good.It is also not\ngood in comedy . All you get is a new subject of a zombie romancing\nwith human.The most negative of all is every thing was going very\neasily and fast like a zombie entering a human territory,zombies\nconverting into human in just one night. The cast was also OK It just\nonly can be a time pass,nothing else.\n"
"\nOf course, I was expecting it to be just like any other zombie movies\nand didn't have much expectation.<br><br>But 5 minutes into the movie, well, might be less than 5 minutes, I can\ntell that this is not about the zombies. I couldn't really understand\nthe people who are so focused on all that was wrong with the zombies.\nTo me, it is obviously not the point of the story.<br><br>If you look passed the zombies, you can see that it's a story about us,\nhuman. The world that we live in right now, it's kind of like that. You\ncan expect comedy, romance, suspense and some 'cheese' :) but it's\nforgivable.\n"
"\nSo I listened to acacia-ash23 and was disillusioned. I wasn't taken on\na journey, just the airport and a plane and some halls and 2 houses.I\nthink there wasn't a story to be told. Nothing in the film stuck with\nme. I was disappointed 'cause the trailer looked good, but the script\nwas so far off from what I imagined it to be. Hmm, I also disliked\n50/50 because the girlfriend seemed unrealistic, and the humour wasn't\nmy style, and I found Kyle to be another stock character. So some\nsimilarities there, and 50/50 also did really well and spoke to the\nmajority. I wouldn't compare this movie to the Twilight series; I loved\nevery minute of that dermo.\n"
"\nFirst thing to note is that I hate love movies, so it seems strange I\nwas watching this. It was because of my current Dave Franco movie\nmarathon, okay? So blah blah blah blah blah I watched this and DANG it\nwas good! This film actually has some positive messages for people\nhaving problems with life and stuff, as by the end of the film, R\nchanges back into a human and stays with Julie. The comedy tone\nbalanced with zombies, action and romance was also very well done by\nJonathan Levine (The director). It's still sweet enough to be a love\nmovie, scary enough to be a zombie movie, hilarious enough to be a\ncomedy, and exciting enough to be an action flick-like film XD.\n"
"\nI thought this film with Nicholas Hoult in this was really good. Jaysus\nhe really can do a killer American accent that no other British actor\ncan do perfectly!! I felt like the zombies in this really do represent\nthe ones that you see on action video games or action movies. However,\nthere's not much blood or gore in this like yeah its suppose to be a\nromantic horror movie but there is very little. All you can see is\nHoult's character eating his love interest's boyfriends brain but\nthat's pretty much it like!<br><br>Its a pretty good movie, not my favorite or would consider it the best,\nbut its grand to watch when you have time to kill! Happy Halloween\nfolks!\n"
"\nWarm Bodies was, without question, one of those infuriating\n\"zombie-turned-love-story\" movies that only excelled in earning my\ncomplete contempt for it and all of its utter preposterousness.<br><br>If you ask me - Warm Bodies was so brain-dead and moronic (on all\ncounts) that it only ended up completely disgracing the movie sub-genre\nof zombies like no other picture I've ever seen before, or since.<br><br>And, as far as zombie movies go - Warm Bodies contained so many glaring\nflaws and equally cringe-worthy moments that, at this point, I don't\nknow where the heck to start voicing and venting my total disgust for\nthis reeking heap of idiotic asininity.<br><br>So, in conclusion - I will bring my angry commentary to its abrupt end\nby simply saying that I sure hope that this sort of\n\"zombie-turned-love-story\" movie isn't going to become the latest\ntrend.<br><br>Sheesh! Spare me that ultimate torture!\n"
"\nEver wonder what would happen if Cameron Crowe and George Romero made a\nmovie together? No, me either. But I'm guessing it would look something\nlike 'Warm Bodies', a romantic dramedy about a young zombie who falls\nin love with a beautiful human survivor and begins to regain his own\nhumanity.<br><br>Just when you think the zombie genre is played out and then some, along\ncomes this unique take. That's not to say I liked it, because in the\nend I didn't, but I do appreciate the attempt at something different.\nThe movie has a whole host of problems, but the biggest may be that it\nnever finds a sure footing and solid balance between its disparate\ntones and genres.\n"
"\nTeresa Palmer is gorgeous. Anyway...<br><br>I was hesitant to watch this movie because it had to do with 'Zombies'\nand I typically hate anything to do with them. Boy was I wrong about\nthis movie. It started out slow but just kept getting better and\nbetter, which is something I love in a movie. The characters were very\ninteresting from the get-go and the plot-line was intriguing also. I\njust went through the whole movie with this thought like 'This movie\nisn't going to be much good', and it just kept proving me wrong at\nevery turn. The acting is great, effects are great, atmosphere is\ngreat. Teresa Palmer is gorgeous.<br><br>So by the end I found myself thinking, 'what did I just see?'. One of\nthe best movies of the it's year is what I saw. I would recommend this\nmovie to anyone of any age. It's just great.<br><br>Also did I mention Teresa Palmer is gorgeous? Yep.\n"
"\nI have seen just about every Zombie and Vampire film and series out\nthere and found this particular twist to be quite entertaining.<br><br>From the first internal monologue I was drawn into the story.<br><br>It is an entirely different and delightful film that is devoid of\nstupid frustrating moments.<br><br>It has a few predictable parts but the overall staging and emotional\ninvestment that is massaged by the film sure seem to make those issues\nirrelevant as one waits for the continuance of the warm charm that this\nfilm offers.<br><br>I particularly liked the sub themes of friendship, love and loyalty\nthat are comedically weaved into the tapestry of this movie.\n"
"\nBelieve it or not, this is one of the best movies of 2013(seriously).\nIt's funny, very clever, has a completely new (and refreshing) twist on\nthe zombie genre and is just plain fun. The story is narrated in a very\ncharming, light hearted way and the film is better for it. As far as\nteenage based movies go, this is probably the best one I've seen since\nThe Hunger Games. I went into this expecting to dislike it (the history\nof teenage based romance films is obviously not great), but ended up\nloving it as the film hit all the right notes for me and was a pleasant\nsurprise. Make time for this one, you won't regret it!<br><br>Enjoyed my review? Keep in touch! <br><br>Blog: www.themoviesnob.ca <br><br>Twitter: @the_movie_snob\n"
"\nThis is a good movie. It's fun to watch and has a good ending. It is\ntaken from the Zombies's point of view (given a zombie could have a\npoint of view).<br><br>It could be considered a zombie love-comedy. This particular zombie has\nthe ability to reason and through his dialogue with himself, his\nfeelings about his situation are revealed.<br><br>Whatever made these people zombies in the first place didn't entirely\nkill off their ability to think hence his ability to desire. He, during\nhis search for food (humans that are still living)sees a beautiful girl\nwhich stirs the desire for what eventually becomes love.<br><br>His desire and feelings for the girl cause his heart to start beating\nagain bringing him back to life. As the movie progresses, he little by\nlittle becomes more human.<br><br>Of course there is more to the movie than that, and in the end it turns\nout to be a an enjoyable movie.\n"
"\nHighly original zombie movie. Possibly the most original since the\nfirst ever zombie movie. A zombie-romantic-comedy, if you like, which\nshows how original it is as I doubt any other movie has been described\nas that.<br><br>Very interesting, quirky plot. Starts intriguingly and gathers momentum\nas it goes. Has a few periods when it becomes a bit of a mundane chase\nand/or action sequences, but these are short. Plot isn't entirely\nwatertight either, but, considering the science-fiction nature and\nquirkiness of the movie, it can be forgiven for erring on the side of\nentertainment over flawless plot.<br><br>Has some funny moments too. The whole premise of the movie is quite\nfunny, in fact.<br><br>Ending is quite sweet and profound.<br><br>Good performances from Nicholas Hoult and Teresa Palmer in the lead\nroles. Solid support from John Malkovich, Rob Corddry and Analeigh\nTipton.\n"
"\nTo be honest I wasn't expecting much from this film given how the\nstoryline read on the cover, I didn't really believe it would be my my\nkind of thing, but being a fan of zombie movies in general I thought I\nwould give it a go. It turned out to be a great movie, a great watch\nand very enjoyable from start to finish, not what I expected from\nzombie but still great. It was very funny in places with an odd and\nvery dark humour, also scary and quite jumpy from time to time, and it\nhas to be said the strangest storyline ever. I love the way it gave an\nalternative view on zombies, giving them personalty. The character R\nwas played extremely well by Nicholas Hoult, you just love him from the\nstart and root for him until the end, brain munching and all! Highly\nrecommended, and a must see!\n"
"\nThe charming elements and the fact that I'm a zombie addict held my\ninterest but, in the end, this was silly. Even those weirdos who think\nThe Walking Dead is a training film would say \"Ahhhh....no.\"<br><br>The voice overs were very good. Funny. <br><br>Yes, I know that it's a zombie movie. It's silly to begin with. But the\nstory elements were that much more silly. <br><br>Well dressed and coiffed post-apocalyptic teens? One little bit of\nzombie scuz on her cheek and the other's don't smell her? Eating brains\nabsorbs memories? And yes. Love cures anything. <br><br>It all ended up as a suburban teen-girl fantasy.\n"
"\nLet me just say that I typically don't like \"zom-coms\" for the simple\nreason that most of them just aren't that funny. Additionally, the idea\nof a romance between a person and a zombie fills me with revulsion.\nHaving said that, I fully expected to be bored to tears or completely\ndisgusted with this particular film. I was pleasantly surprised.\nEssentially, \"R\" (Nicholas Hoult) is a zombie who ambles along--day in\nand day outdoing what zombies typically do. Then one day he and a\nnumber of other zombies stumble upon a group of humans and while he is\nchowing down on one happens to see a beautiful woman named \"Julie\"\n(Teresa Palmer) who is surrounded and totally vulnerable. This strikes\na strange impulse in his brain to protect her and lead her to a safe\nlocation. What follows is a story that is both funny and cute without\ngetting too morbid or syrupy. Be that as it may, judging from some of\nthe other reviews my opinion is not shared by everybody. To each his\nown. In any case, I didn't think this film was too bad and I rate it as\nslightly above average.\n"
"\nNot exactly filmography surplus, but don't look for it. Behind easy-to-\nget humor and strange mix of zombies, romance and few \"horror\"\nelements, there is quite a heartwarming message. If you haven't seen\nthis movie jet, you will understand my comment after seeing it. If\nyou've already watched, than you probably got opinion of your own.<br><br>This is one of those movies that sums up all we (mankind) have become.\nOn one side zombies or even \"bonies\", on other side hasty \"problem\nsolvers\".<br><br>Warm Bodies has nothing to do with 'Twilight' (found some comparing of\ntwo) and it is quite unique in its genre. This is not just a love story\nabout two different worlds colliding in rather unusual way, but a story\nabout something, that resembles world we live in.<br><br>Lovely story, worth of watching, unusual in concept of love with easy\nto get message for all.\n"
"\nI got interested in watching this movie because of the accidental\ntrailer playing after I watched another movie trailer. The trailer was\nfunnily inviting, I was gonna watched Hurt Locker but then I decided to\ntry this instead. It was interesting, very different from other zombie\nmovies. First few minutes was interesting, it's funny (or rather\ntragic) to be hearing zombie's thoughts. I have to admit the first half\nhour after the first ten minutes of the movie was kinda slow paced and\nI was starting to dozed off but I was so curious with the ending of the\nmovie so I kept watching. A very refreshing break from the gory zombies\non the Walking Dead. Going to recommend this to friends for sure!\n"
"\nThis is going to be a very short review.<br><br>This film was excellent i thought. I seen it advertised and thought it\nwould be a refreshing twist on the zombie genre of film and it was.<br><br>It was very entertaining from start to finish and i felt actually sorry\nfor the corpses in the film at times. (when you watch it you will\nunderstand). <br><br>The film delivered on all levels and i would definitely watch it over\nand over again. Highly recommend this film if you want easy viewing and\nto be entertained throughout. <br><br>*********\n"
"\nAfter watching this movie I was keen to log on to IMDb to write up my\nreview but now that I have seen so many reviews on here that basically\ncover most of what I wanted to say, I'll try and keep it brief. My\nexpectation was not high as I don't particularly like the lead actor\nNicholas Hoult, however a wry smile appeared on my face within a moment\nor two of the movie starting. Zombie movies are ten a penny and we all\npretty much know what to expect. This is a little off the beaten track\nand it doesn't take very long to work out it's direction, however I\nfound that this didn't distract me from the movie and settled in nicely\nto see how it would progress. No spoilers here but suffice to say\nmovies are all about entertainment and this one entertained me\nthoroughly. I enjoyed this immensely, while some of the special effects\ncould have been better, the direction was thoughtful and visuals not\noverly dark. For an offbeat zombie this is a watcher even if you don't\nwish to own it. Miss is and miss out!.\n"
"\nWhen i first heard about this film my immediate thoughts were: \"Oh no,\nnot another zombie-apocalypse film!\" and \"My god, there's not even a\nreal Hollywood-star attached to this film. How will this ever work?\"\nWhen i heard it would be a love story i became even more skeptical. So\nnaturally, I had very low expectations of this film. It was however,\nquite funny and genuinely entertaining to me. This doesn't make it a\ngood movie. It is filled with clichés and does feel a little\npredictable (especially towards the ending). There are a few references\nto different films or stories, notably one to Romeo and Juliet. This is\nthe kind of movie that will not win any prices, nor does it deserve\nany, but that is excellent to fill an empty afternoon or evening. This\nis for a large part due to it's rather creative premise, a zombie\nlove-story. All the other things in the movie were on par, but none\nclearly excelled. Lesson learned, zombie-love stories can work...\n"
"\nOkay. Just finished Warm Bodies. It wasn't until the balcony scene that\nwe really put it together. And even all the scenes before actually got\nWAY better in our minds immediately. So, Julie (Juliet), R (Romeo), and\nhis best friend, M (Mercutio). We get it. That actually made it better\nbecause at first, we weren't lovin' it. But now, I can give it at least\n3 stars and even 4 for that connection and the performances of ALL (did\nI mention John Malkovich???). So a good, solid 4 for Netflix and 7 or 8\non IMDb. Too much time on my hands? Well, yes, but so what? AND THE\nSOUNDTRACK, ROCKED 80s - Cory Hart, GnR, Roy Orbison, Bob Dylan and\nsome Indie stuff. Just watch it already.\n"
"\nWhen my girlfriend put this movie on, I expected something cliché and\nboring like Twilight, but I have to say that I was rather impressed.<br><br>I like how much comedy they managed to push into the movie and for me\nmade it worth watching.<br><br>Of course, there was some cliché moments but still, the movie was\nunique in it's own way and didn't bore me one bit.<br><br>This is actually quite the achievement in my opinion since most movies\nhave moments that makes me want to go asleep instead of watching the\nrest.<br><br>Good job!\n"
"\nThis movie you must have seen! And when you watch the movie you begin\ntoo love the zombie! A must see for all comedy, romance and horror\nfans! SPOILER! You just see at the begin that the zombie walks around,\nand the most people just think \"OH this movie gonna be bored\". But\nafter 10 minutes you can't stop Watching! SPOILER ENDED! And what this\nmovie do fantastic are the actors and actress! You have Nicholas Hoult\nas A, He plays fantastic. You have Teresa Palmer as Julie. Teresa and\nNicholas are perfect together in this movie. So go and watch this\nmovie! :)<br><br>Vanessa B.\n"
"\nNo spoilers here so don't worry.<br><br>So I began watching this film with the intent of just making fun of it\nand laughing AT what was going on rather than WITH the intended jokes.\nBecause to be honest, a ZOMBIE ROMANCE FILM? C'mon. Zombies are\nprobably the least romantic and attractive of the supernatural\ncategory. But man, was I surprised.<br><br>From the first moment, I was completely invested in the fate of the\nmain character because of his dry, awkward sense of humour. I only\nrealised after a while that he's played by Nicholas Hoult, i.e., the\nBeast from X Men: First Class.<br><br>And sure, the basic plot of the film is a bit predictable but by the\ntime the viewers reach that point, they honestly wouldn't care or would\ncompletely agree.<br><br>This film promises to make you laugh and fulfill your wish of a romance\ngenre too in a high school teen romance between a pretty girl with an\noverprotective father and an awkward social outcast who just HAPPENS to\nbe a zombie in an apocalyptic scenario.<br><br>I'd give it a 7/10 overall and I suggest you all watch it!\n"
"\nFunny, I was going to watch \"Cloud Atlas\" as a \"transformational\" movie\nand then watch this as entertainment. I decided to go straight to the\nentertainment and I think it had a great and healing message and I had\nfun too! I love seeing Nick Hoult! He did a great job! Even John\nMalkovich seemed normal-ish!It's a romance so it is a movie about love\nand unconditional love and going for it with your heart, even when you\ndon't one! I liked that the CG stuff wasn't overdone so the movie had\nan organic feel. This added to the realism in the movie. SO many movies\nnow days don't integrate their CG well and it ends up looking cartoon\nlike where it should not. All in all, a very enjoyable movie!\n"
"\nI suppose that's the best way for me to describe this movie. Don't get\nme wrong, it's definitely a good movie. But it's cute, too, which is a\ngood thing because that's the point.<br><br>Zombie boy sees girl w hearts in his eyes, kills her boyfriend, eats\nhis brain, sees his memories, and falls even more for the girl.<br><br>Speaking of the girl, it's pretty interesting that the lead that was\nchosen is one who looks like an attractive version of Twilight's\nKristen Stewart. That can't have been an accident.<br><br>This is one of those movies that is an off-the-shelf date movie, or one\nto just enjoy on your own if you like zombies. I'm not interested in\nHollywood pushing Nicholas Hoult down our throats (ugh, Jack, anyone)\nbut he was good in this movie.\n"
"\nThis movie contains booth horror and lots of love, great for couples\nand everyone who has the age required for this movie :)<br><br>The Boy \"R\" meets a lovely girl when she and a \"team\" are looking for\nmedicines for the human camp. People with hearts, zombies and bones\nwhich have been zombies for so long that they can't become human again.\nIf the movie should have been any better I think another actor would\nfit the role as dad in this movie better. The role is well played by\nJohn Malkovich, but not well enough. The movie also have other\nweaknesses as it is too overdone in the way of editing special effects.<br><br>Great movie overall and sometimes touching, I give it therefore 8/10\n"
"\nEven though the acting was good, (I Love Teresa Palmer and John\nMalcovich)this was just a horrible movie in my opinion. Just the\npremise of the movie was awful, Its basically a zombie movie meets\ntwilight, I mean really? I can't believe as many people liked this\nmovie- I couldn't even watch it all the way through, I skipped around\nto see if there was any kind of problem that arises in the plot but it\nwas basically: so a girl real living girl falls in love with a rotten\ndead corpse (and no I'm not talking about Anna Nichole Smith) Do your\nresearch before you think \"Well Teresa Palmer is hot and I like zombie\nmovies\" like I did because chances are you will be HIGHLY disappointed.<br><br>Thanks For Reading.\n"
"\nA quite different take on the zombie theme. On the surface a dumb and\ndumber premise but artfully handled and nice allusions to Zombie lit,\nShakespeare and world politics. This film is often surprisingly\nbeautifully shot with some nicely understated CGI and even more\nunderstated humour (even if occasionally borrowing from Shaun of the\nDead...but who could resist?).<br><br>Not rip roaring laughs but delicate film making meshed with dumb zombie\nhumour in a way that somehow works. Overall premise seems a bit cheesy\nbut supported by the film's metaphor of accepting/understanding others\n... difficult when someone wants your brains.\n"
"\nIts my best Zombie film I've ever seen. Undoubtedly the whole team\nworked hard for the result I guess . I assure again that they are\nsucceeded, my ratings anyway is 7.4.<br><br>Music : The stuff which kept alert and amused and puzzled me is the\nmusic. Nice choice and nice tracks according to feelings and\nexpressions. I will give 8.5 for the music.<br><br>Acting : Nicholas is so hot and damn handsome zombie I admit. He did\ngood. Palmer was looking so cute and sweet here that I wish I could be\nthere. Her stuff was cool. The supporting roles were average. However I\nrate acting 7.5.<br><br>Direction : Better than many other zombie films I've seen. Thanks to\nthe director for reducing violation and brought some sweet thing in\nthis type of film. (7.2)<br><br>Dialogues : Liked it. (7.5)<br><br>Screenings and Scripts : could be better to make it masterpiece. (6.8)<br><br>Story : Well on the air. (7.1)<br><br>I liked the biography of Nicholas also.<br><br>So guys don't miss the Zombie Romance.\n"
"\nI really liked this one. In most zombie movies the zombies are bad and\na representation of evil and have to be cured by some magical potion.\nHere zombies are represented in the beginning as bad but then they\nstart to change by themselves with their will, which is what struck me.\nIt is a movie that shows that change must come from the inside and that\nit is always possible. And also that the strongest changing force is\nlove. The movie's love story is beautiful because it is not pushed,\nunrealistic, and badly paced. At the end, it makes sense that she loves\nhim. The theme of the movie is not shoved in your face. Julie's dad was\nwhat I thought the movie would fail with. I expected him to be stuck\nup, unwilling to accept to the degree of being ridiculous, but he\nwasn't. It was a pleasant surprise as him not understanding went only\nso far and it didn't ruin the movie. I was touched by R's willing to\nchange. Great music, perfect pacing of the story. At times it is a\nlittle predictable but in a good manner because what you expect to\nhappen, must happen. Overall, a very good movie.\n"
"\nyou know what..this isn't an academy award winner, but neither is it\ndisappointing..its just rather nice, and quite fun...and when you see\nthe leads...any decent film watcher will tell you this couple are\nfuture stars...they are lovely in something so silly yet so rather\nsweetly entertaining that i wouldn't dare bother a criticism..i raise a\nglass to two future stars...two very warm and enjoyable bodies\nindeed...you don't need the academy or the split up into\ncinematography, script, plot etc etc etc for this one...just enjoy it\nand shut up...its like watching future potential academy awards in\ntheir infancy...this pair have it...and good luck to them...\n"
"\nWhen I first heard the premise of Warm Bodies, I thought that it could\nbe a serious flop. However, I was pleasantly surprised to find that my\ninitial thoughts were completely wrong. This film has a refreshing plot\nthat is really quite different than anything else I have seen. Not only\nis it quirky and extremely funny it places, but it also carries a great\nmessage of open-mindedness and acceptance. It has a romantic storyline\nthat keeps the viewer rooting for the two lead roles the entire movie,\nwho both happen to have great chemistry together. They keep the romance\nquite lively (hardy har har). Strange as it feels at first, you find\nyourself hoping the zombie gets his girl.I found Warm Bodies to be very\nentertaining, and quite charming.\n"
"\nI didn't have high hopes. Its not that it wasn't an interesting concept\nin the premise but its the low budget \"please don't let this be\ntwilight\" aspect of it. I was surprised at the amount of heart the film\nhad. My first problem with the film is that it had a lot of plot holes.\nMeaning unanswered and in-explainable gaps in logical storytelling.\nHowever, because of the dark comedy mix genre, I didn't take this to\nheart. The film is free minded and is more about personal interactions\nand gestures than dialogue or plot. Although its mostly about the\nhumor, it does take itself a bit seriously at times which works\nsometimes but not every time in execution. It took me until the balcony\nscene to realize what R stands for, so I guess I wasn't looking too\nhard before hand. My main concern was trying to grasp what the\ndifference between the bonies and the corpses were. We never really get\na detailed answer, and that hurt the film for me. Even though I liked\nit overall, I totally can see how someone would outright hate it.\nNicolas Hoult did a good job hope to see him in more projects.\n"
"\n\"What's wrong with me? I just want to connect, why can't I connect with\npeople? Oh, right...it's because I'm dead.\" R (Hoult) is a zombie, a\nvery depressed zombie looking for meaning in his life. After him and a\ngroup out looking for food find a pack of young adults they begin to\nfeast. When R eats someone he sees his memories, then changes his mind\nand saves his girlfriend Julie (Palmer). The two begin a relationship\nthat may change the world forever. This is a very funny movie that just\nseemed to run out of steam a little over halfway through. The movie is\nvery much worth watching and actually turns out very sweet, if not a\nlittle too perfect. The only real problem is that after awhile I\nstarted to lose interest a little and seemed to really drag toward the\nend. I still recommend this movie but it's not as good as Zombieland or\nShaun Of The Dead. Overall, very funny movie but just couldn't maintain\nthe beginning excitement the entire way. I give it a B.\n"
"\nOn the face of it, 'Warm Bodies' is a very interesting film: one part\nzombie-action movie, one part comedy-romance, and one part whimsical\nscience fiction. In practice, it isn't quite as interesting as it\nsounds, because each of three elements is actually quite generic, even\nthough they're cleverly interspersed. Overall, the film has a nice\nmood, although veering heavily towards the sentimental, supported by\nthe kind of folkie soundtrack that seems to be de-rigour in a certain\nsort of movie (in spite of the genre-bending, think 'Garden State' and\nyou won't be too far out). And if it seems strange to summarise a\nzombie flick as pleasant viewing, in this case it's correct call.\n"
"\nNow I'm not usually that type of person who likes watching a lot of\nhorror based films. But this film has definitely outdone itself in my\nopinion. The plot was brilliant and not as cliché as I thought it would\nbe. I actually stumbled upon this movie as my friend suggested it for\nme after I had just watched 10 things I hate about you. It was so\noutstanding and the actors (mostly R and Julie) have done an amazing\njob portraying their characters.. Was teary in some parts when this\nfilm wasn't all that sad so you know that I was really into it\nDefinitely recommend this movie to anyone who's looking to a nice\napproximately 2hr good 'horror' film Mind you it isn't as scary, the\nonly things that look the scariest are the bonies to be honest\n"
"\nThe trailer looked hilarious. The idea of a zombie coming displaying\nsome consciousness and coming back to life. There were so many\nopportunities for laughs and giggles. I was thinking something along\nthe lines of \"Shaun of The Dead\".<br><br>Instead, it turned into a creepy love story. What could be worse than\nseeing a girl kissing a dead zombie guy? I mean, eeewwww!!!!! It was\ndisgusting.<br><br>It's basically a tweaked out version of Twilight, which lost a lot of\nit's laugh factor along the way.<br><br>Not worth the time to watch it.\n"
"\nWarm Bodies <br><br>The best thing about dating a zombie from a woman's perspective is that\nthey don't have any issues with eating you out.<br><br>However, this horror-comedy is told from the male zombie's perspective.<br><br>Uninterested in the afterlife, R (Nicholas Hoult) is more intrigued\nwith girls - one in particular.<br><br>When R and his friends attack Julie (Teresa Palmer) and her boyfriend\n(Dave Franco) - who are on a mission for Julie's father (John\nMalkovich) - R falls in love.<br><br>By ingesting her beau's brain, R's privy to Julie's memories, which he\nuses to woo her.<br><br>But the two are torn apart when both their species are targeted by the\nnext step in zombie evolution.<br><br>An optimist outlook on the zombie apocalypse, Warm Bodies aptly\nbalances satirical comedy with Bard inspired besotting, creating cult\nmovie-like capabilities.<br><br>Incidentally, which body-part would a zombie have to eat to learn how\nto get aroused again? <br><br>Green Light <br><br>vidiotreviews.blogspot.com\n"
"\nDozens of movies &amp; TV shows have been made on zombies where every movie\nhas one single agenda that is survival of the humans. \" Warm bodies \"\nhowever follows a zombies survival and exhume . both lead actors have\njustified their respective roles however at times i was imagining\nKristen Stewart playing the role of Teresa Palmer, no offense to fan\ngirls but they both act very same . from the plot line this may seem\nlike a zombie version of twilight but as it turned out to be it not and\nboy am i glad to say that . i just hope Jonathan Levine feels the same\nway and not planning a sequel or something because that would suck and\nruin a perfect ending . camera work is average but direction and story\ntelling is good , all in all a good flick to watch at night even with\nyour girlfriend.\n"
"\nAt First i thought is this a joke,a romance Zombie movie ? but as i\nwatched it, the movie offered a mix of Horror,Romance &amp; even Comedy.<br><br>I think this paves the way for a new Genre of Zombie movies not\nfocusing on just Horror and action which is about time too!.<br><br>The Movie is great but i think it needed to offer more reasonable\nexplanation to the transformation that took place near the end hence\nthe 9/10 but overall i think most viewers will love it, also since its\nPG-13 it's not too graphic<br><br>Definitely one of my favorites of 2013,an Entertaining title from start\nto finish.\n"
"\nThis movie was awesome! <br><br>Friday night in with popcorn, couple of zombie movies and girlfriend in\ntoe. The first zombie movie I watched I was belly laughing (my choice\nof film) then my girlfriend brought this one, which I thought was going\nto be rubbish, a love story and zombies which can communicate, come on\ngive me a break!!!<br><br>This film is funny, suspenseful, a bit of horror and romance; kept the\ngirlfriend happy ;) <br><br>I didn't really find it scary but I was entertained the whole way\nthrough...<br><br>Great story Great Make-up Great characters<br><br>I would say the audience is for 16 - 25<br><br>Easy watching and enjoyable\n"
"\nI didn't think It was gonna be as good as it was ... looked like a\nZombie version of Twilight actually and i was prepared to be a lil\ncringed ..... (and was trying to figure out how Zombies can actually be\nHot or Unlike Vampires have feelings/ Emotions or have a relationship\nwith someone \"Human\" well after watching shows like Walking Dead and\nResident Evil .. thats all the idea we really get that zombies are <br><br>But was a great Movie and def funny in parts .. I took my 10 yr old\nnephew whos a Walking dead / Zombie fan .. and thought that he wouldn't\nlike it as much as it was touted as a zombie \"romance\" but he loved it\nand said was soo funny !! some classic lines but the cast and wasn't\ntoo scary for kids (but wouldn't take anyone under 10 to it) but still\nhad enough gore for us action fans and the romance was sweet enough to\nbe there but not full on like twilight (like Love declared within 20\nmins of the movie) def recommend plan to see it again too :)\n"
"\nI'm not even going to bother writing a long-winded, over-analyzed,\ndetailed review. I am just ABSOLUTELY IN LOVE with this movie. Go see\nit for yourself, and you'll understand why.<br><br>The only few issues I have with it is that: <br><br>1. When R and Julie were on the airplane and they were listening to\nrecords, it was a tad bit too slow-paced.<br><br>2. Rob Corddry is terrible at being a zombie. He is way too human. <br><br>Since the minimum length for reviews is 10 text lines, I'm gonna fill\nup this space with a poem:<br><br>Loved the movie after seeing it last night,<br><br>still loving it today;<br><br>Will love it tomorrow,<br><br>and the day after that - <br><br>and all the days to come.\n"
"\nI decided to watch this one weekend afternoon because it's received\ndecent reviews and was recommended to me by a co-worker. I was very\ndisappointed. If it wasn't for the last portion of the movie I would\nhave given it a 3/10 but the ending somewhat redeemed it. However, the\nfact remains that the first 3/4 was very boring and cheesy. It felt\nlike they were trying too hard to create something different and funny.\nWhat resulted was not what I had hoped for. There was so much error in\nlogic (what logic there can be in a zombie type movie). It just didn't\nmake any sort of sense. Throughout the movie I kept hoping for it to\nimprove, increase suspense or at least keep me interested.\nUnfortunately, it did not. I would classify this as a B level horror\nfilm meets chick flick. Not something I would recommended unless your\nonly other option is watching something Tyler Perry created.\n"
"\n***may contain spoilers*** When I went to the cinema with my friends I\nkept thinking about how many other things I could be doing at that time\ninstead of going to that ridiculous movie. When the movie started I was\nthinking, \"Brilliant, how long is this movie again?\" But as the movie\nprogressed and I got familiar with the story line I began to enjoy it.\nI was really impressed with what they had done. I loved how it was\nShakespeare related, especially the part when R goes to Julie's\nbalcony(Romeo and Juliet, R and Julie). This is a great romance film\nfor couples and a great suspenseful, horror movie for friends. If you\nare one of those people thinking this movie is lame and not worth your\ntime I would greatly suggest giving this movie a chance. I have heard\nthat the book is much darker and gruesome so I am going to have to find\nthat book! Anyway, great movie, great cast, just a brilliant movie.\n"
"\nFrom the first 10 mins when R put on \"Missing You\"i thought \"Yeah nice\ntouch\" But when he first met Julie in the drug store \"John waite's\nMissing you\" kicked in again but this time had me signing along. Albeit\nfor only a few secs till he was shot.<br><br>But there's so many good songs that play and really suit the movie like\nBruce springsteens \"Hungry heart\"i guess has a double entendre to it.<br><br>For me this \"Heart warming\" movie has one of the best soundtracks for a\nmovie I've heard in many a year..<br><br>I really cant remember a proper movie (Not some high school singalong)\nthat has so many great songs in it. They totally nailed the movie with\n\"Missing you\" and surprised the song hasn't entered the music charts\nfor people who haven't heard it before as its a classic along with Bob\nDylans \"Shelter from the storm\"to name but a few,. This Really is a Fab\nwatch as well. Movie 8/10 Music 10/10\n"
"\nWell, it's my 1st review here and I wish it would be helpful for others\nwho are going to watch this movie. The power of Love can do anything,\neven can make Zombies change and bring them back to life. This is the\nmovie message, I think. I'm not a Zombies fan at all but I really liked\nthis movie. Go watch it and you will really get inspired. I liked the\nmovie story and scenario. May be the actors performance wasn't v.good\nbut you can say that it was satisfying enough. I liked M(Rob Corddry)\nscenes, his performance was really good.<br><br>I thought that I was going to see a movie like Twilight, I think that\nit's totally different, romantic scenes here are not made in an\nexaggerated way like twilight. I liked the sound track of warm bodies v\nmuch as well.\n"
