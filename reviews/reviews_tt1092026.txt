"\nI was on the Irish premier of the movie last Thursday with Simon Pegg\nand Nick Frost showing up and saying few words before the movie . First\nof all, I would like to say great cast especially Sigourney Weaver ,\nJason Bateman and my two mini stars of the movie Bill Hader and Joe Lo\nTruglio as agents Haggard and O'Reilly . The movie its self is very\nfunny and the script well written , the small alien with voice from\nSeth Rogen its very real and well made by CG artists . Obviously the\nchemistry between Frost and Pegg is great like always ( you know what\nI'm saying if you remember Shaun of the dead or Hot Fuzz )Rogen as\nalien is a perfect cast with his IM SMOKING WEED voice and great lines\n. In summary well made , great cast , funny script what else do you\nneed for Friday night . For me seven stars\n"
"\nHoly mother of alien, what an amazing cast. I have never before been\nsurprised by a movie so much. Didn't really know anything about the\nmovie before I've seen it and it turned out to be pretty unique. I mean\na religion-bashing comedy with a couple of geeks, an alien and\nexplosions? Slap me with a donkey beard.<br><br>I bet you will have fun watching this; even if it's not your cup of\ntea, you'll still have a couple of chuckles at the very least. The plot\nis surprisingly good (unlike what you'd expect in a comedy), now add\npro-class acting and an awesome CGI alien with super cute eyes and you\ngot a super fun times guarantee.\n"
"\nI must admit, I laughed throughout this movie. It had every stereotype\nimaginable. Drunken, bigoted red necks, creationists Christians, Sci Fi\nnerds, Men in Black,Sci Fi movie references were in abundance. What\nmade it sophomoric was the profanity. Too much to make it funny for any\none over the age of twelve. As Paul told Ruth when she first learned to\ncurse, you must use it sparingly, and at the right time (to\nparaphrase). Profanity was used too much in this movie. I was not\noffended, but bored by it. It would have been a movie targeted for the\nolder audience if the profanity was used sparingly. I am not shocked or\ntickled by the F bomb or potty humor, or references to gays or penises.\nHowever, the appearance of veteran actors, Sigourney Weaver, Jane\nLynch, Jeffery Tambor and Blythe Danner was a delightful and funny\nsurprise. Seth Grogan was brilliant as Paul. Jason Bateman was\nconvincing as Agent Zoil. The two primary British actors, of whom I had\nnever seen were perfect. All in all, a nice surprise of a movie and a\nhoot in the afternoon.\n"
"\nPaul. The swearing, non-religious, weed-smoking alien. This film is so\nfunny, I have seen it about 10 times and it never gets old. Seth Rogen\nis perfect casting as Paul,and Kristen Wiig fits in great as well.\nSimon Pegg and Nick Frost make complete legends in this as two 'not\ngay' science nerds. I would recommend to all that like a bit of a\nlaugh, and all those who enjoy Simon Pegg/Nick Frost films (Shaun of\nthe dead/Hot Fuzz). Teenagers would love it just as much as adults do\nbecause of it's humour and fab plot line. I wouldn't recommend if you\nare strictly religious as it may appear offensive if you are (due to\nthe religious comments, and swearing).\n"
"\nI was thoroughly impressed with this film, it really did give me a good\nfew laughs and that's rare these days. Simon Pegg and co. have always\nbeen my favourites, I've watched everything else they've been in\ntogether and it's always funny. This was no different either -\nbasically this film is how E.T. should have been.<br><br>I won't spoil anything for anyone as I know it's annoying when that\nhappens, I just really recommend watching it if you fancy watching a\ndecent comedy that isn't like all the rest of the \"comedy\" films that\nhave been out this year. I thought it was great and I've watched it\ntwice since it came out.\n"
"\nAt the beginning does not expect much from this movie, the way it is\nfilmed may displease some people (I personally like). Here in Portugal\nthis movie was unknown to me and some friends of mine. Someone told me\nit was a fun movie and I decided to see this movie at home by accident.\nI was not expecting that was special but after seeing it, I can say\nthat is special to the point of coming here to write a very positive\nreviews. Paul is the alien, friendliest and most fun I've ever seen. It\nis a movie that sees quite well and even after finishing, we are still\nthinking about the scenes and smiling for a while. I'm going back to\nsee him more times for sure. Strongly recommend watching this movie.\n:))))\n"
"\nIt is funnier than I had anticipated. I thought this would be one of\nthose annoying crap humor movies that have no plot, which this kind of\nis except it does have a plot and it is very well executed. <br><br>The characters are likable even the antagonists. And the lines are\nsurprisingly witty. <br><br>Warning: it does have foul language and obvious sexual references and\nit does degrade Christianity but keep in mind it is rated R. <br><br>This movie is not going to change your life but it is good for a few\nlaughs.<br><br>So pick this up for a few laughs and watch with friends and enjoy.\n"
"\nNot only is there intelligent life elsewhere in the universe, there's\nalso wise-cracking life! Simon Pegg and Nick Frost play nerds attending\nComic-Con who then meet a sarcastic alien (voiced by Seth Rogen). A lot\nof the movie pokes fun at Americans' stereotypes of the English, as\nwell as stereotypes of Americans, and also every conspiracy theory.\nProbably the funniest scene is when Kristen Wiig's fundamentalist\nChristian tries to convince the guys of creationism, and then when she\nattempts to curse for the first time. But more than anything, \"Paul\" is\na movie that really knows how to be funny. It's also clever how they\nhave people appear in surprising places, and how they inserted a bunch\nof references to other movies. It's simply a movie that you're sure to\nlike, assuming that you aren't the religious type. A real pleasure.<br><br>Am I the only one who thought that Jane Lynch's character looks like\nthe wife on \"Mister Ed\"?\n"
"\nI loved this movie it was the most totally hilarious Sci Fic movie I\nhave ever seen, the movie wasn't given enough much of a rating though\nwhich sucks. If you love the little bug eyed creatures then this movie\ns for you, from making a man pee himself to being grouped by and agent\nin a costume shop this little guy was the coolest alien I have seen in\na movie ever. There is a lot of alien swearing in the movie so maybe\nnot for little kids but definitely a movie I could watch more then once\njust for the laughs I got from the funny alien parts, its nothing like\nany other alien movie you have seen before. So if your religious and\ndon't like swearing then I suggest you don't watch it, but if you love\naliens and don't mind the language then it is definitely worth renting.\n"
"\nReally rubbish effort from a team that a lot more could have been\nexpected from. The same joke (alien acts just like us!) is constantly\nrepeated to the precise same effect, namely muted half smile turning to\ngroan when you realise that the 4 year olds that the joke can only be\naimed at cannot see the film. The best of the film is when the Pegg and\nFrost are bouncing lines off each other but any of that chemistry is\ncompletely missing when the CGI blob alien on screen and Wiig is an\nempty vessel in this. Sean of the Dead was impeccably written and\nhilarious, Hot Fuzz had some good jokes in it but they seemed badly\nstuck together with chewing gum, and this is just desperate. Could it\nbe that they are not being given enough time to come up with a decent\nscript or could it be that they struck lucky with Sean? Only the next\neffort will tell...\n"
"\nI've seen this a few times now, and it cracks me up every time. My\ntaste in movie genres is quite broad, but I'll admit it tends to lean\nmore towards Sci-fi. My favourite Sci-fi movie is, and probably always\nwill be, Forbidden Planet. That said, my favourite Comedy Sci-Fi is,\nabsolutely, Paul. Even though I know what's coming, I still laugh out\nloud. There's been a long-running dialogue on here about the merits of\nthis movie as regards religion .vs. atheism. This movie is NOT a\nsounding board for that particular debate - if indeed a debate was\nneeded. The story-line seeks to use as one element, the interplay of\nthe two beliefs (non-beliefs?) in relation to the existence of other\nlife forms in the universe. Having said that, I worry that folks are\nputting way too much emphasis on these matters. It's just a very funny\ncomedy film based on a Sci-fi premise ... and I love it! Just read my\nstrap-line.<br><br>There's real life ... and then there's movies!\n"
"\nHuge fan of Nick Frost and Simon Pegg. They make a brilliant duo,\nthey're the Action-Comedy kings, and this film proves it. Brilliant\ncomedy, great voice-dubbing by Seth Rogen, surprisingly great action\nsequences and great original story. The directing was spectacular, the\nwriting was great as well, and everything is handled fantastic. I'm\ndefinitely gonna watch this film again, had a blast with it, and\nbasically anyone who loves comedy can enjoy it. A very humorous look at\nthe mysteries behind Area 51. Greg Mottola really nailed the directing\nhere, truly enjoyed that aspect. Other than that, my only issues with\nthis film is that I wanted a little more background about Nick and\nSimon, and I wanted more background about The Big Guy, she felt kinda\ntoo mysterious and had a bit of an empty personality. Besides that, I\nreally recommend this film, if you love either Nick and Simon or just a\nfan of Comedy- check it out.\n"
"\nThis movie was fun and interesting. But it contains an odd, ham fisted\nattempted slam against Christianity that makes little sense. Upon the\nsight of an alien, a conservative Christian woman abruptly turns\nathiest. I'm a Christian. I've also learned all about the facts of\nevolution at the Christian schools I attended. Just about every\nChristian I know thinks that the vastness of space inevitably contains\nextraterrestrial life. This is not at all incompatible with faith. It\nwould have made just as much since if she had turned athiest on the\nsight of a vacuum or cheeseburger. I'm not sure why the writers of this\nmovie thought that Christians would lose faith upon encountering\nextraterrestrial life. It comes across as forced and ignorant. It's an\notherwise fine film. In fact, you are more likely to find a green pot\nsmoking alien that has the voice of Seth Rogen than a Christian who\nloses her faith due to the discovery of alien life.\n"
"\nTwo British geeks go on a tour of UFO hot spots in the States after\nvisiting Comic Con in San Diego (and getting to meet - *gasp* Adam\nShadowchild!) and on the way, stumble upon a snarky, sarcastic and\npotty-mouth alien named Paul, who takes them on the ride of their lives\nin his journey to go back home after 60 years.<br><br>\"Paul\" is hilarious. But it's not the type of comedy that's for\neveryone - if you enjoy stoner comedy mixed in with geeky awkward nerdy\nhumour, then you will enjoy this. There is a lot of swearing and\nvulgarity, and it's certainly not an intelligent movie, but as I said -\nit's fun.<br><br>There are a few surprising heartwarming moments too, which I won't\nmention here for spoilers. But along with pure unadulterated silliness,\nthis movie is ultimately about friendship. Bonds that can form\nregardless of species and regardless of home planet.<br><br>I thought this would movie would be a dud, but it did not disappoint.\nDefinitely an amusing movie all around.\n"
"\nI happened to have came across this movie last night on Film 4 and I\ndecided to check it out. The film follows two British Sci-Fi nerds who\ncome across an alien named Paul(voiced by Seth Rogen)who is on the run\nand is looking for his way home(like E.T). So they help Paul out and\nteam up with another co-pilot who happens to be blind(played by Kristen\nWigg)and together they try and help Paul out as a FBI agent(played by\nJason Bateman) is after him.<br><br>Overall I found this film funny. The special effects on Paul is very\ngood as it looks so real looking(as Paul is CGI). The acting was great\nas both Simon Pegg and Nick Frost worked on this film and have starred\nin numerous films before like Hot Fuzz or Shawn Of The Dead.And the\nrest of it was funny too. Keep an eye out for Jane Lynch,Tangled's\nJeffrey Tambor and The Lucky One's Blythn Danner(as the woman who first\nseen Paul years ago).\n"
"\nThis film is one of my favorite comedies of all time. Not just by the\nfact that it's hilarious as hell, but because of they successfully\nmanaged to blend in science-fiction, action and crude humor.<br><br>The cast is superb, it's like someone entered my mind and recollected\nmy favorite comedy actors. Bringing together Judd Apatow and Pegg &amp;\nFrost was one then weirdest combinations I've seen, but surprisingly,\nIt worked better than anyone would imagine.<br><br>The screenplay was well-written and the CGI animation is unbelievable.\nAnd surprisingly, it had no plot holes in the storyline. This shows\nthat Pegg &amp; Frost are one the best duos in comedy.\n"
"\nThis was one of the best sci fi/comedies I have seen in years. One of\nmy co-workers was very insistent that I see this, and I'm glad he\ntalked me into it! Two sci fi addicts are returning from a convention\nwhen they pick up two unexpected \"guests\":an alien and a female\nreligious zealot. Paul is the alien, and conflicts between him and the\nlady, as well as his hilarious lines and observations from the addicts,\nprovide most of the humor. It is a marvelous combination of such genres\nas science fiction, comedy, and \"road buddy.\" There are allusions to\nsuch films as The Blues Brothers, Alien, and Close Encounters of the\nThird Kind-you will need to watch closely to catch them. Catch this gem\nof a film-Paul is a terrific character! I absolutely loved this film\nand you will too.<br><br>*** 1/2 out of ****\n"
"\nI think the most problematic part of making a comedy with an alien is\nnot to have it become to cheezy, too childish, \"too much human\"\nperhaps? In the case of Paul it seems that by making it more down to\nearth and cheezy beyond any measure a kind of \"the movie is so bad it's\ngood\" effect, though in a very positive way, is achieved. Paul is not\njust funny but it's original, it also re-invents many jokes in a way\nthat doesn't seem to be ripping off any other movies. The movie is\nenjoyable from start to finish, with a number of interesting twists and\nis entertaining even though some jokes are just childish, but have just\nthe right amount of adult humor that will keep 99% of the audience\nlaughing. If you have not seen this movie - get your friends together,\nget some beers and a pizza and have a fun evening. Paul delivers in\nevery scene.\n"
"\nI really enjoyed most aspects of this movie. It was a fun alien romp.\nHowever, I am not a fan of Seth Rogen. I find most of his films force\nvulgar language where it isn't needed. <br><br>Yes, vulgar language is a part of our lives and it has a place in\ncinema. But it's as if they forced vulgar language into scenes in this\nmovie that just sounded forced. Natural vulgarity adds to the realism\nof a film, but here, there was just too much that added nothing. <br><br>As far as the movie itself, I rather enjoyed it. Nothing epic, nothing\nOscar worthy, but a fun film to watch.<br><br>I rated a 6, but if the forced vulgarity was kept to a normal amount, I\ncould have given it a 7.\n"
"\nI have to admit, that I was surprised by the language that is being\nused in the movie. Then I saw the rating and it kinda made sense\n(R-rating in America), though I didn't expect them to go that way. But\nwhile the way is what's important, it's also what might turn people a\nbit off the movie, especially the first 20 minutes might seem a bit\nslow. Something the rest of the movie will make up for! <br><br>One of the things I was sad about, was the fact I knew the \"Bird\" joke\nfrom the trailer. It would've been great to just watch it unfold on the\nbig screen. But the movie has quite a lot of gags and it is obvious\nthat Nick Frost and Simon Pegg get along great, even when not on a\nscreen or a movie set. Their chemistry (combined with that of out title\nhero) make the movie more than watchable! Not politically correct mind\nyou!\n"
"\npaul is another gem of a film from simon pegg and nick frost paul is a\ndrinking smoking alien that crashed on earth a long time ago but has\nbeen kept from the public by the government but leaked by the\ngovernment in the form of merchandise so people know what to expect\nwhen they see him.<br><br>two friends are on holiday to America to go to comic and visit all the\nufo sightings in the us when they go to the black mailbox they run into\npaul and their journey begins defiantly a film to watch again one worth\nwatching .<br><br>i have seen oath films from simon pegg and nick frost and paul is my\nfavorite favourite it has comedy tragedy and action i also recommend\ntheir other films hot fuzz the worlds end and shaun of the dead they\nare also funny films and would recommend them.\n"
"\nI have never saw a movie like this. There are tons of movies out there\nwhen the main characters find a alien, or a prehistoric man who came\nfrom a different universe or time and the only source of humor when the\ncreature tries to discover our world.<br><br>This movie different. There is a extraterrestrial (Seth Rogen) who have\nalready known everything and he is responsible for the 47's Rosewell\naccident. He likes drinking, smoking, cursing and he has a weird sense\nof humor. During his escaping journey meets two nerds (Simon Pegg and\nNick Frost) and a half eyed Christian girl who later realize that\nsaying curses is fun. This situation contains lot of funny moments and\njokes.<br><br>The other strong side\" of this movie the references. I don't think\nanybody can discover all of them at the first time. This could be a\nproblem if you are not a nerd because you miss plenty of jokes. Of\ncourse the movie can't come through without clichés so the story is\nabout escaping from the planet but they are doing this a really funny\nand unique way.<br><br>This movie really deserves a chance!\n"
"\nI am a big fan of Pegg &amp; Frost - SPACED and SHAUN OF THE DEAD are\namazing pieces of comedy. And even though HOT FUZZ has some funny\nmoments - its kind of a mess. And when I first watched PAUL, I enjoyed\nit but thought the beginning was rather slow and forced. But I watched\nit for a second time because my wife hadnt seen it and I really enjoyed\nit much more the second time. Pegg and Frost have such great rapport\nand chemistry and the film is full of terrific actors - Kristen Wiig,\nBill Hader, Jason Bateman, etc. The film pokes a lot of fun at ET and\nother sci-fi alien films. I really liked the Wiig character and that\nshe was a repressed woman trapped at a RV park by a crazy religious\nfather. As she tasted freedom for the first time with the guys, she\ntries to make up for last time w/ cursing and partying. Some nice\ncameos by Jeffrey Tambor, Jane Lynch and also Sigourney Weaver. This\nisn't quite as clever as SHAUN but it is fun and exciting. Well done,\nmates.\n"
"\nThere aren't that many comedies I enjoy, but I really loved Hot Fuzz\nand Shaun of the Dead, also with Pegg and Frost. This one is not quit\nin the same league, but still pretty good. As always, Pegg and Frost\nexcel in portraying lovable goons, realistic to the point of cringing.\nAt first glance the film seems to be aimed at the American market, but\nits not without a bite. It refuses to take the safe road and makes good\nfun of American preoccupation with UFO's, anal probing and faith. It\nboldly, bluntly and rather hilariously attacks Christianity repeatedly.\nIt is also packed with references to the classics and pays homage to\nnerds and geeks, while parodying them at the same time, lovingly but\nviciously.<br><br>This really is one for the nerds. If you liked Galaxy Quest and are not\noffended by jokes at precious beliefs, this is definitely one to watch.\nIf you do, pay attention to the T-shirt the Christian girl wears the\nfirst time she enters the screen. I laughed my head of.\n"
"\nReally liked the movie - very quirky - Spielbergy - surprising - US/UK\n- curse nerd worthy and others dialogue - good cast and very\nappropriate alien appearances of - actors seemingly had a lot of fun -\nstory, dialogues - Its very humanist even so its alien - I always\nwondered why people are writing so much in those reviews and now I\nknow, you will have to. A short review will not get published. I\nsomehow need to fill 10 lines even so I wanted to keep it really really\nshort as I was always a bit annoyed by all these very long reviews and\nsimply wanted to have a short cool or not cool plus. I need to keep\nwriting to fill line number 10 - Enjoy :)\n"
"\n\"Paul\" has a very promising beginning, with a good laugh count. The\nfish out of water scenario of an alien needing assistance to get home\nworks initially. However, just passed the midway point, after the\nreligious zealot girl gets involved, things change from clever to\nredundant, bordering on boring. I mean the cursing angle is way over\ndone, and the film seems to have run out of ideas. The last third of\nthe film is nothing more than a cartoon-like car chase. Overall, \"Paul\"\nis enjoyable enough for a watch, but repeat viewings seem unlikely.\nIt's really a shame, because the alien creature is well done, but Paul\nultimately wears out his welcome. - MERK\n"
"\nFor the most part I enjoyed this movie, but it seemed a bit rushed and\nshallow. Perhaps, because the writers were too busy making fun of\ncertain stereotypes and being socially political. Perhaps because,\nbeing residents of the U.K. they were caricaturing caricatures and\ntrying a little bit too hard to dispel others. Maybe they were just\nhaving too much fun on their U.S. road trip.<br><br>I also found too much of the acting overly hammy. Somebody has to play\nthe straight man, but there's little of that. I could've used a little\nless toilet humor as well. As they actually say in the movie \"You have\nto pick your spots\"<br><br>All that aside, the basic tenor of the movie is pleasant because, I\nwould guess, that there's a love of the subject matter. Also, it seems\nthat the actors were having fun with the roles and making the movie.\nI've seen a lot worse, but with a bit more restraint, this movie\ncould've been great.\n"
"\nThe story line sounded interesting and while I would not have paid the\nmovie theater ticket based on the previews, seemed like a possible\nlight entertainment as a video rental. It turned to be a near total\nwaste of time, the previews essentially showed all the worthwhile\njokes.<br><br>The amount of pure profanity (swearing) is also supposed to make this\nfunny? I don't know but I passed the age of \"cream-pie in the face\" and\nBeavis &amp; Buthead style \"laugh at the word fart\". They seemed to be\nfillers for a lack of better gags and real jokes and some of those\njokes are repeated multiple times over the movie: yeah we got it - two\nguys, traveling in a RV - must be gay! Not so funny but we could give a\n\"Ha! Ha!\" moment ... but not the third or forth time! There would be\npotentially good moments and good lines made by the Alien, Paul, but\nthe acting seemed terribly flat to me and it was hard to enjoy the\n\"moments\".<br><br>I cannot even understand why people would have given such a high\nrating. I gave a 4 at the end as I have seen worst but don't expect\nmuch of this.\n"
"\nTwo British sci-fi geeks are travelling across America when they bump\ninto a real life alien, aka Paul. Together they take to the road to\nevade everyone from angry rednecks to government agents.<br><br>If you like Simon Pegg's other comedies (Shaun of the Dead, Spaced, Hot\nFuzz and the like) you'll probably enjoy the humour here, plus Seth\nRogen does a good turn as the voice for the swearing, smoking alien,\nPaul.<br><br>Some people have criticised the film for 'selling out' and being 'too\ncommercial,' especially when compared to Shaun etc. I didn't think so.\nI thought it was really funny. It probably helps if you're a sci-fi fan\nand you can pick up on all the genre references. Also, just ignore all\nthe debates on the internet that this film has sparked up about\n'religion vs non religion' - it's not meant to really teach you\nanything, just be fun - which it is.<br><br>Definitely one for the nerds (of which I am one!).\n"
"\nPaul is not perfect, but it is not as good as Shaun of the Dead and Hot\nFuzz. However I for one found it an enjoyable movie, and much better\nthan people I know made it out to be. I mainly wanted to see it for the\nconcept, which seemed fun and intriguing, and for the most part it was.\nThe story is mostly fast-paced and entertaining, but there are some\npredictable moments with some gags going on for too long. Also while I\nloved Kristen Wiig in Bridesmaids, I didn't find her character here\nanywhere near as well written or engaging this time round. However,\nPaul does look great and has an appealing soundtrack. A vast majority\nof the writing and gags are very funny and on target and the direction\nis well above average as well. Simon Pegg and Nick Frost are a\nwell-matched pair, both are likable and their chemistry infectious,\nwhile Seth Rogan, an actor I don't really care for, is surprisingly\ngood as Paul. Overall, far better than expected even with the flaws.\n7/10 Bethany Cox\n"
"\nShaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz are considered to be comedy\nmasterpieces, with the former also featuring as on of the 20 favourite\nmovies by Mr. idiosyncratic Quintin Tarantino. Now, the comic duo\n(Simon Pegg &amp; Nick Frost) collaborate again along with an alien ( Seth\nRogen) for a fun filled cross-country drive, I expected a laughter\nriot.<br><br>Paul was a highly intelligent and sensitive alien with humane elements\nembedded in his heart and brain. While escaping the clutch of human\nauthority, he chance-meets and befriends two British comic-book\ncreators vacationing/researching in America's most UFO sighting area.\nMost of the things Paul does are regular alien stuff ( bringing someone\nto life, punishing the evildoers with some blasts) that we had seen\nbefore, but this time in a regular human way - which we have not seen\nbefore.<br><br>There were some lolz moments, but overall falls way sort of\nexpectations.<br><br>Watchable if you have no other movies on desk.<br><br>(originally posted @ weirdo-on-movies.blogspot.com\n"
"\nI thought of seeing this movie because of the high rating and the very\npositive reviews on IMDb. In general, I love to see comedies. However,\nthis movie did not make me impressed. In other words, it did not made\nme laugh which is supposed to be done by a comedy. Movie mostly relies\non heavy use of swear words to create jokes but it didn't work for me.\nTwo leading characters looked dumb. 30mins into the movie, I was\nwondering how on earth this movie got this much of positive reviews. To\nme this was one of the most boring comedies I have ever seen. This\nreminded me a similar movie called \"Idiocracy\". At least it conveyed a\ngood thoughtful message even though it was boring.\n"
"\nThis is the funniest science-fiction movie I have seen in a while.\nActually I don't remember the last one I saw, off-hand. The two nerds\ndid their parts perfectly. The interaction between took a little\ngetting used to at the beginning of the movie. But once I tuned in, it\nwas a riot till the end. The Christian Creationist woman was a nice\ntouch in the story. If you are looking for a X-Files type story then\nthis is not it. This is more of a \"Hey dude where is my car\" sort of\nthing with an alien thrown in for good measure. At least that is the\nway I see it. The x-rated dialog kinda surprised me as I would have\nthought this movie would be targeted at a young audience. But if there\nwas this much in it at all, there should have been more!\n"
"\nThis movie is no hot fuzz, but it is definitely entertaining. Simon and\nNick's sense of humor, i think, is always spot on. I love how their\njokes are so subtle and dry, and move through the film without skipping\na beat. Not as funny as it could've been i believe, but i will for sure\nbe seeing it again. I do have one question however, why is it whenever\nreligious people are shown in movies they are always made out to be way\nover the top and crazy, almost cult like? Just because someone has\nreligion or beliefs doesn't mean that they are super closed minded and\nact as though they just had a frontal lobotomy. But anyway, still funny\nnonetheless, i look forward to seeing what Simon and Nick roll up with\nnext.\n"
"\nPaul is a hilarious movie with a great storyline and great sci-fi\nspoof,with two brilliant writers and actors,Simon Pegg and Nick\nFrost,with everything they did together always turning out\nhilarious,there main great pieces of work being Shaun Of The Dead and\nHot Fuzz.<br><br>Two nerds hoping to publish a comic they created at Comic Con,Graeme\n(Simon Pegg),who illustrates the comics and Clive (Nick Frost),tour\nArea 51 in a caravan to get a true feel of alien existence.They stumble\nupon a real alien,Paul (voiced by Seth Rogen),who is on the run from\nthe FBI.Graeme and Clive help to return him to his ship to return home\nbefore he is caught,along with Ruth (Kristen Wiig),who Graeme is\nfalling for.\n"
"\nWith all the major franchisees milking worn out characters with stale\nsequels, what a breath of fresh air to be introduced to a Awesome\ncharacter like PAUL. Had the most fun I had in a movie since Shaun of\nthe Dead or The Big Lebowski. 10 stars any day.<br><br>It is a fun ride of a movie. Don't expect an amazing story, but expect\nthe very essence of a good movie - awesome characters and a hell of a\ntime with them. <br><br>The best part about the movie is how Paul is so obnoxious, lovable,\ncrazy, irritable, ugly and yet so gentle and wise. A tough combo to\npull off - that mix of traits.<br><br>Paul is probably the best animated character I have seen yet - in terms\nof the depth of expression and body language captured. Yes it is\nanimated and it is an alien movie, but don't bring your kids - it is a\ntreasure trove of swear words and is just not suitable for kids - a\npity really.<br><br>So, if you want to kickback for the weekend and have a lot of laughs,\nrent it out or hit the theaters, you will not regret it.\n"
"\nLet me begin by saying that Paul is a movie by nerds for nerds about\nnerds. If you don't enjoy movies that glibly poke fun at themselves and\nfan-boys, you might as well go watch the King's Speech or something.\nPaul is not meant to be high brow, cerebral entertainment. It's meant\nto be funny and does an excellent job of it. There are a ton of giggly\n'did you find the hidden (and occasionally not so hidden) reference to\na beloved sci-fi film' moments that will appeal to all of us who live\nfor space aliens and epic comic book movies. There are curse words and\nother cringe worthy language in such abundance you might want to leave\nthe under 16 crowd at home but not much worse than that aside from\ncontinual references to boobs. Enjoy the action, enjoy the fun and\nleave the moral subplots to the foreign films.\n"
"\nThis is a crappy movie, with contrite writing, made bearable by\ntalented entertainers.<br><br>It takes excellent talent to make a dog like this stand up.. Adding the\nBritish cast members was a good idea. England is putting out excellent\nwork these days, and it is nice to see them in an American movie, but\nthey deserve better than this marginal script.. <br><br>You have been warned.<br><br>If a 12 year-old boy wrote this movie, it -might- be impressive, but\nmostly it would be typical. <br><br>Fart jokes, gay-baiting, gratuitous swearing.. <br><br>adolescent, at best.<br><br>If Seth Rogan had not already proved himself, well.. let's just say I\nhope he made some money, because it is nothing to add to his resume.\n"
"\nI really thought that this movie was going to be a good one, how WRONG\ni was. With the actors from Shaun of the Dead - i thought it would be a\ngood one but it is really bad. The special effects are the only things\ngood about this turkey. The story line is about the same as any B alien\nmovie. Paul is an alien, captured by the government, tries to escape to\nget back home, some humans are helping him get away from the evil\ngovernment agents, and so on. It seems like the writers went out of\ntheir way to make an anti-religious anti-Christian movie and that\nreally gets in the way of the plot. They spend way too much time on the\nanti-religious part and not enough on making the movie funny. Don't\nwaste a minute of your life watching this foolish stupid piece of crap.\nOne man's opinion.\n"
"\nBeing a huge fan of Pegg and Frost, my expectations were high. Yarp!\nMaybe that was the problem. Or maybe I didn't smoke a few joints before\nseeing this movie. No, wait, no amount of weed could make me laugh at\nthis movie. Narp! Pegg and Frost are fatter, slower, less funny and\ngive a stilted performance, and look like they're going through the\nmotions. Parodying religion can be funny, but if I want to see a movie\nmaking fun of religion, I'll go see \"Life of Brian\". Don't give it to\nme kindergarten teacher style in a comedy about an alien, a boring\nalien named Paul played by Seth Rogan who reads the script like he's\nreading an instruction manual for a lawn mower. Don't waste any of your\nresources on this movie which includes your money, your time, your\nbrain cell activity, or any physical exertion. Seriously, stop reading\nnow, and navigate away from this review.\n"
"\nI'm going to keep it short and simple. The movie is hilarious and very\nentertaining. However,if you are a 10 year old or hardcore Christian\nand take everything they say against religion in the movie personally,\nthen don't see it. I hate it when people say a movie is awful cause\nthey bashed something. I'm a Christian. But, remember people, it's just\na movie. <br><br>That's all. That said. Moving on... There is a lot of swearing in the\nfilm, and at times, perhaps to much. But, still,I thought it was great.\nHad me laughing the whole time and it was well worth the ridiculous\nTicket prices at the box office. I look forward to getting it when it\ncomes out on DVD.\n"
"\nSpoilers everywhere<br><br>OK so let me just write a review that depicts Paul as a bad movie not\nby American standards, that is by complaining about \"strong\" language\n(get over it you prudes) and making fun of god. Paul is a bad movie,\nbecause it is cheesy, corny and totally foreseeable. From the moment\nPaul healed the bird and told everyone that it is actually dangerous\nfor him, I knew he was going to heal someone at the end of the movie.\nThere were some funny scenes, but the hole movie just tries too hard to\nbe funny. It just doesn't work out. The end was horrible. The \"fight\"\nscene with Sigourney Weaver was just made of flickering images from\nmany different angles... if you can't make it right then DON'T do it.\n"
"\nI laughed for the first 15 minutes or so of the movie as all of the\npreviewed \"funny scenes\" were shown. I expected the rest of the movie\nto be as funny, and was very disappointed. Paul was all down-hill from\nthere. If the negative characterization of \"Christians\" was about\nMuslims, gays, or Jews, the film would have been slammed as \"hate\npropaganda\". It was really that bad. Don't waste your time or money on\na movie that really does preach hate for a people-group and has no\nother redeeming value. The hate propaganda is so simplistic and\nuneducated that it is exposed as mean and derogatory. <br><br>Tired, old, repetitive, and barely creative sophomoric humor failed to\nentertain for the last two-thirds of the movie, and I was simply left\nfeeling cheated and abused. Several attempts at humor could have been\nlaughable if it weren't so poorly performed by the \"actress\" portraying\nthe Christian girl \"freed\" by the alien and geek abduction. <br><br>In my opinion, not even worth a rental.\n"
"\nhes the slacker alien whos just here to make us all feel great! hes so\nfunny. the way he acts, with his cargo shorts, backpack, and laid-back\nattitude, i have a friend just like him! gosh these are some crazy\nhijinks you're involved in, how did you get yourself in so much hot\nwater, you crazy little alien?<br><br>nothing good to see here, hope was the only thing that kept me going\nthrough this abomination, hope that hed get tied to the bumper and\nforgot about for a few miles, a'la chevy chase. i have to think that\nthere is some other hand at work here, seeing as pegg and frosts last 2\nmovies sit here on my shelf. it comes off as not knowing whether to be\na kids movie, a stoner movie, or a comic fan's movie, even if i was a\nstoner kid, who liked comics, and funny movies, i would still think it\nsucked, and probably kick you in the nuts for making it.\n"
"\nSPOILER ALERT!<br><br>First two thirds slow to get off ground. Mostly predicable, no likable\nlead characters for me, Paul too cocky though his attributes very\ninteresting. Safe, mainstream, common, vanilla, even for the subject.\nReally great, loved the locations, save the end. Missed chance:\nfunniest scene with Paul on phone with Spielberg could have been a show\nstopper. (Has writer ever been in room with other writers, reviewers or\nadvisers and had to defend his script? That's not how you talk.) Well\nthought out script, though. Hat's off to writers Mr. Frost and Mr.\nPegg: no one dies. Standard cinematography, nothing fun. Great\nsoundtrack. First rate production technically.\n"
"\nWe got fooled by the IMDb rating (7.4 so far) and went to see a funny\nand interesting movie. Got so disappointed of that and we don't want\nanyone else experience it. No story , no real story behind it. Just\nfull of foul language that might not even make sense to use. My guess\nis this is for individual male adults and with certain mind stream. It\nwas a waste of our time!!!!!!!!!! Don't go to this movie to expect a\nnice sci-fi movie because it is not. It is just full of gibberish and\ncussing that does not make any sense at all. It is so bad that there\nare a few talented actors and actresses have been wasted on this movie.\nand I have no clue where in the hell!!! the rating of 7.4 came from. I\nhope a little bit later, the rating goes low enough that people get\nsome clues about the content and value of this stupid movie.\n"
"\nPaul is a dud.<br><br>Paul is just awful. <br><br>It takes swipes Christianity for no reason over and over again.<br><br>It comes across like a 12 year old raging against mom and dad taking\nhim to church. <br><br>Yeah, we get it-there is no God.<br><br>3 jokes the whole movie. <br><br>Bisexual is the way to be according to this movie. <br><br>Drugs Drugs and more drugs. Glad to see that this movie tanked at the\nbox office. Hopefully that will spare us from a sequel.\n"
"\nThis is one of the films that forces you to think as the author\nimagined, a lot of the stereotypes and weak arguments. It feels as if\nyou are forced to listen to a stupid man that talks 2 hours. Yes, there\nare a few funny scenes, but it's transformed into \"swill\".<br><br>It's not about whether you are religious or not, but the movie shows a\nforced belief of the author and without any arguments, but uses the\nstereotypes that are not really arguments. You feel like you are in the\nprison of stupidity. I really do not like movies like that. <br><br>Also, it's very predictable, you just wait when it will happened,\nimposing the wrong model (drugs, bisexuality, \"strong\" language...).<br><br>I think every film needs to have a lesson (final word) and this garbage\nhave: smoke, be gay - it's fine, there's no God, drugs...<br><br>Just do not waste time on this.\n"
"\nI have been a fan of Pegg n Frost since their first notably\ncollaboration in the cult channel 4 series \"spaced\". Regrettably this\nfilm (paul) is not as good as I had imagined it would be. The story is\nweak, Many parts seem bland in its delivery, some scenes are too wordy,\nSome lacking of liveliness and creativity. Even more those two English\ncomedians genius couldn't afford to bring up a solid humorous\natmosphere as well as they had done in shaun of the dead to save the\nday. Nay they look trying too hard to be funny. More over there are\nsome disrupting performances of the supporting characters, baroque in\ntheir awfulness. The only one that caught my attention in this film is\nthe ALIEN. To be fair paul's CGI is nicely made, smooth, and\nintriguing. In a nut shell this is a strictly disaster sci-fi flick.\n"
"\nGenerally, Paul (2011) has received positive reviews. Some sites\napprove of it, and some rate it to be exceptionally good, above average\nor average, itself. I honestly think it's because it's NOT part of the\ncornetto trilogy - however, it's still a good comedy with some\nintergalactic features (obviously Paul himself), good humour, ship-\nshape, top, albeit ridiculous, moments and more. <br><br>I genuinely think it's the least favourite, if you bring it in with\nShaun of the Dead, Hot Fuzz and The World's End, but hey, some people\nmight like it better than the other three, although they're more\nrelated (however, non-related in actuality.)<br><br>Paul is a funny, light-hearted at times, Sci-Fi comedy with some rather\ndazzling moments. Paul is great, and it's better knowing he's voiced by\none of the finest and funniest comedy actors in the world today - Mr.\nSeth Rogen. It's a good film. <br><br>In all honesty, Paul earns a 7.2/10 rating from me.\n"
"\nI love the actors in this movie, every one of them are high end comics\nand they kill in each and every movie they play in. the two main\ncharacters you would know the comic duo Simon Pegg (Graeme Willy ) and\nNick Frost (as Clive Gollings) from hilarious movies such as \"Hot Fuzz\"\nand \"Shaun of the dead\". the acting is good and the ideas are funny up\nuntil about 20 minutes after they meet the alien, after that it gets\nold very fast. I get it the alien is a \"Bro\" and after you see the\nalien fart and tell a few dirty jokes you get the point and the gimick\nis over. from that point i had nothing to watch the film for. Over all\nthe acting is excellent the beginning is funny up to about 20 minutes\nafter they meet the alien. for other people it might be a 7-8 movie for\nme its a 6. i wouldn't watch it again and did watch trough till the end\nbut maybe if it was 2 in morning and i was wasted on pot or beer or\nsomething it would be more watchable\n"
"\nI am not a big fan of sci-fi films and so I probably missed some\nknown/interesting links and references to them. But as I like British\ncomedies and have seen some great films with Simon Pegg's\nparticipation, I decided to dedicate 1,5 hours of my life to Paul.\nAlthough the plot is hectic, not evenly running and some humour is\nbanal, the overall picture is good, I had my giggles and joy of\nrecognition. As for other actors, I found supporting performances even\nmore fascinating: Jason Bateman as Special Agent Lorenzo Zoil, Kristen\nWiig as Ruth Buggs, Sigourney Weaver as \"The Big Guy\"; I am not so much\ninto Nick Frost and Seth Rogen, I consider them as clown-like\ncomedians. Still, I have to admit, that Paul's appearance and lines\nwere funny.<br><br>I am sure you will find the film good if you like comedies and have\nsome knowledge about last-century science fiction films. And thanks to\nBrits there is witty scoffing at religious and conservative values.\n"
"\nA decent comedy, although in my opinion just nothing extraordinary. The\nfilm is full of clichés and stereotypes (the classic nerds, the\nreligious stereotypes, etc) and there is nothing wrong with that, but\nyou gotta make them work . <br><br>Some people might find some of the religious comments and jokes\noffending (I think some of those jokes were good),so beware.<br><br>The best: Paul, a really enjoyable character. Unfortunately the other\ncharacters were not that interesting, and made the story drag a bit.\nThe worst: It just felt like a story that has been told so many times\nalready (geeks &amp; aliens), it stopped being funny.<br><br>Score (4)\n"
"\nTwo British sci-fi-loving nerds (Simon Pegg and Nick Frost from Shaun\nof the Dead and Hot Fuzz;) go on a road trip across America visiting\nUFO hot spots, when they come across a real alien (voiced by the\nubiquitous Seth Rogen). Passably funny, though one suspects even\ndie-hard sci-fi buffs will find the film's wall-to-wall pop referencing\ntiring and a tad lazy. In conclusion, Paul is an entertaining film, and\nthat is the main thing which makes it worthy of a moderate\nrecommendation. However, if Paul had lacked from its geek elements (for\nexample, if the alien was a fugitive from the Law, or a Mexican trying\nto cross the border), I think that the screenplay would have not been\nenough to sustain the film.\n"
"\nSo Paul started off really slow but pick up really quick, when going to\nthis movie i did'nt no that Seth Rogan was the voice of Paul and i\nthought it really work.<br><br>So Simon Pegg and Nick Frost all ways do a great job. with there\nrelationship was so good in this film,<br><br>So the director of super bad Greg Mottola does a great job and he\nalways does and i really enjoyed the film, so i give it 7/10 because of\nthe start took along time to get in to it but in the end it really\nwork.<br><br>So if you enjoyed this film check out (hot fuzz, Shaun of the dead and\none of his directed films super bad).\n"
"\nOnce again, British actor, Simon Pegg, is back with an off the wall\ncomedy. He is joined by a fellow Britt. The two are in the US for the\ncomic con in San Diego. Afterwards, they rent a RV and go on a tour of\nthe southwest visiting UFO sites. They pick up an alien and are chased\nby the FBI. They also encounter a super Christain woman played by\nKriten Wiig and change her mind about her beliefs with the alien. That\npart was very questionable as it was somewhat disrespectful. But\noverall, the movie has its funny moments and was some what\nentertaining.<br><br>FINAL VERDICT: Aimed for adults. It's OK if you want to see something\nwith this type of adult humor.\n"
"\nPaul is the most over-rated movie of the year, and that's the case for\none reason, it's not funny. I mean what the hell, I chuckled a few\ntimes, but this movie is almost completely devoid of humor. Now of\ncourse that's my opinion, if you found this film to be hilarious than I\nenvy you. I haven't seen any other Simon Pegg and Nick Frost movies,\nand this movie didn't really make me want to. I really couldn't care\nless for Paul himself, I mean if he had been captured and disected than\nI probably would have just shrugged and sighed. Also the Sigorney\nWeaver cameo was way too obvious, no, I am not putting a spoiler alert\ndown, if you know who Sigorney Weaver is, then you will know she is in\nthis movie the first time you hear her voice. Now there are things I\ndid like, but most of them were the science fiction elements, I loved\nwhenever they would make a reference to a science fiction film, and the\nSteven Spielberg voice cameo was awesome. It does a good job of showing\nhow crazy sci-fi fanboys can be. And the end twist was actually pretty\ngood.\n"
"\nDo ever feel the need to watch a silly but hilarious flick?well this is\nthe movie.Paul our friendly alien will captivate your imagination and\nredefine the term extraterrestrial for you.<br><br>Director Greg Mottola has brought in an entire different aspect of\naliens on earth.First Paul supposedly crashed landed on earth in some\nsixty years ago.Then randomly runs into our two main characters Simon\nPegg, Nick Frost.Then a chase ensures the FBI hot on paul and his new\nfriends trail they run into a a girl whom they accidentally\nkidnap.Honestly no need to spoil it just watch it.On the other hand the\ndirector(Greg Mottola) may not have directed major movies but for the\nfew he has done notably Superbad (2007),adventureland,just to mention a\nfew,all show he is humor oriented guy.Ironical in some sense that the\nET in this case is viewed as funny and friendly unlike as perceived buy\nother directors.The script was original,the characters sold the act and\ncreated one beautiful flick.\n"
"\nWho do i see to get that 2 hours back. Worst movie i have seen in a\nlong time. Usually like Simon Pegg but as my son said \"did he write\nthis as they were going to shoot?\". Not sure if this was to be a true\ncomedy or a weak attempt at satire focusing on ET and other early space\nalien movies. The movie starts off promising with Comic Con and a few\ngood laughs at nerdy stereotypes. Then jumps into a few typical jokes\nof laughs at homosexuals and straights but falls very flat. Then the\nmovie tries very weakly to make a statement on religion and then\ncontinues into a mishmash of tripe. I will give Simon Pegg a pass as\nthe rest of his movies had a cutting edge that was funny.\n"
"\nIt's one of the best Simon Pegg and Nick Frost movie I have ever seen.\nI liked them in the cornetto trilogy and from then, trying to have a\nlook at all of their work. Boy, they can give you a good laugh. I think\nthe director did a pretty good job. References to other films like Star\nwars and aliens gave me a chuckle. The screenplay is captivating,\nvisuals are great, comedy is fantastic. Good job on writing the story\nby Mr. Pegg and Mr. Frost. If I had known about this film when it was\nreleased, I definitely would have watched in theater. A pretty good\nNerd film if I can say. Trust me, if you are a bit nerdy like me, you\nare gonna love it. Even if nerd movies are not your cup of tea, this\nmovie is not gonna disappoint you. 10 rating for all the fun and\nentertainment.\n"
"\nA cool film to spend hour and a half on. I watched it quite long ago,\nso I don't really remember details. I remember that the film had some\ngood humour in it and provided witty references about a lot of stuff.\nThis is the kind of films I sometimes want to watch on my spare time.\nI'd like to hear from the director in the future, even though I\ncouldn't watch Superbad to the end (It gained some good critic). Maybe\nit was due to poor quality of my version of the film. Cast, as I\nremember did their job OK. I don't even know what to write next, I\nwanna just leave these brief notes for myself, not attempting for them\nto be useful for other people. If anyone is aware of more convenient\nway to do so, please tell me.\n"
"\nA super way to spend an evening in the cinema. The film is tightly made\nin the same manner as Edgar Wright's Hot Fuzz &amp; Shaun Of The Dead;\nbrisk, witty and with a sharp eye not only for referencing other films\nbut also other filming techniques. Simon Pegg and Nick Frost are on\ngood form. Jason Bateman is a nice, straight-faced addition and Kirsten\nWiig actually takes over the funny once she is introduced. The\nmotion-capture of Seth Rogen for Paul is high quality and Rogen himself\nis very entertaining.<br><br>The creationist issue is a little over-played (although not to the same\nextent as in Ricky Gervais' The Invention Of Lying). More effective are\nthe little moments that play on the wonder of supernatural\nintervention; the episode with the sparrow, for example.<br><br>A film-lovers flick but nothing like as nerdy as the critics might have\nsuggested - nor as nerdy as the characters themselves. 6/10\n"
"\nI enjoyed this movie, if you are looking for a great Comedy/Sci-fi type\nfilm I would highly recommend this film.<br><br>The reason I give it an 8 is because it portrays Christians in a\nnegative light - not all Christians are like these crazy people\nportrayed in the movie and also I am a Christian myself. Christianity\nis not a list of rules &amp; does/don'ts as this movie portrays I.e. don't\nsmoke, don't cuss, don't etc...<br><br>Christianity is a relationship with God not the list of does &amp; don'ts\nor a laundry list.<br><br>Other than that I enjoyed the film very much.\n"
"\nTwo English geeks take a road trip across America and run into a foul\nmouthed alien. Surprisingly enough, Paul is the joke that becomes least\ntiring throughout this film. He isn't always trying to be offensive,\nand actually brings a little heart and soul to the piece. I found there\nto be a lot of unnecessary Christian bashing going on throughout. As it\nwas done without the slightest hint of satire, and in the movie God is\ndisproved by the existence of a fictitious alien, it seemed a poor\nargument. Otherwise it's quite fun. It never had me laughing out loud,\nbut I was mildly amused. Unfortunately, towards the end it is nothing\nbut quotes from greater film. I mean the entire last 20 minutes seemed\ncomprised of quotes delivered in all seriousness by the cast. Will aid\na nice drinking game for cinephiles, but was tiresome while sober.\n"
"\nMy friends and I gave \"Paul\" a shot last weekend. I wasn't too hopeful\nas the trailer didn't make the movie seem all that great. I was\npresently surprised at how funny it was. As much as I am already tired\nof Seth Rogen, I thought he was a really great choice as the voice of\nPaul. Simon Pegg and Nick Frost were also a good choice for this movie.\nThe only thing that really turned me off about the movie was it's\nagenda. Throughout the movie, the writers continually portray\nChristians as sensational, ridiculous idiots and heavily promote\nscience. I suppose maybe I shouldn't expect a lot different from a\nsci-fi comedy, but it irritated me. I feel that the movie was funny,\nbut nowhere near \"Hangover\" funny. It's in the category of movies that\nwill be continually shown on Comedy Central in 2-3 years, much like\nShaun of the Dead and Super Troopers. I give it a 7.\n"
"\nPaul is the name of a dog who, one assumes, the Alien originally\nrescued but then disposed of. This only occurs to you after thinking\nabout why some things just don't seem to match up when you watch this\nfilm for the first time. There are other conceits that probably fly\nstraight over the audience's heads too. Never mind, this is a healthily\nfunny take on sci-fi and the people who love the genre. It takes a\nnumber of affectionate sideswipes at the icons well known to all of us.\nIt reminded me of the live mime show based on the puppet series created\nby Gerry Anderson, \"Thunderbirds\". Funny because you can't really take\nsome fictions seriously can you? A great laugh, just unfortunate that\nthe writing wasn't given to a professional screenwriter to provide rude\ndialogue without so much need for expletives.\n"
"\nI enjoyed this film, I caught myself laughing out loud a couple of\ntimes, and spent most of the film with a happy grin on my face.<br><br>There is often something very different about British comedies financed\nby and made for America. The good side is they have some kind of happy\ngrin warmness to them that I like. The negative side is that the cut of\nreal British humour is often removed. During Paul I could not help (as\nI happily smiled along) that Pegg and Frost were holding back. For a\nlot of jokes I wanted to to carry on and 'finish it off' - follow the\njoke to its cruller, harsher, ruder, British end. <br><br>So, how was this \"British American\" comedy? I enjoyed it. If found\nfunny but too long whereas this was about right. The jokes were\nconstant, and I left the cinema happy to recommend the film to friends.<br><br>So... yep, I'd recommend you to go and see this film - you'll leave the\nCinema with a happy grin, although maybe not aching from laughter.\n"
"\nPaul isn't really up to the same standard as Shaun Of The Dead and Hot\nFuzz but it's an engaging, reasonably funny flick. Several laugh-out\nloud moments and a general air of amiability bring it home; and it's\nsort of a living proof us geeks are inheriting the earth!<br><br>Simon Pegg and Nick Frost play two British Nerds having the holiday of\na lifetime at the San Diego Comic-Con and they have a subsequent plan\nto travel to the famous UFO hot zones in the region. And it isn't long\nbefore they run into a real living alien (a superbly blended CGI\ncreation voiced by Seth Rogen) in dire need of rescue from the\ngovernment agents trying to hunt him down.<br><br>As you'd expect there's a whole welter of movie and sci-fi references,\nand Pegg and Frost's script keeps things ticking over nicely. While\nsome of the humour falls flat much of it works; hurrah for the alien\nprobe jokes! To summarise: a good little movie, not a classic but\ncertainly worth watching.\n"
"\ncould have been a great film but alas was yet again hamstrung by pegg's\nnon existent talent, complete lack of anything approaching likable(or\nmore honestly ,barable). The plot is familiar enough alien comes to\nearth and meets humans,two of the most stupid annoying fat nerds your\never likely to meet this side of a far scape convention.As with most of\nthese one note movies i found myself waiting for the funny stuff to\nstart happening until i was rudely surprised by the closing credits.I\nimagine it'll make 100s of billions of pounds this movie solely by\nvirtue of it being utter dross and people have low to no standards,it\ndoesn't look like pegg is in a hurry to change his most profitable\nformula\n"
"\nNo.... I cried with laughter at the majority of this film.<br><br>The films starts quite slow. Starts as road movie with two British\ngeeks taking a life time dream of a trip around America visiting\nvarious sites where meetings with aliens are suppose to have happened. <br><br>The star of the film is a CGI character called... You guessed it Paul.<br><br>This film is more than a comedy. It makes fun of people's conceptions\non race sexuality and just about everything else that is suppose to be\npolitically correct that we aren't suppose to talk about.<br><br>If you have the right mindset for this sort of film you will find the\nfilm entertaining and funny. If you wish to look deeper you will find\nother things as well.<br><br>In the mean time... \"Hey f*%k nuts... It's probin' time!\"\n"
"\nIn truth I don't normally laugh aloud even when at the cinema\nsurrounded by people but this movie had be clutching my sides and\ngasping. <br><br>Keep in mind that it is 'adult humor', swearing, sexual references etc.\nso not suitable for the kiddies.<br><br>The story line isn't the most original I have seen but there were\nenough twists and turns to keep you interested until the very end,\nincluding the mini-clip during the credits. The special effects are\nfantastic, high speed chases, guns, secret government officials and\naliens. What else could you want from a movie?<br><br>If you want a laugh, to see a good film then you HAVE to see this\nmovie. It's very much worth the money.\n"
"\nAll the humor in this movie is pretty much at a 7th grade level. Lets\nput it this way, one joke that gets repeated like 10 times involves a\nfantasy woman with 3 boobs, the other major source of comedy involves\nsmoking pot (how original).<br><br>I'm also a little sick of seeing \"Christians\" stereotyped and then\nbashed. This is so overdone by Hollywood, completely cliché, so sad to\nknow people still think that is a good theme for a comedy.<br><br>Oh well, in my opinion, don't waste 2 hours of your life on this not\nfunny movie. They had a great idea but failed to deliver. If you want\nto laugh, rent something funny instead.\n"
"\nI watched much of what Simon Pegg has done and found it to be very\nclever in an understated manner, probably the British in him. This\nthough was a Seth Rogen movie which is curse words and fart jokes\nhumor. This had such a chance to be funny and clever at such a high\nlevel but instead sunk to Seth Rogen's level. There seems to be a lot\nof people who like that and I am sure they pre-order the newest\nrecording of Larry The Cable Guy as soon as they can, but I am not a\nfan. The acting was fine and the plot while overdone was OK, but there\nwas nothing to pull it together and for most part entirly and utterly\nwithout humor 95% of the time. I can't wait to get back to when\npervasive foul language was not funny and you need to actually be\nclever to write a script.\n"
"\nNow and then a film emerges and does everything it is meant to do,makes\nyou laugh from start to finish. Simon Pegg and Nick Frost have done it\nagain and I am oh so pleased we don't have to wait a lifetime between\nthem getting together to work on a new project,the chemistry between\nthem is simply magic,one could almost call them the Laurel and Hardy of\nthe 21st Century. Throw in Seth Rogan and Sigourney Weaver and be ready\nfor all hell to break loose on the big screen. Paul hits your funnybone\nfrom the first scene to the last and the humour is infectious,I haven't\nheard an audience laugh so much in the theatre since..well since 'Hot\nFuzz\". Lets hope that Mrs Pegg and Frost continue to team up on such a\nregular basis,the world of cinema is a much better place thanks to them\nboth.\n"
"\nI had expected more laughs from this movie but sadly I laughed more\nwatching the previews before the movie... :( . And if I combined all\nthe funny parts of this movie I could blink and miss them entirely. A\ngood use of tactics though by putting their funniest part of the movie\nin the previews, we are suckered in to pay a ridiculous price for a\nmovie ticket when you could wait and pay a dollar to rent it.<br><br>Save your money and rent it from redbox.<br><br>Gave it 4/10, it's just one of those movies you can put on, get up, and\nwalk around to do other stuff and not really care that you missed a\npart here or there.\n"
"\nGraeme(Simon Pegg) and Clive(Nick Frost) are two British sci-fi comic\nbook geeks, decide to take a trip to San Diego for a Comic Con\nconvention, after that they both take a tour of Area 51. But much too\nthere surprise they run into an alien who is named Paul(voiced by Seth\nRogen), a short light green, big headed life form, with a big foul\nmouth. Asks Graeme and Clive for help, if they could drive him to his\nlocation where his alien ship will meet him, they quickly meet\nRuth(Kristen Wiig), and she ends up coming along for the ride. But a\nrelentless government(led by Jason Bateman) is hot on Pauls trail. Will\nthey make it to there location before it's too late? <br><br>An entertaining sci-fi comedy, Pegg, Frost, Wiig, and Bateman are all\ngood, and they all get there chance to shine. Even the CGI Paul, well\nvoiced by Seth Rogen. If you are tired of seeing serious Alien Invasion\nflicks, then check out this raunchy adventure sci-fi flick.\n"
"\nIt's rare that I am surprised (or suckered) by a movie, by hype, or by\na misleading trailer. But this one just didn't do it for me. Now, I see\nthe high IMDb rating, and I trust that, more or less. So I do believe\nmost people really like this movie.<br><br>But not me. I just didn't laugh. I could see most jokes coming before\nthey got there. Same for the punch lines. It was like watching comedy\nwriting in very slow motion. I realize Seth is a comedic icon of our\ntime, but his voice just did not fit that alien. I couldn't get past\nit. It was weird.<br><br>Throughout the movie, I could *see* what they were trying to do. It was\nforced, fake and usually awkward. The timing wasn't there. The\ncharacters were cartoon-y. I just didn't buy it.<br><br>I did have a couple laughs during this movie. But mostly, I left\ndisappointed.\n"
"\nvery Sad....Jeremy had a short but Sweet role, the 2 main stars were\ncharming, funny, &amp; not too gross, but the gratuitous TERRIBLE language\n&amp; jokes were waaaayyyy over the top... don't know if it could be\ncrafted into a PG or PG13, but if it could be, it might be fun. GREAT\nshots of NM throughout!! i love Jesus, &amp; was disgusted at the way they\nportrayed the 2 Christians in the movie--try THAT with any other\nreligion, &amp; heads would roll..... THANKFULLY, Jesus is the #1\nForgiveness Guy!!! i should have known when i read this page\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1092026/parentalguide#certification and saw\n''56 f-words etc etc,'' that i should not let the pull of Jeremy &amp; NM\novercome my good senses..... :*( i am definitely not a prude; all in\nour group (many ages)also thought it was way over the top....<br><br>i wonder what ''they'' were thinking, it could have been SUCH a sweet,\nfunny movie~ or maybe it was meant to be this gross.......\n"
"\nI like Pegg and Frost movies but this one seems to have been given the\nHollywood treatment by someone who does not understand why their other\nmovies were so funny. There are a few laughs but this film fails\nbecause it tries to be too much at once. The director doesn't seem to\nknow whether he wants this to be a teen gross out comedy, road movie,\nchildren's family comedy or critique of Christianity. Having tried and\nfailed at all these elements there is no time to get to know the\ncharacters enough to make them believable or to fully exploit the idea\nof a comedy alien. Rather than being placed in funny situations Paul\nthe alien seems to exist purely to lecture us in an unsubtle way about\nhow idiotic Christians are. If you are aiming at satire fine but not in\na movie marketed as light comedy. Since when did it become acceptable\nto lecture people during a comedy film?\n"
"\nI was embarrassed for the woman next to us who had brought her\ndaughter. It was full of forced obscenities clearly and artificially\ntrying to make the movie funny...for people who knee-jerk laugh when\nobscenities are used. (Yawn) I got numb to that after a while but what\nwas really offensive it that apparently the real purpose for the movie\nwas to debunk any belief in God and Christians were \"shown\" to be\nidiots. Any believer who watched this movie would have to be offended.\nIf they just hadn't cheapened it with excessive and unnecessary gutter\nlanguage and hadn't pushed their agenda of Godlessness, this could have\nbeen a funny movie. I wish I had gone in for a root-canal instead. Just\nplain offensive.\n"
"\nThis movie was very disappointing. A mediocre plot plummeted to\nterrible very quickly. According to this movie, anyone who believes in\nGod is an idiot. It goes out of its way to portray Christians as\nintolerant, ignorant backwoods folk. It is one thing to support\nevolution and atheism. It is another thing entirely to demean and\ninsult anyone who believes otherwise. Exalting yourself by tearing\nothers down is juvenile and cruel.<br><br>Any possible humor was tainted by this movie's blatant intolerance of\nChristianity or simply any God at all.<br><br>Aside from the religion bashing, the movie was mediocre at best. The\nhumor was uninspired. Most of the laughs were expected to come from the\nuse of foul language. <br><br>I have heard that this is not a \"true\" Simon Pegg and Nick Frost movie.\nFor their sake, I hope that is true.\n"
"\n\"Paul\", is one really funny movie that offers a little more substance\nwithout riding on the successes Simon Pegg &amp; Nick Frost had gained in\nEdgar Wright's \"Three Flavours Cornetto\" trilogy. Being a huge lover of\npop-culture, this film has a lot of it and it all gets surprisingly\nrecycled into something both unique and familiar.<br><br>Every actor is pretty much suited for their role, and I was really\nimpressed how well Seth Rogen fleshed out as Paul. I was sceptical that\nit would just be Rogen spitting out his clever rude humour all the\ntime, but when I saw him he was so hilariously offensive as well as\ngoing from loud to quiet, to rude but caring. It really made the Alien\n\"down to earth\", and ultimately a cameo from one of Sci-Fi's famous\nladies makes this movie so fun to watch.<br><br>Final Verdict: If you ever wondered what a road trip with an Alien\nmight be like, then wonder no more. 7/10.\n"
"\nGraeme Willy (Simon Pegg) and Clive Gollings (Nick Frost) are two nerdy\nbest friends. After attending Comic-Con in San Diego, they rent an RV\nand drive to tour America's UFO sites. At Area 51, they run across Paul\n(Seth Rogen) who is an alien escaping from government detention. Ruth\nBuggs (Kristen Wiig) is a religious fanatic home schooled since the age\nof four by her father. She gets taken by the boys after Paul causes her\nto faint. Meanwhile the group is being pursued by Agent Zoil (Jason\nBateman).<br><br>I love anything with Simon Pegg and Nick Frost. This one is pretty\ngood. Although Seth Rogen sounds very odd coming out of Paul. I keep\nexpecting Seth to unzip Paul and come out. I also like the sweet\nKristen Wiig. The comedy is a little bit mild. I expected a lot more\nfrom an inappropriate alien. Nevertheless the movie has charm and fun.\nI just wish for more stupidity.\n"
"\nFirst off, who comes up with this stuff?<br><br>This movie was so comedic and the alien was perfectly animated in every\nscene and he was absolutely hilarious. <br><br>The Christian lady really ticked me off and totally ruined the movie\nfor me because that was just really annoying, I don't know anybody who\nis that psychotically religious to be that annoying. And the fact that\nshe was missing an eye was kind of dumb and didn't have to be part of\nthe movie.<br><br>The main protagonist's accents were also a really good addition to the\nhilarity of this film and I really enjoyed their acting as well. This\nmovie would have been perfect without any romantic add-ons as well.\n"
"\nThe first thing i should mention, out of politeness, is that\nChristian's will hate this film. OK, the majority of them will probably\nlaugh ( will they? Not sure about the US types) and they should.\nAfterall, it is a comedy film not a factual documentary.<br><br>Now, as a comedy film, there was no real big laughs to gain out of the\nexperience. I giggled many times through out but nothing made me roll\nof my seat, heading throbbing with immense laughter. Seth Rogan as Paul\nwas OK, with Paul being Seth's unrecognisable twin from another planet.\nPegg and Frost were surprisingly boring whereas Bateman was the main\nstandout.<br><br>There wasn't enough to me make ever want to watch again. No big gags,\nsimple jokes, repeated religion bashing. Good for a rental only. I\ncan't say a lot. It was just Meh.\n"
"\n(extended edition)<br><br>Simon Pegg and Nick Frost team up once more and have brilliant\nchemistry as usual. They start off as two British geeks at Comic Con,\nSan Diego. On their grotesque voyage in their RV to Area 51 an alien\nriding a car literally crashed into them. Seth Rogen is the perfectly\ncasted as the rude alien Paul. Or maybe the part is tailored to suit\nhim... Paul is is like a midget Seth wearing an alien suit... Perhaps\nthat makes him less special than E.T., but now at least he provides us\nwith some good laughs. It's a great parody/homage with plenty of\nreferences to their source material. Along the way the trio meets up\nwith a crazy bunch of people, I'll let you discover them yourself. It\nleads to a cat-and-mouse chase with some sidequests. In the end, this\nfilm is a successful sci-fi comedy, but mind the frequent swearing. <br><br>My score: 8 out of 10 My rating: PG-13 or 12(NL)\n"
"\nPAUL (2011) *** Simon Pegg, Nick Frost, (voice of: Seth Rogen), Kristen\nWiig, Jason Bateman, Bill Hader, Joe Lo Truglio, Jeffrey Tambor, John\nCarroll Lynch, Jane Lynch, David Koechner, Jesse Plemons, Sigourney\nWeaver (Cameo voice over as himself: Steven Spielberg). \"Close\nEncounters of The Geek Kind\" could've been the working title for this\nfunnier-than-it-has-a-right-to-be sci-fi valentine comedy from Brit duo\nPegg &amp; Frost (who co-scripted) as two UK sci-fi geeks who trek to the\nUSA to see every genre landmark and find themselves with a fugitive\nalien (Rogen toking good times!) attempting to get 'home' after the\nFeds are hot on their tails. Slacker homages to all things genre in the\npop culture riffing (best bit: a redneck roadhouse's rendition of John\nWilliams' 'cantina theme' from \"Star Wars\") goes a long way but\ndirector Greg Mottola keeps things at an even keel.\n"
"\nWell I've been waiting to a while to finally watch this film since\nseeing the trailers and I have to say I was not disappointed.<br><br>Pegg &amp; Frost are a great comic duo and their films I find are always\ntop quality British humor and I'm glad to say Paul didn't disappoint.<br><br>Although I did start to have my doubts after the first 20 minutes as\nmany contributors have said it did start a bit on the slow side the\nfilm finally found it's feet once the foul mouthed and foul mannered\nlittle Grey guy arrived.<br><br>It's not often when I watch a film and get tears of laughter rolling\ndown my face but the one part of the film in the comic shop with the\nMIB guy was puerile quality.<br><br>I hope the make a Pauls very soon.\n"
"\nthis movie was great for one reason, creationism vs darwinism. very few\nif any alien movie has dealt with and included Jesus \"freaks\" in the\ncast and plot, and this movie does it beautifully at the end when the\ndad still isn't convinced there's no god and he says like god bless you\nor w/e to paul. and pauls just like, yea whatever dude. that was great.<br><br>i love simon pegg but i was quite disappointed with hot fuzz and run\nfatboy run was decent, but they hit it outta the park in this one. you\nget to see them on \"holiday\" here as they travel through the-otherwise\nboring, unless you like aliens- southwest visiting all the alien\nlandmarks.<br><br>then along comes paul, admittedly-and not surprisingly- essentially\nseth rogan in all his other movies. but i gotta admit its much more\nsatisfying watching an alien chief a joint than i had expected, kudos\nto this one. money well spent\n"
"\nI have very mixed feelings about this film. I love Shuan of the Dead\nand Hot Fuzz so I was really looking forward to seeing this one.<br><br>However I started to feel this sinking feeling as I was watching it. I\njust couldn't gel with the film and felt it was really flat and to be\nhonest, a bit boring to start with. Yeah it had a few laughs and\ngiggles but it wasn't the standard I was expecting or used to.<br><br>Then about 30 minutes in to the film took a turn for the better, thank\ngod. The dialogue became faster and funnier and felt like the film it\nshould have been from the start.<br><br>My advice to anyone thinking about seeing Paul is expect much of the\nsame humour you got from the previous two films and if thats your cup\nof tea then stick with it as it will get better.<br><br>If I rated the film in thirds I would say the first third is 3 stars,\nsecond third 6 stars and the last third 8 stars.\n"
"\nFor a comedy, don't expect to be laughing throughout the entire movie.\nThe movie is driven by a good story and spiced with comedy here and\nthere. Which in itself is a good combination, and it worked well for\nthis movie.<br><br>Not to forget the CGIS in the movie. They were excellent. The character\nPaul was so nicely made, and the textures of his skin, face and eyes\nwas off the charts. And those effects really helped carry the movie.<br><br>\"Paul\" is a good movie, though it is not Simon and Nick's best movie,\nit takes a lot to top \"Shaun of the Dead\". But it is a good enough\nattempt, and the movie works well enough all together. A movie with a\ngreat story, some laughs here and there, and it will take you out of\nthis world.\n"
"\nI was excited about this because I'm a huge Simon Pegg fan with 'Sean\nOf The Dead' being one of my all time favourite movies. Here he's again\nteamed with his partner in crime Nick Frost with Seth Rogan as the\nvoice of Paul the alien. It's a road trip movie that sees sci-fi geeks\nGraeme and Clive picking up an extraterrestrial hitchhiker named Paul\nand then helping him get back to his mother ship while the FBI closes\nin on them.<br><br>Paul is cute and funny in a dumb sort of way and works especially well\nif you're a science fiction movie nerd (like me). I appreciated all the\nhomage paid to movies like 'ET', 'Star Wars' (cantina song) 'Close\nEncounters of the Third Kind', 'Alien' etc. Even with all that going\nfor it though, this still wasn't as good as I was expecting and\nultimately didn't quite hit the mark for me. 09.11\n"
"\nParts of this movie were funny, but the good was somewhat overshadowed\nby the bad. It started well, but meandered, seemingly lost from about\n1/3 of the way in, with the \"plot\" becoming as muddy as the amateur\nattempts at feeding the Christians to the lions.<br><br>I am not religious myself but it did seem that the writers were going\nout of their way to force the \"there is no god\" message to the point of\nalmost desperation. I couldn't help wondering what Christians had done\nto these people to warrant such an attack, but regardless, it detracted\nfrom the movie on the basis that it is not the place of movie writers\nto force belief - or in this case removal of belief - down viewers\nthroats. As a cynic, I am always suspicious of anyone who feels it\nnecessary to take pot shots at those who are unable to answer back\nthere and then.<br><br>Shaun of the dead et al were funny on their own merits but it does seem\nthat this movie was simply unable to carry itself through without cheap\ngimmicks and lazy plot vehicles. Very disappointing.\n"
"\nIt was funny and fabulous :) Very good curse words. Very.<br><br>The story was good, characters were good and jokes were pretty good\nalso. Just my kind of geeks those two. That chick and Paul were also\ngreat. Paul has a really nice personality. And now i'm suddenly\nthinking of space balls, hmm. Anyhow. Nice personality (wonder what\nthose space balls look like?).<br><br>I especially dug it when she started cursing. I laughed! And also\ncried. And no, not because of all that cursing :) So, it didn't\ndisappoint me emotionally, rather surprised me actually. <br><br>It was kinda a cliché movie but still i liked it. That isn't always a\nbad thing. I mean cliché's are what they are because they are them.<br><br>Oh and, 3 tits!\n"
"\nI wasn't sure what to expect before watching this but this was probably\nthe funniest Pegg and Frost movie yet. I though that it had a very good\nstory- line and it had some real depth. I also thought that once again\nPegg and Frost were both good. I thought that Seth Rogen as Paul was an\nexcellent choice, as if there was ever an alien, I would imagine it to\nsound like him and I thought he fitted the character perfectly. The\nending was a bit of a tear-jerker and a little bit of gore but one line\nmakes everything better! Overall I would say that Paul is a great\ncomedy film, if you like typical Pegg and Frost films, this one is\ndefinitely worth a watch. I would rate it 9/10 and say that it is\nsuitable for anyone 13+.\n"
"\nIt was a decent movie. It had a couple of really funny scenes. But\nthere wasn't enough of the geek stuff. I wish they would have spent\nmore time at the Comic Con and nerded it up a little more. Their\nobservations and humor were spot on. I thought Paul himself should have\nbeen a little more alien. He seemed like Seth Rogan but with a big\npurple head. He could have almost been any generic slacker dude. Pegg &amp;\nFrost are a great team and Kristen Wiig was good in her part, as usual.\nI could actually see the three of them making another movie together.\nThey had good chemistry.<br><br>I was thinking that maybe they wanted to make a movie that would\nattract the genre fans but also not alienate the general movie watching\naudience.\n"
"\nShaun of the Dead and especially Hot Fuzz are two great movies. Hot\nFuzz has great special effects with solid acting and a good script that\nis well directed, Paul is not lacking in special effects and Seth Rogen\nas Paul was enough to make it worth watching, but in other areas such\nas story and real laugh out loudedness it lacks. It is surelyyy no\nSuperbad, so expect nothing more than a pretty entertaining, whacky\ngood time. I would wait for DVD. I would have rather seen a number of\nthe other movies in theaters now than spend the time and money on this\none. I don't know what these people who LOVE IT and say RUN OUT AND SEE\nIT NOW OMGOMG are smoking, but I want some, it would've probably made\nthis movie much better!\n"
"\n... If You're A Window licker, then this may be very good but I've\nwaited for over a year to download this, and I thought it was going to\nbe something special but it turned out to be special needs!!! How this\ngets such a high score is beyond me!! OK, if I was a blind, retarded\nwindow licker, then I might have shown a little interest but I'm not a\nwindow licker, so the movie did little more than annoy me!!! If someone\ncan please point to the part that's worthy of more that 1/10... please,\ndo so but I honestly can't see how this is worthy of anything more than\n2/10! Why do people feel the need to score something highly, simply\nbecause it was 'OK'?<br><br>*rolleyes*\n"
"\nI was really anxious to see this movie once I heard about it. I am a\nbig fan of Simon Pegg and Nick Frost, those guys are hilarious. I loved\nthem in \"Shaun of the Dead\" and \"Hot Fuzz\". When I saw that these two\nwere pairing up again I was 100% sure I would like this movie. To me\nthis movie did NOT disappoint me at all. I really like it. It was\nfunny, and if your a nerd or kind of a nerd like me and into sci-fi,\nyou can relate to it. I'm not a fan of Seth Rogen either but I thought\nhe did as awesome job as \"Paul\". I know a lot of people are upset\nbecause of comments made on Christianity in the movie, but I mean come\non! I'm not religious but in my opinion I've heard way,way worse in\neither other movies or stand-up. I loved this movie, and I am 100% sure\nthat I will be buying it to add to my collection.\n"
"\nI went to see Paul today (Sunday march 20th) I have to say it was very\nfunny, The Graphics of some of the things in that movie were really\ngood, The creator of Paul the alien did very well. The eye\ndetail/features were amazing and the way the skin and body shape looked\nwas pretty much dead on. As i watched the movie i didn't honestly\nexpect there to be a alien with awesome powers and to swear, drink and\nsmoke at all. The end of the movie was pretty sad, a lot of people in\nthe theater cried when Graeme was shot. I can say i did expect the\nhealing part to come in from the part with the bird but i did not\nexpect Paul to recover. I was expecting an extremely sad movie but all\nin all it was funny and i enjoyed watching it.\n"
