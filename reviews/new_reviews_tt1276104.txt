the whole premise of this story was flawed from the beginning
for scifi fans time travel is what its all about
its meant to be intriguing and full of conundrums that most importantly some how make sense
all the best time travel movies have a consistency that holds the idea together
this is precisely what loopers does not have
there where so many holes in the plot that it became impossible to go with it
if your going to beam someone to the past to be killed why do you need a looper
why not beam them straight to the furnaces
and if you have to use a looper why rely on him to kill himself  let someone else do it
seriously this was just a few of the canyon like proportions of the gaps in the plot of this flop
if bruce was not in this i would have walked way before the end
i was fooled
you dont have to be
the premise for this film is fantastic the cast appears great and its a movie that wants to be seen
however it is a major disappointment
the whole concept of hit men and timetravel is intriguing and the concept of your future self being the target even more so but this in truth is not what the film ends up being about
in a terminator esque manner bruce willis turns his antics in the past to a save the future kill quest wanting to destroy a futurecrushing rainmaker whom we know very little about and have little incentive to want killed whilst he is still a child
the aforementioned has tk the films terms for telekentic powers and this is barely covered and feels like one idea too far almost an add on that is ultimately crucial to the narrative but is not presented to us enough
in all the film leaves you dissatisfied feels clunky and disappointing as on paper it could have been so much better
i hate to be a cynic but i have a hard time believing that the 8
510 rating on imdb is genuine
as for originality i guess the film could be described as a unique combination of other story lines but definitely nothing innovative
it moved quite slow at times and there are also some serious contradictions and plot holes
in the future homeless people fill the streets and the us resembles a third world country yet all of the high rise building are brand new and futuristic
the cars use solar panels to power internal combustion engines which would never be a possibility
in the end the main character commits suicide causing his future self to disappear
if he had killed himself at his younger age the older self wouldnt have existed
there are also some unbelievable coincidences that keep the story moving
i am sure the filmmaker would have some complex explanation but i base my realities on known science and if they have an alternative science it should have been introduced
first of all forget the plot
there isnt any just a bunch of half baked overdone derivative ideas flung at the screen in the laziest piece of film writing ive ever seen
visually the picture steals from mad max blade runner witness the matrix carrie and another half dozen better movies
but the most unforgivable thing it does is decharm joseph gordon levitt
one would not have thought this possible
also in resurrecting the tiresome bullet headed bruce willis it reminded me of why ive always hated that guy
his scenes with the chinese broad were particularly excruciating
all in all a horrible mess that doesnt even have the guts to follow through on its setups
the worst movie ive ever seen
and definitely not a action and certainly not a thriller
the plot is very weak
not worth wasting your money on watching this movie
in my opinion burn the negative of this movie
awful movie
a real disappointment
and the concept of time travel was badly conceived
this movie is more of a romantic movie than the story of a man facing his future self
didnt expect this from bruce willis
and the telekinesis thing was bullsht
and the movie moves pretty slow
i mean it takes about 30 mins to reveal what the plot is all about
and the worst thing is the lack of action
there is non hand to hand combat which was really disappointing
and there is just a 2 minute scene of willis shooting people which ended as soon as it started
all in all the movie is so bad that youd rather sleep at home all day
and btw this is my 1st preview so its not very professional
but had to write this to stop yall from wasting your money and valuable time
the perfect time travel movie made
not an easy thing to accomplish
but rian johnson does it and it looks so good
powerful storytelling stylish good old action and the visuals reminding of children of men is what makes this futuristic scifi  an excellent movie
and the heart this movie has
makes it a great movie
do watch it
you will be surprised
well  i dont like timetravelmovies much because most of the time imo the writers screw the story up
but the highratings and the fine actors involved dared me to give the movie a try  and ofc it failed
far too many holes to the plot e
g
if the gangsters in the future got a timetravel machine there is no need for loopers at all just think about it
also the movie didnt hold my attention well  too much dialogue for my taste which lead into the kingdom of sleepiness
the implementation of the mutant kid didnt make the story better at all
another aspect are all the action scenes  uninspired and at best mediocre stuff
summa summarum imo one of the few good timetravelmovies is the original movie time machine of george pal from 1960 with rod taylor in lead
if a director or writer wants to rise chances for making a bad movie  heshe makes one about timetravel
i did not like the past self killing himself and thereby killing his future self
when the future already existed we can not roll it back
if we have to then we should bring back everything not selectively
the same way it would not be acceptable if bruce wills have killed the rain maker as he is already in the future
one can kill somebody who is in the present either in past or in future
if happens otherwise then that should roll back everything related with that somebody
it is as good as bringing whole time back to past present
who writes a story about time traveling should be little reasonable

lamest movie i have had the displeasure to see in awhile
first of all i thought the plot might have some merit
but the delivery was horrible
the time machine was a piece of 1950s scrap metal from a brokendown foundry
it just made no sense
why would someone go back in time and work for a henchman in the future
couldnt you find the henchmans mother and kill her before she was born
why would criminals be the only ones using the time machine
i blocked this horrible movie from my mind so i dont remember much anymore
what a waste of time
it made no sense from a time paradox point of view
but i guess all usa made movies have to be stupid these days to compete with all the other stupid insipid movies that are made in hollywood
no one can come up with an original idea so we get godzilla part x etc
and when they do its some piece of garbage like this
if i could only go back in time and warn myself not to see this movie and get my 2hrs
of life back
the whole plot relies on the fact of a man  a looper  who gets the job to kill his own self of 30 years later sent back to the past  closing the loop then
the situation opens field to a set of narrative and slightly philosophical questions
one just never understands why the closure of the loop isnt done by someone else besides the self
this option would surely make the whole situation so much easier and surely there would not be loopers tempted not to kill their self selves
why didnt the big bad guy that rules the world in 2074 thought of this
forgetting that basic but yet so important plot fail it is a well put together action film and emily blunt is beautifully filmed  i guess rian liked the girl
if the narrative would go on in 2012 and being the future the time where the tobekilled guys would be sent from everything would be exactly the same
so not much of science fiction here besides cool design cars sophisticated weapons and a few more ordinary things that dont bring anything actually essential to the plot
this was one of the most boring movies ive ever watched no real storyline that you could follow without losing interest
it was very disjointed and confusing jumping back and forth without any real sequence
im surprised that bruce willis put his name to it but then he has not had many offers lately
the directing and editing was not up to par and as a previous op posted no good sequence between past and present
i kept watching in the hope it would improve
it didnt
in fact it got worse
i wish i could find something good to say about it but i cant
after 35mins i gave up as i was falling asleep with boredom
save your money it really was that bad
it started out ok but i lost interest in about 5 minutes
i thought the idea was compelling sending people back in time to be executed but then it got confusing to the point where it was laughable
lots of people running around shooting stupidly designed weapons
a child is shown getting shot which was bothersome
the tender moments of this film are about as meaningful as a fabric softener commercial
even the cars of the future are pathetic in this film
maybe the director used up the budget on actors and couldnt hire anyone proficient for anything else
too bad mystery science theater 3000 is off the air because it would have been perfect for this dog of a film
i made the huge mistake of ignoring the r rating and taking my 12 year old to this movie
thats my own stupid fault
dont repeat my mistake with your child
or for that matter any adult including yourself
this bleak morsel of cinematic gristle will have you rummaging for your prozac in short order
looper contains plenty of the usual gratuitous sewage including drug addiction poverty mindless sex brutal torture and dismemberment explosions and shootings
to this dogs breakfast is added a liberal seasoning of fbombs urban blight and telekinetic special effects
if theres any redemptive message here its get on your knees and get right with jesus lest you end up in this living hell
the problem here is the script and overall way of telling the story because the idea of filming point blank executions of so many individual people close up and personal is too gross to handle
the director has no idea how to make a film watchable
he just causes stress which spoils the good bits and in fact he makes me wonder if hes a freak who needs an outlet for his sadism
i liked two things about the whole film and for their visual aesthetic only
frankly i felt so disturbed by the idea of this being on general release and that i had seen it that i wished i hadnt gone to see it  and the strange fact that people have given it good reviews on imdb makes me wonder if everybody is desensitized to extreme violence and i am the only one who knows that you dont have to kill and maim to make things exciting and fun
this film is seriously just bad
at first youre drawn in the concept threatens to become fascinating but it simply tumbles into an abysmal joke of a movie that ends with a disgusting clicha
you seriously have to check your brain at the door to even remotely enjoy this film
how it has carried an 8
2 rating here baffles me
source code it is not inception it is not terminator it is not
i really worry about the future of science fiction considering how well this abomination has done
someone had the gall to call this movie this generations matrix
apparently this generation is drastically dumber than mine was
time travel is a tricky thing to deal with
taking the approach that since its complex youre not even going to attempt to form continuity as this film does is not the way to deal with that complexity
whats the allpurpose standby timetravel plot
yeah  guys getting sent back from the future to assassinate someone and alter future history
looper comes up with an alternative guys from the future getting sent back to be assassinated by regular schmoes in the present
brilliant only maybe they didnt quite think it through and half way im not spoiling anything here am i
they revert to plan a  one of the guys from the future whos evaded his assassin its his younger self so he remembers its gonna work decides to bump off some kid whos going to grow up to be mr nasty in the future
not a heartwarming little angel kid of course that wouldnt be right not even one of those cynical wiseass sort of kids either people love them too
what other sorts of kids are there
oh yes malevolent psycho kids with satanic powers  thats our plot
remember the first time you saw star wars
itll be like that only more confusing
and probably less sequels
why what the hell
after reading all of the other previews did you all see the same film
trust me
this film is rubbish in fact sifting through rubbish would be more interesting it really was a very poor a used condom has more life
it would seem all of the biggest guns in the film world gun shed were brought out on show in this epic pile of nasty i would have been more than happy to use one just to shoot the tiny rainmaker just to end it all
apparently young joe had to wear a false nose in the film to look like old joe
just wish that i had use of the hollywood prostheticss team as not to be recognized as i left the cinema
looper seemed to be a perfect metaphor for cycles and loops in the lives of many characters and does so in such a way thats only possible in a film with this type of time travel
character development is unique and makes you suspend some disbelief with the logic and instead slowly understand who one man is and who he is able to be
the movie is paced brilliantly
the beginning of the movie is the only part where the exposition is told so blatantly but for a movie this complicated thats okay
the movie isnt about the future it presents
its about a man who must close the loop with his future self
definitely a new favorite
i do love this movie except for one of the biggest casting fups of all time
who the heck thought it was a good idea to cast paul dano as a hitman
it literally drove me nuts to watch such a soft person try to play a hitman
and then sure enough while theyre looking for him hes crying like a little girl
theres a huge difference in the way joe acts when his loop runs
in 2074 when the mob wants to get rid of someone the target is sent into the past where a hired gun awaits  someone like joe  who one day learns the mob wants to close the loop by sending back joes future self for assassination
with a cast of so many talented actors you would expect that looper would turn much better unfortunately the movie was boring full of plot holes and it was just dumb i completely turned off my brain when bruce willis shot the window and i thought that he was going to escape from the side where he shot it but instead he broke the other half on his own it made zero sense the same goes for the ending and on top of that the movie just drugged itself so much it was so boring and it felt like a bad copy of terminator back to the future and other way much better science fiction time traveling films of the 80s and 90s
all this people that wrote reviews like this film its original and fun its neither original or fun its just an overrated dumb scifi film with great talent wasted
looper is one of those movies that escaped me for too long
this movie is filled with complexity and keeps you on your toes from start to finish
the acting performances are absolutely stand out all round
joseph gordonlevitt is superb jeff daniels and bruce willis deliver accomplished performances and emily blunt is ever so slightly intoxicating
this feels very original is packed with fantastic action and complex themes and challenges the viewer in many ways
it doesnt feel like there is a wasted moment on screen which is testament to solid direction and editing
pierce gagnan is also worth a deserved mention for his performance
a very real life take on the concept of time travel and all of the complexities and complications that would presumably come with it
10 years ago i would have rated this lower but look at the competition
a lot of people giving bad reviews did not watch it or cant even understand a basic plot
very simple if they panned the movie and didnt mention incest i would exclude their review
willis shoots the boy and levitt gets a scar on his face
this for certain means only a few minutes earlier in the movie joe had sex with his own mom
i did subtract some points for this being a somewhat sloppy timetravel movie
i do agree with other reviews that say the plot should make more sense
at the very least a little more work could have been put into that
i did not like the ending but that is pretty common these days
very disappointing ending just because joe from the present shot and killed himself preventing future joe from killing sarah does not guarantee that seth would not grow up to be the rainmaker the kid had a very short fuse
very disappointing ending just because joe from the present shot and killed himself preventing future joe from killing sarah does not guarantee that seth would not grow up to be the rainmaker the kid had a very short fuse
my review does not contain enough lines yet i repeated all that needs to be said about the movie
very disappointing ending just because joe from the present shot and killed himself preventing future joe from killing sarah does not guarantee that seth would not grow up to be the rainmaker the kid had a very short fuse
looper is such a refreshingly good american film that its almost possible to forget that its essentially a bmovie
the plot is based on the idea that time travel will be invented in the future but will be criminalised so that the only people to use it are the mafia who send their victims back in time to be killed in the past by specialised hit men called loopers
once you accept that absurdity  and the presence of telekinetic powers  the film creates a simple but clever plot in which one of these hitmen finds himself asked to kill his future older self
he fails and soon finds the mafia after him whilst his older self tries to hunt down the man who will kill his their wife in the future
the future is well imagined in low key ways  unusually for a sf flick half the film is set in rural areas  and intelligent
what really sets it apart though is the cleverness of writer director rian johnson who elevates what ought to be a generic b picture through a masterful use of music writing editing and image
i wish i could loop back intime and not watch it go firefly hunting or feed some stray cats
this movie was retarded
i skipped through most of it which may or may not make this review a review but the whole life runs in a circle thing as drawn at the very end of the movie was a nice concept but with the plot and story board of this movie
lame
the hinting of the ends justifies the means with killing the children added to the fact that the one who supposedly cherished life and love was the one who was carrying out this horrendous escapade was even more fuel to my fire of how
retarded this movie was
i watched the preview again after i watched it
i dont see a connection
someone please help me on that one
a young murderer called joe lives a life of pre arranged shootings and wild drug partiesuntil one of his suddenly materialising victims turns out to be an older version of himself
how we know this is because thats how the film has been advertised not because of any thing like a resemblance
which bring us to the heart of my problem with the moviejoseph gordon levitt has been made up badlywith a rubber nose and contact lenses to try and resemble a young bruce willis
they really truly failed
every single time i looked at the weird eyes of jgl it broke the reality of the film for me
creepy bright and totally out of place
oh dear im sure it was good other wise even if almost everyone in the cinema guessed the ending long before the punch
shame i couldnt enjoy it felt like it was constantly holding up a sign saying sack the make up department
this movie is excellent
if you enjoy scifi mysterious actionpacked thrillers i highly recommend it for you
joseph gordon levitt has solidified himself as one of the decades most entertaining actors with this film with help from a perfectly casted bruce willis and all around great supporting actors
the true thing that made this movie stand out from others was its creativity
brian johnson the director amp writer developed a whole new realm of reality where time travel becomes an issue with peoples improper use
the movie like a rope that you keep following through twists and turns which you later solve with the awesome revelation of the mystery
if you love movies that make you think creatively and cause youre imagination to run ramped then you must check this movie out
some movies i wont be interested throughout the whole film however this movie was different
well done mr
johnson
overall an excellently creative movie which will have you thinking afterwards
once again critics have reviewed the director and not the film very much like blink this is so overrated
funnily enough his middle film brothers bloom was better than this and blink and yet it was ignored
very little happens apart from both joes killing people the time travel is utter nonsense to make the film work older joe has to come back twice and get this instead of being killed the first time so that he gets the money and goes to china he escapes the first time then ten minutes later for no reason the scene is repeated and this time he get killed then we go back to young joe out to get and kill old joe
then halfway through we go into another plot the shooting stops for a while and the film tries to get deep and serious
full or pretension and utterly boring
first the good stuff about this movie
excellent plot
new idea for time travel
good performance by joseph gordon levitt
new concept of tk which was a good treat to watch
i guess thats all
now bad things
1
the design of time machine was same as a 50 year old time machine movie
2
their vision of future is crap
i mean seriously
only thing that was modernized was flying scooters
people kill each other for stealing a piece of cloth or something equally cheap
but ya they still use ford 150 truck
wtf
3
bruce willis tried to act
the guy who looks best with guns and grenades he was shown crying like a baby after a kill which was no way decent or apt
in short the only thing good about the movie was concept but picturization was so so shabby and it always appeared as if the movie was made just for sake of making it
don waste your time
1
interracial sexflirting check 2
all characters are trash hollywoods war on morality
check
3
terrible action sequences with one guy beating up 4 by himself no problem no reality
check
4
no kids
remember
hollywood hates kids especially white peoples kids
kids die but no one has kids
ya no one has kids over 30 years duh
check
5
china is the center of the world in the future
where they pay slave wages and have forced abortions
fu hollywood
6
people whisper and then there are loud explosions
over and over
annoying as hell
7
the asian woman cleans up the loser druggie man
men are kids and helpless and bad
women are wise leaders
8
another ripoff remake as others have pointed out
made worse
9
weak ending
shouldve paid the writers during the writers strike
10
organized crime and not fascist police states like what america is turning into is somehow the thing to worry about in the future
killing children in movies for the shock value like this is unforgivable
in this movie it actually adds nothing to the plot or to the movie as a whole
its simply bruce willis shooting an innocent child
i really liked the concept of the movie and at points it was clever but it is completely ruined by such a shock value stunt
im actually quite surprised that this film in the uk is only a 15 because of this
my additional comments on this movie is that the young bruce willis character played by joseph gordon levitt is just not believable which is disappointing as he was excellent in the movie brick which was also directed by rian johnson and is a really great film
it was by watching brick that made me want to see more of this directors work but now i am completely put off
many flaws in the storyline
extremely violent with no real meaning to that
movies like this one destroy everything philip k dick has achieved for science fiction
dont watch it if you dont want to waste your time
actions of many characters are either not understandable or simply stupid
e
h
why do loopers flee from their young alter ego instead of cooperating with it
the worst point is the violence  if you want to see people shot tortured mutilated this movie is right for you
subjects like telekinesis are added like ingredients to a failed salad dressing  without any idea behind it
very shameful altogether
a plot like this shoud not be produced these days
confusing and unconvincing storyline that never really gets startedjust kind of limps along and never builds a sense empathy between the audience and the characters
this is probably because theres no meaningful background established to the key players  who were they and how did they end up in this situation isnt focused upon
the movie also has sections of unnecessary repetition when they simply could have fast forwarded in time to 30 years later
the actions scenes are restrained in terms of visual impact while theres little or no humor and no opportunity for the actors to shine
no captivating or special moments or even scenes where there was a glimmer of something more inspiring intriguing or interesting
i had high expectations on the movie being a big fan of scifi genre
it started pretty well setting expectations high then follows a series of mediocre actors play copypaste from other movies  terminatorsigns style and such missing the originality
the movie lacks charm and feels like multiple pieces put together  dialogs feel to be taken from elsewhere other movies characters act in a extremely foreseeable way like you know what they are going to say or do
there are movies with lower quality of play and direction so this one i would put as mediocre
i personally wondered whether to stop it and watch something else couple of times
if you have no special demand for quality fun and original movie that would bring you pleasure from watching  you can try to watch this one
i love sf and time travel movies and i like bruce willis so i thought this might be a good movie to catch
boy was i wrong
this movie is dumb from beginning to ending
it has no redeeming characters to attach yourself too and it is excessively violent especially toward young children
i find it hard to believe that critics and others liked this ridiculous premise of a film
i wanted to get up and leave but i was half hoping that the movie would get better or at least amount to something in the end
sadly it just continued on with needless exposition and a ridiculously predictable ending
i wish i had my 1hr and 58 minutes back
i wasnt the only one to scoff at this scene but i probably was the only one to walk out
being that there was to be at least one other instance of this i had no choice
i have a problem with shoot em up bangbang films to begin with
death and destruction are just not entertaining to me
not that i watch the news but how about hollywood giving us something that the public cant see 3x a day on television
and exactly which one is feeding the other
i wasnt always this sensitive but im wise enough now to see whats wrong  and that is clearly the media
joseph gordonlevitt is a great actor and hes very easy on the eyes
making him up to look like a younger bruce willis however wasnt so easy to watch
as far as overall plot this one is a predictable have i seen this before
snoozer
to each their own is true but i have not been so bored by a scifi movie in a long time
i kept waiting for there to be plot
a story
something that kept me guessing
this movie never had a point
unlike many i thought the makeup to make gl look like bruce was amazing
you didnt see the resemblance until bruce finally enters the picture
the movie is one big circle
the circle is ended leaving you thinking what was the purpose
spoiler one interpretation could be the dough left in the end is what funded the little guy to become he he did
i am not here to pretend i am some great movie critic
this is only the second movie i have ever taken the time to write about
it is so others do not waste their money or lower at least their expectation
this film was a major disappointment
the trailer is promising
the idea is interesting and the quality of picture is good
bruce willis is in it so you would expect a decent action film
so i went to check it out
the beginning was alright action everything makes sense
but then in the middle of the movie it changes from action film to a boring not making any sense drama
its like the director forgot what movie he was making and started making something else
bruce williss character kills kids randomly who the heck came up with that idea
at some point while the movie was still going i wanted to leave the cinema it was that bad
dont get dazzled by the trailer and dont go watch this movie
watched looper featuring joseph gordonlevittthe dark knight rises as young joenarrator  bruce willisdie hard with a vengeance as older joe the lovely emily bluntyoung victoria as sara paul danocowboys amp aliens as young sethfrank brennanthe vampire dairies as old sethnoah seganfanboys as kid blue piper perabothe prestige as suzie tracie thomasthe devil wears prada as beatrix xu quinglife on a string as joes wife pierce gagnonone tree hill as cid garrett dillahuntraising hope as jesse and jeff daniels the purple rose of cairo as abe
