i recently saw sucker punch at an advance screening and thoroughly enjoyed it
to be honest i am the target demographic here
im a guy in his twenties who plays video games and enjoys fantasy movies and action
but this is a decent film overall
it appeals to my sensible adult side that appreciates a good well written film with great directing great acting and overall good cinematography
it also appeals to my twentysomething male side that loves sexy ladies guns killer robots dragons samurai and swordplay
the abundant cg is stunningly beautiful and doesnt feel overdone or become visually exhausting like some movies
this movie gets me
and i know that there will be a good number of people who dislike this movie dismissing it as juvenile or stupid
who dislike the amount of cgi used in this movie
i dont care
i love this movie for exactly what it is
a good movie that appeals to me in every way
even with millions of bullets flying through the air dozens of swords swinging amp the hundreds of punches these hotties take not one of these girls ever gets a single scratch during the battles
after the first brawl pitting the girls club against steampowered germans amp ferocious shooting planes its so painfully obvious that none of the girls will be in any real danger that the big budget special effects are just fluff amp overkill
whats the point of all the bullets amp bad guys if the chicks are indestructible
by the second battle its just so irritating watching these females punch kick shoot jump amp slice their way through crowds of bad guys when they could have just walked amp not gotten hurt
the story is clever but watching chicks that fight again amp again amp cant possibly be defeated is not onetenth as interesting as watching people who can actually die in battle
i heard nothing but bad things about this movie and i finally saw it
i fell in love with it
everything about it was so great and visual as excepted with zack snyder
what people lose grasp of i think is that 90 of the film is in babydolls head
therefore anything goes
yeah theyre dressed scandalously but what else would they be wearing in a young girls mind
and of course theyre going to be able to fight its all in her mind
it was a way of escaping for babydoll
if my mother and sister were just killed i might be a little screwed in the head too wouldnt you
i think people saw the preview and just assumed hot chicks and special effects
they didnt and usually never do think beyond what is shown to them on screen
i love synders work and its sad that this is by far his least appreciated film
im not sure who and why rated this masterpiece so bad i guess its just that you either love it or hate it
but the movie has everything and is for everyone
you just have to let yourself go in it and enjoy
well half naked and attractive girls kicking ass dance strip fantastic music flawlessly directed fight scenes drama sadness true nature of man who is just evil and one good girl is giving all to beat it
with every viewing you get something new cause its hard to understand it fully
but thats the beauty of it the story behind of another story dream within a dream and its all wrapped up in a box which is made to entertain and teach you something
thats what movies are for and thats why i love it
watch the extended version do not watch the theatrical version i repeat the extended version is 1000 better and it makes sense and it has two well known actors in it that were cut from the theatrical version
but be warned its darker but only because we get answers
the rest of this review must be nonfiller
why is it required that i type this much who knows
this movie with a proper ending can be compared with fight club if that doesnt convince you maybe my personal testimony will i almost never write reviews on here ive only written one other review other than this one
watch the extended cut
if anything watch it to see more of the high roller played by john hamm and to understand the ending
no words to say
its like  when poetry becomes a movies
im glad that the movie has 6
1 score because if everyone could understand that movie then a problem should arise to our mind
why the word we line in is like that
that movie addresses to few people
the colors the pictures the scenario the words  the acting was perfect
while i was watching this film i could image of an old person in a peaceful place talking to me about life and about my inner personality that controls my mind
just like an angel
sometimes it is hard to face the truth that comes up from our soul
sometimes we know it is hard to look at ourselves to put up a fight to our ego
what is the reality we have to defense
and what is the true meaning of the word reality
who teaches us what is real and how to laugh at lies
who chains us
and who holds the key that can set us free
you will be unprepared
it was the tag line for this movie and i was unprepared like literally it took my breathe away scenes after scenes
i really do have high hopes for this movie and it lived my expectations
since it was announced i told myself that i have watch this movie
the first twenty minutes has no dialog
no one said a thing but you can clearly see what they were going through
then it follows the sudden change of the movie setting
it started from the asylum then into a burlesque brothel
then every time baby doll emily browning dances she channels another world
a world where she and her friends sweet pea abby cornish rocket jena malone blondie vanessa hudgens amp amber jamie chung kicks asses of samurairobot warriors clock works dragons gores and robots from wwi to dragon lairs
and oh the action sequence is amazing amp the cgi effects was epic
this zac snyder film will blow your mind away with an incredible story line
so to make this long story short great movie
i recommend you to watch this
a lot can be said about this film but only when accompanied by clenched fists and a look of bewilderment
wooden acting onedimensional characters awful writing boring and repetitive action sequences a plot which is predictable in its journey to nowhere a lack of metastory a horrible degradation of wellloved songs evidently bad editing which is a rare one
all contributing to a pile of misogynist filth that makes you wonder why you still bother going to the cinema
this film characterizes everything that is wrong with modern cinema emphasizing looks above content and a type of stylised filmmaking which is long past its sell by date above common sense
dont see this film unless you enjoy developing an aversion of movies
i give this movie a 7 out of 10
the movie is about a young girl who is sent into an asylum by her evil step dad and then creates and alternate reality in her head in order to find a way to escape
emily browning did an amazing job at portraying baby doll her real name in the film was not used because they were given stripper names
this was not just a normal asylum
during the film the director zack snyder used many different elements including music and camera angles to give a sense of suspense or shock during the scenes
what i think makes this such a great film is because it is very serious about a girl being trapped and misused however in her alternate realities baby doll gets to fight in many engaging action scenes throughout the movie instead of watching her dance on stage
which also helps make the movie more about the character and not about half naked girls dancing on stage for fat old men smoking cigars
after watching the dvd i actually felt compelled to go online and check the ages of these girls
i liked the movie but again i felt uncomfortable at times
i liked this movie which is kind of weird because at any moment i felt like the movie might pause itself and chris hanson of nbc datelines  to catch a predator might appear and ask me why did i come here and did i know what was i watching
humor well sorta
however i want to believe the movie was trying to reach the japanese anime devotees but i felt the message of its genre wasnt clear enough
i gave it a 7 but the chris hanson fans might statutorily call it more like 5 to 15
i totally love it
the story the acting the cg amp the music
movies are made to entertained and i was
and it had a metaphor which was great
the first time i saw it i didnt quite understood it mostly because as many other people im not used to think to understand a movie
but after watching it a couple of times it becomes more a more clear to me
besides i love the music so much it wasnt a drag
i will see this movie again and again  i dont know what else to say
i dont usually give reviews to movies just because i think people like so many different things but i figure this would be my way to recommend this amazing film to you
give it a try im sure you wont be disappointed
this is one of he best movies ive ever seen
its real and unreal at the same time its gripping and emotionally engaging
its also full of eye candy but that only adds to the feel of some parts being unreal and because of that they are also beautiful while the reality is cruel and unforgiving
the cast was chosen excellently the music and sounds were beyond perfect
well i guess i am not a really good critic but if a movie makes me register to a site just to worship it than that movie has accomplished something thousands of others couldnt
i strongly advise anyone to go on and watch this movie its a masterpiece
p
s
if you got scared of how too artistic or too cruel this movie is at the very beginning than give it an other try you wont regret it
i saw this show with no expectations
in fact i didnt even know the plot really
i have to say its the best show i have seen all year
possibly even longer
it has me so gripped that i cant stop talking about it to everyone i know
it leaves so much to interpretation that you cant help but talk about it with others that have seen it
i highly recommend this show
the story is very deep and dark
i thought the acting was perfect
the dream sequences and slowmotion cgi was amazing
the best part is that it didnt take anything away from the story
it wasnt just senseless violence
i am very surprised at the gross and rating
i guess there are people that had some high expectations and even possibly didnt understand it
but please go see for yourself
most of the movie took place inside the fantasy world minds of young women committed to a mental hospital
there was a fantasy world inside the fantasy worldkind of like a play within a play
the film dealt with a very mature subject molestion without actually showing any disturbing scenes to gross you out unlike the tv show criminal minds for example
the young women fought their demons in a video gamelike fantasy world as a kind of out of body experience
killing dragons and nazis in the fantasy was slaying their own personal monsters in their minds
the plot was original and unique
the actresses played their roles to perfection and scott glenn was excellent
i believe in guardian angels and have worked with patients who have had out of body experiences so the movie fit well into my personal belief system
it was entertaining exciting and surprising
my sons got it and liked it
probably the best movie i have seen in the last 5 years
i already love zach synders work 300 and watchmen are 2 of my favourite films ever
sucker punch is such a great movie i have watched it twice already
i must say that the extended version is much better and i would recommend anyone to see that for your first viewing
i knew people would slate this movie as the trailer makes this film out to be something that it isnt
this movie has so much to offer you just need to watch it with an open mind
to fully understand this movie takes a little work from the viewer ive watched it twice and i still come up with differnt theories as to what happened but thats what i like most about it
soundtrack is also amazing
sucker punch is a knockout
a visual masterpiece with enough story and acting to make it feel substantial
if you combine heavy metal suspiria tron kill bill big trouble in little china along with the visual flair of 300 you end up here
to call this film psychedelic is to make the understatement of the year
zack snyder definitely continues to improve as a filmmaker even if dawn of the dead is just about perfect
the characterization were engaging and i enjoyed the multilayered reality especially the transition to the higherlevel fantasies
gets a 10 from me and i hope this trend toward intellectually stimulating special effects extravaganzas continues
i didnt realize id enjoy the fantasy imagery as much as i did
oh and the soundtrack is just perfect
perfect
when i bought the ticket my expectations werent high i assumed that ill be watching some standard action film with lovely girls and good action sequences but what i got surpassed all of the above and more
in the whole duration of the movie i managed to blink only twice as my sore eyes are so happy to remind me at the moment
the story line is superb action sequences interwoven with such mastery that they didnt stood out new actors to me came together better than puzzles and combined with stunning graphic scenery they deliver the best story i have seen in this genre
i believe some my have their views of the matter but in my eyes this one is shame to miss on the silver screen
originally i decided to watch the movie because of emily browning
loved her in uninvited
i thought the movie was a pretty cool action movie with all the special features and cool fantasy world battles
but it was just too confusing with its storyline for me
it was only after i found a movie explanation that i could finally understand it
after understanding the moviei thought the movie was pretty great especially with all the thinking out of the box and mess with your head analyzing you gotta do to understand the movie
but without a explanation its would have just been an action movie about hot girls kicking butt in a weird fantasy world
the visuals are made for lana del rey on acid
the plot thickens with some corn starch as i stream for more
my mother has called cavin and then i digress that this film is justified through the mise enscene that appeals to a niche market whilst also entertaining the masses of abortions
the movie itself was a work of art
i am a woman and not really into the whole scifi thing but this movie was excellent
it made your brain work and stuck in your mind
there were only one or two parts where i thought can we just get on with the story
other than that it kept my attention
the outfits werent worse than what ive seen some girls on nickelodeon wearing
if your older and not into the scifi thing then this is not the movie for you and you probably will think its stupid
its aimed towards the teenage audience not towards thirty or forty year olds
its a movie for those who want to escape from reality and not a romantic comedy
its supposed to be crazy and unpredictable
shes in a mental institution for a reason
so if youre looking to escape form reality or just watch something crazy this is the movie for you
this film was not at all what i expected
in all honesty i was beginning to be somewhat disappointed about halfway through the movie but the film really brings it in for an amazing ending
like others i expected something visually stimulating based on trailers and this film goes beyond those expectations
i did think some of the action scenes were a little too long and too much focus on using slowmotion techniques with zooming in on details but the film as a whole more than makes up for it
the story is an amazing one
i do wish they developed the background story more and at times i was wishing they made more obvious transitions between all of the alternate realities present but upon seeing the film in its entirety i think they did a great job overall
the story is heartwrenching and is one that makes you think about your own life
all in all they may have done things a little differently than i wanted but in the end the film is absolutely not a letdown and leaves me really wanting to focus internally
something i will definitely be adding to my collection
well the movie is completely underrated here
thats why im leaving this brief review
its zack snyders film not for everyone
the movie is dark music is good plot is excellent three cgis setups are from games  fantasy wwi and scifi
its a kind of mix of everything
but the major plot is brilliant and the ending is great
you dont need to concentrate on cgi scenes or their quality
zack snyder could equally insert anime or just pictures instead with the same effect it doesnt really matter
the movies is not about manga girls acting in games
when you watch all this darkness of the clinics recreated by zack snyder and the final medical verdict made and you know a bit history of american psychiatry you start thinking more about dark american past and where all these evil people came from
surely not from dreams of the poor girl
i have to say i thoroughly enjoyed this gem of a film
i went in to the cinema not expecting much because of all the bad reviews it received but came out pleased and surprised and baffled at the same time as to why it was slashed by the critics
the most common arguments by the critics was that it lacked a story linegood dialogue ampwas demeaning to women
this is completely and utterly wrong
anyone with half a brain would pick up the storyline although it could be interpreted differently the dialogue was appropriate to the film genreu dont expect them to speak in a 17th century shakespearan styleamp i thought it was empowering to women
yes the girls were in tight cleavage baring attire most of the time but the film sent out a message of never give in amp fight for your rights and your freedom
it is fun actionfilled colourful underrated and though provoking
i hate this phrase but this movie truly shows girl power
its extremely sad but it shows what a person can rise above and how if someone really wants something to rise above they can
like a quote from the movie you have all the weapons now fight
it also proves that there are people who will sacrifice themselves for someone they care about or a cause that they care about
i love how they showed the theater when baby doll first gets there and then she ends up acting out scenarios in her head that describe how shes feeling how it feels to fight for something
the best part i think is the fact that they say everyone has a guardian angel they come in different forms an old man one day and a young girl the next
most of all that they arent here to fight your battles youre here to fight your battles they are just here to show you the way and to keep you going
overall i think this is a mustsee
the movie starts out cool gets weird gets really good and goes back and fourth a lot your sorta lost and then towards the end it all makes sense
its written very well they have a lot of great scenes
the cast is very well placed the scripts totally fine and it has very good production as well as directing and all that other stuff
i hope they make more like this film and its been a lot of fun and i will defiantly watch it again in the future
the only bad thing is at first your totally lost but thats how they want it to be
also i would of preferred someone else besides emily browning to play the main character
all in all have fun it has plenty of brilliant action scenes
if your someone older then you might not like it at all
sucker punch one of the most interesting movies that ever hit the silver screen
the movie really captured the crowds attention with its it uniqueness of story unbelievable effects and great directing
though might not be called an oscar movie its twist and turns definitely leaves you talking about it
aside from its noteworthy plot the movie also shows values of courage independence friendship selfsacrifice and many more
its imaginative director zack snyderand all the other people who worked behind the scenes really took their audience to another world
of course a movie is not a movie without the actors and actresses and for me at least they were very good
sucker punch is the kind of movie you want to watch with your friends or siblings because it really exemplified being there for each other and working as a team
to those people who said they did not understand the movie i suggest watching it again and this time only focus on the movie and i assure you will see its magnificence
i recommend this movie to everyone
me being a fan of zack snyders movies i went into see sucker punch with the correct level of expectations and i came out happy
the movie similar to other snyders movies is fantasy based and high on style with stunning slowmotion action scenes and a pulsating background score
if you expect a classic cinematic masterpiece give this one a miss
this movie needs to be seen as a out n out commercial entertainer
girls ruled the movie and they looked hotparticularly jamie chung
great art direction and good editing
this movie might not do well in us but will definitely rake in the moola in orient countries
snyders creative imagination knows no bound
300  watchmen and now this movie
i would definitely watch this movie again
now waiting for snyders superman reboot
i normally do not write reviews for movies however when a movie has left an impression on me i feel compelled to do so
i actually had high expectations for sucker punch and this movie exceeded those expectations
its not just a bunch of hot girls in skimpy outfits kicking trash and an overabundant amount of cgi
the story is fantastic easy to follow and downright original
i can guarantee that the people who do not like this movie are stuck up and have no imagination and are probably the kind of people i wouldnt want to hang out with
if you arent one of these people then i promise you will love it from start to finish
i can only wish more movies brought such entertainment and originality
first i would like to thank my dear friends for making me watch this awesome movie
this was so wicked cool man
lots of nice girls for eyecandy and a amazing story
watch it
sucker punch is an epic action fantasy that takes us into the vivid imagination of a young girl whose dream world provides the ultimate escape from her darker reality
unrestrained by the boundaries of time and place she is free to go where her mind takes her and her incredible adventures blur the lines between whats real and what is imaginary
she has been locked away against her will but babydoll emily browning has not lost her will to survive
zach snyder paints another masterpiece
visually spectacular and poetic director extraordinary great style and set the same of avatar soundtrack powerful good cast emily browing is very good and incredibly original plot
the first very long sequence is to be left openmouthed to the movies a lot and we were ready to see a movie casino and full of rhythm wich still are just started
but all in silence he has kidnapped has just silenced
and who often goes to the movies know what its like this
imho the only flaw is that the movie is a little too short so i hope in a directos cut in bluray
if you liked 300 or watchmen this is an absolutely must see
i saw this at warner bros
where i work
really like zachs visual style but man is he weak on story
so many things are not well played out
the girls are at an asylum but no one acts crazy
the fantasy world of the movie feels like set pieces for an upcoming video game
there are times when the girls seem to be capable of anything and other times hopelessly ineffective
one last thing if youre going to use rock music in a score use the originals or at least have killer versions by new artists
glad i saw it but im really getting tired of cartoon movies and cartoon characters
zach snyder has so much promise in this industry and im really pulling for him but i think his only home run so far has been 300
i have been a fan to mr
zack since the movie 300
a total of 5 years in making will be paid off when you watch this one
i love the gradient colors stunning cgi and video game based hack and slash stunts
plot is simple but the execution is tough
zack had done a beautiful job in presenting this movie with his own glamor style
emily does justice to the character with her cheesy looks and decent acting
the rest of the crew is apt to their roles
music is very nice which will mix up to the scenes
overall an average story with great screenplay with gorgeous visuals which makes you to stick to your seat
a brave 810 for this baby doll
this movie gives me ambivalent feelings
it has excellent technical aspects as one would expect from zack snyder but i rather more enjoyed the legend of the guardians than this one which although was an animated one about owls had more story and worthy visual effects than this one
mistake me not  the fx in this movie are super cooland the eyecandy kicking their way through the plot are well worth it
but it is the plot that i cannot grasp
the director has definitely succeeded in blurring the lines between reality and fantasy and you do get to understand the way things go even though it appears to be fantasy which is the basis of this film  as per tag line and storyline a girl dreams of other things to plot of escape in a very glum asylum however after sitting for nearly 2 hours with this one i cant keep wondering
whats the point of this film
i think its a highly impressive movie with a lot of energy and emotion in fact it strikes people a lot because some of these things can happen in real life
however i believe strongly of the fact that the stories of how the other characters  the 4 friends of the main character and the dancing teacher got into the mental place also how the owner of the place got it for starters it certainly needs more story and work behind it
i also think it could have been just a bit more realistic
its a shame how a simple but powerful movie could have had more in it
as a summery of all it had the best storyline for a suspensefulsadisticthriller movie but it was like a draft as if we could have heard the history behind the place
i also think its a big shame how the movies a dream of a dream because it kills the feeling in it
this movie was just fantastic
it may not seem like its good but do not believe the critics
this is a 100 fantastic all the way through for most moviegoers
do you want a emotional story
check
just want to see some bad ass action girls kill monsters
check
do you want a thought provoking make you think kind of movie
check
in literally the first 30 seconds to a minute i was already hit emotionally
i dont know whybut i can take a guess what set me off the first scene got to me in a way no other film has
and it held me there
this movie was just so good any movie aficionado steam punk fan action movie fan deep emotional story lovers this movie is a must see
visually stunning interesting amp action packed
yes
little dialog mediocre acting sloppy story line amp bizarre
indeed
i think this film will come down to personal taste
its great for its production values but poor for everything else my opinion
as another member stated its like a 120 min music video
that doesnt mean its bad just not my taste
where i dont feel cheated in any way by watching it i have no interest in seeing it again
if you like watching sexy women in an action film then go for it
if you like good acting and strong story line then id stay away
thus the rating of 5
its a take it or leave it for me
the imagery on screen in this film is absolutely amazing
there is some dialog and filler between the incredible awesomeness that we could really do without but other than that its unbelievable
im not kidding
this movie was truly awesome in the true sense of the word
ive never read a comic book in my life but if this is what comics are like  i love comics
movies just dont get any cooler than this
i couldnt care less about the storyline
i dont even know if they were speaking english
this movie has style right from frame one
aaron simms shows his brilliance
aaron is amazing
i have never been as slackjaw awe stuck watching as film as i was with sucker punch
im going to edit my copy down to the hour or so that it should be and watch it every night
i imagine that not only is it fun to watch but it must have been fun to make
it has all the shots and camera moves that weve all wanted to see and do  but no one was ever been brave enough to do
for starters it was definitely something unique faltering in those small places which could have possibly made this movie one to remember
pretty girls battling in high heels is probably not the best way to make a lasting impression with viewers and the fact being they have all done a very good job made it easier for me to like sucker punch
the fighting scenes in the movie could have been better shorter not the effects but the whole approach seemed kind of monotonous
and also taking the high roller scene off the reel has probably caused a lot of damage to the movie
emily browningthe best reason at first i watched this movie for more than qualifies for the role of baby doll
sucker punch is not a movie where every single thing is explained it leaves the audience to figure most of it out
looking for an action movie with a brain
its right here
im going to keep this brief
this film is packed full of metaphors the entire fight scenes for example if you are of the intelligence to understand these metaphors then you will find the film highly enjoyable
however if you are say the type of person who is easily confused by traffic lights then you will not enjoy this film
the plot of the film makes perfect sense if you can follow it and it saddens me that so many people have slated a good film because they are mentally incapable of doing so
in my opinion this film was far better than 300 but not as good watchmen which is also worthy of higher acclaim
well done zach keep up the good work
first of all let us have a quick review about the director zack snyder zack is the director for both hits 300 amp watchmen regardless both story lines the direction was a remarkable trademark for snyders slow motion action amp camera angles
this is what is happening here in sucker punch the movies contains beautiful girls with big guns amp acrobatic abilities to deliver memorable action packed sequences in a number of fantasy world created from the main characters baby doll imagination
but thats that
the story youll either ok with it not love it or totally hate it
as it seems that snyder also screen writer created the action amp fantasy sequences amp still havent finished the main plot idea to back up the sequences
overall if your are looking for girls with big guns thats the movie
either than that just avoid i personally enjoyed the movie as i knew what i was getting into
for the most part i enjoyed sucker punch
visually the film is amazing as snyders films always are but i feel hes getting a little too comfortable with using his trademark slowmotionbullettime effects in everything he does
i really would like to see him do something without that as a creative crutch
it worked well in 300 since it was primarily an action film and watchmen was long enough that these effects were merely occasional artistic flairs and made sense
in sucker punch theres too much of this and it stands out primarily due to the backandforth nature of this films narrative structure jumping in and out from reality to fantasy whereas these effects only appear in the fantasy segments
otherwise i liked the story a positive message told through a very down beat story and the film also benefits from a good throwback high energy edgy pop soundtrack
the narrated bit at the end however was a tad heavyhanded
yeah its one of those movies which youre either like wtf am i watching
or wow this is so bad ass
for me it was the latter
the story is about this girl in an institution where she uses dance as her survival
her dance takes her into this weird but amazingly shown places where she basically fights off real problems shown as monsters amp magic
the ending in my opinion was really unexpected and awesome
the cinematography is stunning and so are the soundtracks
the star cast not famous but gorgeous does a pretty good job too specially the lead
if youre into details the weapons swords statues castles everything is right to a perfection
the only reason someone would hate this movie is if they try to watch it with logic
keep an empty mind and let the movie flow
just enjoy it without applying thoughts
ninja cheerleaders with guns fighting robots zombie nazis and dragons
im not sure what else you need to say but imdb wants ten lines
how about the jacket meets 300 and sin city
all in all a thrill ride with plot twists that keep you guessing the entire time
the story line is more about crazy situations than plot exactly but the stunning visual effects more than make up for any plot holes
i would put this slightly ahead of sin city and 300also graphic novelsjust for the visual effects and cinematography
the originality of the story earned it an extra star from me
there are a couple places where the story is disjointed but overall it is complex
you can discuss the fine points of exactly what each person thinks really happened around the water cooler
or just watch it for the cheerleaders
either way it is worth seeing worth seeing twice and worth owning
so i concluded my snyder bash with sucker punch feautring an all female cast polar opposite of snyders all 300 male cast
this featured emily browningthe host as baby doll vanessa hudgensbeastly as blondie abbie cornishrobocop as sweet pea jamie chungpremium rush as amber and my favorite out of the bunch jenna malonethe hunger gamescatching fire also frequent snyder collabrator carla guginosin city as madame gorski and the main villain oscar issacrobin hood as blue and guest appearances by jon hammmad men as high roller and scott glennsecritariat as wiseman i really like this movie because each sequence was a tribute to each genre is nerd culture japaneseanimesteampunkmedievalfantasy and my favorite science fiction also i really enjoyed the lesson it taught on bad times dont last forever also once again amazing direction by zack snyderman of steel amp costume design by michael wilkinsonman of steel and score by tyler batesconan the barbarian also this gets me excited for snyders next film man of steel
d 710
sucker punch is a true rollercoaster ride that any 1222 male will strap into and scream the whole way
combining hot women action guns steampunk nazi zombies futuristic robots orcs dragons eyegasm visuals and slow motion cgi this movie really does hit a home run
with a subtle hidden storymeaning behind it and an amazing soundtrack snyderdirector should feel proud of himself
this is the type of movie where you expect a cheesy gunsblazing video game like thrill fest and receive one but the amazing thing is you come out of it feeling high on life and awesome instead of angry that 2 hours of your life are down the drain
saying much more would spoil but trust me if i were to say more it would be more compliments about the hidden story the true meaning of the title and the sinister jokerlike acting from oscar isaacblue jones
two thumbsup will watch again and again and again
can you get into mindwarping action with impressive special effects
director zack snyder hopes so
a young girl named baby dollemily browningis placed in a 1950s era asylum by her abusive stepfathergerard plunkett who actually pays to have her scheduled for a lobotomy
baby doll must enter a mental fantasy world to cope with her new situation
in this alternate reality she meets a wise manscott glennthat provides her a plan to escape both her physical and fantasy worlds
in order to escape she will need the help of some accomplices to steal five objects in order to break away from her mental institution prison
her attractive partners are played by abbie cornish vanessa hudgens jena malone and jamie chung
others featured carla gugino jon hamm oscar isaac and ron selmour
zack snyder is spoiling us with great visual movies and this one is not exception
in spite of the bad reviews by some of the socalled specialized critics the movie is quite interesting
we get to travel inside the mind of this girl called babydoll while shes trying to get herself free from this mental asylum that her stepfather managed to get her in dragging at the same time the other girls that befriended with her
the catch in here is that every step towards freedom is a battle that they fight
we get to see all these actresses that we wouldnt normally see in an actionfantasy movie and they kickass
along with a great visual we get a great score functioning perfectly
ultimately this a movie about greed human exploitation with a mask of respectability survival and freedom
