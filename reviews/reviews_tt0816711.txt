"\nWhat a waste of money.... and I do not only mean for the tickets. The\nwhole production must have been quite expensive. And I guess the\ntaxpayer pays for all scenes where the US Navy or Airforce shows up?\nFor what? The movie failed on all accounts and didn't even manage to\ncreate tension or scare people. The audience even started laughing in\ncertain scenes. Uff I really don't know where to start: Satellite\nphones that work inside steel vessels, EMP kills electronics including\nsatellite phones but only hours late they seem to be working again,\namputations that don't cause the victim to bleed to death, kids that\nare totally cool after losing their families (high five!).... and i\ncould go on and on. By the way the sponsors of the movie must have been\nDuct tape and Pepsi. The only creepy feeling i get is that movies like\nthis or \"The Purge\" play a certain role to prepare society for future\napocalyptic events. God bless America!\n"
"\nThe only movie I have ever seen that is worse than this is Alien Vs.\nPredator. No blood, no gore, no swearing, no zombie movie. Brad Pitt's\narrogance and feeling of self-worth will suffocate you as you watch\nthis steaming pile of cr*p. I don't even care that it doesn't resemble\nthe book, it was a terrible movie no matter how you slice it.\nApparently Brad's artistic addition to the movie was that when humans\nbecome ill the zombies won't attack them...yet one of the guys who help\nSir. Brad super-UN inspector Pitt only has an injured knee, not an\nillness. Brad Pitt is the only actor in this movie that has any real\nscreen time, it might as well be called \"Brad Pitt saves the world (in\nthe most uninteresting 2 hours ever). This movie is bad and anyone\ninvolved in writing/directing/producing it should feel bad.<br><br>I hate you Brad Pitt, with every bone in my body. Since you \"made this\nfilm for your kids\" by giving it a PG-13 rating I hope one day they\ngrow up, read the book, and despise what you created.\n"
"\nWhat in the hell has happened to BRAD PITT. Or is it just that he being\na producer is trying to rake in money for what is a pile of sh*t of a\nmovie.. A Zombie movie without man eating zombies and blood and\ngore....I mean what the f*** piece of garbage is this.The direction and\nthe story is as if some 10 year old kid has written and directed it.\nAnd what has happened to brad pitts standards....I guess he is only\ngoing downhill as far as his recent movies are concerned like killing\nthem softly and this piece of sh*t.... Its a shame to the zombie movie\nfranchise and does not even qualify to b on any sort of list of that\nsort not even from the bottom......hell I cant even complete the 10\nlines necessary to write a review on IMDb but still I wanted to express\nmy hate for this piece of sh*t that I certainly had to write this down.<br><br>Save yourself some money.....donate it but don't go to watch this\n"
"\nAbout halfway through my viewing of World War Z, I was ready to walk\nout. Then I realized something, I was in my own home. This movie made\nme want to leave my own home. I think that says something about it<br><br>Anyways on to the film, the plot so incredibly flimsy it makes houses\nof cards look like architectural wonders and Brad Pitt's character\n(Gerry, I think it was?) is one of the worst movie hero's I've ever\nseen. His character had such little depth to him and he does so many\nthings perfectly that's it's just downright bizarre. And that's your\nproblem, he's not human, he's a cardboard cutout of a human<br><br>The film is also riddled with clich√©s, from the \"you couldn't possibly\nunderstand\" line to the typical happy family with two kids at the\nbeginning. There's nothing new here, nothing at all. That's another\nreason not to see this movie.<br><br>So in case you didn't figure out my opinion on this, it's terrible. Do\nnot see. Worst movie of 2013 for me.\n"
"\nBrad Pitt in a world full of zombies very awesome? Yeah... I don't\nthink so. Seeing the early trailers for World War Z,I knew it was gonna\nbe a cheap flick. The zombies were beyond stupid... climbing like ants!\nAre you kidding me? All those CGI zombies look like complete garbage\nnor they didn't even look threatening. All they do is scream like\nidiots. I want zombies to look scary as hell with their limbs open and\nblood coming out of there mouth. NO!! we get stupid PG-13 version of it\nbecause of \"money\" since its gonna target teenagers mostly that are\nprobably gonna say \"VERY GOOD FILM 10/10.\" Now the action was quite\nboring including the dumb plot- line that wasn't interesting at all.\nBored me silly! I've become a zombie myself for watching this piece of\ngarbage. <br><br>World War Z is a 0 for me.\n"
"\nWhen the totality of life on earth as we know it is threatened by a\nhorrible contagion that turns people into crazed, rabid killers in\nunder 30 seconds, Brad Pitt's character gets no more freaked out than\nif he were dealing with a paper jam in a photo copier.<br><br>The writing, pacing and acting in this film are on the level of an 8th\ngrade kids spinning wild fantasy. This happens! then this happens! then\nthis! then the zombies come! then the helicopter saves them at the last\nsecond!<br><br>Zombies on the planes! blow a hole in it so they all get sucked out but\nBrad and his girlfriend.<br><br>Plane crash! everyone dies but brad and his Israeli girlfriend, who's\nup walking around without a scratch.<br><br>Never mind the flight crew, Pitt walks a few miles though he's run\nthrough with a piece of metal.<br><br>Wakes up 3 days later in his street clothes, still pretty clean, all\npatched up &amp; ready for more action.<br><br>And on it goes. This film is an insult to the viewer.\n"
"\nOK, i just finished watching. No WW Z is not good at all. I gave it on\nIMDb a (1/10).<br><br>Maybe the worst expensive movie ever made. No character development, no\nsuspense, implausible action sequences, no horror, not a single drop of\nblood, lot of useless scenes with the best scenes already spoiled in\nthe trailer and the worst is a complete out of sync 30min ending\nsequence. <br><br>From minute 76 on you believe you are in a different B zombie movie\nthat a high school kid could produce for $10,000. It's just crazy bad\nand the person responsible for this remake should be shoot himself\nbecause he ruined whatever was left of this movie at this time. Hope\nthat there will be a directors cut to see what the original ending\nlooked like.<br><br>And they really talking abut a follow-up to this?\n"
"\nSpoiler, this movie is stupid.<br><br>Aside from having nothing to do with the book other than some locations\nand character names, it is full of logic flaws and a rather asinine\nplot.<br><br>Lets start with the fact that the book was good, really good, and the\ngo with the fact that Pitt and his crew decided to steal its name wipe\ntheir arses with the rest.<br><br>I am going to start and end with the fundamental flaw in the premise of\nthe movie that never existed in the book. Somehow it takes pitstain's\ncharacter countless days and three continents to figure out that the\nzombies don't attack the terminally ill, something that could have been\nfigured out in an hour at any local hospital. Premise fail and the\npurdy graffics and lack of character dimension don't make up for the\nrest.<br><br>Do yourself a favor and read the book. You'll be hooked in less than\nthe two hours of this piece of trash wasted.\n"
"\ntechnical after 5-10 you had to walk out of this movie as your jumping\nfrom one plot hole to the next plot hole basically I should vote 0/10\nbut i could see it for free so 1/10 is OK besides from the plot holes\n(this movie has no real story) the directing and camera movement is\nawful too you cant see anything with this shaking and dark mess you\ncant even see who is a zombie from 3m onward distance to make a zombie\nmovie with pg16 is genius too I don't even know why they are called\nzombies <br><br>i am surprised they didn't call-in the Prometheus scientist team again\nwhich has already proved it can handle such stuff<br><br>about the people you know that brad Pitt will survive and about the\nrest you don't care<br><br>lol lol lol what a crap movie\n"
"\nLet me start off by saying I haven't read the book yet, so I have no\nidea how they compare. However, this was a pretty good movie overall.\nMany zombie movies are merely mindless gore and violence disguised\nwithin some fragile thing that doesn't even deserve to be called a\nplot. However, World War Z has a much better plot than most other\nzombie movies. One thing I noticed right away is that this movie\nactually made me jump in surprise several times. It's very suspenseful,\nand truly worthy of being called a \"zombie horror movie,\" as opposed to\nthe plethora of predictable, unsuspenseful zombie movies that have come\nout of Hollywood. Brad Pitt does a great job in his role, although I\nfelt his character lacked definition in many ways. It would be nice if\nthey had \"fleshed out\" the characters a bit more. <br><br>Overall, this movie is definitely worth the watch if you have a couple\nhours to spare. Not the best movie ever made, but a pretty good one.\n"
"\nI was really excited about seeing this movie, but left underwhelmed. I\nthought the acting was lackluster, the story very linear and\npredictable, with no interesting plot twists or great moments of\nrevelation.<br><br>This role didn't suit Brad Pitt - I'm too big a fan of his to say he\nwas poor, but I found his character quite shallow and unengaging. I\ncouldn't provide a detailed description of his character if I had to.\nEverything worked out for him conveniently throughout, and of course he\nis the one who saves the day - without too great an effort of problem\nsolving either.<br><br>Overall, the movie wasn't bad, but it certainly wasn't great either.\nWouldn't recommend for those who value a solid storyline over all else.<br><br>Although it is a TV series, I consider AMC's The Walking Dead a far\nsuperior journey into what could come of a zombie apocalypse - with\nmore engaging drama, character development and suspense. Yes, there is\nfar more time for The Walking Dead to achieve this, but even in episode\n1 of the series these superiorities are evident.\n"
"\nFirst I didn't even understand why was this named a WORLDWAR movie.\nThere is NO WAR. The story is about Zombies , which originated from an\nUNDEFINED source. A vaccine is discovered at the last 15 minutes of\nfilm , and the rest of film totally disappointed.<br><br>The 3D effects are pretty good. The effects and sound department has\ndone a good job. But nothing matters if the story is such bad. There is\nno story at all for the film. <br><br>Only go to the cinemas if you want to waste your money or want a nice\nsleep . <br><br>As a whole The movie is a WASTE !\n"
"\nDidn't know what to expect when we got this film, had read a brief\nsynopsis and it sounded good - plus we like Brad Pitt. What a\nroller-coaster of a film! Well made, full of action, pretty scary in\nparts (prepare to scream a couple of times at least), good cast and\ngood acting. The story line is interesting and it does make you think\nhow this would affect you in real life, what would you do? how would\nyou cope? what about your family? It's also set on a global scale, with\nseveral countries being featured in the film. All of a sudden, the\nworld is a very unsafe and unpredictable place. Good luck. If you fancy\na film that is a little bit different, will play on your emotions and\nmake you think twice about stuff, then give this a go.\n"
"\nThis movie was walk out worthy. Anyone giving this garbage more than 3\nof 10 stars either don't care about ridiculously intelligence insulting\nplot holes. For example: you are in a plane that crashes because a\nfight broke out with zombies. You happen to be flying over a country\nyou have never been to. You promptly pull yourself together from the\nplane crash and walk directly to a \"secret research facility\" miles\naway to find the cure. This was supposed to be somewhat \"smart\" movie.\nBut ended up being just dumb as Jurassic World which never set out to\nhave an intriguing plot or mystery of any kind. I wish I could give\nthis movie a 0.5 of 10. With budget and the source material they had to\nwork with they did worse than I could have imagined. This movie is the\n\"walk out worthy\" category.\n"
"\nAfter hearing the news this was to made (being a fan of the book)to the\nlong drawn battle for the rights to film it I was pant wettingly\nexcited about this film.......well I wasted my pee basically.<br><br>No spoilers from me here.<br><br>Terrible film Terrible to even be touted as World War Z as zero\nresemblance to the book Terrible script Terrible characters and a\nterrible ending.<br><br>Like my review title says JUST READ THE BOOK! if you want a decent\nzombie apocalypse tale<br><br>Watch the film if you don't actually like the zombie genre and are to\nmuch of wuss to watch a real zombie flick but want to look cool to you\nhipster friends.<br><br>Mr Pitt all that fuss for the rights? You should be ashamed.\n"
"\nIt's almost impossible to do justice to a great book in two hours, but\nthey could have at least tried, rather than simply using the name on a\nalmost entirely different story. But I knew that going in.<br><br>So I say disappointing because the story was just dull and rather\nsilly. Not much happened during the whole movie, nothing much developed\nstory-wise or character-wise, the zombies were not very zombie like,\nand the cleverness of the original material was completely missing in\naction.<br><br>I'm sure they could make a good movie on a tenth the budget, instead of\na not so good action blockbuster for hundreds of millions.\n"
"\nWhat kind of zombie movie is this? The kind of bloodless,\nfamily-friendly PG-13 fare that Hollywood churns out now apparently,\nand I hated it. What kind of ZOMBIE movie has no blood in it? Even the\nzombies themselves just look like regular people with a few minor\nbloodless wounds that run around. They aren't scary, they aren't gory,\nthey aren't worth watching. I haven't seen such a poor excuse for\nzombies since I AM LEGEND.<br><br>I have seen zombie movies before where somebody was bitten and they\namputated the affected limb. Take Day of the Dead for example, one of\nthe bloodiest, goriest movies I have ever seen. They show the gore in\nall its gory glory. In World War Z? Nah, no blood, cut away, don't\nshock the audience, don't show anything. In fact I don't think I saw\none person die in this movie.<br><br>I suppose if you want to take the kids to see a zombie movie, this\nwould be the one to go to.\n"
"\nI was about 30 minutes into World War Z when it became glaringly\napparent that the filmmakers were going through great lengths to avoid\nincluding blood and violence. Honestly, historically speaking, gore has\nprobably been more important to the zombie genre than story (which is\nincredibly weak in this movie, anyway). Pitt is terribly unconvincing\nas a stay-at-home dad that is secretly a badass (and apparently way\nsmarter than the worldwide scientific community). If you genuinely like\nzombie movies, you will not like World War Z. If you like the book,\nyou'll be disappointed by this movie. Apparently, Brad Pitt is going\naround saying he wanted this movie to be PG-13, so his kids could see\nit. That's absolutely untrue. This movie is PG-13, so they could make a\nprofit. It had an incredibly high budget, and they needed it to be more\naccessible, as to recoup that money. Make no mistake, this is a Brad\nPitt vanity project.\n"
"\nI had high hopes for this movie after seeing the trailers, and then\nfinding out its a sort of new twist on zombie stories. Upon finally\nwatching it, it seemed almost lazy to me. <br><br>They didn't do a good job of explaining how the characters come up with\ntheir theories and from what I could tell, they also didn't explain how\nthis whole phenomena began. It just happened, apparently, and then\nended (I guess?). I would have liked a more solid ending. <br><br>In a way, the 'unknown' factor made it seem a little more real. If this\nzombie apocalypse were to take place that suddenly, I suppose there\nwouldn't be an easy fix. But I really did not like their solution nor\ndo I understand how they came up with the idea of this solution. <br><br>Overall, the action was entertaining and I liked the characters, but\nthis isn't a movie that would stick in my mind as a thought-provoking\ntale at all.\n"
"\nThis was truly awful. I'm actually a little miffed about it. I read\nWorld War Z and it was a really good book. I don't understand how they\nare allowed to call this movie the same name, it literally had nothing\nto do with the book!!! I've seen book to movie adaptations that strayed\nfrom the book before, but never anything like this. Literally the\nentire plot, every single character in the movie, does not exist in the\nbook!!! There's no \"trying to find a cure\" thread in the book at all,\nyet, that's what this whole movie was about?? No war scenes AT ALL?? I\nswear, I went home and double checked my book to see if maybe I had the\nwrong title or something...<br><br>One star was generous, this was truly awful.\n"
"\nThe only thing was good in this film was that it starts fast but the\nwhole rest of the film is full of nonsense and nearly every who was\nwith us in the film said that this film was awful. There are much\npoints: 1. We take a scientist with us and give him a weapon so he can\nkill himself. 2. In Israel all know that loud things brings the\n\"Zombies\" to rage. Then they start singing? 3. They build a 20m Wall\nand they don't watch for an attack or have security? 4. He and his new\nsoldier friend survive a lane crash. The only one? 5. Somewhere in\nEngland there are 3 scientists without any weapon who survive all\nattacks. And the army cant kill some of them. 6. His family is safe on\nthe ship because he's doing his job. His handy doesn't have 5 minutes\nbattery and they kick his family of the ship.<br><br>This film has many more such moments. How does this film get so good\nrankings? The worst film i've seen since more than 5 years.\n"
"\nI have personally never read World War Z. Therefore, you cannot say\nthat I am comparing the movie too harshly against the book.<br><br>How can I put this nicely? There is no character development in this\nmovie. You are literally thrown into the pit of fire without any\nwarning. You don't even learn the main character's name until 1/2 way\ninto the movie. You don't know how Pitt got his job, how Pitt's former\nsupervisors know where he is at all times, you don't ever truly figure\nout what started it, and I never even figured out the daughter's names.<br><br>Secondly, one does not simply survive a massive plane crash such as the\none placed in this movie. He would be dead. End of story. I'd rather\nwatch Season 3 of the Walking Dead 800 times over than watch this POS. <br><br>I'm a Resident Evil (the game, not the movie), Silent Hill, and Walking\nDead (comic and show), so I am a die-hard zombie fan. This movie did\nnothing for me with its poor execution.\n"
"\nI am that kind of guy who either love a movie or hate a movie. So my\nratings usually are 1 / 10 or 9 / 10 or the rare occasion: 10 / 10 (the\nperfect movie) This movie I didn't like. The main problem is that it\nhas no character build-up. After 5 minutes after we meet the characters\nthe action starts. By now I don't even know the name of any of them,\nand I couldn't care if any of them died. Sadly we are in the beginning\nintroduced to a very interesting character, but sadly he is killed off\nas the moment we start to like him. Many scenes drag on for way too\nlong, and I found the movie more comical than scary. Me and many others\nin the cinema laughed of how silly and stupid the \"zombies\" acted. Also\nmany of the scenes drag on way too long and you start to wonder what\nthe director was thinking. The ending is one of the worst ending of any\nmovie I have ever seen. It felt like the whole thing was pointless and\nit left zero impact. A good movie is a movie you can see endless times.\nThis movie I will only see once.\n"
"\nAt the point when it looked like Brad Pitt was already aiming for major\niconic roles in the silver screen... he decides to play the:<br><br>Typical American dad that can do ANYTHING for his family and who's wife\nis ideally, permanently attached to the \"cellphone\" and worried to\ndeath every minute of the day... Oh, did I mention that they adopted an\nimmigrant in the process?<br><br>I'm rating this movie as 1 not because of the terrible scene where Brad\nPitt drinks a grape soda and the 15 minutes victory sound track, but\nbecause of the mutilation and degradation in the terrible adaptation of\nthe book and the misconception created by the makers of the movie when\nthey decided to name this a horror film...<br><br>PG-13 contains suggestive themes.............. seriously.\n"
"\nThe movie is not as much a world war on zombies as it is an attack on\nhuman intelligence. An intelligent story is sharp and it cuts you as\ncleanly as a scalpel while implanting itself into your brain leaving\nlittle evidence that it was there. At the opposite end of the spectrum\nWorld War Z employs the bludgeoning technique, utterly obliterating\nyour skull into a bloody mush of hair and bits of bone. <br><br>This is one of the only movies that I have ever considered leaving\nmidway through. With each scene came a fresh onslaught of disregard to\nthe human psyche and with it my uncontrollable urge to cringe in horror\nof how poorly written this film is. This is not a film in which you\ntell a fellow human to rush out and see in theater or even wait till it\ncomes to video, unless that person is your mortal enemy. I would not\nadvise seeing the movie at all even if for free. There are more\nconstructive ways to spend your time. Trust me.\n"
"\nAnother Zombie movie, and this one is clearly the worst. I could not\nbelieve what I was watching. I'm surprised that Brad Pitt would\nactually appear in the movie. The Zombies did a bit with their teeth,\nvery similar to what Curly of the Three stooges did, and many in the\naudience started to laugh including myself. When the Zombies started\ntheir contortions with their body at least six patrons or more started\nto howl with laughter. This group of movies companies that put together\n125 million dollars to make this rubbish will not be laughing all the\nway to the bank, but most of us watching this garbage will be laughing\nall the way to the coffee shops and bars.\n"
"\nIn short: his movie is a total disaster. It doesn't have a beginning,\nit doesn't have an ending, it doesn't have any good acting (except\nDaniella) it doesn't have anything good. The plot is idiotic, actors\nare awful, Brad is disappointing. I don't know what's wrong with Brad\nbut this is not OK. He has proved in 90's (Se7en, Sleepers, Snatch,\nFight Club,...) that his is one of the best actors ever but in last 10\nor so years he has wasted his talent on stupid and boring films. If\nthere were no Brad Pitt in this movie it wouldn't get over 2-3 but\nbecause of Brad Pitt it has 7.4 and that shows how people think.\nTragic.\n"
"\nA very disappointing film that I wanted to be good. It reminded me of\nthe film Outbreak which starred Dustin Hoffman. In that film people\nwere infected with an Ebola type virus in this one they were turned\ninto zombies in about 12 seconds of being bitten - go figure. The film\nwas dark and basically a glorified walking dead B Movie - yawn. Has\nBrad Pitt hit rock bottom? I thought that with a big Hollywood star and\nprobably a huge budget the film would have originality and a great\nstoryline. How wrong can you be. Worst of all the one place where they\nhad managed to avoid the world wide plague was Jerusalem until, of\ncourse Brad arrives and then it all went pear shaped. The zombified\npeople were more funny than frightening and I began to wonder if it was\nmeant to be a comedy.\n"
"\nThis is what the 'powers that be' the council of 13, the people that\nactually rule this world, and who own EVERYTHING including the\nentertainment industry, WANT. They live their wishes, their desires and\ntheir fantasies out in the movies. They would love to cull 80 to 90% of\nthe human population and then chip the rest, so they can live on a\nPRISON PLANET. It's said in the move 'Mother Nature is a serial killer'\nThat's rich! The elite are the serial killers spreading viruses\nworldwide, and putting disease into vaccines,and they want to blame it\non MOTHER NATURE? Friggin Satanists.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GShdHBz5z1k\n"
"\nThe book is a masterpiece which deals with zombie apocalypse told from\na lot of point of view. Every character got something to tell us. But\nthe movie is a shame, in my opinion, though.<br><br>The novel focuses on a multitude of characters and on how they went\nthrough the zombie war. They released us a banal movie, in which Brad\nPitt save the world almost himself, sometimes helped by useless\ncharacters whom it's unnecessary pay attention on.<br><br>The novel is hyper-violent, often cruel, but they did an almost\nnon-violent movie where zombies give you kisses on the neck and where\nthe only bloody scene is the one with the amputation, although...<br><br>The novel takes care dealing with survival guidebook in zombie\nterritory. The movie wipes its ass with it. Zombies ain't the sames as\ndescribed in the novel, at all. Some advice, as the amputation\nresulting useless in 90% of the cases, ain't respected.<br><br>Some scenes made me laugh a lot. Almost half of the scenes.\n"
"\nI just caught this on DVD. Having the zombies run like gazelles was\neven more frightening. What possible chance do we have when they move\nlike that?<br><br>The movie is set up well and I like the fact that it gets right to the\naction. There is no long exposition as to how the zombies came about or\nBrad Pitt's back story.<br><br>The CGI is awesome and the film is shot well. I thought the ending came\nfairly abruptly and would have liked it to be a little longer. But\nother than that I didn't have any problems with this movie. As zombie\nmovies go this one belongs in the top level.\n"
"\nSeeing some people here giving this movie bad reviews and low rate I\nmust say I totally disagree. I thought this movie was good and very\nwell done. The action starts right away and never stops and I was very\ncurious all the time where all that happens in the movie would\neventually lead and how the people in it would solve the huge problem\nthey are up against. All in all I thought this was a well made, well\nwritten, well acted and intelligent film in many ways, given that it is\nof course a zombie movie, and of course that requires the viewer to\nhave tolerance towards the adventure. But it caught my attention from\nthe very beginning and I would recommend it to anyone who likes fast\nmovies and tension.\n"
"\nFirst I Am Legend ripped off 28 Days Later. Now WWZ rips off IAL. Is\nthere a shrewd of originality outside of HBO, AMC, Netflix or Hulu. <br><br>I mean seriously first zombies, transmission by blood and biting,\nzombies bound and screaming to get loose, weird tortured background\nmusic, a virus of unknown origin, zombies running in packs leaping at\nprey, returning as a zombie once chewed on, safe havens on islands near\nEngland and British Columbia, a vaccine, a dog, high powered rifles and\nhospitals motifs, a hero looking for his family, a resourceful girl\npicked up along the way, a good man accidentally infected who must be\nsacrificed, a high rise where death awaits and someone else's child\nmust be rescued, sanctuary with the military that turns out not to be\nsafe, <br><br>And then and then .. <br><br>It\"s tine for a Twelve Monkey reunion when who should appear for a\nquick cameo but David Morse rejoining Brad Pitt.<br><br>And I loved 28 Days later and like IAL a lot. But really - no wonder it\nonly grossed ten bucks more than it cost to make,\n"
"\nI would have expected more from a movie with Brad Pitt in it. If you\nhave a thirst for zombie movies you might love this but it was just so\ntedious. It starts off with a bang with everyone trying to escape and\nwondering what is suddenly going wrong but it's all downhill from there\nwith zombies constantly appearing and reappearing. Brad is wonderful as\na loving husband and father but that's as wonderful as he gets. If\nyou've seen the trailer, you've seen the entire movie. So predictable\nand absolutely ridiculous finale with the handsome hunk saving the day\nand thereby saving the whole world. If I never see another zombie\nmovie, it will be too soon.\n"
"\nNow I know I'll be some getting some disagreements but this is how I\nfeel about the film.<br><br>One that everyone loves but I don't.<br><br>I mean I don't see how this is even consider a great film I mean it's\nnot even worth the film it was recorded with.<br><br>IN my opinion it was made just for Brad to collect another pay check\nI'm not saying he's a bad actor but clearly he didn't think this one\nthrough.<br><br>The zombies are even hardly consider zombies it just another Hollywood\ntrying to catch in on a book.<br><br>The story of the film is just the same one we have heard many times\nbefore and it just pretty much gets boring as it goes on.<br><br>Clearly this film was made to make some money and it might have done\nwell at the theaters but it was pretty much a disgrace to horror and\nzombie films out there.<br><br>Again it's just another film that everyone loves but I don't. World War\nZ just has a big name star trying to save the world and his family but\nhe couldn't save the boredom of the fans of movies.<br><br>I give World War Z an 1 out of 10\n"
"\nI detest any film about zombies because they are the plot. I just felt\nlike Brad Pit cannot possibly be in something boring, can he ?????<br><br>I like Brad Pit, he is a modern Robert Redford in my view, but this\nfilm is just the same old zombie theme, albeit with excellent special\neffects, oh yes!!.<br><br>It starts with the usual family man stuff, but soon goes down hill fast\nwhen the zombies appear, and they do appear in a traffic jam, which\nBrad Pit is caught in, and the rest of the film is about him and his\nfamily trying to escape the zombies.<br><br>Its a new twist on an old tale. <br><br>This is my opinion of this film, and i'm sticking with it.<br><br>1 out of 10.\n"
"\nI don't write many reviews only when they are truly awful or wonderful<br><br>This is definitely AWFUL.<br><br>Zombie films should be banned, they dull the brain cells. This is a\nridiculous movie. I spent most of the time with fingers in my ears.\nListening to several minutes of grunts and groans is NOT my idea of\ndialog.<br><br>It is so full of holes it leaks like a sieve. It is not that I expect\nmovies of recent times to have a decent plot, this this makes everyone\nlook as if the are the dummest idiots on the planet.<br><br>I.E they build a wall knowing the zombies are out there, but cannot be\nbothered to patrol it. or Helicopters land so close that they can jump\naboard!!<br><br>They should issue warnings about being a zombie film so it can be\navoided. So if you are not a zombie lover, give it a miss and save your\nmoney.\n"
"\nWhen will Hollywood realize that they do NOT need to fiddle, meddle, or\notherwise mutilate a story to make a movie? The book is a masterpiece\nof socio-political commentary, showing how politics and big business\nallowed the plague to become a world-wide catastrophe. Instead, we are\ntreated to how politics and big business mutilated this story and\nmutated it into yet another generic action movie. Instead of following\na reporter around the globe ten years AFTER the war, as he gathers\nstories from those who fought and survived, we end up following one man\non his quest to be reunited with his family. For those who have not\nread the book, do so. The pity is that Brad Pitt HAD a working script,\nwritten by J. Michael Straczinski, that he used in order to get the\nproject green-lit. Instead, he tossed that script and used his own.\n"
"\nZombie movies will never go to history as clever, deep and intriguing.\nIn fact, they usually are rather ridiculous, horribly illogical, and\ninsultingly stupid. World War Z doesn't disappoint in that respect. The\nplot here is just plain awful. Just out of nowhere, a zombie plague\npops up on earth, and of course, all the people with a brain in tact\nacts extremely stupid. I will never understand the fascination of this\ngenre. Is it the film-makers that decide to do these zombie movies\nbecause it is cheaper with brainless actors that have nothing to say?<br><br>If you like the worst TV show ever - The Walking Dead - this is the\nfilm for you. <br><br>If you still have a brain and not yet turned into a zombie - avoid this\none...\n"
"\nAwful film and a big disappointment. You need a special talent to waste\nso many resources and dollars and create such a boring film. Its even\nmore upseting when you know that many films have been made on this\n\"zombie\" theme before, and if you want to be creative (or original),\none would expect a new angle on this subject. but NO. Same screaming\nactors playing flat zombie characters. Also, the main character\ndevelopment is flat and \"Cliche\", the plot line is predictable and the\nending is poor. Special effects are OK, nothing more. I can't see any\nreason why a good actor like Brad Pitt A waste of two hours agreed to\nstar in this movie (money is not a good enough reason in this case).\nAlso, the re-production of the locations (Jerusalem for instance) is\nfull of errors and unreliable. with such a big budget, the producers\nshould have made a bigger effort, if they respect the viewers. Go have\na drink with friends instead.\n"
"\nWhat we have here is a pretty mediocre zombie movie in the same sort of\nvein as the far better Zombieland. About the only thing it has in\ncommon with the book is title. The characters are about as\nuninteresting as it gets and there are so many holes and hanging\nthreads in the story you can't help worrying they are planning a\nsequel! <br><br>They attempt serious science but it laughable, has WHO Cardiff heard of\nbiosafety levels? Where do they get the sat phones that work inside,\nand why leave out what must have been a very exciting in flight\nrefuelling to get the C130 to fly that far!<br><br>Seriously, if you haven't read the book don't waste your money on a\nticket to watch the film, go buy the book for a properly entertaining\nzombie yarn!\n"
"\nDerivative and boring. Those are the two words that came to my mind\nafter watching WWZ.<br><br>The only good thing in this mindless (as a zombie...) film is Mr. Brad\nPitt, who does a convincing acting job. Other than that, WWZ is a\nreheat of countless other films that rely on the same formula.<br><br>Lame special effects, plot holes the size of Gibraltar,e.g., zombies do\nnot attack \"sick\" people.... This is in my opinion a Deus-ex-machina\nsolution the writers used shamelessly...<br><br>I wonder where they spend the millions and millions of dollars they use\nto make those films. I guess it is not in the script!\n"
"\nOkay, this movie didn't get amazing reviews but it is an AMAZING movie,\nThe movie had an interesting story, was a little scary and never had a\ndull moment, the action had already started within ten minutes of the\nfilm, one of the things i love about this movie is that they make you\nthink that you know what's going to happen next but you will always be\nsurprised! This movie is extremely UNDER RATED, if you are a fan of the\ngenre you are guaranteed to like it and if you aren't like me you can\nstill enjoy it,I am glad i saw this movie, i was not let down in\nanyway, it was a good use of 2 hours I hope a sequel is made and based\non the ending there probably will be!\n"
"\nNo other way around: Three quarters really good, a quarter of crap.\nShort said, at the latest when Mr. Bleibtreu appears, it's time to to\nleave the cinema. It seems that the film crew was suddenly out of\nmoney: the end of the movie is not playing in the whole world with\ncolossal monumental recordings full of CGI-Zombie-Tsunamies but only\nwith a handful of fairly creepy made- Folks within an office building,\nthe excessive and unintentionally funny often repeated chatter with the\nteeth, as it would be a really strange adhesive cream commercial with\nthe scenes of a finally adjusted to the appropriate audience extreme\nGeronto crime scene on Sunday night.\n"
"\nIt started in gear, which was good and I got drawn in to the suspense\nthat it was building nicely, but it seemed to drag after a while with\npredictable storyline, no character depth at all, and a simple no\nthrills ending. I was half expecting Will Smith to show up with a new\ndog. To many this movie will be enough, but for me, in the year 2013, I\nwas expecting something different, something to catch me off guard.<br><br>This movie goes down like popcorn, initially satisfying, but after a\nwhile, you forget the taste and keep eating just for the sake of it,\nthen afterwards thinking you could've done without it. I wouldn't\nrecommend this movie to children anymore than I'd recommend them\npopcorn.\n"
"\nThis movie revealed close to nothing in the trailers and, having read\nthe book, I was anxious to view it. It took about 90 seconds for this\nmovie to start its engine. Then, it flew off like a bull on crack. As\nyou watch in the beginning, while Brad Pitt's successful acting leads\nhis fictional family to safety as ordinary survivors, you are hooked by\nthe time he assumes his past position with the UN. As he travels here\nand there you are poked with action, suspense, thrills, a slight amount\nof horror, sadness, and epic adventure. Oddly enough, this movie was\nslightly realistic, at least, as realistic as it gets that is. <br><br>This movie is worth the ticket and the disc.\n"
"\nI think this addition to the zombie film genre is great has a better\nfeel to it than some previous ones. Very loosely based on the book, the\nstoryline provided is well enough and I found myself sincerely caring\nfor them all and routing for Pitt's character and bravery to protect\nhis own. From the trailers I have expected a sloppy looking graphically\ncreated zombies flooding about in the masses. It gave a vulnerable feel\nto the main characters and that you can't necessarily guarantee a\ngetaway when their faster than a marathon runner. The ending and\nresolve left one with hope as it was intended in the story as a whole.\nI will definitely purchase it when it comes out. And sometimes, it's\nokay to have a zombie flick and have it not be all about the gore,\nwhich I am pleased to see that this movie did not spend a whole lot of\ntime doing. Recommended\n"
"\nI like Brad Pitt, he's done some amazing movies. I was surprised he\nagreed to bring his name to such a poor production. I am always looking\nforward to all kind S-F apocalyptic pictures and I was dragged by the\ntrailers to see this one. The movies has some amazing shots, specially\nthe epic scenes of zombies invasions, but that would be it. I would\nrecommend it for a rental, for those hardcore fans who find pleasure in\ntinny details. As a whole the script is poor and in many occasions the\nlack of logic, simple stupidity or naivety irritates. Pitt is on a\nhighest importance mission in Corea while his life and of his teammates\nis put in jeopardy by a phone-call of his bored and longing wife? lol?\nPitt injects himself a random virus which happens to be the one that\nworks as a ' camouflage cure' ? Israel happened to foresee the coming\napocalypse and built a wall because their intelligence intercepted\nchatter about ' zombie' while the rest of the world just awaited their\ndoom? etc There is a ton of it. A real waste of time.\n"
"\nOK, I am not a prude by any means... I watch a movie with a completely\nopen mind. In fact, I love the series The Walking Dead, but this movie\nwas like a mix between that series, and the Tom Cruise movie War of\nWorlds (a few years ago). But, it's a much worse version. I literally\nstarted watching with my husband and we stopped watching after 40\nminutes. It was a complete waste of time. If you're interested in\nsomething fun to do with that subject matter, watch the other TV\nshow/movie I mentioned. It'd be worth your TIME and MONEY. Take it from\nme......... ............ .............. .................\n...................... .............<br><br>UPDATE: since the time that I originally posted this, I was curious to\nfind out WHAT would happen! So, I went back to watch the movie, and 3/4\nof it is boring as all hell, but the last 1/4 was better. All in all, I\nstill give it a 1 star, because it still stunk, even when I went to the\nvery end.\n"
"\nI knew nothing about the storyline, lest the trailers. I thought the\nbest part of the film was the soundtrack. Really weak script and again,\nwho thinks that hand-held shaky camera is engaging and exciting. Blur,\nblur, blur. Lead couple was terribly miscast. Definitely like my\nzombies slow and scary. There was such a major difference in the look\nand reaction time from group zombie (CGI) to small cluster zombie (Real\nactors). Real waste of money and talent. Based on some of the reviews,\nit should have been more like the book. The soaring shots of the planes\nand helicopters was nice to watch...even epic..as the reviews\ntouted...., but the film was anything but.\n"
"\nI really enjoyed this movie however the ending was abit naff but all in\nall it is a perfect popcorn flick to watch! During the movie you never\nreally 'see' the zombies as being blood thirsty cannibals as you've\nseen in other movies such as Dawn of the dead!<br><br>The acting in the movie was OK but the performance by Brad Pitt was\ngreat so if you're a fan of him give this a watch! <br><br>The CGI was simply breathtaking and at parts the movie was pretty funny\neven when it wasn't trying to be!<br><br>I have given it an 8 because i think its a pretty good movie despite\nwhat the critics say !<br><br>Just sit back, relax and enjoy the carnage that unfolds\n"
"\nworld War Z is fast paced, well acted, with an interesting story. If a\nout break happened we would have trouble. I love how we study for the\nweakness, and strengths of a virus. The 9 out of 10 people theory where\nwe go with 10th person outlandish idea is a great theme. The movie is a\nmix of War of the Worlds meets cognition. The problem with World War Z\nis the ending. There is no explanation of why? There is no explanation\nof how to solve the problem? The ending left the viewer empty. The\nmovie could be gearing up for part 2. Brad Pitt does another\noutstanding role. He seems to have left his outrageous weird roles like\nfight club, and True Romance. His new genre seems to be action, family\nand playing the hero. I give World War Z a seven out 10.\n"
"\nI won't give this film a ten mainly because i saw it in 3d which costs\nmore; this film did not need to be in 3d, didn't mind the 3d, it just\nwould've been just as good without it. Brad Pitt's character is\nbelievable and appealing. The film is fast-paced and fun from beginning\nto end, there's tension and excitement throughout. I personally love\nzombie flicks, even the direct to video lot. Movies where the viewer\ncan't even begin to imagine the horror lend an excitement that's only\navailable in modern zombie horror, in my humble opinion. World War Z\nalso has it's share of predictable moments, but without giving anything\naway, you will still enjoy the film. I am not really saying much with\nthis review only to say that if you like zombie, you will truly dig\nWorld War Z!\n"
"\nThe only reason I did not give it a 1 was that the mass crowd scenes\nwere very well done. SO, that leaves a 1 for everything else. How low\nhas our Brad Pitt sunk. Doing it for the cash for sure. What a waste of\nintellectual effort or the lack there of. Time to kick the guts out of\nHollywood and just do not go see their products. Thank god I do not\nhave to pay to see this crap. So to make it absolutely certain and\nwithout spoiling the plot - the nature of science is so easily\ncircumvented by this story line and a hero emerges that just makes you\nwonder who the hell these people think are watching their films. Oh I\nforgot - they know only too well and the gullible public keeps lining\nthe coffers of the Jewish monopoly in Californication land. Just\nlaughable.<br><br>Do not go to see it. You will kick yourself afterwards. Go buy your\ngirl a great dinner instead.\n"
"\nIf you like zombie movies, don't bother with this movie! It has nothing\nin common with zombie movies except that it happens that when the virus\nkills humans they start spreading the virus by biting.<br><br>So, for an avid zombie lover, the movie is an absolute disappointment.\nI hate zombie movies. In fact, I didn't want to go just because I was\ntold it was a zombie movie. But I was seriously bored and I thought\n\"Come on, cut Brad some slack. The guy is very careful with his\nchoices\". So I went mainly or the pop corn, but I was blown away by the\nmovie.<br><br>Incredible camera work! Solid script. As usual with Hollywood for the\npast decade or more, scripts are not as good as used to be so I gave\nthis one 8 out ten, missing two points as the some tiny bits in the\nscript could have been better. But, I am definitely buying the DVD.<br><br>I absolutely recommend it (unless you wanna go for some zombie action).\nI loved every minute of it.\n"
"\nOK so we all know this movie was very troubled in its production and\nneeded enormous amounts of reshoots. Unfortunately they got Damon\nLindelof to rewrite the movie and needless to say its a mess. The\nactual \" resolution\" (the movie isn't resolved but the solution they\nfind is as near as they are going to get) is utterly imbecilic. It\nmakes no sense in any way shape or form.<br><br>Not that the film doesn't have problems from the start. Mark Foster's\nsuper fast cuts and shaky cam make what could have been interesting\naction sequences unwatchable. Pitt is totally unconvincing as an\nintellectual type and he looks bored at times.<br><br>No clich√© is left unused, there is no blood. Its a Disney zombie movie.<br><br>I'm not a gorehound but you'd expect some.<br><br>The characters take turns in behaving stupidly. <br><br>Its not involving 75% of the time and there are \"what the heck\" moments\nof idiocy so regularly that they took me out of the movie.\n"
"\nThe only possible scenario that I can envision for this movie sucking\nso badly is that the screenwriters didn't even bother to read the\nnovel. They must have simply liked the title and gone from there. How\nthey ever got Max Brooks to sign off on this project is beyond me. I\nwon't detail any scenes from the movie since I don't want to spoil it\nfor anyone, but Pitt's character was shallow and unbelievable, and the\nonly good filmography were the zombies. How this possibly came from the\ndirector of Monster's Ball, I have no idea - unless he abdicated\ndirecting to M. Night Shyamalan. It was that bad.<br><br>In summary, a waste of my time and money.\n"
"\nChoosing fast and crazy zombies over slow and predictable ones give a\nbunch of raw pleasure to World War Z. Besides the ambient savagery, the\nmovie stands as a classic: some escapes, some panic, some infiltration\nand some investigation. Nothing new, though the burlesque of the\nsolution has its merits. 7/10.\n"
"\nAnother huge fan of the book wondering what the hell i just watched.\nwhy does Hollywood even bother buying the rights to other media if\nthere just going to utterly destroy it?Why not just make an original\nfilm? is really so bankrupt of all ideas?The film has a UN employee\nbrad Pitt travel around the world to various action set pieces for\npretty much no reason only to survive a series of increasing unlikely\nclose shaves .Until near the end he and his one handed companion walk\nout of a devastating plane crash with a minor wound.no else survived of\ncourse. For once the mean streets of Cardiff prove less dangerous than\nzombies as they make their way to the wizard castle to find a magical\ncure or something.....\n"
"\nIt's a science fiction horror film is a story of brainless and dead\npeople who are taking control over world . The movie is full of amazing\nand horrifying scene.Pitt conducts himself manfully throughout the\nproceedings -- he is never less than believable while facing off\nagainst this pandemic - but if I never see another zombie in the\nmovies, I will not feel deprived.As compelling as Pitt is at reflecting\nthe world's pain through Lane's eyes, the movie treats him too often as\nif he truly is the only one with loved ones to lose or a world to save.\nI have now started finding better movies through www.flickstree.com. It\nnot only suggests great movies to watch,it also tells where you can\nwatch the movie online.. Highly recommended.\n"
"\n1. Shaky Cam 2. People saying first names over and over and over. 3.\nFather exists only to make pancakes for his kids, daughters grill him\nabout it. 4. Family only exists to try to sell this as a family movie,\nwomen are totally and realistically worthless in an emergency. 5. Brad\nPitt has a problem with a cop, a random black man comes by to ask him\nhow hes doing. 6. Cops clearly don't care about humanity and don't help\nin emergencies. 7. Lots of phony high pitched screams to go with shaky\ncam. 8. 5 seconds into the zombie apocalypse white criminal stereotypes\nare raping people in public. 9. Brad Pitt looks like a burnt out hippy\nand often has his mouth hanging open. 10. Quite possibly the least\nscary zombies I've ever seen. 11. Hispanics who look and sound illegal\nsave the white Brad Pitt family and instantly are asked if they want\nfood to eat. 12 Anchor baby of illegals saves Brad Pitt again out of\nnowhere, cause little boys all know how to use hand guns. 13 Rotten\nwife tells him to go talk somewhere else, but its OK cause she is\nsmiling.\n"
"\nFirstly, I love a good zombie film and I'm also an admirer of Brad\nPitt's work, so when i heard that a big budget A Lister zombie movie\nwas being made based on a cracking book i was a tad excited to say the\nleast! World War Z is a good film...the action zips along, decent plot,\nexcellent acting by all concerned, some very tense moments and a couple\nof jump scares along the way....if I'm nitpicking (which I am), I got\nto say truthfully I don't like the CGI created zombies at all and there\nneeds to be more gore! A sequel is in the works apparently, which I\nlook forward too, and I hope they can correct these minor problems with\nthe first one and create a truly big budget classic zombie movie\nindeed!\n"
"\nLike any other zombie-movie but a lot less excitement-buildup.. I could\nstand about half of the movie until i turned it off again. So i'm aware\nmy rating might in some peoples opinions not be justified since i\ndidn't see it all through.. but wow, this was truly bland and felt\npointless to the point i gave up, which I should add happens in very\nrare cases. Rly looked forward to this considering the hype around it\nand the amount of money put into advertising it but.. nah this was like\nany other zombie-movie with no unique twist and very predictable. So\nall in all, not recommended even giving a shot unless you want to see\nthe same movie as the other 611 000 zombie-movies out there.\n"
"\nDude, what is the point in having CGI for the zombies to climb up the\nwall? Seriously that's just a stupid lazy way to put on a action/horror\nfilm! I have to tell you this, this is one of the worst movies that\nBrad Pitt has ever been dragged in.<br><br>Thank the Lord I didn't watch the whole movie because I would be bored\nout of tears and seriously be going crazy. It would do your head in! <br><br>Yknow nowadays with CGI, it doesn't always work out in some movies\nespecially ones that involve with Zombies! I would rather watch Michael\nJackson's music video of \"Thriller\" then looking at this!<br><br>I don't understand why it has a IMDb rating of 7.1 and a 63 metascore.\nIt really didn't deserve it, it needs to be rethought again because\nrealistically, I would be expecting bad reviews or a bad metascore from\ncritics.....p\n"
"\nI thought that the team will be able to feel and recognize the essence\nof this great work and offer us a different, but yet equally exciting\nand frightening story. In this segment, the story of the movie is very\npredictable. We know already exactly in advance that wherever Pitt\nlands there will be in a few seconds' a thousand billion zombies and\nexplosions. What I found unbelievable in the film is that Forster\ndecided to take out a few key moments. I recommend \"World War Z\" to all\nthose who have not read the novel, and to the book lovers I suggest\nthat they should skip the movie. Even Though, this is an exciting and\ndynamic movie and actually has several moments that raise a lot of\nadrenaline in the blood.\n"
"\nRarely have we seen zombie films work in the process of the film. And\nrarely do PG-13 zombie films work. The audience are rarely given a\nchance to focus on what has just happened, or to absorb key plot\npoints. Instead we jump from one scene to another. Coherence is lost.\nImpact is lost. Someone must have left scenes on the cutting room\nfloor.In one scene, a character with key information is quickly\ndismissed from the film in a manner that was underwhelming and\nfarcical. At this point I did a double take, looked around the cinema\nto see if anyone else was as bemused, and carried on watching. The\nconfused frown never fully left my face. Of the few strengths in the\nfilm, one must highlight Marco Beltrami's score that bounds behind the\nopening credits.\n"
"\nNot many movies make a mistake so big that I have a hard time watching\nthe rest of the film. In this one, that was exactly the case. At the\nbeginning of the film, and all throughout, the make a point to let the\nviewer know it takes 12 seconds for the virus to take hold. To the\npoint of Pit standing at the ledge of a building preparing to hurl\nhimself off while he counts to 12.<br><br>In the scene on the plane, the catalyst for the major plot point is a\nZombie in the bathroom. How did this man get past the gate, down the\njet bridge and into the washroom in less than 12 seconds. Moreover,\nwhat kept the zombie from breaking out of the restroom and attacking\nlong before the plane took off.<br><br>This movie is full of plot holes and technical errors, that might be\nforgiven. When the story begins disregarding it's own rules, it becomes\na flop.<br><br>Pass this one up...\n"
"\n...hmm I wonder if that will work ...but I actually think it did and it\ndid good, there are some parts of the movie that I didn't like (see\nbelow, spoiler alert), but there are many really good things and they\nkept me interested and entertained.<br><br>Likes, the chaos and selfishness in the beginning, the doubt and\ndespair through out it all, the fights and survival tactics, the\nexplosions, the viciousness of the zombies, the fast moving scenery and\nthe locations (especially Istanbul).<br><br>Dislikes (one big spoiler), Istanbul was the greatest disappointment or\nthe \"only\" weakness in the film, why do you build a giant ass wall and\ndoesn't post any guards on top, the zombies would still have gotten in\nwith their tactic, but it would have made it much more realistic.\n"
"\nI watched this on Netflix the other day and liked it a lot better than\nI did the first time, when I say it in theaters. I think I was\nexpecting a stronger plot and more story which the film lacks, but then\nagain Marc Forest directed the film and he was the director who dropped\nthe ball on Quantum OF Solace. <br><br>As I watched WWZ for a second time I realized I had to let go and just\ngo for the ride this film is 2 hours of zombie porn. I watched the\nunrated cut which has a lot more blood and guts than the theatrical\nversion I saw. <br><br>That's all this film is, set piece after set piece of zombie mayhem and\ndestruction. If you think of it as a 2 hour version of the introduction\nof a zombie video game and turn your brain off to logic, story and\ncharacter development - buckle up and have some bloody fun.\n"
"\nNot a terrible movie, fairly average. Some of the computer-generated\neffects were somewhat impressive, like the armies of zombies climbing\nover one another like ants. Brad Pitt has his certain charisma and\n\"star power\" but they seemed to be minimizing that throughout. They\ngave almost nothing for Mireille Enos to do. (She's from my home town!)\nDaniella Kertesz seemed to play the most interesting character, the\nIsraeli soldier who travels with Pitt's character. All of the\nbig-budget stuff is here, the cinematography, the effects, the\nre-written ending after being shown to test audiences. I am fairly glad\nthat I didn't waste theater-type money to see it. But it's okay.\n"
"\nBrad Pitt has become more than just a pretty boy. He can involve you so\nyou care what happens to him. That's what saved this movie from being\njust another Zombie Walking flick. The writing was pretty mediocre from\nso many standpoints. The opening scenes are good except it certainly\ntakes Brad and family long to run. If everyone is running away from\nsomething, is that not a good time to start running also as opposed to\ndawdling around waiting to interview someone? But it was scary. The\nscene in Jerusalem was very well done, even if obviously CGIed. Who\nknew Zombies could swarm and plan like bees? The plane scene is good\nalso. The bicycles to the military plane seem stupid. And the chase\ndown the WHO hallways seems, ludicrous. They sent Murielle to Nova\nScotia... Oh No. Not Nova Scotia. That seemed lame. It's worth the\nwatch, but no classic. But the film has its moments.\n"
"\nThe film World war Z has its beautiful scenes, with fast paced, heart\nstopping moments. In the Narrative, we follow Gerry Lane (Brad Pitt)\nand his fight to save the world and by doing this saving his family.\nThe basic story is there, Man forced to work in his ex-job to help\nprotect his family. <br><br>As Gerry's previous job was staying alive in dangerous places, we\nsuspect he will be smarter and more accurate in making his decisions.\nHowever as the film goes on past the 60 min mark, we notice that his\ndecisions are just too good to be true/real. In contrast there are some\ndisappointing and quite stupid scenes. <br><br>Overall the film draws you in to believe that Gerry will stay alive not\nmatter what he does and that the only outcome is saving the world. For\na 'normal' man he sure does have luck on his side.\n"
"\nI gave it an eight/ten only because of Djuricko. Rather than that, the\nmovie is too much similar to I am legend. It it really interesting but\n'zombies' are exactly the same in the already mentioned movie. I would\nrecommend people to watch it but only if they don't have anything else\nto do in their boring lives. World war z is a great name I can say\nthat, someone did make his imagination go. Brad Pitt acting wasn't bad,\nI'm not saying that, but it is not too hard to act in a movie like\nthis, it is too amateurish. There was no plot at all, everything starts\ntoo early and the end is already seen by the viewers even before the\n30th minute of the movie. All in all, nothing special, if you want to\nwatch a movie where a person needs to think to get the puzzles\ntogether, skip this one, this is too obvious.\n"
"\nOverall it was a good film, but what happened in the last third/quarter\n? Looked empty and rushed. Reverted back to type in this section. Slow\nmindless zombies, well, I say zombies, but what was with the click\nclicking, chattering teeth doctor ? Looked a bit daft to say the least.\nI've read the book, but apart from the title in common........I did\nlearn something from this film, as well as the vastly poorer zombies\nmovies being released en masse it seems. Zombies in films have had\ntheir day. Too much competition from vampires, werewolves, ghosts and\nscarier stuff now. Mind you, fast, at least human fast zombies, that\ncan think, plan, communicate with each other and use weaponry, might\ntake it up a level, with the usual hunger for human flesh and needing a\nhead injury to re-kill them, might work. Think Terminator, but zombies\nnot cyborgs, hard to destroy and can shoot back ! Just a thought.\n"
"\nI was a bit baffled I must admit, because as I watched this film I\nfound myself wondering if Will Smith's character from Legend was going\nto pop up in the distance when they showed a New York scene.<br><br>And that's the thing, it's basically the same film really, just with\nmore people and locations.<br><br>I watched it though, it was kind of fine, kind of okay. But all the way\nthrough I was struggling to really care, either about the rather\npredictable premise that human stupidity created the zombies through\nsome form of virus or sickness even though the zombies seemed to\nsuddenly have impossible strength and speed which would require\nsignificant bone, muscle and organ replacement surely...or indeed about\nthe people trying to survive. <br><br>Perfect film to watch if you are going to sort of pay attention, but\nmight make a cuppa now and again or check the sports scores on your\ntablet and don't mind missing 30 seconds here and there.\n"
"\ntry to teach you how to survive in this horrible situation on world,\nwhen i heard announcement of this movie. i expected more like aliens\nand giant robots in this ''world war z'' title. but what is that?? too\nmuch zombie movies, now my 5 years old brother going to believe zombies\nis real. I'm pretty sure that brat Pitt looks like a uncle Thor. dead\nsoldier scene was horrible we if you including Hollywood star like brat\nPitt on your movie you should screen play something real. not a waste\nof time for me just cut that scene and make it 90min movie easy exiting\nsimple not boring to watch. when i see this movie in theater first 30\nminute was exiting next 30 min goes funny last 30 min i just talk with\nmy friends how fake and funny that uncle Thor looks on this film.\nExpecting more but too boring.\n"
"\nBrad Pitt, Mireille Enos, Daniella Kertesz, Matthew Fox and David Morse\nstar in this 2013 sci-fi thriller based on the novel. This begins in\nPhiladelphia with former United Nations investigator, Gerry Lane (Pitt)\ndriving with his wife, Karin (Enos) and their 2 daughters. Soon, they\nget into an accident and discover that a lethal virus is infecting\npeople into hungry zombies. Among the panic, Gerry gets his family to a\nsecure location and is asked to help find the source of the epidemic\nspreading across the world. Kertesz plays Israeli soldier, Segan, Fox\n(Party of Friends) plays a parajumper and Morse (Contact) plays an\nex-CIA agent. This isn't bad, but could've been better and Pitt is good\nin it.\n"
"\nSo I had heard some seriously mixed reviews about this which meant I\ndidn't go see it at the movies. The other day I finally watched it and\nto be honest I was fairly impressed. My boyfriend disliked it and I can\nunderstand why (if that makes sense). It had a good plot and in my eyes\ncould be pretty realistic (as far as zombie movies go and movie\nland)Brad wasn't over ally skilled which made me think a bit more real\nlife there. It just lacked in execution. Possibly would of worked more\non that story and would of recast some of the people. I felt some of\nthe scenes were empty and didn't need to be there but all in all I\nthought it was decent. I think people should see it for themselves\nbecause as far as I can tell people either liked or hated this movie.\n"
"\nThere is so much off-screen violence, so many plot holes, so many\nplaces in this film where something starts and then ends without any\nsense of a middle to it that it feels almost like the version I saw\n(the PG-13, single-disc DVD version, in case later re-releases muddle\nthe issue) was the edited-for-TV version or the cut they put together\njust so they could later release a Director's Cut with all the sense\nput back in.<br><br>Giving the hero of an action film a family to worry about is a choice\nfilmmakers rarely go for, but it is effective here in establishing his\nmotive for survival. Unfortunately, all the teasing about \"what I used\nto do\" from Brad Pitt never pays off. We never learn that he used to be\na sniper assassin or an accountant or anything back when he did\nwhatever it did that was so disturbing in his past. That's just one\ndisappointment the film features. Revealing more would venture into\nspoiler territory.<br><br>6 out of 10: Worth seeing, not worth recommending.\n"
"\nI rather enjoyed the first couple of acts of this (surely unfinished)\nblockbuster. Marc Foster gets right on with it. All the stuff you've\nseen in the trailers seems to happen in the same span as the pre-titles\nof a Christopher Nolan flick. It's quite exciting and I was even a\nlittle spooked myself.<br><br>The film starts to get a little labored as Brad Pitt's indeterminate\nUN- type begins to guess a possible solution. This dawning idea seems\nto coincide with a truly extraordinary handbrake turn in the film; a\nflight out of apocalyptic Israel points Pitt towards Wales because it's\ncheap to film there - oh, sorry, no, because that's the nearest WHO\nresearch facility and suddenly the whole circus scales right down into\na TV version of 24 Days Later. The film ends in much the same way as I\nAm Legend but without anything like the satisfactory arc prior to it.\nAnd credit where it's due - to the (apparently) uncredited Zombie in\nthe WHO facility, the first to prove Gerry's theory right. 4/10\n"
"\nThere is not a single thing I like about this zombie flick at all cause\nits not entirely based on the book and the book had more then just one\nstory unlike this film. This is a film that I would not recommend to\nanyone. I mean the ending to this film is terrible. All it did was show\nBrad Pitt's character and his family in a boat somewhere on the west\ncoast or the east coast and it had no meaning at all. Also the zombies\nin this movie reminded me of all those zombies in the video game Left 4\nDead for the Xbox 360. I mean if you're gonna make a film based on a\nnovel, at least make it mostly based on the plot of the novel. This is\ndefinitely one of the worst films I've ever seen in my life. This film\nshould've been scratched.\n"
"\nThe visible differences between the Lockheed C-130 and Antonov AN-12\nare so pronounced, I can't believe the director released this film with\nthe scenes frequently cutting between the two aircraft. The airplane\nplayed such a prominent role in the movie, this simply should have\nnever happened. <br><br>The movie was virtually unwatchable for me because of this jarring\ndiscrepancy. Even people generally oblivious to aircraft types can tell\nthey are not the same model of plane.<br><br>I hope that Brad Pitt had not seen this gross error before the movie\nwas released. That aside, simply the fact that this was a zombie movie\nshould have given Pitt some doubts about his participation in the\nmovie.\n"
"\nWhy was this movie made? Here we have yet another zombie action remix\nof half a dozen movies that everyone has seen, only this time it's got\nBrad Pitt and an odd emphasis on Israel and the Middle East. I'm not\nkidding when I say that it's even more boring and predictable than the\nmost stereotypical of zombie movies. The action scenes feel like\nsomething from a textbook, and the plot is, yes, textbook. It was hard\nfor me to sit through this because I really did feel like I was\nwatching a movie made from a checklist.<br><br>It was oddly surprising to watch a large budget movie that isn't even\nas good as it's cheaper counterparts. If you compare this to such\nmovies as Cloverfield, I Am Legend, Walking Dead, War of the Worlds and\nThirty Days of Night, this movie doesn't even come close to any of\nthem, yet borrows scenes from all of them. So again I ask, why would\nyou waste time and money on such a snooze fest?\n"
"\nThis movie left me asking myself \"why?\" Right from the beginning, when\nBrad Pitt was stuck in traffic, why did he floor it and drive like a\nmaniac until he wrecked his car? When he and his family were headed to\nthe rooftop, why did he suddenly shut the door behind them and trap\nhimself with the zombies? When he was in Jerusalem, why did the girl\nstanding in line have a microphone that was hooked up to all of the\nloudspeakers? When he was running to the car, why did his driver look\ndirectly at him and then speed away? Why did his plane crash within\nwalking distance of the exact place he was headed? Why did the doctor's\nat the WHO tie him down and interrogate him like he was a criminal? Why\ndid he very carefully leave his only weapon outside of the lab where\nthe zombies were roaming? And finally, why did an A list star like Brad\nPitt agree to do such a terribly written movie?\n"
"\nVisit any Internet message boards about it, and you might get the\nimpression that its more commonly accepted title is \"The Brad Pitt\nZombie Movie That Sucked.\" I myself am a die-hard fan of Max Brooks'\noriginal book, but I still loved the movie.<br><br>It wasn't a George A. Romero film, and it wasn't \"The Walking Dead.\"\n(And it certainly wasn't the book.) But ¬Ö that's just fine, in my\nopinion. It was different. It was a bangin', epic, global monster war\nmovie with some amazing action set pieces. I think the siege of the\nwalled Jerusalem (a subplot that actually WAS from the book), was alone\nwell worth the price of a ticket. Not every zombie movie has to have\nthe same tone and narrative as Romero's work or Robert Kirkman's work.\nArnold Schwarzenegger's recent \"Maggie\" film showed us, for example,\nthat very different zombie movies can still be incredibly good.<br><br>My only real criticism of the movie was that its plot resolution seemed\n¬Ö pretty damned risky. Isn't there a pretty obvious danger connected\nwith the defense employed by Pitt's character? Maybe I missed\nsomething.\n"
"\nWondering why I gave a 7 out of 10? Well, by not bringing anything\nreally innovative into the plot doesn't mean that it deserves a bad\nreview.<br><br>Again, the concept its not new, you might find something fresh in the\naggressiveness of the infected, demonstrating a new kind of horror to\nthe zombie genre, but then again, its always the same.<br><br>The main effort in this movie are not in the characters (except for\nBrad Pitt), neither the plot, the horror, soundtrack etc... what really\ncomes out shinning in this movie are the zombies, here you get the real\nfeeling of the threat, the contamination is fast as the madness and\nblood lust on the infected, that makes you realize that you wouldn't\nsurvive with a samurai sword in the same event.<br><br>Anyway, if you are in for a zombie apocalypse worldwide movie, then\nthis is it, nevertheless you shouldn't go in with big expectations.<br><br>Enjoy :)\n"
"\n(45%) A big budget, globe trotting zombie horror/action movie that\nfeels very much like cut scenes from a video game glued together. The\nbiggest issue here though is the characterisation, as the movie unfolds\nwe learn next to nothing about every single person in the entire movie.\nMr Brad Pitt is a married man with kids and a job with the UN and that\nis pretty much all we ever learn about his character, apart from him\nbeing more than able to smash open zombies heads with a heavy metal\nbar, and he is in almost 100% of the movie. Overall though it is a\ndecent fast zombie movie if that's all you want, but it's nothing more\nbesides.\n"
"\nif i'm honest was not expecting much from this film but how wrong i\nwas! I'm a great fan of zombie films and was not disappointed with this\none, the action scenes were intense and plenty, the zombies themselves\nwere also different to any i have seen before they were fast, strong,\naggressive and slightly intelligent. it makes a change to see a zombie\nflick thats does not entirely center on one area or a group of\nsurvivors, in this film u saw the world dealing with it and how one man\nrisked his life to find answers. my advice watch this film because in\nmy opinion it could be the start of a new zombie film wave (hopefully)\ndon't compare this movie to others like dawn and land or even diaries\nof the dead! it is a whole new outlook on living dead films and i hope\nto see more like it!\n"
"\nI saw the trailer, hoping for an adrenaline filled pumped zombie movie\nhowever, World War Z wasn't quite as pumped and adrenaline filled as i\nhad hoped.Instead World War Z, had disappointed me because it was\nmarketed as a pumped zombie thriller but id saw overall there was more\naction in the trailer than in the whole movie. It just seemed like any\nother zombie thriller out there and in no way compares to '28 days\nlater'(in my opinion best zombie classic) which if your looking for a\ngood zombie movie i strongly recommend over world war z. To me it was\njust another zombie flick and didn't really have anything special to\nremember.Some of the acting is okay and some is excellent,however, i\nthink it lacked originality.i would overall recommend you watch 28 days\nlater before and then watch this movie. its not anywhere comparable to\nthe zombie movie classics such as Night Of The Living\nDead,Zombieland,Zombi 2 and Dead Alive.\n"
"\nProduction values alone are the only thing keeping this in the 5-10\nrange of ratings. Great effects keep this worth watching.<br><br>However, coming from a zombie book, this was an extremely disappointing\neffort. The infected hardly act like zombies until the final act when\nthey are \"dormant\". They honestly reminded me of the dark stalkers in I\nAm Legend, which was a huge disappointment considering I (and I'm sure\nmany other book fans) were expecting either Romero zombies or at least\nDawn of the Dead remake zombies.<br><br>Funny thing is, the theatrical ending we got was thrown in at the last\nminute while the original ending was cut. I almost wish they would have\nincluded this extra footage just to make the DVD/Blu Ray worth owning,\neven if the theatrical ending is the only part with true zombie-like\nbehaviors displayed.<br><br>Worth owning for genre completionists, but it won't be something you\nfind yourself wanting to watch very often.\n"
"\nThis is a great thriller, filled with impressive visual effects and\nintense suspense. The set design of this film felt grandeur and\nspectacular, which I felt was great but it inhibited some much needed\nemotional human moments. Something this film had plenty of were jump\nscares, which can only be seen as effective in a zombie movie. I did\nlike the realistic tone that was present throughout, making me believe\nthat a zombie outbreak could really happen. Unlike I Am Legend, I\nthought the way World War Z solved this global catastrophe was\nbelievable and eye- opening. Of course the star of World War Z is Brad\nPitt, and he does a great job in my opinion portraying the character.\nMy real problem is with the actual character itself. It seems as if\nthis guy is invincible and can overcome any obstacle that comes in his\nway. I didn't read the book so I'm not sure if that's how the character\nis written, but it did draw me out of the movie at times. The ending\nfelt very rushed which did affect my grade of the movie; however this\nis a solid film with more style than substance.\n"
"\nI'm not really into zombie movies and TV shows, but I actually enjoyed\nthis one. Brad Pitt was his usual gutsy self, being the tough guy\nmaking the tough decisions. The movie wasn't real cheesy considering\nthe zombie theme. It had good action, suspense, and kept you on the\nedge of your seat. It actually half seems like it could happen in real\nlife, but not quite on the large scale it did in this movie, or as\nfast. What ever happened to the parents of the Mexican boy? They never\nreally addressed that. Is it just me or were the zombies exceptionally\nfast and strong? They were running like twice as fast as everyone else.\nThat makes it even more terrifying!\n"
"\nIf this movie had a low budget this movie would be considered b-rated.\nIt looked like the script wasn't well written, and all the best parts\nin the film were shown in the previews. The acting was decent, and the\nstory at best was fair. I think that the film makers and studio just\nwanted in on the cash cow. Zombies are zombies, and this seemed to be a\nrip off of Resident Evil, The Walking Dead (The Movie &amp; AMC's Show).<br><br>While it was OK, I wouldn't recommend this film to people who like\nzombie films. The only upside I could think of was that the special\neffects were pretty good. It's bad but, not something that I'd call a\nfavorite. I feel that this was a wasted effort.\n"
"\nWorld War is a fictional movie. I love action thriller but I am not a\nbig fan of movies based on Zombies and Aliens. But as Brad Pitt is the\nlead in this so I decided to watch.<br><br>It's a long 2 hours 15 minutes movie with some surprises, shocks and\nhas some great graphics. Pitt is amazing as always. This movie show\nanother side of the Pitt as he is a family guy now and unlike Fight\nClub and Troy he is more of a family guy and is motivated by family.<br><br>The movie has a logical conclusion which you will hardly find in any\nfictional movie. The supporting actors have also performed very well.<br><br>The movie also highlight the important aspect of our lives that we are\nvery much prepared to fight each other but we are not at all prepared\nto fight the other forces and disasters. And no one really know what to\ndo during these time.\n"
"\nI'm not understanding some of the lackluster reviews here but I respect\nthat everyones entitled to their opinions. I haven't read the book yet\nso I'll preface my review with that. I've seen both the rated and\nunrated cuts of this film, both are very good. This movie is riveting\nfrom start to finish. No filler, just action. Much like movies such as\nCloverfield and 28 Weeks Later/28 Days Later you'll feel like you're in\nthe movie experiencing it as one of the characters. It moves so well it\nfeels like it flies by but in a good way. I recommend it. The acting is\ngood too. Cinematography is epic and special effects are above average.\nWell worth a watch by all, genre fans or not.\n"
"\nafter 28 days later i was looking for a good entertaining zombie flick\nbut so many films just fall short or never live up to the expectation\nexample are resident evil retribution.<br><br>so after long time i purchase world war z blu ray , i was not expecting\nmuch but after sit through this movie every minute is entertaining even\nthough is not r rated and not have blood,gore and there are not much\nviolent it still deliver a good suspense and scary moments.Brat pitt\nhas put money on a good project good to see him back in big budget\nfilms after curious case of benjamin button.<br><br>this film is fresh and imaginative with spectacular visuals my vote\n9/10 highly recommended.\n"
"\nDecent zombie flick. I would have to say it would be third on my list\nof zombie films to see with The Walking Dead on top and 28 days later\nin second. I'm a little bit of a science nerd and didn't feel that the\nending was very plausible but hey it's science fiction and there are no\nzombies yet so I guess anything is possible in a movie of this type.\nThe reason I compare it to Contagion is because of the world wide\nfactor. Not many zombie films try to focus on the world wide epidemic\nand instead only focus on a select group or team and there endeavors to\nfurther the plot. I like the fact that this film wraps everything up in\nthe end. It doesn't leave much to the imagination but I like not having\nto over think things, sometimes. Overall it was worth seeing at least\nonce. I don't feel that I would get much pleasure in watching it again\nbut it was a nice change up in the common Zombie movie plot.\n"
"\nThis is a movie where you say i spent 2 hours but i don't say want them\nback! It was really enjoyable and the zombies where amazing i mean in\nthe acting. They were realistic and the sounds were really good not\nincredible but still great. I strongly recommend that movie for the\nfamily! I know it has horror and stuff but its great with company! Also\nthe action scenes where amazing because there where great physics. By\ntelling physics i meant the zombies, how they fall,die and stuff. Also\nreally fast start of the action! The action starts within minutes from\nthe start of the movie and that makes the movie more exciting and more\nviewable. I mean there so little times that you will say the word\n\"bored\".\n"
"\nThis film is billed as a zombie apocalypse film and it succeeds in\nbeing exactly that which is the reason I like it so much. Brad Pitt is\nhit with this Zombie Apocalypse that has taken over the whole world and\nhe has to attempt to find a vaccine to stop this apocalypse. His\nperformance is great and he is the main guy that you have to care about\nbecause the film doesn't really focus on anybody else. His family and\npartners in the film are okay but you don't really care what happens to\nthem throughout the film. The best part of this film is of course the\nzombies these flesh eating creatures move faster then traditional\nzombies. Some of the crazy shots with the zombies are breath-taking and\nthe film never really gets better after these encounters. This film's\nclimax is tense without really any violence and that is the key for\nthis film and is so tense to watch. This isn't going to win any Oscars\nbut it is a fun zombie film that I enjoyed a lot.\n"
"\n..So i was a fan of the original Max Brooks novel, but had heard enough\nabout this movie going in to know not to expect it to be anything like\nthat...<br><br>So I went into this movie with no expectations, and honestly was pretty\nimpressed for the first half. This was a real smart, intense, gritty\nportrayal of how the world and its governments could react to an\noutbreak such as this. I find it very telling to learn that pretty much\neverything in this movie after Israel was a re-write and re-shoot,\nbecause i found the tone and intelligence of the film took a dramatic\nshift with the plane sequence. <br><br>Still, this is a fairly entertaining action picture that involves\nzombies. I would not call it horror, as it is shot to be very PG-13,\nbut still the film is effective.\n"
