absolutely loved every minute of this movie
usually im not too crazy about tarantinos movies but this one is definitely the best one ive seen in a long time
the actors were picked perfectly
the overall experience of a movie is amazing
when we first went to watch it i was a bit skeptical and thought id end up leaving an hour into the movie its a 3 hr movie but it grabbed my attention from the very beginning and i didnt even wanna get up to go to the bathroom afraid to miss something
im usually very particular about the movies nothing can hardly satisfy me but this one is definitely in the top 5
soundtrack was perfect
when i got home ive done some more research on it and loved it even more
overall i would highly recommend this film
at first i didnt want to see this movie because of some political remarks made by jamie foxx and samuel jackson two of my previously favorite actors but quintin tarentino is a great director so i broke down and saw it
glad i did
this was absolutely one of the best movies of the year
although jamie foxx has top billing this film would not have been anywhere as good without christoph waltz
he stole every scene he was in
brilliant acting and great comedic delivery
leo was great too
lots of blood something expected in most of quintins movies but a great story
also expect to hear the n word about 2000 times
cristoph waltz should get the oscar for his performance
should get nominated for best picture
this is absolutely a must see
this is teenage garbage plain and simple and teenage in terms of the directorwriter
lets set aside that tarantinos movies never have any substance and are exercises in retro gory fetishist camp
lets ignore that the story arc is off and the film is way too long
also that there are massive issues regarding all kinds of credibility
which leaves the two main problems with this adolescent mess
the first is what would you say about any film centered on two races of people in which one race is with a single exception shown to be nothing but a vast collection of savage cruel stupid buffoons
thats what qt happily does to the white race in this his attack on racism
then theres the blatant theft of mel brookss blazing saddles in the many nword remarks geared for laughs and the idiot pre klansmen
never was a big brooks fan but at least he never had the gall to pretend he was making a statement
i felt dirty watching it and am embarrassed i stayed until the end
a weak story with cruelty amp violence beyond the pale
for those who can separate fiction from reality yet have a peculiar bent towards violence this movie may be manageable
for those without good filters this is fodder for another newtown
sorry i gave tarantino my money that i wasted my  is incidental that i encouraged him to make more trash is deplorable
i think there is a place for violence where it adds to the story in this case the movie was solely about violence
is there a plot
yes but it is incedential this is about blood amp gutsand i dont mean bravery
there is no redeeming aspect to the movie don waste your time
i expected this movie to be awesome since the director is awesome
i was sadly mistaken
i have to admit it had good points but over all i wish i wouldnt have wasted my money
not only did it throw me off when they were playing rap music in a western movie but in one second they were talking about going to find someone and the next second they knew exactly where they were and they were already there
really
and the sad thing is is that i always use this website to compare the good movies that are out and this one had the highest rating
now it makes me wonder where the ratings really come from
i expected so much more with all the good actors in this movie
i never expected samuel l jackson leo dicaprio or jamie fox to be in a movie this horrible
quentin tarantino needs to undergo some serious rehab before directing another movie
this movie was as racist as it gets with the gratuitous use of the n word and the overhyped violence of white men torturing and killing black men and black men taking vengeance on white men
historically the film is schizophrenic jumping from what appears to be the 1880s in the mountainous west right down to the costumes and the weapons to the ol southern plantation life of the precivil war twenty fiveyears earlier
with shots of hilly california thrown in for good measure
the only saving grace of this movie is christoph waltz as the german bounty hunter and jamie foxx looking uncomfortable on horseback
for the life of me i dont understand what prompted leon dicaprio to take part in this fraud
after the huge success of this movie over the past few weeks i started wondering what is tarantinos winning recipe for this movie
was it the depiction of brutality african people were subjected to during the slavery
certainly not since there are movies that do a much better job in that area
was it the spaghetti western style
not the best one in that area either
the satirical portrayal of some characters or situations
the movie has its funny moments but with all of my generosity i could not call it a comedy nor a satire
and then it struck me
profanity
profanity spiced with a few jokes and the right dose of blood spatter
thinking back to his previous work i started to see the pattern
this recipe seems to be very successful with the audience
why not give the masses what they want right
that one worked for rome too
at least for a while
it seems to me the prophecy of the movie idiocracy regarding our society is becoming a reality much sooner than expected
nope
no spoiler alerts here other than proper caveats to warn you that you shouldnt bother watching this
i write this only because nobody took the trouble to warn me
going by the oscar wins and availability decided to watch it to my complete disappointment and disgust
what bad lies and niltononexistent acting
when it became clear there was going to be no improvement in the story or the pace i stopped watching
so saving you the trouble before you get as far
and i believe that i have to write 10 lines on a minimum to make you believe it is true
i am a history buff
i love historical fictions and fictional histories
this movie falls in a category all in itself
other than some glossy historical costumes it might have been set in washington d
c
since then ive read things that say there may be a political agenda in this
nope the independent cinema viewer in me couldnt watch it long enough to agree
unentertaining and tiresome
i thought it was absolutely idiotic
ok so django gets a couple lessons in gun play and then kills 200 people without ever taking a bullet the rest of the movie
not to mention he takes down 30 people at the end of the movie by himself
they should have just called it rambo vi
christopher waltz is pretty grand in it but his character makes out germans to be this great altruistic people
ya uhm dude hate to inform you of this but germans become the worst humans in history
personally i think its just too touchy a subject to make an action comedy about but to each their own i guess
honestly i believe the most intriguing character of the film is the one samuel jackson plays as an obedient former slave to candiedicaprio
his character would be an intriguing study but in this film he merely gets a few scenes
now i can finally say quentin tarantino is the most shtty and overrated director of all times how on earth you call this movie good
its just the acting of these marvelous stars that even let me watch it for these almost three fuin hours just his kill bill 1 is the movie i can say is worth watching shitty director just full of sht
you will be better watching an old jet lee movie or something because if you are in this movie for the good acting of leonardo you wont find it
jamie fox and his bad acting
not that good really
the movie does not build up to the quality that we have seen in previous movies that talk about racism nor it shows anything real for that matter
the movie does not deliver the message that you might expect
i had to hold the control in my hand because the music would be too loud and the dialog too low
good cast though
if it hadnt been for the allstar cast i probably wouldnt have chosen it to start with
i have never been disappointed with a samuel jackson movie although i didnt recognize him at first
leonardo decaprio plays a villain with glee
it was well acted and believable
it was a fairly good story i like to watch a film that strays from the average and predictable especially in westerns
it well filmed with beautiful scenery
i recognized the grand tetons
but the film was way too long and bloody
i spent the last half hour just hoping for it all to end
this was a poor movie poor actor play except for leo di caprio who was very good as always the play of django brumhilda and dr shultz were all especially poor
completely unrealistic story kind of stupid even that could never happen in the wild wild west they would have both been killed right at the start of the movie
a cockandbull story
too much stupid tarantinolike effects like fake blood and 1 man kills 1000 scenes a small bag of dynamite destroys a huge building
this movie doesnt deserve its high rating it should be a 7 at max
i guess the stupid and blacks all voted 10  and the smart did not even watch it
a generous 5 for a few good scenes but overall just crap worst qt outing ever
the whole premise is weak  the whole dr king schultz character and his actions would have gotten him killed the way they ambushed the guys and destroyed the wagon  stupid why they didnt simply buy the wife  makes no sense whatsoever the mark of a film maker that has nobody in the editing room or reviewing the script and saying this is pretty far fetched you have to be a real fan boy to give this a good rating there are a lot of fan boys here of course i hope his next outing is better to say the least this wasnt highlander 2 bad  but it was bad
interesting plot story and events
above average soundtrack and good actors who are really amiable and suitable
excellent photography and directing of the movie
holds excellent messages though many things need to be clearer
just enough comedy to be mixed with drama
sequence of events is good to very good but couldve been much better
the movie was very good and had just the perfect amount of western style inclusion but for most people i think they expected more in addition to the amount of drama
the movie showed how crucial the slavery of black people was but didnt show how crucial it was for the other blacks other than him and his wife and couple of others and this was very disappointing taking into consideration how long the movie was
i think the movie shouldve been also count as a drama and an action
overall the movie was very good and fun to watch and sophisticated in a way plus it was just enough western and drama that will not make you depressed
rating 7
12510 final rating percentage 71
the story and the acting were good but the implementation could have been better
the main character is nothing more than a black clint eastwood so in that respect its kind of a ripoff of his spaghetti westerns
the musical score is terrible
it doesnt come close to matching the era or the scenes themselves
gunfights are very graphic and most will find them over the top
its not something id put in my collection neither is it something that is good for repeated viewing
everyone seems to give it rave reviews but i think its because they are just tarantino movie fans and are letting his reputation feed into their opinion
how unrealistic can a move be
some reviewers actually gave this movie a 10
based on what
it started out ok and had some situations that happen maybe
but for the last ten minutes i didnt know if i was watching a western movie gone bad or the writer was just making a big joke of the whole thing
when django jumps on a horse bareback with no bridle and rides off with the horse under total control over the horse that about did it for me
how phony can you get
it went downhill fast from there turning a sort of interesting movie into a cartoon
i shoot in competition and i wish i could shoot 110th as good as django
my goodness
the first time he shoots a guna rifle its a 200 yard shot at a guy on a running horse
and he hit him
and he shoots from the hip not really taking aim and never misses
how anybody could give this movie high marks is a real wonder
and at the end when he ride his horse like he was trained for the circus i just cracked up
a bounty hunter helps a slave rescue his wife
tarantino has a sick obsession with violence
in films like pulp fiction and inglorious basterds the scripts are so interesting that one can overlook the bloodfest
unfortunately the script for this western is so long and dreary that the repellent violence cant be ignored
the film actually gets off to a fairly engaging start thanks to a gem of a performance from waltz as dentist slash bounty hunter
foxx is much less interesting as django a perpetually angry and arrogant slave
things take a turn for the dreary when dicaprio enters the picture as an evil slave owner
soon thereafter the film runs out of steam but still rambles on for about an hour
this movie seemed rushed and pointless
he has done enough revenge movies already
i didnt care about any of the characters
i normal like the soundtracks of tarantinos movies but i didnt like hearing a rap or whatever you call it song in a western
people complained about the number of times they said the word nggr
that didnt really bother me
its a movie about slavery
the usage did it sounded to modern
it was funny a whole theater full of people didnt bat an eye over a man getting beat to death
yet they all jumped and cringed every time someone said nggr
it was filled with the usual references and hommages to the genre tarantino is ripping off
like the cameo by hangem highs bruce dern
an like django spelling his name to the real django franco nero
which i liked
but it seemed forced
this movie just seemed like a good idea that was poorly executed to me
django unchained is filmmaker quenton tarantinos latest offbeat adventure for the big screen
highlighting this film are great performances by christoph waltz jamie foxx samuel l
jackson and an ensemble supporting cast that includes former television stars don johnson tom wopat bruce dern don stroud and amber tamblyn
however it is the sharp performance of leonardo dicaprio as the cruel and merciless plantation owner calvin candie that steals the show in this violent tale set in the south prior to the civil war
inspired by the 1966 italian made western django tarantino wrote a script for this film that accent and combine his unique style of filmmaking with the spaghetti western genre while presenting an eyeopening look at slavery in the deep south during that period
in typical tarantino fashion this movie was not made for the faint of heart with its extreme graphic depiction of violence and torture
so be warned
even though this movie runs long at just under 3 hours it maintains your interest at a high level
while throwing money down a sinkhole will not employ an entire cast of coat hangersactors it does compare to junk food
ultra violence then a chuckle then more violence and a big ooh and a ha ha
so forth it grinds
until you cast an eye around the cinema to discover yourself surrounded by teenage minds caught in a emotional seesaw of an infantile relapse
and then our hero gets the girl in the end like a kick in the shin
i could also have feed the pigeons with the popcorn
decoupage narratives from this director are so last century
so tarantino that you would want to forget the many works he references endlessly only to discover these for yourself
there is basically no way this piece of junk could have been saved by another director
as every element save the cinematography and costumes reek of sloppy work
quentin tarantinos django unchained is a long movie so be prepared
it is set during the slave period of the us south and there are very graphic depictions of the physical violence used during that time
jamie foxx does a fine job as django a slave required by a bounty hunter dr king shultz played by christoph waltz to identify brothers that are wanted for crimes
as django and shultz team up the movie unfolds with much violence and use of the n word
it reaches a point where dr shultz is killed and that is where the movie ends in my mind
shultz was by far the most interesting character in the movie and after his death i did not care anymore
leonardo dicaprio overplayed his role as he can easily do as a villainous slave and plantation owner
actors samuel jackson and don johnson both were excellent in their respective roles but christoph waltz was the standout in this film and as mentioned after his death there is no movie anymore
i was looking forward to this movie and even more after i learned that christoph waltz who impressed me in inglorious bastards is playing here as well
the idea of the movie was
interesting director did a great job christoph waltz was again flawless and quentin tarantino did again very good job at taking only inspiration from the original and not just copy it which i value highly in these times when big percentage of hollywood movies are just copies
so
why only 610
i know that black had it hard in times of slavery
everyone does at least i hope everyone does
so why i have to watch testament to it in action movie
the movie would be great if it didnt waste one hour on this topic
this way it was just long and i was yawing from the middle
i am not a quentin tarantino fan
i am not a jamie foxx fan
christoph waltz gives me the creeps
all of the prefilm cons aside i still didnt like it
it was actually not bad for tarantino not too gritty and overthetop
jamie foxx was not ridiculously overacting for once and you actually get used to him after a little while
christoph waltz played a really good guys and you end up rooting for him till the end
i still didnt like it
i cant say exactly what it was
the story too farfetched or maybe too much just rubbing me the wrong way
i think parts of it may have been played to casual and others too dramatic
i watched it and i am not disappointed because i expected to hate it
i just dislike it
leonardo dicaprio stellar performance as always even as the bad guy and thanks tarantino for blowing yourself up i could watch that scene again and again
no kidding samuel jackson just absolutely nailed his uncle tom role
he was hilarious
not the best role for dicaprio but he did ok as well
don johnson was cool and james remar is always good
not tarantinos best but an enjoyable slice of historical fiction even though it was rife with plot holes and quite unlikely scenarios
fans of samuel jackson should consider it a must see
even though i really like james remar tarantino should noy have used him for two separate roles
it was a bit confusing
especially when all of the other cameos lee horsely tom wopat etcwere cool and he could have dredged up so many more forgotten actors to appear
i love tarantino but this one was so far over the top you couldnt even see the top from where i was
although there were a couple of good tarantinoesque scenes of dialog there wasnt enough to sink my teeth into
jamie foxx was solid
christoph waltz was excellent as usual
leo d
had his moments
samuel l
jackson was terrific as the house slave playing somewhat against type although subservient he was still irascible and no pushover so that was in keeping with his usual persona
the characters actions were generally uninteresting and the action was predictable
the violence was over the top even for qt
how many times can he show a bullet causing someones headchestlegarm to explode
it wasnt boring by any means it just didnt live up to my hopes for it
qt is so in love with playing with the filmic conventions of his youth he sometimes forgets to make a good film
this film is shameful on several levels
first it disgustingly violent
second it glorifies violence
third it shows violence as funny
fourth it is outrageously racist every white other than a german is sinister and most are stupid
fifth this racism is used to justify the first three points
sixth while some of the plot twists are clever several are just ridiculous and covered by the typical device of moving so quickly that you dont have time to consider how improbable they are
other than the foregoing it is pretty good fastpaced and sometimes funny
but how can anyone be so desensitized that heshe does not appreciate how offensive and dangerous this is
there is more to life than entertainment
what happened here
where is the magic
the unique tarantinos touch
where the originality the fresh dialogs the smart plot
this movie is boring flat badly written and worse acted
the story is predictable to the point its annoying
the good guy is so good the bad guy so bad
why
we dont know as they are not 3d characters but cardboard puppets
in fact the whole movie feels like a puppet show
and then those cheesy flashbacks showing the sweet couple during their sweet days
what is this a telenovela
i am sorry tarantino because obviously the loss of ms menkes has affected the quality of his production terribly
i hope he will recover it soon and give us again the special films that made him one of the greatest artists of cinematography
django what a disappointment
frankly this was a really boring movie with too much unnecessary violence
but since the director is tarantino criticizing this movie is some sort of taboo
if you have seen some of tarantinos work there is nothing new in this one
blood violence boring conversations and a story that has nothing special
heads explode bodies tear apart and people dies
that is the one sentence summary
i am not even mentioning the references that would be counted as racist
moral of the story this movie is not my cup of tea
neither the action justifies itself for such a long period of time nor the story is interesting enough to compensate for the violence which was totally unnecessary
quentin tarantino is quite possibly the master of popcorn cinema  entertaining films that give an illusion of depth while actually being incredibly shallow
this is another fine example of this genre and if you take it for that youll be sure to enjoy the film immensely
especially the first half is incredibly funny and christoph waltz shines as the incredibly subtly named dr
king that frees django and turns him into a bounty hunter
theres good dialogue decent action scenes and just enough of a story to keep you entertained for almost two hours
sadly the film lasts for almost three and would have greatly benefited from some serious editing
at some point i just wanted it to end especially when tarantinos usual gorefest took over in the last third of the film
if you are trying to find out whether youll enjoy the film thats quite easy
if you like any other tarantino film youll like this one
if you dont care for his style this one wont change your mind
so really its just more of the same solid albeit uninspired entertainment
last week i managed to watch django unchained and i have to say that i am a little disappointed about what on the screen happened
i expected an outstanding movie which presents well done dialogs awesome screenplay and compelling atmosphere
in my opinion none of the points above were fulfilled
this was tarantinos worst done movie
just too cheesy and low for being nominated for an academy award
compared to the previous movies django unchained is a boring nearly 3 hour torture
everybody in my environment is keen about django but i can not understand why
hopefully kill bill 3 will be better than django unchained
sorry django 410
this film is just another one in which tarantino resorts to truly unnecessary violence and bloodshed in order to draw the attention of a crowd of a dubious taste
it is as if he doesnt care at all about the artistic quality of his work
it is all blood and death and destruction
all characters and incidents are extremely exaggerated
this film has certainly not been made to claim a place in the history of cinema
id rather like to remember tarantino as the prodigal director of extremely creative lowbudget films such as pulp fiction or reservoir dogs
artistic genius is not measured by how much the artist earns it is measured by how much his art is valued how long his works are remembered
looks like tarantino is getting old and jaded
he generally has a small acting role in his movies in this one he looked like elvis in the latter part of his career and so does the movie
going through the motions with little emotional involvement or imagination
i am actually quite a fan of tarantino and had hoped to see his equivalent of clint eastwoods unforgiven but left the theater disappointed
the movie was far too long for what was on offer not that much and the ending seemed to be a 20 minute add on to meet blood and gore quotas and nothing more
as regards acting this movie should leave a few of the famous thinking like silvester stallone after he made rhinestone
i understand he basically paid to have that movie taken out of circulation
samuel jackson in particular may soon be doing the same
his role was far from sympathetic but made worse by overacting
dont give up the day job quentin
quentin tarantino made a few excellent movies in his carrier but in a last few years i guess he is lacking out of inspiration
he is starting like most of directors and actors in last few years to make random movies about random things that pop his mind and he gets credit for it on account of his previous fame
this movie i can compare to a inglorious bastards
i contains lot of unnecessary scenes too many doesnt have a point and it isnt even that funny
blood is everywhere in this film and its suppose to be funny
its not
director put in this movie every random thought that crosses his mind
dialogues are supposed to be witty and clever but they are really not like they are for example in reservoir dogs pulp fiction
i can describe this movie like wannabe puplp fiction and it failed hard
even various soundtrack themes are not fitting in picture and they are out of place i mean rap music
wtf
watch this movie if u dont have anything better to watch and u always do have
510
ok ok how good is django really
i am a real quinton fan
this movie is good to watch if you if you know his style
it has a message of redemption and empowerment
i like seeing jamie fox and other ethnic actors getting top roles
as far as original this effort is dull
he borrowed the success of hans lander from inglorious
samuel jacksons role is just another movie for him to be in
as far as using slavery as a plot i would rather see more serious depictions in movies that enlighten us and drive us to improve our outlook toward a better future
the difference between inglorious basterds and this movie is that we do not have a race of people that we still have a derogatory word that is harming us as people
the n word is old in quintons movies and why do we still use it to make millions at the box office
not really a great movie
lets see if quinton has it in him to do a movie without needing two hours of the n word
this movie was absolutely amazing i knew that i was going to love it because jamie foxx is one of my favorite actors
the message behind the movie was powerful and deep
the details in the scenes were right own point
the actors and actresses they played those roles to the core
i have watched this movie over 10 times literally
the whole movie is so exciting and surrounding
the whole crew is acted wonderfully
oddly the rather blank stoic django is the least interesting character in this violent somewhat uneven film
in his previous film inglourious basterds quentin tarantino told a masterfully sprawling story of wwii bending history willynilly to find a more truthful center
django unchained is even longer and more sprawling but with a much simpler story and themes
it doesnt quite fit
the movie has long flabby stretches that scream for the cuttingroom floor while the bursts of violence often feel outsized and misplaced
i was engaged in this movie from minute one
just the soundtrack mixed with the images makes you want to see where the story goes
jamie foxx does all that its required from him in the main role with a great oscar winning performance from christoph waltz who can be charming funny and charismatic all in a role that you dont necessarily root for in the beginning
their chemistry is what drives this movie and it does it rather well
the cinematography here is top notch and tarantino proves hes probably the director that most wisely chooses songs for his movies
what takes this movie in my opinion to epic status is leos surprising role as a villain who most couldnt see dicaprio do
but he excels in this role
overall is a movie that doesnt bore you for one minute and its part of my personal favorites
i just recently chose to watch this movie
i avoided it for the longest time as i consider the subjugation of a people based on elements of their birth to be heart breaking and morally wrong
i must say that jamie foxxs promotion of the movie by saying i killed all the white folk did not encourage my interest in the movie
that being said
after watching the movie it is truly a well directed and tasteful movie
while demonstrating the vulgarity of slavery the story so elegantly intertwines a story of both redemption and righteousness
i tip my hat good sir
a truly well written directed and performed movie
this is a very fun tarantino flick thats at the same time one of his best ones
this movie is very good at entertaining the viewers and at the same time showing them the cruelty of slavery that makes you doubt humanity
watching the perfect portrayal of django von schaft candie stephenand especially dr
schulz who is so awesome you cant believe it
and like in every tarantino movie one of the main characters dies to soon in this case its sadly dr
schulz and also in this movie is the quirky tarantino humor that we all love
i can only recommend this movie to tarantino western or only casual movie lovers ok who am i kidding
everybody should watch this movie
i ignored the hype around this movie for a long time mostly because many years ago i had seen reservoir dogs and did not enjoy it
this movie made me a tarantino fan after watching this film i went back and watched all of tarantinos films and loved them all including reservoir dogs
the incredible acting performance by christoph waltz is one of the highlights of this film
i believe waltz might be one of the best currently active actors out there right now and whether or not you dislike or like quentin tarantino films i would urge anyone to watch this film solely to see what great acting is
furthermore the story is captivating and the way this film handles slavery and american history at this point in time is handled in a way that i have yet to see in another film
of course this movie is 100 tarantino and is incredibly violent but if youre a fan of tarantino never seen a tarantino movie or enjoy great movies watch this now
this is an exceptionally good movie
some of the scenes of violence against people are great to watch
i loved watching villainous people getting hurt and killed
that first shooting scene at the candieland plantation was intense and extremely gripping
the treatment of slaves in the movie is just about as horrible as black slaves in america were ever treated which makes the revenge violence more pleasing
the music is great in it
one of my favorite scenes is where django is riding a horse and is dressed up in 18th century clothes and is looking dignified and the song his name was king
or whatever its called plays
that is a very funny part of the movie
much to my surprise i liked it very much
i think that it is qts best since reservoir dogs
having seen it i am baffled by the misguided commentary about the film that greeted its release
no one seemed to realize that it is first and foremost a black in both senses of the word comedy
i found it extremely clever and funny throughout
indeed it seems to be as much an homage to blazing saddles and skin game as to the original django
i had my usual language objections mild by tarantino standards but not the one that seemed to bother everyone else
of course if this were the old days it would have benefited from an intermission that separated the first section from the candie land section
i gave it a b
i did not enjoy this movie as much as i thought i would
since christopher waltz was in it
which he totally earned that oscar win for his performance
but jamie foxs performance was not that impressive and the movie seemed to drag on for me
i do not think it should have be nominated for best picture but it would have been better than argo
leonardo dicaprio did a fairly good job in his role and i enjoyed him
i also liked samuel jackson who in my opinion was very funny
so overall i give it a 5 and i encourage you to watch it you might like it better than i did
oh and one more thing kerry washington was not that bad and i am not a big fan of her acting
nobody cares all right but i have to confess a thing before starting this review the dlame thing isnt mine its a friend of mine that said so a genius short analysis if i might say
i would stop this writing right there with that word but imdb needs ten lines at least so lets get a bit deeper into the subject
the movie is watchable and that is a good news because tarantino is still far above the average actors are pretty good but only mr
jackson and mr
waltz reach a high level and the plot stick you to the chair vengeance on racist
what is missing
editing
what happened when the camera got back to the rental house and the computer got turned on
nobody knows but i believe it messed things up
the editor changed and the work isnt good
whos fault is it
no clue because in movie making 22 is equal to whatever
the first scenes of this film are very promising
it is intelligently funny and the the effects of alienation in setting costumes and also how the actors play their roles are really aesthetic
even the killings are that way
therefor one doesnt take them too seriously and they dont spoil the fun watching at first
after a while though i began to wait for more fun and more smartness
instead there came unnecessary brutality and killing
the fun was mixed in and a bitter taste came to it all
i waited for the next scene and told my children that now it will be smart again but it never happened instead it became even more cruel
like that not smartness speed and humor win but becoming as bad as the enemies
still django is the hero
the characters are very well chosen and the roles are acted out very well
only django himself is not totally convincing
the day this film came out i immediately ordered it on amazon
i was looking forward to watching it being a big tarantino fan and having enjoyed inglorious basterds i saw no reason why i wouldnt enjoy it
after watching it i came to the conclusion it was better than inglorious basterds by some distance too
its a blast from beginning to end
the plot was entertaining to watch and it kept me guessing
the dialog is hilarious in places yet serious in others which did work very well
the acting is terrific leonardo di caprio did a great job playing calvin candie the main antagonist in the film
but the standout performance has to be that of chistopher waltz
he was brilliant to watch as doctor king schulz
he made every scene his own not to say the other cast members were poor and he really was brilliant
jamie foxx also puts in a solid performance as django
overall i highly recommend this film especially if you are a fan of tarantino
fun dialog and great action
i like christoph waltz way more in this than inglorious basterds
there were many scenes in this movie that i went back and watched numerous times
i think some of the lines samuel l
jackson gets to deliver in this movie even top the most memorable ones from pulp fiction
i wasnt into jamie foxx as the lead character most of the timei think i would have liked someone else better
i liked leonardo in this better than anything else ive seen him in
he fits the role well
some favorite parts are the exchange with don johnson when they first arrive at his plantation the first few minutes we see sameul l
jacksons character and the brief conversation between django and betina
not the most flowing narrative but it kept me glued to the end
as much as i love tarantino his style is getting a little old
django unchained would be the perfect film if tarantinos previous films hadnt been made
it is sharp and clever at the same time with excellent packaging
the performances are outstanding and it is hilarious
it is a great film
now that ive said that im going to give a little warning about tarantinos next films
this movie has no background or message to it
it can barely support itself
if it wasnt made by tarantino it would be terrible
let me explain
why can he throw all of these racial slurs and offensive materials at us
it isnt like hes trying to prove anything
i get that hes trying to make something for the sake of it being cool but a little heart to the film would have been good
it gets by on this film but in the future hes gonna change something or it will get tiring
i get im saying negative things but as i said its still a great film
youve heard all the positive things about it i dont need to repeat it
grade a
the best movie ever
10 stars
when i die i will miss my son who i love most and movies in movies i will miss quentin tarantino
a exceptional fantastic and bombastic movie
quentin tarantino deserves all the golden statues
many thanks to all the cast especially forgive me jamie foxx did an brilliant interpretation but christoph waltz for me is radiant superb spices up perfectly all movies he enters
christoph waltz when enters the character hes like a big star glows and we glow with him
awesome
thanks to all cast and crew for the magic you give me and making my days more amazing
from portugal all the best
what a movie what a performance delivered from christoph waltz wow wow
true master piece from quentin tarantino
he has proved himself again that he is the king of making movies
i strongly suggest this movie is not for light hearted people
few scenes are from this movie very violent and gory
this is the one of the best movie ever taken in western trend so far
hats off to quentin what a talented guy he is
we except lot of master piece like this from you in future
i feel christoph waltz may win oscar for this movie my instinct says the same obviously he deserves for oscar no second thought about it
all western style comic lover must watch this movie
django unchained
another masterpiece from quinton tarantino this movie had a powerful lead from jamie fox and a very strong supporting cast of some big name actors the story line following django being freed of slavery on a mission to find and save his wife was easy to understand and follow the characters were interesting and kept you pulled in non stop action and blood shed kept true to tarantino style
and it made this film a thrill ride from the start
a very high recommendationthis was one of foxes best films next to ray well put together not a dull moment in this moviegreat story line top notch acting non stop action with some comedic parts make this film a definite 10
my husband hated it but i loved it
tarantino gives it that spaghetti western flavor with all the copious amounts of airborne blood and spatter that you expect from a tarantino film
jamie foxx comes through with a strong hardcore performance that has you rooting for him all the way
chris waltz gives a superb performance with the majority of the dialog and decaprio nails it as a charming albeit sadistic plantation owner
samuel l
jackson made you wanna slap the crap out of him
excellent
look for a few older actors in cameo roles including tarantino
so much fun with so much revenge
cant wait to own it when it comes out on dvd
it is with great pleasure to tell everyone that this is one brilliant film
ive seen an uncounted amount of films but nothing quite like this
its intelligent funny terrifying and directed with such creativity that it could wrap even hardest to please viewers in awe
leonardo dicaprio shows us once again why he is the greatest actor of our time
jamie fox played it well and christoph waltz performance was beyond spectacular
djangos soundtrack may be a little unfitting for some particular scenes but stunning visuals a shrewd script and monumental performances from a well rounded cast does more than make up for it
admirably giving quentin tarantinos already impressive directorial history  helming such timeless classics as pulp fiction jackie brown and reservoir dogs  i genuinely believe django unchained is his best work yet
