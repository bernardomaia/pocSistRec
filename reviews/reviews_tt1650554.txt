"\nI'm a huge fan of the first Kick Ass film and the comics, so I'm a\ntough fan to please but this film exceeded my expectations! In a year\nfull of over-hyped superhero films Kick Ass 2 came along with a low\nbudget, no contracted actors roped in and R rating and gave me the most\nentertaining hour and 40 minutes I've paid for all year!<br><br>Excellent acting all round especially from Jim Carrey and Chloe Moretz,\nthis film doesn't copy and paste the first but stays close enough to it\ncinematically that the new director takeover isn't largely noticeable. <br><br>I don't understand why the film hasn't been rated better, 10 out of 10\nfrom me. Super on all levels!\n"
"\nKick-Ass 2 was definitely a film for the fans, if you aren't familiar\nwith the Kick-Ass series then this movie wouldn't be for you. Having\nsaid that I am a fan of the comics and this movie was awesome. The\nfight scenes were crazy and Hit-Girl always runs the show. I hate that\nthe critic scores are low but I honestly kind of figured they would be\nand I see why they made it so low, to a film's core this film wouldn't\nbe looked at as a masterpiece, and they couldn't exactly retain the\nsame shock factor the first one had because Hit-Girl was only 11 or 12\nyears old in it. But all things aside this was a pretty entertaining\nfilm and I think most people would really enjoy it.\n"
"\nWatching KICKASS was a pleasant experience which really had some kick-\nass moments. Unfortunately , Kickass 2 tumbles down and is thoroughly\ndisappointing. <br><br>To fulfill her father's dream Hit-Girl leaves Kick-Ass and joins\nschool. Meanwhile Kickass joins a new group to protect the citizen. To\nhis surprise, Red Mist creates his own group of evils to avenge his\nfather's death. <br><br>Directed by Jeff Wadlow , Kick ass 2 has nothing new to offer. The\nbound of expectations raised by the original movie will be deteriorated\nby the sequel. The movie has no story and worst part is that not a\nsingle scene is glorious as compared to the previous part. Direction is\nno-where. Screenplay is disappointing. Editing is OK. Action scenes are\nfine. It is again Chloë Grace Moretz who shines as Hit-girl.\nUnfortunately , the character is not fully developed. Aaron\nTaylor-Johnson does his part fine<br><br>Overall , I was extremely disappointed with sequel. Disaster. 1/5\n"
"\nKick-Ass was a pleasant surprise; Kick-Ass 2 is a big disappointment.\nDefinitely not as good as the first movie... this time the jokes are\nnot as funny, there are zero surprises in the plot. Creativity was left\nbehind. Apparently the producers thought that the lack of intelligent\njokes could be compensated by adding gross \"humour\": people throwing up\nand shitting all over the place. That's supposed to be funny?? I found\nthe violence unnecessarily graphic: dismemberments abound, blood is\nshed as if it was nothing. And this is supposed to be a teen action\ncomedy? There is no need to show all that gore... Showing it as\n\"casual\" makes it more consumable and that is actually a very\nquestionable proposition!\n"
"\nWhat an absolutely terrible film. Gone is the style, the wit, the\nintelligence of the first film. This is a paint-by-numbers sequel which\nmissteps at every point. It glories in violence instead of critiquing\nit. The characters are boring caricatures of themselves, the supporting\ncast are cartoon characters - literally. Kick-Ass had real people in\nridiculous circumstances - this sequel has ridiculous people doing\nridiculous things for no apparent reason. Hit-Girl's story is a weird\ntired high school mean girls cliché which ends with Hit Girl getting\nrevenge by making them vomit and poo. Huh? I could go on and on, but\nthis film is just - weird, and a great big disappointment.\n"
"\n...this movie is just...I wish I could sue someone. I would sue the\nusers of IMDb for rating it higher than a 2. Its not badly made but the\nstory should be taken out and shot.<br><br>Twice!<br><br>I never comment or rate movies, but this one was so bad that I had to\ncome warn the world...<br><br>BE WARNED!<br><br>It is just nonsense about some guys and a girl who really have never\nhave a story written about. Writers should worry about showing people\nthe great things in life, this movie had none of that.\n"
"\nOne of the worst movies I've ever seen. There was no point to this\nmovie. The story was stupid. I should have been paid to watch this\nmovie. I rented it.Anyone who thinks this movie was good needs to to go\ninto therapy. It was so bad that all of the people involved in this\nfilm should be water boarded. In fact anyone connected with this movie\nshould not be allowed to be in or make another movie ever again. The\nstudio that made this \"film\" meaning that film is something you clean\nup from your sink or toilet should be burnt down, demolished and then\nburied under ten feet of granite. My wife stopped watching in about 30\nminutes into it. We left it on but was disgusted by the lack of plot\nand the total rip off of the first film. Was it a teen movie ? Was it a\nmovie comic book ? Was it a horror movie / Wasn't Batman or Spiderman.\nI know nothing of the \"comic\" it was based on but thought the first\nmovie was okay. I want back the time I spent watching this appalling\nfilm.\n"
"\nPretty Impressive with the sequel of the movie, what impress me the\nmost is the big improvement in Acting of Aaron, Chloe &amp; Chris, compare\nto the 1st movie, good work there. <br><br>Packed with full action compare to the last 1, smooth movement, cool\neffect, though is more violent than the previous 1, but still is\nacceptable, well at least for me it is. <br><br>Too bad that cage didn't show up in the sequel, but hey Jim is here,\nhis act impressed me, of course he does, its good to see him in this\nmovie, I miss his acting, its been a while. <br><br>Hoping that there will be kick ass 3 coming soon, well done team, nice\n1.<br><br>Voting this movie a solid 7 out of 10, good movie to watch to get a\ngood laugh.\n"
"\nWhen I saw this film was coming out, I could not contain my excitement.\nI enjoyed the first one immensely and was happy to see they were doing\na sequel. Admitially I was a bit skeptic about the 2nd one, as most\nother films which I have seen that have been sequels, the 1st is\nusually always 10x better than the first one.<br><br>I personally think this film is much more exciting and has better\nscenes of violence. I have read other reviews on this movie slating\nthis film as an 'enjoyable time waster' I would have to 1000% disagree\nwith this and I would probably say that out of all the movies I have\nseen this year, this one by far tops it.<br><br>I think the acting in this and the people they got to play the other\nsuper-heroes was just perfect, every new super hero made me laugh and\nagain they were also involved in some epic fight scenes.<br><br>So to anyone who is a bit skeptic (as I was) about seeing this movie..\nDon't! It's 'Kick-Ass' awesome.\n"
"\nI remember when this movie came out, I loved it so much. I like these\nmovies because there's no way things would go well for anyone who\ndecided to just become a superhero. These movies are violent, brutal\nand emotionally so rough. <br><br>But now that I've seen this movie too many times, I notice how tacky\nthe screen writing is. Especially during those scenes where Mindy\nclashes with the popular high school girls. Girls can be mean, but you\nwouldn't know that listening to these girls talk. <br><br>Still fight scenes are fun, character designs are amazing, and there's\nsomething in Kick-Ass movies that just couldn't be done in typical DC\nor Marvel movies, some kind of irony that could never work in Avengers.\nOf course Deadpool comes close, but Deadpool's not a typical Marvel\nmovie, is it?\n"
"\nMuch as I enjoyed the film... Th humor is labored and a bit too in your\nface this time.<br><br>A shame as overall the story is good for a film that never intended to\nbe serious.<br><br>It's biggest issue is the laughs come from trying to be as crude as\npossible - Which honestly fails most of the time.<br><br>If a little more thought had been put into proper laughs than trying to\nbe crude - Like naming the main villain the \"Mother F**cker\" - I would\nhave given at least an 8...<br><br>Still, if you liked the first film, you will enjoy this one too.\n"
"\nOkay, I admit I'm a huge Kick-Ass fan. This is my second favourite\nmovie of all time only to the first Kick-Ass. Dave is a whole lot\ntougher than he is in the first one, and it also shows the badass side\nof Jim Carrey. Jim Carrey always makes me laugh when he is in dumb and\ndumber, ace ventura and the mask but this shows the total badass side\nof him as Colonel Stars and Stripes, an ex-mob enforcer turned real\nlife superhero and born again Christian. His dog Eisenhower (Schvantz!)\nwas totally awesome too how she punished a villain by chomping on his\nballs. Hit-Girl was even more foul mouthed in this one than she was in\nthe first one (she is a 15 year old in this one), and this one had\nmother Russia, a super villain who punishes cops very violently and\nwith a lot of action. This has very little spoilers, I guess.\n"
"\nNot sure why so many people are giving this film 1 star reviews. There\nare films that I can't even watch 5 minutes of because they're so\npoorly produced or the acting is so terrible that it deserves 1 star.\nThis movie is not one of them. I get people's take on the violence etc.\nbut the film is rated R and it's based on a comic people! for frak's\nsake! Good soundtrack, great acting, and a very believable and\nrelatable to our world if there were heroes or villains. I love Marvel\nand the X-Men films (for the most part) but if you believe that someone\ngetting a sword shoved through them wouldn't make them bleed profusely\nthen you're just an idiot. The kick-ass franchise is actually realistic\nin the sense that it SHOWS BLOOD. If you don't like it go watch X-Men\nFirst Class ... (not ragging on first class ...just saying...no\nblood...the hell??)\n"
"\nThis was a great movie. It was nice that they carried over the story\nfrom the original. Some people may think the movie was a bit stupid but\nthis kept the character of the movie. The storyline was great and the\nhumorous content mixed with the action really went well together.\nBringing in new characters was a great plus. This just made the movie\nmore interesting, as you could learn about the new characters and what\nthere roles were in the movie. Personally believe that there was more\naction in the movie than the last one. It helps to keep you interested\nin the movie. Overall it was a great entertaining movie. I could easily\nwatch it over and over again just like I did with the first kick ass\nmovie. Hopefully they make a 3rd movie. That will be a must see!!\n"
"\nThe sequel to the original movie, Kick Ass, continues its legacy with\nthe same witty and amazing skills as the first. The difference with\nthis movie, from the original, is more action - more characters - more\nprofanity - and more action! The story picks up literally right after\nthe ending of the first. A brilliant first scene pulls you in as Hit\nGirl demonstrates a scene from the previous movie that was between\nherself and Big Daddy. The result is a hilarious moment that laughs you\nright into the movie and you have no choice but to continue to watch.<br><br>There are no boring moments during the movie and the end brings the\nperfect fight against good and evil. You even find out what those\nsyringes are used for! If you are looking for a movie that is full of\nprofanity, action, and makes you want to suit up and take on\ncriminals... watch Kick Ass 2!\n"
"\nIt's very impressive the amount of time people spend in writing\nreviews; good and bad but there's times where certain reviews and\nratings just make me angry. Like in this case; an absolutely amazing\nmovie given the presence. So like the majority of reviewers I give this\nmovie about an 8, because it kick ass. When I get angry is when I can\nnot reply to the comment or reviews; especially when you get some\nludicrous rating of 1 and moronic review. For such a popular site as\nIMDb it's not fair to the movies or the viewer when you have no ability\nto debate a left wing or right wing review. Of course this is my\nopinion just as each and everyone of these reviews are. In fairness\nthough, a film an acting educated opinion is worth more than a radical\nconservative/liberal or anyone with whacked agendas. All that being\nsaid Kick-Ass 2 was a super funny and wicked violent; along with great\nmoral story.\n"
"\nI remember when i watched The Avengers in theater. I was bored to\ndeath. The Avengers is not fun at all. KickAss 2, by other hand, is all\nabout the fun.<br><br>I loved KickAss 2. I didn't like the first so much, so i watched this\none without expectations. But even if a had gigantic expectations it\nwouldn't matter.<br><br>Jim Carrey was funny as ever, it was good to see Donald Faison again.\nAll the character were interesting and fun, ridiculous but coherent to\nthe movie spirit. <br><br>The final was amazing. Mother Russia vs Hit Girl was epic. By the way,\nmother Russia was some villain. <br><br>Well, thats what a comic book based movie should be all about. The fun.\nNot care so much about the most realistic outfit or the most expensive\neffects, but instead to bring fun and excitement.<br><br>I hope for a KickAss 3 in the same fashion of this one. Fun till the\nend.<br><br>Sorry about my bad English. Its not my main idiom.\n"
"\nConsidering the content, no other title could have been chosen except\n\"Kick-Ass 2\". This is not everyone's cup of tea, but nothing ever is.\nMeaningful parts will resonate with you, more than you think.<br><br>We might not be superheroes but we are never in a position in which we\nhave nothing to work with. We all have capacities, talents, direction,\nmissions, callings.<br><br>When the end credits started I thought to myself \"I want a third\ninstalment .\" I rated it this high because the film succeeds in\neverything it wants to accomplish.<br><br>I caught a screening with two of my best friends and all of us enjoyed\nit throughout. I really won't offer any spoilers, but the \"Sick Stick\"\nscene alone is worth the ticket money (:\n"
"\nThere's not much to say about this movie. It brings just what it\npromises: violence (not too gory tough, so I don't really get all the\nhate for the so-called \"extremely bloody violence\" in this movie,\nbecause we only see a little bit of blood here and there), pervasive\nhumor and alternation between a light and a dark tone throughout. So\nbasically it's just like the first movie, only with more heart and\naction. But then why is it just a 7 out of 10, while the first one was\neasily a 9 out of 10? I don't really know, it's a psychological thing I\nguess. The first one was fresh, new, controversial. This one is nothing\nbut a copy of that, but with more of everything. If you loved the first\none you will love this one too, but you'll love it even more if you\nnever saw the first one, if you know what I mean! 7/10.\n"
"\nReading the reviews of this only furthers my belief that mainstream\ncritics don't know what they're talking about half of the time. On\nrotten tomatoes this gets around 30% whereas the one direction movie\ngets nearly a 70%?! my point exactly. Kick Ass 2 is action packed and\nhilarious and it's just as good as the first if not better. <br><br>It's a natural progression in terms of story, characters. Hit-Girl and\nKick Ass are back and better than before with more outrageous wannabe\nsuperheroes, and their up against a new gang of badder super\nvillains.If your like me and enjoy R rated superhero/comic book movies\nyou'll enjoy this as this isn't your average superhero movie for the\nkids that's all about the CGI and a fluffy PG rating, its a more bloody\nsuperhero movie that's grounded in reality not fantasy.<br><br>Overall,it was a good movie don't listen to the critics. Just like the\nfirst set the stage for a part 2, this one sets it up for a 3rd and I\ncan't wait for Kick Ass 3 !!<br><br>7/10\n"
"\nThere is very poor writing, and the director failed to lead the story\nanywhere interesting. There is a lot of confusion on where to set the\ntone-something that the first film did very well. It felt like watching\na story that a sixth grader had written. In short I wish I had not\nspent money to see what I saw before leaving after about an hour and\nten minutes. I feel that had the original team been charged with\ncreating this film it would have been terrific, but it is a truly\ndisappointing project as it stands. For those who need closed\ncaptioning, be aware that this flick doesn't have it. That meant we\ncouldn't watch it here, but I'm not sure we would have stuck with it\nanyway, as the video quality was poor and grainy.\n"
"\nSo other than the star, the one solid performance by Jim Carrey, there\nwas nothing new to see.<br><br>sure Hitgirl tries to fit in at school and is reminded that she should\njust be herself. (cliché) Kicka$$ has a mid-life crisis at 17 and gets\nback into crime fighting. And his dilemma is whether its the right\nthing to do...(cliché)<br><br>Even the fight scenes have the same \"oh know hit girl is gonna die\"\nmoments to them...and then she doesn't. Had the thrown that\n\"LA-LA-LA... LA-LA-LA\" music from the first movie during the demecco\nhouse fight scene even the moronic masses would have picked up on it.<br><br>In my opinion, this movie is a good example of why piracy is so\nrampant. 10$ ticket, 7popcorn, 1$drink (loyalty cup), 4$ candy...22$<br><br>22$ for 120 minutes of, \"entertainment\" <br><br>Matthew Vaughn &gt; Jeff Wadlow\n"
"\nViolence,Vulgarity,Humor and Suuperheroes.... What's there not to like?\nSo we have Kick Ass(Aaron) and Hit Girl(Moretz) who had marked the\npresence of superheroes and started the revolution! Christopher Mintz-\nPlasse reprises his role and come back as a new super villain and now\nconsolidating a team to take revenge. Hit girl tries to balance her\nlife as a student which is a very realstick approach and I liked it a\nlot! There is a team of superheroes led by Colonel Stars and Stripes\nplayed by Jim Carrey who totally pulled it off! The movie had emotional\nscenes and intense elements just like previous part! If u liked Kick\nass 1 , you will definitely love this fantabulous sequel! Truly , it is\na stupendous sequel of a meritorious movie!\n"
"\nIf you enjoyed the whimsical idealism of the original Kick Ass, you'd\nbetter not subject yourself to this sequel, which is an altogether\ndifferent beast. In fact, you'd better not watch this movie too close\nto mealtime. The profanity is jarring and continuous, with f-bombs\nabout every 3 minutes, spearheaded by the idiotic name of the chief\nvillain, \"Motherf***er.\" The ultra-violence and ultra-vulgarity is\nreminiscent of a Quentin Tarantino flick. There are dismemberments,\ndecapitations, explosive vomiting and diarrhea, crotch-mauling dogs,\netc. It is difficult to write a spoiler for this movie because the plot\nis so weak. Consider yourself warned and avoid this grisly turkey.\n"
"\nThe first Kick-Ass film is one of my favourite films so I was delighted\nwhen I heard there was going to be a sequel. I didn't think it would be\nable to live up to expectations but it certainly did, it is a brilliant\nsequel. Both films are at least on par with each other.<br><br>The action again is fast paced and in some parts really gory, the\nhumour is still there and the characters are all portrayed extremely\nwell again. This one had more super heroes in it which I thought was\ngood and it was more straight to the point. As in the first one I think\nChloë Grace Moretz as Hit-Girl is the standout performer, she is\nunbelievably good in this role.<br><br>Overall it was a worthy sequel, I would recommend it to anyone. Even if\nyou don't normally like super hero films I think you may be pleasantly\nsurprised, it is just a brilliant action film. This is probably going\nto be the best film of Summer 2013, I really hope there is a Kick-Ass 3\n:)<br><br>9/10 - Must watch.\n"
"\nI'm surprised how low this has been reviewed. Yes the first film was\nspecial but this isn't going to write the same magic again.<br><br>I personally enjoyed the film and didn't find a lack of hit-girl\naction. There wasn't a great deal of it in the first one either,\nfrankly. And I'm told the graphic novel previous to the films were way\nmore... graphic.<br><br>The whole going to school thing didn't make the most sense, and in my\nimage of hit-girl I couldn't see her being upset by the opinions of a\nbunch of blatantly awful girls. Nor could I see her even being tricked.\nSo that needs fixing or some better insight into her character. Or\nperhaps everything was there but I just wanted the action hero.<br><br>Anyway, the film got the job done and it tidied up the loose ends the\noriginal left us with. Which I liked. It's nice to see big characters\nare actually mortal, unlike most series' where they just live on and on\nin some magical stasis of reality convenient for easy sequel writing\nand advertising icons you can re-use for half a century.\n"
"\nI have read the comics and have the first Kick-Ass, so I knew what to\nexpect going into this film. I knew it wasn't going to be word for word\nclose to the comics, neither was the first one. There is some stuff in\nthe comics that wouldn't have worked for the film, so I understand why\ncertain changers were made. Jim Carrey's performance as Colonel Stars\nand Stripes was literally spot on to his comic counterpart. Chloe Grace\nMoretz was great as Hit Girl, although the van chase sequence was a\nlittle cheesy. I was disappointed that Evan Peters did not return in\nthis one. However, the action was good, the character dialogue and\nchemistry worked surprisingly well. I do recommend this movie to anyone\nwho is a comic book lover or anyone who just wants to see a fun movie.\n"
"\nI found the first Kick-Ass to be an odd but fun film that deserved its\ncult classic status so I was really looking forward to its sequel.\nAlas, what a disappointment this is. From the moment we first hear the\nname of the villain, it became apparent that the film was simply trying\ntoo hard. Director Jeff Wadlow included all the violence and profanity\nfrom the first film but forgot to add any of the fun, resulting in a\nflat affair.<br><br>The key problem was how dull it all was, in particular involving the\narc of Mindy attempting to adapt to life in a new school; it all seemed\ntoo contrived. And I can't believe I'm saying this but the film misses\nNicolas Cage. Jim Carrey has been cast to replace him in that big-name\nrole but bizarrely he's barely in the film. There were just too many\ncharacters to keep track of and care about.<br><br>While the first Kick Ass was a great antidote to superhero movies, this\nis nothing more than a terrible parody.\n"
"\nKick-Ass 2 started out promising. The story, with Hit-Girl being forced\nto retire and leading Kick-Ass to form his own team was a fine start.\nJim Carrey was fun as Colonel Stars and Stripes, and the movie was\nshaping up. But from the moment Chris D'Amico arrived, he was annoying,\nand just got worse. Mother Russia and the other \"super villains\" were\nawful, and the fact that Dave's geek friends become heroes like \"Ass-\nKicker\" and \"Battle-Guy\" is cheap. It was overly violent (and not in a\nfun way like the first one), boring at some points, and a rip-off of\nitself. The first one was much better. Though I would recommend it to\nfans of the first, if anything to finish the saga, Kick-Ass 2 was\noverall a disappointment.\n"
"\nI loved Kick-Ass. It was fresh, original and funny as heck. I didn't\nhave high hopes for the sequel but I thought at the very least I'd\nenjoy it. But to me, Kick-Ass 2 just felt like it didn't know where to\ngo.<br><br>The film felt more like the trials and tribulations of two high school\nkids with superhero stuff added as an afterthought. There was no real\ncharacter development of the newbie heroes, so I couldn't have cared\nless if they lived or died. The middle part of the film detailing Hit\nGirl's attempts at being a normal teenager just felt weird, as if it\nwas trying to capitalise on the whole \"fish out of water teenager girl\"\nstory.<br><br>The fight scenes were okay and there was some humour during the film.\nBut there was definitely something missing that didn't feel as though\nit was a direct sequel in the series.<br><br>And the ending left me unsatisfied. Overall I almost wish I hadn't\nstarted watching this and not tainted my enjoyment and memories of the\noriginal Kick-Ass.\n"
"\nWhat a complete and utter mess of a film. It's all over the place and\nis over saturated with characters and plot lines. Why they didn't cut\nlike 3 or 4 of these plot lines and like 10 characters I don't know.\nHad they done that, they could have focused on the action and the\nrelationship between Kick-Ass and Hit-Girl. That is all I wanted from\nthis movie. But no. They had to waste my time with Hit-Girl having a\ndilemma about being Hit-Girl, Hit-Girl being a normal, stereotypical\nteenage girl, Kick-Ass dicking around with some random superhero group,\nand so much other crap like that. None of it was necessary.\nUnfortunately, they left in all of it and we are left with this\ncluttered, unfocused crap. Such a disappointing movie. Definitely\navoid.\n"
"\nGood movie living up to all it's gore and violence expectations,the\nmovie was good for trying its own adaptation since it did not end the\nsame as the comic book in the first adaptation.<br><br>The movie delivered in its own story line as it tried to follow the\ncomic book while ensuring that certain content were edited or omitted\nto allow an M18 rating.<br><br>While the movie is not an exactly family friendly movie, it is a\ndefinitely must-see for all comic book fans and those who wish to see\nwhat happens to Kick Ass, Hit Girl and Red Mist after the events of the\nfirst movie.<br><br>Stay to the end for a lead up to the next movie!\n"
"\nKICK-ASS 2 (2013) ** Aaron Taylor-Johnson, Chloe Grace Moretz, Jim\nCarrey, Christopher Mintz-Plasse, Morris Chestnut, John Leguizamo,\nDonald Faison, Robert Emms, Lindy Booth, Clark Duke, Augustus Prew,\nGarrett M. Brown, Lyndsy Fonseca, Yancy Butler. Disappointing sequel to\nthe comic book adaptation following the aftermath of the titular hero's\nactions with dire consequences when his rival's villainous desires for\npayback comes with a dour price to pay for his good intentions. While\nmost of the original's cast is back (particularly the two leads) the\nfilm is relatively less fun and more hellbent on depicting violence for\nviolence's sake (yes we get it that real life violence is painful; move\non) with the one-note screenplay by the director Jeff Wadlow. It also\ndidn't help having Carrey crap all over the film prior to its release\nfor feeling the 'message' was overwrought in the wake of current\nreal-life violent events involving teenager (but I'm sure the check\ncleared right, Jim?) So much for a new franchise with something to say.\n"
"\nYes, OK, yes, it has some questionable moments. 16 year old girls do\nperform over- sexualised dance routines that a Vegas stripper would\nblush at. Hooooowever, they're 16, it's legal, deal with it bro. <br><br>Aside from the girls in this film doing what can now commonly be known\nas 'A Miley Cyrus' it is genuinely a great improvement on an already\ngreat original. <br><br>The film is fun, funny and... more fun! It even throws in a few dark\nmoments that really help progress the plot and give The Motherf*cker\nsome credibility as a super-villain. <br><br>My only regret is that Jim Carey has such limited screen time. He\nreally does just own every scene he is in and provides some of the\nfilm's funniest moments. <br><br>Should you watch this film? Yes, yes you should you handsome son of a\ngun. It's entertainment on steroids and consistently delivers all the\ngood things the original gave you but on a much larger scale.\n"
"\nPeople say this was not as good as the first but I disagree I think\nthis was great. Slightly different take on the whole super hero thing\nyet still fundamentally the same.<br><br>In some ways I thought it was better.<br><br>Powerful message in-between the lines of action... \"Revenge never ends\nuntil someone dies, sacrifice is the most valued action any person can\ndo in their lifetime.\" We all have to live our lives like a \"Real\nHero!\" Yes its a black comedy but its not hard to imagine it being an\naccurate simulation of the whole superhero idea/concept.<br><br>I just hope they take it too a new level, like bourne crossed with\navengers with a sprinkle of lock stock all mixed into the next version.<br><br>Where Dave/mindy and co become adults and have secretly carried on\nfighting evil, taking it to a global stage until they meet their next\nbig nemesis.\n"
"\nAs most of you know, the first one was fantastic. This sequel went a\nlittle in another direction. Not to say that this is a bad thing. I say\nthis because after the first half hour of the movie, practically all\ncomedy is gone and it becomes a pretty serious and violent film.<br><br>This may be a downside to some people, and others would see it as a big\nimprovement. In a sense, it kind of was for me. I was expecting to see\na movie that was consistently funny throughout the whole movie (like\nthe first one).<br><br>The only real downside to this movie is that the new characters didn't\nhave a lot of screen time. Jim Carrey's character was pretty bad ass\nand had tons of potential. It's disappointing that he was advertised as\none of the main characters and then he's killed off less than half way\nthrough the movie.<br><br>To sum it up, it's definitely worth watching, but don't expect to get\nthe same laughs out of this one like you did in the first one.\n"
"\nThis movie was awful I could of get my brain damaged for everything of\nthis movie I hated it and it's in my list of the worst movies of 2013 I\nwish this could of be number 1 of the worst list of 2013 but escape\nfrom planet earth saved this garbage butt because escape from planet\nearth was 1 and I hated so much I wanted to pause the movie every time\nI watched it it was stupid don't waste your time or money it's not\nworth it and it's a stupid movie.I dislike this movie because it was\neverything everything was trash the whole movie sucked no spoilers OK\nthis review is free but yeah not worth it I'm definitely giving this\nmovie 1 star for being a huge disappointment and I give this movie also\nan F I enjoyed the 1 movie but this movie was not worth it but yeah go\nwatch this is the end ( if they still have that on theathers , smurfs 2\n( I can't believe I'm saying this or star trek into darkness but this\none was a huge mess.\n"
"\nNot anywhere near as good as the first movie. The first Kick-Ass was\nsurprisingly good. From the trailers it looked like a low-brow,\njuvenile, comic-book teen movie. Turns out it was quite funny,\nreasonably well structured, solidly directed and well acted.<br><br>Kick-Ass 2, on the other hand, is exactly like I expected the first\nmovie to be, ie a low-brow, juvenile, comic-book teen movie. Quite\nsilly. <br><br>Has its moments though, so not a total waste. Still, while the first\none was in effect a good send-up of comic book action heroes, and quite\nclever in doing so, this one is not clever at all. Pretty much just\ngratuitous violence.<br><br>Hopefully there is no Kick-Ass 3...\n"
"\nKick-ass 2 is a great follow up to the original! This film is once\nagain action packed and is packed full of violent fighting, killing and\nother exciting things that they have managed to pump into the film!<br><br>The film is very graphical at points, personally I feel this only\nengages the audience into the film that bit more.<br><br>Throughout the film things happen that I didn't expect, which makes the\nfilm much better in my eyes!<br><br>Don't want to tell anyone anything too much as you wont appreciate the\nfilm as much! Defiantly watch this however!<br><br>AND STAY BEHIND FOR 5 MINS! AFTER THE CREDITS IS A 30SECOND CLIP WHICH\nMAY CHANGE THE WAY YOU SEE THE ENDING!<br><br>EXCITING HEH!\n"
"\nAfter reading mixed reviews, i got kind of skeptical before i saw Kick-\nass 2. I lowered my expectations significantly, i mean, a 28% on\nRottentomatoes? come on.<br><br>The movie was excellent for what it is, solid acting,especially from\nJim Carrey and Christopher-mintz plasse.<br><br>Good pacing, although i wouldn't have minded it being a little longer.<br><br>I do have a couple of gripes. Some action scenes had annoying shaky cam\nfor some reason and at times the movie starts to take itself too\nseriously, it's dangling back and forth over the line of too much.<br><br>The first one didn't take itself seriously at all, it was just\nfun,fantasy,some shocking awesome violence and profanity.<br><br>This one is like that,but like i said, the movie almost turns into a\ndrama at some points, dances around it at least, but after the drama\nscene it's like ''hey,let's kill some fuc**n bad guys''.<br><br>I really liked the movie,just enjoy it for what it is and don't expect\nit to be just quite like the first one and you'll be fine. I hope we\nget to see a third one.\n"
"\nI enjoyed the first Kick-Ass movie and I enjoyed Kick-Ass 2 just as\nmuch. I've read a lot of comic books but I don't expect movies to\nfollow them exactly so the movie was good on its own merits. What I\nhope from a movie is the characters act reasonably given who they are.\nKick-Ass is still a comic book fan so it makes sense he wants to join a\nsuper-hero team. In reality it is best to operate as an anonymous\nhit-man so police don't get too interested but then there would be no\nmovie. The Chris D'Amico character was hilarious. He also thinks in\ncomic book terms unlike his Uncle Ralph who is a real mobster. So he\ncomes up with ridiculous ideas like Dr. Evil. I also liked Night Bitch.\nObviously someone who is there for fan-service. Did you see her Night\nBitch Justice Forever recruitment video? I didn't recognize Lindy Booth\nwho was assistant Claudia in Relic Hunter.<br><br>If you like politically incorrect, foul-mouthed fun then go see\nKick-Ass 2.\n"
"\nUndoubtedly the original Kick-Ass had more ass kicking, but Kick-Ass 2\nfocuses on making its characters human. <br><br>Kick-Ass 2 achieved something its predecessor could not; it made me\ncare!<br><br>The film focuses on the repercussions of taking up the mantle of\n\"superhero\" and the harm that can come from peoples' actions. Just like\nthe original it subverts our expectations. It teases the idealistic and\nheroic choices made in comic books and films and conveys that there is\noften a very real (and painful) consequence to \"heroic\" actions.<br><br>The film spends time of building the human side to its characters. It\ndoes slow down the pace of the film and the build up of action is not\nas seamless or stylish as the original. However in my opinion, this\ndoes not hinder the movie, but gives it more heart.<br><br>I was drawn to the movie, because I love superhero fiction and I\nenjoyed Kick-Ass's humour and over-the-top action! <br><br>However, it's for certain I will be returning for the story and its\ncharacters in Kick-Ass 3. Thank you Kick-Ass 2, you got me hooked!\n"
"\nI liked it even better than the first movie. A starting hero and a\nlittle fighting girl was great, but the second part of story was a\nlittle better. I saw more of characters every day life and they weren't\nonly superheroes anymore. But I admit that I hoped to see some romance\nbetween Kick-Ass and Hit-Girl, because it seemed logical. But I never\nread the comic book before I saw the movie. Costumes were awesome.\nSoundtracks were great too. What I didn't like, was deaths of Dave's\nfather and of course Chris. In some way it felt wrong. Too bad that\nHit- Girl left town in the end, kind of sad. However, this ending gave\nthe impression that I can expect the third movie too, which I like a\nlot.\n"
"\nI liked this film because this is one of my favourite action films of\nall time in 2013 what I liked about this film is that most of the\nscenes are mostly action in all the scenes. I would recommend this film\ntoo everyone that is in too action films. the special effects in the\nfilm absolutely amazing you will love it if you watch this film but you\nwill have too watch the first Kick-Ass before you watch the 2nd film.\nthe script in the film is really funny in most of the films because\nthere is such stars just like Jim Carrey and there is also really good\nactors that are brilliant actors/actress like Aaron Taylor Johnson and\nChloe Grace Moretz. The genre for the film is action comedy and crime.\nAt the start of the film the girl goes to school but doesn't stay she\njust goes too a training centre. At the end of the film there is a\nmassive fighting scene. This scene was very exciting.\n"
"\nOkay, Frankly I don't like comedy film I watch kick ass because of it's\ngory genre. I thought that I will not laugh instead I will be mad at\nthe comedy scene, but I was wrong I was laugh so loud in my room\nbecause of the street language or slang words that they used in the\nmovie. The movie is unique because of it's genre and it's action scene.\nI remember some gore scene in kill bill. I like the villains in the\nmovie. but The head villain is so lame. Hahaha. I rate this movie 7.1\nbecause of the cinematography, the effort and the Effects. I like the\nbloody squirting effects and some rants that they use in the movie,\nhence this movie is for mature only. I think if some minor watches this\nmovie they will imitate it so please don't watch it minors\n"
"\nThis is one of those times I have to say Screw The Critics! Kick-Ass 2\nmay not be as good as the first, but it is still pretty damn good for a\nsequel! Lots of laugh-out-loud moments along with plenty of good fight\nscenes as well. Chloe Grace Mortez, Christopher Mintz-Plasse, and Jim\nCarrey all nail their roles and steal just about every scene they are\nin. Although, I did think Carrey was underused and would've liked to\nsee more of him. The film does become a bit too cartoonish and a bit\ninconsistent, but I was having so much fun watching it didn't take that\nmuch enjoyment out of it. If you are a fan of the first than I can\nalmost guarantee that you will enjoy this one as well! By far some of\nthe most fun I've had at the movies this year and better than any other\ncomic-book or superhero movie to be released this year as well.\n"
"\nI was dancing in excitement through much of this film, throwing punches\nin my living room with Kick Ass and Hit Girl. I do not understand all\nthe hatred toward this flick...it was entertaining as frak. Granted, it\ndid not have much of the originality of the first Kick Ass but, for\nshats sake it is a sequel and by definition it won't be original. If i\nwere to judge movies only on quality, originality and good acting then\ni would have hated Star Wars episode IV, V, VI, I, II and III (as the\noriginals were based on Akira Kurosawa's The Hidden Fortress) but i\nenjoy them all (episode V is the best BTW). Unless you are a film\nschool student with a stick up their asX, this movie is more than worth\nthe 90 minutes it takes to watch and i doubt anybody with any clue what\nthis film is about who watches it will be disappointed. Final\nAnswer...this flick was PHENOMENAL.\n"
"\nI'm a sucker for super hero movies in which the super heroes are real\npeople who do not supernatural abilities. That's why I liked the movies\nSuper and Kick-Ass, and this sequel to Kick- Ass did not disappoint.\nIt's very real. Okay, kids would not be able to take kicks and punches\nlike that, but aside from that, it's pretty realistic, or at least\nrealistic enough for me to suspend disbelief long enough to enjoy the\nmovie. I love the crass humor and vulgar language. Come on! Don't be a\nprude! This is how these characters would talk! Like Kick-Ass, Kick-Ass\n2 is a great story. Then, on top of the great story, there is great\naction, decent acting, lots of funny lines, and even a little bit of\ndrama. I hope they do a Kick-Ass 3! That said, this movie is not for\nkids. There's too much vulgar language and sexual references.\n"
"\nThis is my first time posting review here because I cannot stand seeing\npeople criticizing this is a bad movie because it is not \"as good as\nthe first movie\", and totally not giving credit to the brilliant in the\nacting and the message the movie is trying to give. I think everyone's\nacting is superb and the characters gone through stages of development,\nespecially Hit Girl and MotherFker carry the entire movie!! The theme\nof this movie is growing up and living with the consequence and the\nreality, and the writing portrayed it well. The movie is in a darker\ntone (some of the main characters being tortured, killed etc.), and may\nbe that's why people are finding a hard time enjoying it. My only\ncomplains is Jim Carrey is under developed and such a waste of a good\nrole. Also, some plot doesn't really make sense to me (e.g. KA father's\nincident in the holding cell, and the police not taking responsibility\nafterward), but i still enjoy it.<br><br>Please watch this movie with an open mind and give it a chance.\n"
"\nnot quite as good as the first but still one of my favorite movies this\nsummer. the increased blood and gore were a plus and the movie takes on\na more serious tone than the first one. the change in directors kinda\nmade this one an OK film but the potential was there to be great.jim\ncarry was really good in this, you have a hard time telling it's him\nbecause of the serious tone, no quirky voices. the character\ndevelopment was good considering the time, had i had a chance to do the\nmovie i would of of made it an hour longer just so some of the scenes\ndidn't feel rushed. if you enjoyed the first one this movie is worth\nwatching. all in all not to shabby of a movie. 8/10 for me.\n"
"\nThis film was a lot of fun, It was not as good as the original but\ndon't let that stop you from seeing it. There was less storyline and\nmore action which some might like and others will dislike. This showed\nHit girl in a different light old enough now to make her own decisions\nand struggling to deal with the decisions she has made. The mother\nf*cker was so over the top it worked which most over the top villain's\ndon't (example Mr freeze from Batman and Robin and anyone from Mystery\nmen) The Russian I feel stole the show in her limited screen time. She\ndidn't say much but her actions spoke louder than words.<br><br>This is a movie worth seeing if you enjoyed the first one but in saying\nthat there are people out there that disliked the first and enjoyed the\nsecond. If you like a good action film you will enjoy this as the\naction scenes in this film where really well done. If you have a spare\n$20 and 2 hours to kill you won't be disappointed.\n"
"\nKick-Ass 2 is an action comedy film directed by Jeff Wadlow. Following\nfrom the first movie Kick-Ass this movie is about Kick-Ass facing more\nchallenges and Mindy trying to live a normal life from being Hit-Girl.<br><br>Starting from the beginning the movie continuously keeps us entertained\nwith action, a bit of comedy. The director exactly knows to keep the\nviewer interested other than making the viewer bored. <br><br>However, the movie lost some stuff from the original movie were\nsomewhat less such as the ironic comedy.<br><br>Still I'd recommend it to any one who watched the original to watch\nthis movie.<br><br>Thank You\n"
"\nI am not going to go into detail about the plot and what not, so I will\njust get to the point. The first kick ass movie is one of my all time\nfavorite films and I have to say kick ass 2 is even bigger &amp; better\nthan the first one. Kick ass 2 has double the action, great funny bits\nthrough out, and the ensemble cast is amazing. The mother****** and Jim\nCarry really steal the show, but then again all the actors were great.\nIt seems like this movie should be getting better reviews, because\neveryone I have talked to loved it and said they think it is as good,\nor better than the original. So don't listen to what most critics are\nsaying go see the flick for yourself and you might be pleasantly\nsurprised.\n"
"\nForget Nolan's Batman or Snyder's superman. Mark Miller's Kick-Ass is\nthe most accurate depiction of Superheroes I've ever seen. It shows you\nthe good and bad side of trying to do what is right. After seeing\nKick-Ass 2 it made me want to become a superhero, but i didn't due the\nfear of death. Everyone can relate to Kick-Ass, while hardly anyone can\nrelate to Spider- man, Batman, Iron man, and no one can relate to\nSuperman. So far I have only read Kick ass 2's comic book counter part\nand it was equally as good as the film. Kick-Ass is the next great\nHero, because we all know straight out of Joss Whedons Agents of\nS.H.E.L.D commercial. \"You don't need powers to be super.\"\n"
"\nI loved the first movie and really liked this one. I'm rating it an 8\njust because I feel like it could have been a better movie if the\ncharacters were as serious as the story line. The movie had a lot of\ngood laughs and I really enjoyed some of the humor in it, but the\nactual story and reason behind why everything happens in the movie is\nso much more serious compared to the jokes that the directors tried\nfitting into the movie. I mean, I get it, the movie's supposed to be a\nfunny view to the life and struggles of ordinary people who want to be\nheroes. But if they really tried hard, this movie could of been almost\nas big as x-men or even the Dark Knight. Great action for what I was\nexpecting though, and I really liked the blood involved with the\nhumored violence. i kinda felt like I was watching a Terantino film.\nMust watch for sure, especially if you liked the first movie.\n"
"\nIt's funny how the critics don't like good movies. Kick-Ass 2 has a\nmeta critic score of 41?? And metacritic.com score of 35?? It should be\nsomewhere up in the 90's, crazy critics!!<br><br>Critics tend to give the Oscar to a movie ya only want to watch once,\nrather than to a movie your gonna watch several times. Seriously, how\nmany times did you watch \"The Kings Speech\"? Once? <br><br>Well, I'm sure you will watch Kick-Ass and Kick-Ass 2 several times,\nthey are that good. They are funny, action packed, and twisted all in\none. <br><br>If you haven't seen either, do yourself a favor and check them out. You\nwon't be disappointed. If ya want to be, rent the last few years Oscar\nwinners for best picture. Not only will you be disappointed, but also\nconfused. <br><br>Enjoy fellow movie lovers!!\n"
"\nFirst of all, I have to say I had a blast watching the first Kick-Ass\nfilm and thought it was great overall. Unfortunately, in my opinion the\nsequel fails at every single aspect that made the first one so\nenjoyable. While Kick-Ass 2 had a few funny bits, there were too many\npainfully unfunny and completely ridiculous moments that made me want\nto walk out of the theater at times. There were also some very annoying\ncharacters like Mother Russia and other disposable ones who were given\nway too much screen time. In addition, Christopher Mintz-Plasse's\ncharacter was pretty lame this time for me and also annoying. Now the\naction sequences weren't really as intense and interesting as in the\nfirst film and some of them had bad CGI. I hate to say this, but\nKick-Ass was a major disappointment and not even remotely good.\n"
"\nkick-ass -really cool, awesome <br><br>in the movie, the frequency stick is god damn funny. the end of the\nfight part is a bit dramatic....<br><br>i don't like the ending on the Jim Carrey superhero storyline, but it\nprobably is a superhero story in the real life.<br><br>even hit-gal is to do good on help the world to kill all the bad ass,\nshe still need to escape from the police arrest. it is real world\nreality....<br><br>law seems mainly for protect the rich and the ass hole. we really need\nmany kick ass in the real world.\n"
"\nWhat a ride! The original crew is back and now the infamous 'Hit Girl'\nis learning new things, not about fighting crime, but about life in\ngeneral (the teenager type stuff that all highschoolers learn about)\nwhile Kick Ass is trying to become a better super Hero, it was a nice\ncontrast that plays well throughout the film.<br><br>\"You only have one life to live, so live it\" forcing everyone to \"take\nrisks\" when trying to figure out who you really are.<br><br>Aside from it's violence and hilarity, the performances of the main\ncast were excellent, as were all of the secondary character's roles.\nThe writing was fantastic. Just when you think you get a moment's rest,\nyou're sucked right back into the story faced with a new dilemma\nwhether on the streets or through their relationships.<br><br>I loved the first installment of Kick Ass, and Kick Ass 2 is one of the\nrare films that surpasses it's predecessor. More violent and more\nfunny, even. Well crafted in every way. PLEASE treat yourself to this.\n"
"\nFirst off i'd say this isn't as good as the original but it's still a\nfine effort. It's basically more of the same humour and violence. If\nyou didn't like Kick Ass you probably won't like this either. <br><br>The three leads are back Aaron Taylor-Johnson (kick ass) Chloe Grace\nMoretz (hit girl) and Christopher Mintz-Plasse (red mist\n/motherfucker). They are joined by a new band of heroes who to be fair\ndon't add a lot to the plot. I was disappointed with Jim Carrey's\ncharacter and the rest are nothing special. This is more than made up\nfor by the three leads who all put in great performances and there is\ngood support from Morris Chestnut as hit girls adopted dad and Garret M\nBrown as kick ass's dad. <br><br>Some of the toilet humour does not work for me but the laughs come\nthick and fast and a lot do hit the mark. The sporadic violence and\nfight scenes are handled well and the plot isn't afraid to veer from\nwhat you are expecting. The ending was a bit weak for me but this is\nstill a film I really enjoyed and will doubtless watch many more times\nin the future.\n"
"\nFollowing up to the successful hit \"Kick-Ass\" we get another Kick-Ass\nmovie that is even more bloodier,hard-hitting, with lots of kick-ass\nmoments. Hit-girl is back better than ever, Kick-Ass is back, and\nintroducing our brand new super hero Jim Carrey who's hands down quite\nthe badass just stealing the show! Bravo Jim Carrey simply a\nmasterpiece that surprising to see Jim Carrey bash some skulls. <br><br>Now folks don't believe the critics. They simply can't take a hit or\ntoo. This movie is fun especially for the fight scenes it throws. If\nyou like the first \"Kick-Ass\" movie then you're probably gonna like\nthis one. Even though it kinda has a different tone to it, it still\nmanages to keep a balance of entertainment.\n"
"\nWas a huge fan of the first movie, this one is just as awesome. The\nactors' performances are terrific as well as the writing. Wasn't sure\nif Jim Carey was right for this but he's really good in this role. Also\nChristopher Plasse is really talented, way beyond McLovin. Overall\nexcellent story, great mix of comedy and strikingly serious evil. Once\nagain, Hit Girl is our hero and you really cheer for her. If you\nenjoyed the clever writing, direction and performances of the first\none, you'll like this one as well. Oh, and I loved the blood an\nviolence because it's movie violence, not real violence. Pull your\ntampon out, Jim.\n"
"\nKick-Ass 2 is considerably darker than the original, yet it still\nretains its humour. A solid cast is let down by some superhero tropes\nand the absence of Nic Cage is really felt. Some of the plot has really\nbeen done to death by other superhero films, it's no longer shocking\nwhen a loved hero hangs up their cape and retires, nor is it much\nsurprise when a previously good hero turns to the dark side, seeking\nrevenge. There is a lot of violence and absurdity in equal measure. My\nbiggest complaint is that Jim Carrey should have had more screen time.\nFans of the comic will be a bit puzzled at some of the choices made in\nthe script, but not a bad adaptation. Enjoyable, but won't win Oscars.\n8/10.\n"
"\nKick ass 2 is offering a much better story, a much better kick-ass\naction, a much better comedy, i could said this is the perfect sequel\nfor kick ass.<br><br>I've been closely watched this anticipating movie. Not only i could see\nChloe grace Moretz as a teenager which is one of the main reason i\nwatch this movie. But also the appearance of Jim Carrey that we already\nknow as one of the greatest comedian of all time.<br><br>I really enjoy this movie. How the story was perfectly put. This movie\ncan bring you in an intense feeling after a great laugh of comedy. And\nalso a bigger scale of reality-superhero fighting. The name of the\ncharacter, the costume, it was way beyond than the first movie. A\nperfect sequel.\n"
"\nHave to say that I'm not a fan of comic books and have never seen the\nKick Ass comics, but, seeing raving reviews here was pretty confident\nthe movie would be OK. Well, huge mistake. First thing that catches\nyour eye is the head actresses pout. It is everywhere, all over the\nplace, she's always having that fake innocent look in her eyes and the\npout. I'm unsure if it is her natural mimics or she's thinking it is a\ngenius idea for the role. The rest of the actors are OK but Chloe\nMoretz made it feel like the whole cast was horrible. I liked Jim\nCarrey, his acting was solid, and the \"bad guys\" were fine to watch\ntoo. The plot is your usual superhero thing, nothing special, it always\nis pretty bad, except the Batman movies. Dialogues in Kick Ass 2 made\nme feel embarrassed for just being there, inspirational wannabe\nconversations among kids are just a joke. It was better when the \"bad\"\nguys spoke though. 2 stars for the bad guys and Jim Carrey.\n"
"\nIn 2010, 'Kick-Ass' had succeeded to surprise fan boys and critics by\nit's theme which is close to reality and teenage's behavior. The movie\nis so fun and hilarious. Also it makes it's star (Chloe-Moretz and\nMatthew Vaughn) popular these days. No wonder, the studio is\nenthusiastic to create sequel for this franchise. Unfortunately,\n'Kick-Ass 2' suffers from many plot holes and inconsistent storyline.\nThere are some stupid scenes in this movie like, the process of Chris\nD'Amico turns into The Motherf*cker and some scenes involved Todd/Ass\nKicker. Jeff Wadlow as director tries to make almost the same formula\nfrom it's predecessor but he just fails to adapt and deepen the\nemotional of character which could be the influential aspect from the\nfirst movie. The only positive point from 'Kick-Ass 2', is the\nexistence of Jim Carrey who is enjoyable to see and some bloody violent\naction scene although it's still nothing compared with 'Kick-Ass'.\nOverall 'Kick-Ass 2' is an unnecessary sequel to be made. The movie\njust ruin the image that Matthew Vaughn has built years ago.\n"
"\nthey have done it again . made me laugh my nose off , make me want to\nkick-ass to! <br><br>attansion : this is my first review i might be kinda bad explaining\nsome things<br><br>the new kick-ass movie adds more comedy. romance. i thought this movie\nwould not make it so i had low expectasions on this sequel but i\npromise you its just as good as the first one not better or worse <br><br>just the same awesomeness <br><br>i love the acting and storyline . and of course the fightscenes and the\nvillain mother Russia is to устрашающий ( Awesome! ) <br><br>probably the best movie of the summer.<br><br>thank you for reading...... - Dagur\n"
"\nI don't know why I love it so much. Most of my friends are not fans of\nKick-Ass, but I am a huge one! You know how sequels are bad and never\nas good as the first one? This is not the case. I enjoyed it as much as\nI enjoyed the first movie. I might of liked it even more. It's a\ndifferent type of film. Not about super- powered superheroes. Not about\nhow cool a person is. It's about real people wanting to actually do\nsomething good, but their humanity is standing on the way. The other\nplus - it's brutal. People die, it's not a Disney movie. People you\ncare will die, your friends. Relationships will be ruined, blood will\nbe spilled. <br><br>Go and watch this film. Just be prepared for something different.\n"
"\nUnderstandably, as a fan of the first Kick Ass film, Kick Ass 2 was\nright up my alley, but I was completely blind-sided by the fact that it\nwent above and beyond it predecessor.<br><br>To be fair, in Kick Ass 2, the plot did leave something to be desired\nfor, certainly not the most original or creative, but what do you\nreally expect from it? What really set the movie on fire was the depth\nthat was added to the characters, especially Hit Girl. In the first\nfilm her character was fairly flat, almost completely if it weren't for\nher relationship with her father. In the sequel however, her human side\nreally is explored, although it's through over used clichés and\nstereotypes, we get to see that despite the costume and lost childhood,\nHit Girl truly is that, a teenage GIRL.<br><br>Anyways, I strongly suggest this movie to anyone, especially those who\nwere fans of the first. I can say that it was the most fun I have had\nin a movie theatre for a long time.\n"
"\nHour and forty minutes of great entertainment. <br><br>Stylish, witty and strong performances from all the leading roles\n(especially Chris D'Amico)<br><br>So why is this 7* (good) for me against the 10* (amazing) of the\noriginal Kick Ass.<br><br>Well Kick Ass had an utterly stunning musical backdrop which was a\nfeature of the film making every major scene an 'event' In comparison\nthe sequel is pretty feeble. (Obviously saved a few bob on the 3\nmusical directors they used on Kick Ass)<br><br>Secondly and maybe due to the weaker soundtrack there is just so much\nless to remember. Kick Ass had half a dozen scenes which just blew you\naway. Only a couple in the sequel (and that's at a push!)<br><br>That said films as amazing and unique as the original only come along\nevery couple of years. This sequel was fun and well worth a trip to the\ncinema. The violence is just what you'd surely expect and only a couple\nof minor scenes that fall flat. <br><br>NB As usual ignore paid critics reviews (Surely these guys should be\nput out to graze?)\n"
"\nThis is my first ever movie review review and I do not plan on going\ninto a lot of detail as I want people to go see the movie and judge for\nthemselves, The following is my opinion. <br><br>As a fan of the first film and a collector of the comic book series I\nwas incredibly happy with this movie. I was extremely excited as I took\nmy seat in the movie theater and I was not in the slightest bit\ndisappointed when the film concluded. The acting was brilliant, the\nscript was funny and had emotion. When you sit down to watch ether\nKick-Ass one or two you know you are watching a special movie that was\nmade out of love for the comics/story rather than a studio looking for\nanother quick cash in. Kick-Ass two is a comedy with a lot of heart and\nin my opinion it was my favorite movie of the year. Thanks for reading.\n"
"\nCompelled to rate and review Kick-ass 2 seeing as how some viewers out\nthere are down-voting this great film for stupid reasons, most common\nof which is \"it was not like the original one\"<br><br>It's a good thing it's not like the original Kick-ass, we get to see\nthe further development of these beloved characters as they experiment\nwith possibilities in this alternate universe that was introduced by\nKA1, and that's a good thing.<br><br>Action was superb, story around Hit Girl was great, the Justice Forever\nleague thing was great, it's a must see this summer.<br><br>Now go watch it!\n"
"\nHow does an action-packed movie get any better? It can't. If you loved\nthe first, you will love the second. I don't want to give any part of\nthe story away. Of course there were some flaws in the story that I\nwish weren't there, BUT they were so small that I did not care. ACTION,\nCOMEDY, ROMANCE, EXCITEMENT, ORIGINALITY. I highly recommend seeing\nthis movie. \"Hit Girl\" owns this thing. <br><br>Dislikes: Jim Carey's character is great, just wish he played a bigger\nroll in the story, as I'm sure everyone else did. Kick-Ass plays a\nnerdy, unsure of himself high school kid, AGAIN. I personally would\nhave liked to see him with a little more confidence considering what he\nwent through on the last film.<br><br>And for all you haters out there on this film, please shut up. No one\ncares about you. You guys don't like anything and your lives probably\nsuck.\n"
"\nThe first Kick-Ass movie is better, yes, but the 2 is still a great\nsequel, probably the comments of Jim Carrey (out of context, by the\nway) created an avalanche of top critics about violence without sense,\nbut wait, the first one is not a deep and thorough message of violence.<br><br>The movie is just about astonishment due to dismemberment, fun due to\nirony and emotion due to stylish fights. So don't pretend you are\nscared because of his violence or feigned about bloodshed must be\njustified, this is not an art movie, specialty film, or experimental\nfilm.<br><br>Super heroes that can not exist in real life, that's the greatness of\nKick-Ass, trying to bring closer the fanciful idea about anyone can be\na Batman, a Black Widow and even a Superman.\n"
"\nas a big fan of the previous movie,,went into dis movie wid total\nexcitement only to see a total crap of a movie.wonder how they could\nmess up the sequel so badly,the whole style and tone of the first movie\nhas just disappeared,,how could Vaughn let the new director go ahead\nwid such crap,,and the worst part was the climax where all the\nsuperheroes and villains just converge for a free for all,,ughh!!it was\nlike watching a teen high school movie with a lot of cuss-words and\nbloodletting,,just hope dat part 3 if n whenever its released gets back\nto the winning ways dat dis kick ass franchise truly deserves.the last\nmovie was the jizz,,but dis sequel is just pure crap,,period!!\n"
"\nBrilliant. I didn't stop laughing or wincing the whole way through! <br><br>Kick Ass 2 is a hilarious, bloody piece of cinema that is great from\nstart to end. It made me feel, it made me laugh and it made me turn\naway from the level of gratuitous violence shown, which was well used.\nI was worried that the new characters would take away the special\nfeeling present in the first film - don't' worry, the new characters\nare brilliant. I loved Dr Gravity (Donald Faison) and, of course,\nColonel Stars and Stripes (Jim Carrey). Both were brilliant and played\ntheir respective roles perfectly.<br><br>Definitely worth a watch, especially if you in any way liked the first\none.\n"
"\nOffers nothing interesting, clever, exciting, or (sigh) funny. In fact\nthis is probably the least funny superhero film I have seen in years,\nwhich was beyond surprising and insanely depressing. To be honest this\nmovie doesn't just lack a sense of humor, but also a pulse. I can\nhonestly think of nothing positive to say except for maybe that Jim\nCarrey had the good sense, or good fortune (take your pick) to enter\nlate and exit early in what appears to be the most thankless role of\nhis career. It wasn't that he didn't try, but that he was literally\ngiven nothing to work with. You can't poor your heart and sole into a\none dimensional cameo role. Sorry Jim, you just can't. My advice to the\nsobs responsible behind this franchise is either bring back Matthew\nVaughn to make a Hit Girl spin-off, or just let this one die and get on\nwith your lives. Just chalk it up as an acceptable loss and just walk\naway before anymore damage can be done. After all, one black eye is\nstill better than two.\n"
"\nGoing into #KickAss2 I went in w/ expectations &amp; hoped we'd get the\nelements from the original Kick-Ass that we all know &amp; love, &amp; Kick-Ass\n2 delivers! Action, Funny, Dark &amp; the most fun I've had in the theaters\nthis summer. Something I really liked is how this once gave more\nreference to the comic which the original did but not as much. Kick-Ass\n2 is a sequel that does justice to the original. Even though it isn't\nIn the same level as the original, doesn't take away how much I enjoyed\nit &amp; delivered. If you loved the first you'll love this one. Don't\nlisten to the critics or Rotten Tomatoes for that matter. Check it out!\n9/10. #TakeMyMoney<br><br>PS STAY AFTER THE CREDITS!!!\n"
"\nFor many people the first one was a bit out of the box,many thought the\nyoung star was exploited too much, well folks it is a sequel so it is\nworse. In the first movie there was and air of innocence about the main\ncharacters well this is thrown out the door in the first scene. The\nmovie is full of violence, full of foul language and choc block of\ndisturbing scenes everything that was said about the first one is\ndoubled here it holds nothing back. The story is a revenge story but\nthe revenge is twisted and really disturbing. The scenes involving\nHit-Girl this time around are not for the faint hearted and the scenes\ninvolving The M*****F***** are disturbing but hilarious. This movie is\nso much fun. If you liked the first one well everything in this one is\ndoubled as it is a sequel, but a special mention to Chloë Grace Moretz\nwho in my opinion is a fantastic actresses every movie I have seen her\nin she has stole the show. Fun and Violence. 7/10\n"
"\nI was a big fan of first \"Kick Ass\", largely as a result of \"Hit Girl\"\n(Chloe Moretz), the 11 year old who did those incredible action\nsequences. The incongruity of a little girl doing such outrageous\nstunts was a great surprise. But now she's grown and it's not so funny\nanymore, and 24 year old Aaron Taylor-Johnson who plays \"Kick Ass\"\nlooks more like a pedophile rather than a high schooler, so the whole\ntenure of the film changes. The villain, Chris Mintz-Plasse, isn't much\nof a villain either, so the whole story is hardly worth viewing.<br><br>There are some amusing bits, and Jim Carrey is always a treat, but fans\nof the original are going to be disappointed.\n"
"\nYesterday I went to see it and I was surprised how empty the cinema\nwas, especially after watching it I was amazed by it.<br><br>The first movie is a typical \"introduction\" movie, you learn everything\nabout the characters, what they do, why they do it and so on. You may\neven say it's a bit tedious. In the sequel however, you don't have that\nanymore and they sure wasted all that time very well. It was way better\nthan the first movie on so many levels, it was funnier, more extreme\nand sadder as well.<br><br>And for those who are planning to go, there is a part after the end\ncredits and it is worth the waiting. After all, it's a Marvel movie.<br><br>To me this was the best movie I've seen this year.\n"
"\nYes critics did get it right.. It's that terrible. The first kick-ass\nwas at least novel and had some storyline and was fun. This sequel was\njust so boring, so predictable and was just a money sucking excuse to\nmake another. Despite the fact it has an R-rating, you get the feel it\nhad an intelligence level that was made just for young kids who ,thanks\nto their video games, do enjoy their violence. Frankly I didn't see any\nof them as worthy of being considered a super-hero or super super-\nvillain, just immature wannabes with a real lousy script. I'm hoping it\nends here, but if it brings in enough money, I'm sure they won't let it\nrest. as long as it makes a buck the Hollywood producer/whores would\nkeep making it until it's star becomes Hit-granny, not girl... :P\n"
"\nI really enjoyed the first Kick-Ass and I thought this sequel was even\nbetter. In this one Kick-Ass has already been well established as a\nsuperhero and he returns to the scene and teams up with other like\nminded people. The other characters who were inspired to become\nvigilantes were all interesting and some very comical. Hit-Girl was\nalso great in this film as she was in the first and it was interesting\nto see more depth to her character.<br><br>This film had a great combination of comedy and action throughout.\nThere were a lot of funny moments and yet there was also a lot of\nserious action and some of it was quite gory. <br><br>Some people might be put off thinking that this would be geeky because\nof the comic book theme but anyone who enjoys actions films should give\nthis a try. Also there is quite a lot of violence in this which might\nnot be expected because it's a comedy but there is also a serious\nelement in it.\n"
"\nMost of you who have enjoyed the first kick-ass, Kick ass 2 is so much\nbetter! more action, super funny and of course hit girl so grown up\nnow! (She's so cute!) I just wished the love interest with hit girl and\nkick-ass would have gone more( just hoping) but aside from that even\nthere were so many characters in the movie they've been great, from\nsmall roles to big roles. Has a great plot and story line. It seems the\nmovie was well executed. I also love the fighting scenes especially\nwhen hit girl saves kick-ass from the bad guys. It also has a soft side\nwhere in kick-ass got mad to his pops and when he was going to be\narrested his dad took his place. I hope there's a kick-ass 3! please!!!\n"
"\nWhen life gets boring for former crime-fighter Kick-Ass\n(Taylor-Johnson), his ex-companion Hit-Girl (Moretz) trains him on how\nto be a proper hero; while D'Amico (Mintz-Plasse) adopts a new\nvillainous title. Although this installment received more negative\nreviews than its predecessor, it's not any worse in quality it's just\nnot as overrated. Gets moving real quickly, and never runs into a dull\nmoment. Fatal flaw: the audience is taken out of the story too often\nwith the characters' insistence and reminders that the plot is supposed\nto be grounded in reality. Jim Carrey is far less theatrical than you'd\nexpect, but he still brings his charm nonetheless.<br><br>** (out of four)\n"
"\nin my opinion this film is even better than the first one! it is very\nwell written, with smart dialogues, clever humor and very cool\nchoreography of the fights. the actors are great, in particular chloë\ngrace moretz, she's really a talented actress and she did an amazing\njob. i really enjoyed watching it, i was gonna vote 10 out of 10 but...\nlike in the first one, they have to shoot a bad final. i'm gonna spoil\nthe comics too. in the first one dave hook up with lyndsy fonseca while\nin the comics she humiliates him and has her friends beat him up. now\nthis cliché final with a kiss and a character that just have to\nleave... face palm, instead of the police that arrests everyone. by the\nway, the flirt between hit girl and kickass it is just...wrong! he\ndoesn't even try to stop the kiss! my sad opinion is that the\nproduction and distribution companies have forced the 2 finals, because\neven if is not perfectly accurate to the comics, as i said, the movies\nare great in everything beside the finals, that seems written by\nsomeone else.\n"
"\nStanding between \"Watchmen\" and Christopher Nolan's \"Dark Knight\"\ntrilogy, \"Kick Ass 2\" renders a pretty credible examination of the\npopularity of super heroes.<br><br>The character of Kick And and his cadre of average-guy super heroes are\nridiculous; As they should be. The problem, as depicted in both \"Kick\nAss\" films is, we sort of want them to be real. We want super-powered\nheroes who will protect us. In the middle of the silliness is Hit Girl,\nChloe Grace Moretz's willing-to-kill \"baby Batman\" who accurately\ncharacterizes the reality that makes the fantasy impossible. With\ngreater ambitions than it was capable of achieving, \"Kick Ass 2,\" while\nless fun than its predecessor, is a worthwhile finale to the storyline.\n"
"\nI enjoyed this film just as much as the first one, however it felt like\nit was trying to hard. It contained lots of one liners of which were\nfunny but it just seem too desperate. Also i felt the movie was to\nHollywood compared to the first one, i mean by this that its over the\ntop. I really liked that fact all the heroes were'not indestructible\nlike superman or didn't have the money to but gadgets like batman; some\nwould have to have days off just because of normal colds. most of them\nhad meanings for what they are doing, so just because of this it makes\nthe film seem more relate-able because of these problems ordinary\nfamilies have to face. I would recommend this film to anyone who loves\nthe first kick ass and anyone who enjoys comedy, action and crime. its\nfull of action and quirky costumes.\n"
"\nDid Kick-Ass really need a sequel? Apparently some studio people\nthought there was some more money to be made so here it is. KA2 is not\nas streamlined or focused as KA1. Besides real-life superheros it also\nhas a lot of other themes like being popular at high-school, obeying\nyour parents, falling in love etc...Sometimes it's really hard to see\nwhat this film is trying to be: you have scenes that might be intended\nas comedy but aren't funny (the music always seems overly dramatic),\nemotional scenes that are very cheesy (intentionally?) and gratuitous\nbloody violence à la Kill Bill. The film was made for a low 28m$ but\nthe VFX sometimes look fake and cheap, the physical fight scenes are\npretty good. I have to say that I have mixed feelings about this one:\non one hand I found it enjoyable to watch but on the other hand it does\nfeel like it could have been a lot better and it didn't need to be\nmade. The pubic seems to agree as it made only half the money of the\nfirst one so this is probably the end of the line. If you have seen and\nliked the first one, I would give it a go.\n"
"\nI really cannot see why this was really bad. I wanted to see this so\nbadly but nobody would recommend it. i went to see it anyway and was\nquite surprised. Sure, its much more vulgar than the previous one but\nthere are way more disgusting movies than this. The only thing this\nfilm lacks is a really engaging thrill that you get from the first one.\nI also disliked the fake blood effects that weren't up to Kick ass\nstandard and that Jim Carey didn't really get a bigger role for this\nmovie considering he was on the poster. The comedy is quite good and it\nhad some great lines in there but this movie is aiming for a more\nserious tone and it gets there during the second half of the movie. The\nStupidity of the names really got me. \"The MotherF***er\" \"Night B**ch\"\n\"Battle Guy\" \"The Tumor\" and finally my personal favourite \"The Toxic\nMegaC**ts\". Overall, This was an effective movie and i was engaged\nthroughout.\n"
"\nWas Jim Carrey right to condemn the excessive violence in this movie?\nYes he was. But I loved the first one so much I had to see the sequel.\nAnd I enjoyed it - mostly. Kick Ass 1 was full of unexpected shocking\nlaugh out loud humor with some \"funny\" violence that was part of the\nplot. Kick Ass 2 still has some of that naughty sense of fun plus the\ncharming leads Aaron Taylor Johnson and Chloe Moretz going through high\nschool stuff and vigilante fighting. Hit Girl is now older and\nexperiencing some teen growing pains still with the foul mouth. <br><br>Wish they had emphasized the comic parts more and limited the violence\nbecause in the second half it just got out of hand - almost Quentin\nstyle - too graphic. After all there are enough graphically violent\nmovies - the distinguishing thing about this franchise is it's humor\ndriven story. It just crosses to the wrong side of the line from\n\"funny\" violence to sickening violence. The way the Russian Mother\ndispatched the cops was too much. If they make another sequel I hope\nthey bear this in mind.\n"
"\nPlot-- Kick ass joins a group of amateur superheros( jokers actually)\nlead by Colonel Stars and Stripes ,where as Mindy trying to become a\nnormal college girl , but circumstances force them to become\nvigilantes, once again. Performances--- The lead cast tries to hard to\ndo justice with their roles but script doesn't offer much for them. The\nreal problem with this sequel is the script .The story has more\nviolence and gore than the prequel. In one scene a criminal got killed\n,in another the hero's dad got killed. For a second you think you're\nnot watching an action comedy but you're watching a revenge drama. Even\nvillain the Motherf*cker (Red Myst) has not much to do except only\nshrieking on his goons.The jokes have less humour, actually they are\nsenseless. Jim Carrey's character is meaningless and is overshadowed by\nkick-ass.The ending is inspired from The Dark Knight (2008) where Mindy\nis going on her bike so fast. Do not waste your money, in buying a DVD,\nfor this one .But, if you still want to watch it then watch this on\nStar Movies or on HBO.\n"
"\nI wasn't a big fan of the original 'Kick-Ass', an oppressively cynical\nand mean-spirited film that never the less sells out in its last\nfifteen minutes and follows the conventions and clichés of the genre to\nthe T. So needless to say, I wasn't exactly anxiously awaiting the\nsequel.<br><br>Flash forward two years, and with few other options, I decide to give\nthe sequel a shot. I'm reasonably glad that I did. Though I find it\nvastly inferior on a technical level (New director Jeff Wadlow is no\nMatthew Vaughn), I did find 'Kick-Ass 2' to be more generically\nentertaining.\n"
"\nKick-Ass, the infamous super hero joins a group of other masked heroes\nthis time, as Hit-girl tries to live a normal life, leaving her super\nhero days behind. The second movie was - no surprise- not as good as\nthe first. The humor was terrible; bad jokes, low quality scenes,\nracist lines. The action scenes were okay, could have been better\nthough. The final battle, too cliché, as was the whole plot. Especially\nthe teenage-high school drama, wasn't even fit for the movie. Things\ngot better when Hit girl came back and took action, but before that the\nwhole movie was one death after the other with no interest at all. The\nperformances were okay, Jim Carey was a nice surprise and Moretz was\ngreat as well. The costumes were good too. But other than that, Kick\nAss 2 didn't live up to the expectations. It just was too so-so for a\nsequel of Kick Ass. So 3 out of 10, could have been 2, if my friends\nhadn't insist on the Union J factor.\n"
"\nViolence and use of rough language brings up same elements as the first\nmovie. It can be really funny. Even repeating some of the first movie\nit separates nicely from other movies of they kind. Brutality and\ndarkness can shock viewer even if you have seen the first movie. This\nmovie has a unique way to play motions in comedy. There is also lot of\nscenes u can't be prepared for. How many times you stop to think what\njust happened? Ending is the only part that i did not like so much and\ni'we had this spider-man theme in my head too many times. Thats why i\ndon't give 10. From start to finish really entertaining and most off\nall super funny.\n"
"\nKick-Ass (2010) was a better film as it was more comedy. But Kick-Ass 2\nfor the first hour was comedy, but as the final 30 minuets drew in, it\nwas more of an action film... and in some parts, it felt a lot better.<br><br>The action was much better than the first film, more fast paced and\nall. But the comedy in the first film however was much better.<br><br>CGI in some parts was over used however, and that really made the film\nfeel lazy as if the director couldn't give a damn about making the film\nlook more real, however, some of the areas which CGI was used was\nunderstandable and even looked cool at times.<br><br>Another flaw, Hitgirl. She was not in it as much as I was hoping. But\nher scenes were pretty bad-ass, and you have to admit, she makes a\ngreat super hero.<br><br>Overall, this film is a great comedy/action film and really... I am\nlooking forward to the possible Kick-Ass 3. Let's just hope it comes,\nbecause I am pumped!! 8/10\n"
"\nThe original Kick-Ass movie is a classic. This sequel doesn't touch it,\nnot even close.<br><br>That said, this film has plenty of action and stuff to look at and\nlaugh at, but you need to consider why the first Kick-Ass was so\nsuccessful. It had original, tight, clever, atmospheric, artistic\nstoryline and details. Kick-Ass 2 lacks most of the shining qualities\nof the original.<br><br>It does the job of bringing us more super-hero madness, more Hitgirl,\nand more of the fun story of these characters. But things seem\nunpolished, unrefined... perhaps giving away the change in directors or\nperhaps just the writing.<br><br>There is something missing in the dialog that was present in the first.\n\"Interestingness\" and original flare is not here, but it's nevertheless\nan eye-candy sequel, with some crazy scenes, if often clichéd,\nstereotypical and overly juvenile.<br><br>I gave the original 9/10, but this sequel only gets 5/10.\n"
"\nAs most sequels go, they are only as half as good as the original or\nworse (Iron Man 2, etc etc). Kick-Ass 2 fortunately bucked the general\ntrend and whilst not as good as the original still was pretty decent.<br><br>Chloe Grace Moretz ability as an actor is growing rapidly, her\nperformance as a torn teenager between her ordinary and superhero lives\nwas the stand- out in my book.<br><br>The only thing that I wish they had done is changed who the villain\nwas, whilst Christopher Mintz-Plasse as Red Mist in the first movie\nworked I felt as though this time around they hammed up the cartoonist\nnature of the character and I didn't buy it.<br><br>Overall I liked it, with a few small tweaks it could have been a little\nbetter.\n"
"\nAlthough I did like the 1st Kick-Ass a little better then this one,\nthis was still a good movie. It was very enjoyable to see Chloe Grace a\nlittle more grown up &amp; mature. Once again, her scenes were very well\nchoreographed. Aaron Taylor-Johnson did a great job in his re-occurring\nrole as well. I liked the way the movie began. It was a fun movie to\nwatch and not half bad for a sequel. My only problem is that the plot\ngot a little corny at times but I guess that's what is to be expected\nin a super-hero type movie. Still, it held my attention for the most\npart. Bottom line, Kick-Ass 2, kicked azz again...But hopefully, it\nwill stop at this one. Lol.\n"
"\nno way as good as the first one.... I really wanted to like this more\nbut it seems like a pointless sequel to me,<br><br>Jim carry serves no purpose in this film and its easy to see why he\nwanted to distance himself from the release of this film now as he has\nmore of a cameo role and there's nothing really special about his\ncharacter, it seems to have lost the magic the first film had, its\nstill enjoyable enough but don't go expecting anything as good as the\nfirst one, this is just a straight continuation hit girl is still\nkicking ass and is probably the best thing about the film, the new\ncharacters are all forgettable really, I think this will probably the\nend for this franchise\n"
"\nI was a little disappointed. This film was no where near as great as\nthe first one but it was still good. I thought it was slow to start and\nas a result a little boring. Hit girl is awesome as usual and kick ass\nreprised his role well. Red mist/mother effer was OK and his gang of\nvillains were cool.<br><br>I was pleased to see that all the original cast members returned saved\nDave. The action sequences were good, but the action in the first part\nwas much better. I didn't realize how much Nick Cage added to the first\nfilm. His absence was def felt in the sequel. Over all it was an OK\nfilm but there is just no way it can compare to the original.\n"
"\nThe movie is different. It is funnier, bloodier, more crude, and\noverall more inappropriate. The one thing that makes me say this is not\nlike the first is its failure to bring anything new to the story. It's\na classic story about good and evil with a twist that was created years\nago by the first Kickass. The most memorable thing about this movie is\nthe epic and hilarious fight at the end involving about a hundred\nsuperheroes and super villains. Like I said, it was great. But is\nwasn't anything like the first Kickass, and personally, I never thought\nit needed a sequel. <br><br>9/10\n"
"\nUsually when a sequel for a movie comes out, it isn't as good as the\nfirst one that came out. But for Kick*ss 2, it came out even better\nthan the first one. The fight scene was very gruesome and I was biting\nmy friend fingernails because it was just gory. This movie had some of\nthe best actors out there such as Jim Carrey and Mickey Rooney. Kick$ss\n2 seems to leave out a lot of the characters from the first movie and\nmost of the jokes was corny af. But I like corns. The plot was really\ngood and delicious.<br><br>This movie made me cry even though I eat nails for breakfast. This\nmovie made my friend drop a shopping cart on his head. Go watch it now.\n"
"\nI wanted to love this one, but wound up only kinda liking it. <br><br>..in the first kick-ass you had the Big Daddy warehouse scene, the\nrescue scene and the final battle/shootout that were INCREDIBLY\nwell-executed action sequences.. <br><br>This one didn't have a single memorable sequence. I kinda liked the\ncharacters, but it sure felt like a TON of this movie got cut, because\nit seemed like a lot of the characters just never really got fully\nfleshed out. <br><br>Like, i wish we could have seen more of the bad guys doing stuff. No\none, outside of Mother Russia, ever really DID anything or really\nseemed like a threat. <br><br>There was the potential here for a really good movie, but it wound up\njust kinda lacking that zing factor that the first one had.\n"
