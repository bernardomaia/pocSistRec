"\nI enjoyed the movie so much, that I came onto IMDb and registered\nmyself just so that I can post a review. <br><br>The movie was packed with jaw dropping, eye popping action from\nbeginning to end. The drama had a mix of sadness, comedy and\nseriousness which were all mixed in together so beautifully to give a\nconsistency to keep the viewer starring at the screen and being\ninvolved in the movie rather than daydreaming about other things. <br><br>In my honest opinion I would say that it is the best Fast &amp; Furious\nmovie to date. <br><br>I want to go see it again!<br><br>(by the way, I realise that this isn't the best review in the world or\nmight even be an awful review, the point is that I enjoyed the movie\nthoroughly and felt I should contribute to it's high average ratings).\n"
"\nI've been a personal fan of the F&amp;F series ever since the very first\ntitle was released. Once I saw that Fast Five was in production I\nimmediately began hunting down a pass for its first showing, I was\nsuccessful. Fast Five is everything we all love about the franchise,\nfast cars, beautiful women, and of course some nail biting action\nscenes.<br><br>Whether you're a long time fan of the movies, or a brand new viewer,\nthis movie is a must see, you're guaranteed to get your moneys worth on\nthis title.<br><br>Best movie I have seen in a long time, it even managed to remove the\nbad taste that was left in my mouth by Tokyo Drift. <br><br>This is going to be one of the biggest movies of the year, see it, or\nbe left behind.<br><br>Rating- 10/10 -Average Joe\n"
"\nThis is the film that single-handedly got me to give the rest of the\nseries a shot, for better or worse. It's a nice change of pace from the\nprevious films where it abandons the street race angle (how far could\nyou have taken that anyway?) and goes into the direction of a heist\naction flick with cars. Dwayne Johnson is a great addition and really\nadds to the series embracing the goofiness of its premise. So yeah,\nstill the best this franchise had, and that's kind of rare for a\nfranchise on its fifth film. The action for the most part is really\nhandled well and a lot of fun to watch. The cast as an ensemble are\nvery charismatic which no doubt makes it more fun for audiences to see\na cast that has so much diversity and it's not done with generic\nstereotypes but just a bunch of people with a common interest. Overall\na very entertaining action flick.\n"
"\nWithout a shadow of a doubt, The Fast And Furious Franchise reaches\nit's peak in this installment with breathtaking action and a sense of\nfriendship and brotherhood shared by the lead characters. Vin Diesel\nand Paul Walker return and are joined by newcomer Dwayne Johnsson for\nthe 5th Fast and Furious Movie, entitled ''Fast Five''. There's not\nmuch to say about this, the action movie of the year, except it's\nfantastic shots of Brazil, the heist plot that brings even more\nexcitem«ent to the table and overall the continuation of the story of\nthese characters we have come to love and support, as their bond\nstreghtens over time.<br><br>In Conclusion, if you love the franchise then you can't miss it<br><br>9/10\n"
"\nThis movie was very good and exciting.Effects and musics are essential\nthings for this movie series.Everything was excellent.(I think)This\nmovie's scenario make this movie one of the best movie\nseries.Intelligent and excellent plan,speed and expensive cars which\nare most important things for this movie.In this movie my favorite car\nis Dodge Charger.In this movie the best scene is a race for 10 billion\ndollar which I loved it. In this movie Dom showed his experiences about\ndriving. This movie had expensive budget.I am glad to Chris Morgan and\nGary Scott Thompson because of this perfect movie.I'm waiting for sixth\nmovie which is in this series.\n"
"\nYesterday night, watching Fast Five at the cinema, I was surprised to\nsee a standing ovation at the end of the movie as well as loads of\nclapping during the movie for a series of scenes - this is the first\nmovie that I've witnessed such thing.<br><br>People that paid for the ticket had high expectations and it was worth\nit. There was a bit for everyone: good comedy, nice cars, very dynamic\nand full of action, thrill and last but not least very good acting from\nVin, Dwayne and the others.<br><br>All in all it was well worth the money, it was obviously the best from\nits franchise and I am really looking forward to the F&amp;F 6.\n"
"\nWhen I saw the film loved it too and stills the most wonderful in this\nfilm when Dominique Torito and Brian O'Connor Ptdel large storage\nbefore the arrival of the police to them and they are in the way of\nescape, and also the way who conducted by Dominique Torito rid of men\nHernan Reyes, and they are trying to catch it's also the atmosphere\nthat was where prevail FBI agent its airport Hobbs to Dominique Torito\nand words that were taking place between FBI agent hop and Dominique\nTorito and also a lot in the shots in this film, which won my\nadmiration, especially the role of the Roman Pyrrhus in this film made\ndistinctive Nhech this film is being a comedian and lazy and fearful in\nthis film, but his role in carrying out the tasks in order to reach\nHernan Reyes is one of the finest tactics that I've seen in my life\n"
"\nFast Five is F&amp;F franchise's awesome film till date in terms of acting\naction emotion heist and all of its genres are being presented very\nbeautifully.<br><br>The entry of Dwayne Johnson as Luke Hobbs make this film even better\nthough he loses the fight with Vin diesel but he was awesome.<br><br>The other supporting actors were good Tyrese Gibson was making a good\nbalance of Comedy through the whole movie the techs,gadgets, heist\nplan, action, stunts were all awesome in this movie..<br><br>Whole movie was awesome it was not at all boring it gives you the\nexcitement as you want totally worth watchable movie...<br><br>Hail F&amp;F series!!!!!........\n"
"\nYeah, exactly... They've found the key to the success, I guess. I am so\nappreciated myself for being patient watching the first movies of the\nfranchise. I was welcomed by a gorgeous work as I've hoped since\nwatching Fast &amp; Furious (2009) #4. I advise those who consider starting\nthe franchise to be patient watching the first three nightmares (not\nrecommended to skip them because there are some connection to be needed\nafterwards). It's good to focus on theme of the armed action-thriller\nalso including fight rather than racing-based events. It is also one of\nthe movies at which I laugh much. On the other hand, some scene of it\nis seriously touching. Action, thriller, comedy, dram, doesn't matter\nwhat you're interested in. This installment has all.\n"
"\nThe movie fast five was a very good movie because it had a lot going on\nthrough out the movie. And it has a lot of action which I like because\nit kept you on the edge of your seat because the problems that are\nhappening are interesting. The sound of the cars and everything is\nreally cool because it all combined together well. All the cars and\nracing was very intense and cool. The actors where the best for the\nmovie because they are tough and suit the personalities of the movie\ncharacters. For example, Dom one of the main characters was big strong\nand scary so it showed that the people that are racing the cars have to\nbe tough and scary looking. Then they have Paul walker and he doesn't\nlook like a racer but is and is apart of the family. So overall, the\nmovie Fast Five is a very good movie and deserves good ratings.\n"
"\nFast Five best one from the franchise.The other ones we're very good\ntoo. I love Fast and Furious movies they we're always amazing for me.\nNow to the movie it is awesome movie because of the action.The action\nis just amazing and the cars are sweet. Testosterone Rock as a new one\nto the crew is perfect and good old Dome is just bad-ass and Brian he\nis just good.I liked that he has way more action then he had it the\nother movies.Paul Walker wasn't Oscar worthy actor but he did the job\nand i thing that he managed it very well especially the scenes where he\nrage in that way I think he's perfect. So the action is totally perfect\nacting is very good and dialogs are very good too. I love the movie.I\nlove everything about it.It's just Mind blowing movie.\n"
"\nThe movie still has its feelings of brotherhood and contains a lot\naction and nice cars, although the movie misses street races, the\nnightlife of illegal street racing, like in the first and second fast\nand furious films. There are some mistakes in the storyline that\ndisturbs me, however they are minor errors that are unlikely to be\ndiscovered (perhaps if you watch it more than 10 times, as I did). The\nmovie in general I think is awesome, the action sequences and the humor\nthat is, absolutely awesome. RIP Paul ... You will be missed, you did\nachieve a lot, inspired many!\n...............................................................\n"
"\nI really love this movie. It's so good. It's probably my favorite Fast\nAnd Furious movie. I love that it's not just driving cars, they're\ngoing to steal money. Awesome. This movie has a great cast and great\nsoundtrack.<br><br>In this movie, Dom and Brian have created a plan. Them, along with\ntheir new crew, get together to do a massive heist. But, the thing is,\nthe vault that they want to steal from, belongs to one of the biggest\ncrime lords in Rio. And when they try to steal it, the crime lord puts\nhis safe in the police station, since he's bought off every cop in the\ncity. So, now the group must work out a way to steal a vault from a\npolice station. Easy right? Not really. But in the end their amazing\nplan works out and they get heaps of money.<br><br>Overall, I give this movie a 10 out of 10.\n"
"\nLOVED this movie. My favorite of the whole franchise(not counting the\nseventh one as that's not in theaters yet).<br><br>But I warn you- if you're one of those movie goers who wants everything\nto be a thousand percent believable this movie is not for you. There\nare some stunts that could be perceived as a bit far fetched, but I\nstill loved it- I mean, I go to the movies to get away from reality for\na couple hours, so whether it's a rom-com where the guy gets the girl\nevery time no matter how much he messes up, or some unrealistic stunts\nin a drama/action, I don't care if it technically can't happen the way\nthey do it on screen. It's entertainment to me, and this movie is VERY\nentertaining to me.\n"
"\nI had always loves the series and enjoyed all of them.This one ships\nwith usual cliché and storyline.The chases are hair raising,dialogs are\nsolid,and there are plenty of funny lines.All of this makes fast five a\nmust watch although suspension of belief if always there in Hollywood\nentertainment movies.This film follows a tight script with lots of\ntwists and turns although all of them may not surprise you.Plot is\nreally convincing and carried forward by amazing cinematography and\nediting.Director cleverly choose between amazing camera angles,which\neditor had turned into a edge of the seat scenes. This film never\nmisses the beat even when there are short emotional moments in the\nmovie.\n"
"\nI'm not a movie critic. I know what I like. And this movie is, without\na doubt, very well done. The action is top shelf, the pace is fast and\nunrelenting, the cars and women are stunning and there isn't a single\ncharacter, even the villain, who is truly despicable. That is, everyone\nin the movie is likable and watchable.<br><br>It was great to see Dwayne Johnson (The Rock) playing somewhat of a bad\nguy but he's also one of the good guys. Being a fan of Clear and\nPresent Danger, I was a little disappointed that Joaquim de Almeida's\nrole wasn't more prominent but it is, essentially, an ensemble cast\nthat is fun to watch. Definitely a movie worth watching and there isn't\nmuch of a lull anywhere in the movie to allow for a quick run to the\nbathroom so make sure you're familiar with the pause button's location\non your remote.\n"
"\nGreat movie! I was bored and wanted some real surround noise :) so I\nplayed it! Wow! Somewhere between Tropa de Elite and Fast and furious!\nSo, Fast and furious on steroids! Full time fun, jumping, shooting,\nfast - real fast driving, chasing, blowing things up in all directions!\nAnd all of it very sensibly put in order. Nothing is out place or time.\nJust set back and be prepared for a big smile through out the movie! I\nreally had big smile at the end. True enjoyment.<br><br>SPOILER: At the end of the movie (after ending slides already start),\none small scene brought back dead to life (Letty)! So, watch it until\nall of it passes. But actually I was happy after watching this\nspectacular movie to see that I will be getting more of this!!! Wow!\nWhat a masterly FIFTH sequel! Bravo!\n"
"\nGood Movie. Great story line. However i was very disappointed in the\nlack of street racing and Japanese street cars. When they won all of\nthe cars they should have shown how some of the races when they won\nthem. There was great action scenes and everything besides the lack of\nstreet racing was good. 2 fast 2 furious had a pretty good amount of\nstreet racing making it my second favorite fast and furious, but Tokyo\ndrift was by far my favorite, it had plenty of street racing car\ndriving and drifting, i loved it. Please put more street Racing in next\nmovie, make it more like Tokyo drift please, this one seems to be\nmissing the old fast and furious trademark (the driving, street racing\netc.) and make sure to include Japanese street cars such as Skylines,\nEvo's, supra's, 350Z etc. Oh and please make sure Paul Walker is in it.\nThanks.\n"

"\nThe film was a action film.In my opinion This film is the best film of\nthe action film.First, graphs of the scene was very excellent.The film\ncontains famous actress and actor.Ludicrous ,Don Omar,Vin Diesel,Paul\nWalker,Jordana Brewster and there was many person but my favorite actor\nwas Vin Diesel because he was Mia's (Jordana's) brother and he was\nbrother really.He was wonderful driver.I liked two scene.The first one\n'Somebody stole the cars from train.'.The second one 'Big robbery'.The\nend of the film was excellent really.I'm very excited.I watched with my\nuncle.Everything of the film very beautiful. Thanks a lot Justın Lin.I\nthink You should watch a film.If you aren't watch,you can lose .\n"
"\nThis might just be the best movie of all time! I certainly did not\nexpect this from a \"Fast and The Furious\" movie. The action genre is a\ndying and dreary one, but this movie lifts it from the gutter high into\nthe sky. The mere originality that Justin Lin delivers is without a\ndoubt one of the most incredible ones I have ever experienced. The\nacting is solid and believable and for the first time Vin Diesel\nactually displayed some emotions. The twist at the end was one of the\nmost psychologically thrilling I have ever seen. Do not hesitate to\nwatch this movie, they rarely come this good. Seriously, if you're not\na pleb you will totally enjoy this movie (so will your girlfriend).\n"
"\nThis is the best film in the series, probably because it borrowed\nheavily from the recent version of The Italian Job. It borrowed ideas\nsuch as deciding to use a fast, nimble car to navigate through a narrow\nparking garage, creating a copy of the target location in which to\npractice, obtaining the same safe they will need to crack later, and\nusing street cameras to direct cars through traffic. All of these\nelements were used in The Italian Job. Oddly enough, rumors had it that\na sequel to The Italian Job was going to be made and be set in Brazil\nbut it was never made. Was this supposed to be that sequel? Probably\nnot. A sequel would've had new ideas and this one just had a rehash of\nold ones.<br><br>Anyway, despite similarities to The Italian Job, this film was\nentertaining and enjoyable to watch.\n"
"\nI was not prepared for how good this film was going to be, I had\navoided watching it after being disappointed with the rest of this\nseries. HOWEVER you will be disappointed no longer as this film brings\neverything we have missed since the first. all the action and violence\nand comedy and general awesomeness. I managed to catch this film on a\nflight back from the states and it honestly made the flight go insanely\nfast. the film admittedly has some flaws and a OK story line but that\nis more than made up for with the rest of the film. and the final scene\nwith the dodge chargers although a little unrealistic was no less one\nof the most awesome in history (no more on that or the film will be\nruined). i can not say how impressed i was with this film after all the\nfailures of its predecessors<br><br>ROLL ON FAST 6!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1\n"
"\nWith the exception of Paul Walker's (as usual) terrible acting, Fast 5\nhas everything an action movie strives for; believable acting, humor\n(mostly from Tyrese), explosions, sexy women (and men for the ladies\nout there), exotic cars, destruction, and most importantly,\nfull-throttled action that its predecessors couldn't come close to\nmatching.<br><br>The setting in Rio really showcases how beautiful the city is with\nspectacular aerial views thrown in on occasion to highlight it. <br><br>Fast 5 is definitely the best of the Fast and Furious franchise, and it\nreally isn't even close.\n"
"\nI LOVED this movie!!! The action scenes are exhilarating too a whole\nnew level.Everyone was great in this one no weak links to be found\nwhich also made it a great movie going experience.some standouts;Tyrese\nGibson from the urban drama classic \"Baby Boy\", really played his\ncharacter..he was hilarious in every scene he had!!! The Rock(Dwayne\nJohnson) was Excellent Luke Hobbs who was bad ass in his role and\nlooked to be enjoying be apart of the cast..the pivotal scene where he\nis down and looks to be out help and unexpected is on the way in such a\nepic guns blazing scene that was so damn good! I almost gave this movie\na 10 because seriously it is that good of a movie and by and I don't\ngive movies 10 these days .Go see this!!! its worth it and u wont never\nregret it!!! Best Movie Of The Summer!!! A\n"
"\nEveryone use to talk about how they are excited to watch fast five, but\nI wasn't really that excited about it. I've seen all the fast and\nfurious films and I though it would be the same, but then I watched the\ntrailer..then the film and absolutely loved it. I loved how the film\nhas a bit of romance, comedy, action... so basically every genre and\nlikes how every second of the film was very exciting and not boring.\nAlso, I loved the fact that Paul Walker cleaned himself up a bit,\nbecause it the other fast and furious films, he was not that hot, but\nit fast five he looked smoking hot. <br><br>Also....jordana brewster and paul walker are smoking hot together!! :)\nI would actually recommend people to watch this because it is the best\nfilm of 2011 so far.\n"
"\nafter watching all the other fast and furious films i thought they\nstarted good and just got worse the more they made, then i went and\nwatched this one and i can say definitely a DVD i will be buying when\nout.<br><br>they brought in all the characters from previous films and added the\nrock (dwayne Johnson) and they made something special.<br><br>was action packed and stunts done properly no dodgy cgi rubbish that\nwas in the 4th film.<br><br>i enjoyed the film very much liked the action and thought the stunts\nwere amazing, a little ott at bits but still very enjoyable.\n"
"\nCars, girls, fights, more cars, more fights... This and more is what\nyou will find if you watch Fast Five.<br><br>I've always been a fan of Fast and Furious. I watched every Fast and\nFurious movie. Some where good, others where Okay. Then I watched Fast\nFive, and boy did it knock me off my feet. It was a thrill ride, right\nfrom the start till the jaw dropping end.<br><br>If you are not a fan of the franchise, Fast Five will reel you in.\nThere just ain't another movie like it out there. You've got Vin,\nDwayne, Walker and sweet nice, Jordana. Plus a few old faces who are\nready to pump up the NOS and race it till it breaks.<br><br>As a fan of Diesel and Dwayne I was looking forward to them standing\nfist to fist with each other.<br><br>On a more serious note. The story was well written and well executed by\nthe actors. All in all a great movie that will be worth buying and\nadded to your collection.\n"
"\nThe trailer gave me an adrenalin rush and my curiosity was more peaked\ncomparing to the previous movies. But if you think this is a movie with\nraces, you're wrong.<br><br>This is a heist movie. But that isn't a bad thing, on the contrary!\nThis franchise could use a fresh start and the big difference was that\nthey toned down showing off fast cars and beautiful women, Fast Five is\nmore character driven and brings back a lot of characters from previous\nmovies, included a nice surprise at the end.<br><br>My guess is we're probably gonna see more familiar faces in part 6, but\nwe will have to wait for that. We also got new faces, in the form of\nDwayne Johnson. It's a nice addition to see how he's determined to\narrest the main characters and that the main characters are deep in\ntrouble with several parties hunting them.<br><br>Also different is that there isn't a single race in this one, but it\nhas a lot of action and even subtle humor we haven't seen in the\nprevious installments.<br><br>Action fans, just go see it when you can!\n"
"\nOK I have never been a fan of F and F series. First one was a good\nsurprise, fresh and at some point original, 2nd one was really bad\nmaybe cause vin diesel was not participating in that one but in the end\nit sucked, I never saw tokio drift and the last one was a mix of bad\nacting, bad plot barely decent action and some CGI effects that looked\nvery fake. But OMG this one has it all, from beginning to end is great\nentertainment, nothing more nothing less. Its like having together the\nbest parts of the franchise with a touch of oceans eleven and some\naction scenes that are simply jaw dropping. This is how all the past\nmovies should have been and being this a 5th part that is quit an\nachievement maybe it is an exaggeration but for me this is the\nmasterpiece of all the 5th parts. Definitely worth the price of the\nticket and I cant wait to see it in blu ray and replay a few times the\nlast half hour of the movie.\n"
"\nFast Five has enough machismo and testosterone to make The Expendables\nlook subdued. It's much more of a straight up action/heist film than\nthe previous movies, with the occasional car chase scene to remind you\nit's still a Fast &amp; Furious movie (if all the returning faces aren't\nenough to let you know). <br><br>And it works. This is a really fun flick to watch in an \"Ocean's Eleven\nmeets the gleeful carnage of a Michael Bay movie\" kind of way that's\nentertaining and ridiculously over-the-top. Fast Five is easily the\nbest movie of the series, and probably one of the most exciting movies\nof the year. Dwayne Johnson is a perfect addition to the cast and his\nconfrontations with Diesel's character is among the many highlights of\nthe film, plus it's good to see the old cast members back in action. If\nyou want an action romp that breezes by without getting to serious,\nlooks slick, and just doesn't know what it means to slow down, this\nwill give you all you need and more. \n"
"\nfast five is my all time favorite movie. it had great fighting and\nracing scenes. everything was perfect. your dumb not to like it. Vin\ndiesel is a great actor for the movie. he's daring and always prepared.\nas usual, fast five had a great beginning and a great ending. it seemed\nlike a suicide mission but they made anything possible at the end. the\nseen with the train was very exciting. you always wanted to know what\nwas going to happen. The movie changed a lot to surprise you, which\nmade it very suspenseful. they invested a lot of money into this movie\nwith all the destroyed cars. it made it totally worth it. it is a great\nmovie compared to the other fast and furious movies. it makes you want\nwant to see the next sequel because it always keeps you guessing at the\nend. thats why i'm positive fast and furious six will be just as good\nor even better\n"
"\nFast Five is a terrific action movie with a well written script. The\naction scenes are the best in the entire Fast series and I rate the\nFast Five a solid 10 stars. For sheer thrills and edge of your seat\naction don't miss this movie. Romance is kept to a minimum, a must for\naction movies, and the next chase, gun fight etc. is just a couple\nminutes away. The 110 minutes on the screen went by in a flash, another\nindication of how great this movie is. I've been to movies where 2\nhours seem like 2 days. D Johnson really held up his part of the movie\nand was very believable in his DSS (FBI) like role. BTW I usually don't\nrate the movies I really like above a 7 or 8 stars, but Fast Five\ndeserves the entire ammo belt load of 10 stars. If you like action pics\n(duh who doesn't) SEE THIS MOVIE!\n"
"\nOne normally expects the law of diminishing returns to set in with\nsequels. But Fast Five is fine.<br><br>Diesel, Walker &amp; Co are in Rio looking for a big score, with Dwayne\nJohnson's crack team looking to bring them back to answer for various\ncrimes (the fact that these guys have no jurisdiction in Rio is\nmentioned, but otherwise overlooked).<br><br>There are a couple of excellent set pieces bookending some entertaining\ncharacter stuff and plot movement. And when I say \"excellent\", what I\nmean is not very probable, but immensely entertaining, with brilliant\nstunt work interlaced with visual effects so well that you can't tell\nwhich is which.<br><br>I thoroughly enjoyed this.\n"
"\nFast Five is for many the best Fast &amp; Furious in the franchise and it's\nnot many times that we see a 5th good movie for instance A Good Day to\nDie Hard was disappointing or Rocky V was good for me but everyone else\nhated it. Fast 5 has one of the most badass fight scenes from the\nseries i'm talking about The Rock doing the spear at Vin Diesel, also\nFast Cars, beautiful women and a lot of chases from rooftop to rooftop.\nIt's easy to see why people loved this film and why it still seems to\nbe the best one it was directed in a very good way, it was mostly a\nheist movie but also it was just a better movie than the previous 4\nespecially 2 and 3. This is how you make a series great where many\npeople were mixed with the first 4 and now they love this one good job\npeople.\n"
"\nI did not like the first movie of The fast and the furious. I like 2\nfast 2 furious. And I like The fast and the furious Tokyo drift. And I\nlike Fast and furious new model original parts. But this is better.\nThis movie has a great story line. It also has great acting. It also\nhas a lot of action. 7.3 is a good ratting. But this is such a great\nmovie that 7.3 is underrating it. I give it 9. It is a great movie.\nFurious 7 is a better. But still this a great movie. If you like action\nmovies then you will like this movie. This is a movie that you should\nsee. I is a very cool movie. If you do not like this movie that's OK\nwith movie. But if you do not then I do not think you do not like\naction movies.\n"
"\nWarning, may contain spoilers. This is a good action thriller movie\nwith strong characters. There is a good feeling that these characters\ncare about each other. The director handles the intense action\nsequences in a good way. They are entertaining to watch. The main\nvillain is a bit weak. I didn't really feel threatened by him. The film\nhas a pretty good soundtrack that fits into it well enough. The ending\nleaves you wanting another movie.\n"
"\nI just finished watching Fast &amp; Furious 4 and now I'm starting this\ninstallment Fast Five. I must say so far this has been the very best\ntransition from one installment to the next so far. Much better than\nany of the previous installments. I loved the introduction of the Rock\nin this installment as well as the fact that all of the originals were\nback. Now the stunts in this installment was were the best up until\nthis point in the franchise library. Vince ... It was nice to have\nBrian save Vince in the last one Vince was in( part 1) because after\nthat here in Fast Five they got along pretty well. Let me buckle down\nand tune in to this one ... I think I can recall much of this one and I\nrecall it being pretty entertaining. Time for me a beer and movie\ntime.... I'll add more if need be. Yes bring in the team. Yes this is\nwhen it got back good. I'm loving it. The mix of all the best from each\ninstallment prior to this one and it's on. This was the best one after\n1\n"
"\nFast Five is a fantastic movie with a really well developed storyline\nthat continues right were the fourth Fast &amp; Furious left off.The cast\nare all brilliant as usual,but a lot of credit for making this the best\nFast &amp; Furious yet has to go to the addition of Dwayne Johnson,his\nperformance as Luke Hobbs was outstanding,he was intimidating and scary\nand he suited the role perfectly.This one is certainly for action\npacked than the previous four and a much more exciting story to it as\nwell.Fans of the previous Fast &amp; Furious and fans of action movies in\ngeneral will love Fast &amp; Furious Five.<br><br>Dominic (Vin Diesel) escapes from prison with the help of Brian (Paul\nWalker) and Mia (Jordana Brewster) and they all become wanted\ncriminals.Dominic plans a heist with a bunch of lose friends to win\nback their freedom.\n"
"\nFor the fifth installment of the Fast &amp; Furious series this installment\nwasn't half bad. In fact, I found it to be better than some of its\npredecessors.<br><br>Fast Five has a great cast of misfits and they all come together nicely\nin this flick. This movie is very fast moving and doesn't waste a\nsecond jumping into the plot. Fast Five has a great combination of\naction, light humor, and even a wee-bit of suspense.<br><br>I did find this movie to be highly predictable though, and\nunfortunately, this was not \"The Rock's\" best work. With that being\nsaid, despite its minor misgivings, Fast Five was highly entertaining,\nthe cars/car driving was fabulous, and the chemistry among the actors\nis fantastic.\n"
"\nI usually finish movies - even bad ones - but this is worse than bad.\nGirl: \"I'm Pregnant\"....Boy: \"You're Kidding me!?\".... or \"This Mission\njust went from Mission Impossible, to Mission Insanity\"....yes that's\nthe kind of completely brain-dead dialog that's commonplace in this\nholy-hell-crud-fest. This is a movie whose story and dialog has the\nsophistication of a Grand-Theft-Audio Video Game. It features ludicrous\naction sequences, terrible direction, and equally bad acting and line\ndeliveries. There are lots of good looking people on screen with\nstilted cue-card-bad line-delivery take your pick of any actor\ninvolved. Before even starting this stink-fest you knew who the target\naudience was for by the PG-13 rating. To top off, the music is lifted\nfrom old Miami Vice episodes. Not worth your time. A true turkey!\n"
"\nHow would i describe Fast Five? Preposterous! Ridiculous! Absurd! The\nfilm is riddled with one-liners and stunts that would kill the average\nhuman(except for Chuck Norris, but is he really human), yet it is\nentertaining for a summer popcorn film. i have seen all of the series,\nexcept for The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift and this one seems to\nbe the worst of all. It is like they said lets take all the good parts\nof all the previous films and through it together. Unfortunately it\ndoes not work. This film was about them stealing cars, but they don't\nshow many cars in the film and they hint at races, but skip to the next\nscene, so we don't actually see the races. We meet some characters, but\nonly for as minute and then they almost disappear for the rest of the\nfilm. As i stated above, it is still entertaining, but... Just check\nyour brain at the door.\n"
"\nIf you are a big fan of the Fast And Furious Franchise.Then I recommend\nthis movie to you.It has all the action,foot chases,and best of all.Who\ndoesn't want to miss out on two buff dudes beating each other\nsenseless.The acting is OK,and to be honest the stunts are just crazy\ninsane.I hope my review helped a little bit.Im just hoping this is\nREALLY the ending to Fast and Furious,because I believe this a\nbrilliant ending to a brilliant franchise.Thus,I'm really excited to\nget the movie on DVD when it comes out. Anyway,i hope my review helped\nout a little bit.And I'm hoping to see some more movies from Justin Lin\nin the future\n"
"\nGreetings from Lithuania.<br><br>This is the best action movie so far in 2011, hands down. Action\nsequences are UNBELIEVABLE in every meaning of this word. Plot? Nothing\nnew here, but it works. Acting is OK, especially from Dwayne Johnson -\nhe simply rocks in this one! What i liked the most in \"Fast Five\" that\naction sequences doesn't use CGI, or uses it where it's only necessary.\nStunts are \"crazy\" in \"Fast Five\" - in a god way. And that is what\nmakes action seq. in \"Fast Five\" look AMAZING - You have to see it on a\nbig screen. <br><br>Really looking forward to \"F&amp;F6\"!<br><br>9/10.\n"
"\nWhile this movie doesn't have much straight up street racing its got\nplenty of everything else. This is the one sequel where they got the\naction right on all aspects. Not much CGI at all unless it was so good\nyou couldn't tell. Crazy shootouts and an awesome fight scene. The\nstory is probably the best out of all the sequels, while not quite that\ngreat. Its a rip off from The Italian Job, but i never liked that\nmovie.<br><br>The character development is there for our main cast from the first\nfilm. While a couple action parts are cheesy its hard not to like this\nmovie. Much better then the last film and Dwayne Johnson made the movie\nbetter. If your a fan of the franchise go see this because they just\nreinvented the whole franchise.\n"
"\nThe above sentence just sums it all, \"A lot of testosterone and hot\nbabes.\" For some, that's all it takes for a great movie. This movie was\nreally just about Vin Diesel vs Rock, that's all. Without those 2 guys,\nthis movie would've just sucked. In my opinion, this was NOT the BEST\nof fast and furious, the best is still Tokyo drift.<br><br>Though most of the population just needs some violence and action to\ncall it a good movie. Whether you want to admit or not, the fighting\nscenes were fake. Watching the movie, at the end, what lesson did you\nlearn? Big guys with guns kick ass? Yay, when I grow up, I want to ride\nfast cars, steal money, and have a gang family and I'll still be the\ngood guy. That's not how the real world works.<br><br>Sure, they tried to add some elements from Ocean's 11 series with the\nHeist and everything, but that was most likely the only good part.\n"
"\nI don't understand how people review this movie as being good. It was\nterrible. The plot had many loopholes so if you want to appreciate a\ngood story, you can't. Even if you look beyond the loopholes in the\nstory, some of the scenes are just impossible. What I loved about the\nfirst movie was the fact that for the most part it was realistic. This\nmovie had too many unrealistic scenes. I'd rather not gives examples\ncause I don't want to spoil the movie for anyone.<br><br>Someone described this movie as being a heist film rather than street\nracing. It was well said, because if you turn a street racing movie\ninto a heist movie, its obviously going to fail. And there is just no\nway to make a good plot out of it. <br><br>Just so some people have an idea of how disappointing this movie was...\nthere is no race scenes. At least none that important or anything. It\nwas not a fast and the furious movie at all. It was just a way for them\nto make so much money.\n"
"\nThe Fast and Furious Franchise always gave a fun time that's full of\nRush, From the Very First movie to this, it's always fun to watch and\nyou will always have fun if your a classic fan of the franchise, Now\nthose who criticize this movie cant deliver Everything you want, i mean\nyes it's definitely not The Godfather! and you certainly wont expect\nanything of that magnitude in this movie, but than again this movie is\nall about having a good time and checking out fast car's and hot\nbabe's. That's how it's always been and always will be, People Will be\nsatisfied with this movie because it delivers what you expect and more.\nThe Classic chase and thrill's and to add up the excitement there are\nsome extra materials that i won't give away, so if you are fan of rush\nand excitement and just wanna have a good time , this is the movie for\nyou.\n"
"\nNow, I am not a fan of racing movies, but this was not a racing movie!\nAlthough that may disappoint some Fast and Furious lovers, action movie\nlovers rejoice! Fast Five is full of exciting action scenes, gorgeous\nwomen and fast cars! If you come to the theater with a hunger to see\nsomeone get the living hell beat out of him, you are going to leave\nfull and satisfied! Vin Diesel and Dwayne Johnson both play amazing\nroles, and their actual personality shines through their characters,\nwhich truly makes a movie a good movie. Fast Five is in chronological\norder with the other movies, and is just what long time fans would\nexpect from a Fast and Furious movie. Even the ending is a HUGE twist\nand is hard to see coming. Should you go see Fast Five? YES!\n"
"\nI don't know how this movie was liked by so many people!! It is\nprobably as bad or slightly better than Fast &amp; Furious 4. The last FF\nmovie that I liked was Tokyo drift. Rest of them (following it) are\njust boring and uncreative.<br><br>The movie has a plot which is borrowed from Ocean's eleven without a\nclear role for each of the players. The car chase scenes are\nunbelievable and stupid. <br><br>There were hardly any decent car chase scenes. Last 2 minutes of the\nmovie was a big product placement gig!<br><br>The Only thing that was warm about the movie was the presence of inter-\nracial couples. Except that every thing else was as cold and unexciting\nas a arctic winter!\n"
"\nI have no problems suspending my disbelieve but this movie pushed it\ntoo far. I like the Transporter and Crank movies because they are\nridiculous but also very entertaining but this movie was a piece of\ncrap. The whole \"Safe\" pulling sequence was so horrible and stupid I\ncouldn't believe my eyes. Also the movie is boring, the acting and the\nscript are insulting. Who ever really likes this movie has some serious\nproblems or is 5 years old. Sorry but its true. People who think movies\nlike this are good are the reason Hollywood will continue to make\ndrivel like this.\n........................................................(My tenth line\nstarts here.)\n"
"\nThis movie sucked from start to finish, actually i fell asleep watching\nit the first time. So had to watch it again, well from the part i fell\nasleep. No Spoilers only so much, the acting is total rubbish, cliché\nlike and painting the the average American stereotype totally over the\ntop. F&amp;F 3 was rubbish already, badly cut, totally incoherent lousy\nacting and so on... Vin Diesel i do expect more of you!!! Dreadful\npiece of movie Junk, the production team must have gone to town on the\nmovie rating here on IMDb 7.8 yeah right, you gotta be a) a total numb\nnut American finding this trash good or b) from the production team to\ngive this garbage more than 1. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME! UNLESS YOU DO\nNOT HAVE ANYTHING BETTER TO DO.\n"
"\nWhat an awful movie. I cannot believe that this film went through a\nscreening process and made it to release in this form.<br><br>This is clearly just a vehicle to cash in on the F&amp;F name. Nobody looks\nlike they really believe in the movie, its almost written on their\nfaces \"I am just doing this for the money\"!! <br><br>Its about as cheesy and unbelievable a movie that you will see this\nyear, and probably next year, unless they do a F&amp;F6. The one liners\nthat they thought worked in the earlier movies are hear, long moody\nfaces to camera are supposed to replace the storyline. Special effects\nare one thing but nearly everything in this movie is just laughably\nunbelievable, more like a cartoon. I am still reeling from the shock of\nthis horror of a film. What a waste of money.<br><br>The sad thing is I like the Rock, I like Vin, but this movie is really\na sad showcase for their talents. I hope they never sit and watch it!!!\n"
"\nI never had any anticipations from this movie but watching it was a\npure and utter disgust; I never thought that a director could go this\nfar on pure Super bull Sh*t; the actions are totally out of the world\nand when I say out of the world I really mean it, this movie was made\nby disregarding every law of physics, the director must have hated\nphysics or his physics teacher must have done some wrongs with him.<br><br>Also the director lacks common sense: <br><br>Vin Diesel vs Rocks : The probability of happening of the unbelievable\nis null {}<br><br>In brief:<br><br>Production value: None, Actions: Suited for star war movies, Story:\nCrazy and with lapses, Acting: Horrible Disgust: Guaranteed,...<br><br>The only good thing that this movie had was, The Rock; but, seriously,\nhe was treated awfully and I feel sad for him he deserved much better\nthen that junkie who seems like goggling when talking.\n"
"\nI confess to not being a big fan of the 'Fast...\" series. I do enjoy a\ngood action film. I didn't enjoy this one due to it exceeding my\nability to suspend disbelief quotient. Cars CANNOT do those things. If\nyou show the stars having their first hot meal in a while eating like\nhungry dogs, then how do they later afford the stuff they need for the\n'job'?. How, in a country run by the criminal they rob, do they get\nfake passports? Fast Five is too full of these issues for my mind to\nsit there on idle. It wakes up and busts out of the jar I put it in\nprior to going in to thee movie, and kicks the inside of my skull. Stop\nit! get out now! But no, I stayed to the end. Rental Only.\n"
"\nThis one was too much even for the F&amp;F franchise; I would call McGuiver\nand Jammy Bond, maybe even Braddock. And many places didn't look like\nBrazil, which has almost no passenger railways at all (maybe there're\nthree or four, no more than 200 miles I guess), what to say TGV (or\nsomething looking like it, I really can't figure what was that).\nSecond, it was more like Mexico, if I know something about that.\nFinally, I don't know where they found so many import cars for those do\nexist in very, very limited quantity. And just a dozen (in the entire\ncountry) are designated as patrol units, for use of senior officers who\naren't seen around driving them. Well, there's no fun in driving a VW\nFox or a Fiat with 79HPs, uh?\n"
"\nI just don't understand how people can give this anything above 3/10.\nIts just so ridiculously stupid on so many levels it would take me the\nwhole day to write up whats wrong with this film if you want to call it\nthat. The acting is extremely poor as expected, many scenes are\nextremely cheesy and cliché. The stunts are so grossly unrealistic that\nit pisses me off that they even try and make us believe this sh*t is\neven remotely possible. It's just as realistic as having them fly\naround like superman and creating antimatter out of their asses.<br><br>This whole movie is just dumb on too many levels and those who enjoyed\nit are equally dumb! I want 2 hours of my life back!\n"
"\nOne of the worst movie i have ever seen.<br><br>Basically these type of American movies have nothing in them. And this\none is no different. Just different characters . thats it. otherwise\nthe theme is always the same. The American military is again there (\nany good movie for an American should involve the military.. pathetic\nmentality..)<br><br>The only good thing about this movie is it was filmed in Rio De\nJaneiro. I think the whole movie was for a fight between Vin Diesel and\nDwayne Johnson. I really don't know how this movie got 7.8 rating. <br><br>Never trust a movie with the so called American heroes.\n"
"\nover the top: if jumping buses in \"speed\" bother us compare to speed,\nthe action in this movie is a jump over the empire state building..\nwith a bus.<br><br>Secondly it is full of plot holes in peoples action and what they say\n..right at the ending..go through what people did just 10 minutes ago\nin the movie.. makes no sense.!..u got to start asking yourself was i\ndreaming or in a different movie ten minutes ago? The movie starts\nwell, but ..the tension between Brian oConner and Dominuq Toretto is\njust not there anymore and this makes the whole movie bland.. soon u\nfind yourself in a completely unoriginal plot..aka almost identical to\nthe plot from \"the Losers\" , \"The expendabels\" and so many others..just\nwith the plot holes as above and a worse story and more boring....when\nthe action starts it gets ridiculous quickly...I like fast and furious\nI and IV..this one was the worst of the serious.\n"
"\nIf you have absolutely nothing better to do...only then watch this\nmovie .... and that too at your own risk :)<br><br>You bring in Vin Diesel and Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson.....so you expect\nto see at least some reasonable action rather than that what is shown\nin this movie...<br><br>Once again, as in all the recent Hollywood action movies, the sequences\nin this movie fail to arouse the required amount of thrills and end up\nto be nothing but senseless and absolutely implausible......specially\nthe last scene ( the vault being dragged across the city by the two\ncars )...<br><br>The utterly preposterous fight sequences are complemented by an equally\nweak story line and direction....<br><br>The only good thing in the movie is, well ,Gal Gadot ( and even she\ngets a very little screen presence :) )......<br><br>All in all it is an absolute waste of time ....\n"
"\nI saw this movie with expectations. The IMDb score were at the time\n7.9, so I thought that this movie would be pretty good, but trust me,\nits not! What bothers me the most about this movie is the extreme\nstupidity and lack of logic. For example, in the beginning of the movie\nthe team is raiding a train to steal cars located in the last carriage.\nA few carriages a head there are some police officers. They don't hear\nwhen the team uses blow torches to open the wall of the train carriage\ncontaining the cars resulting in the whole carriage wall ripping of,\nbut when 1 shot is fired inside the carriage containing the cars, they\nsuddenly get aware of the raid. <br><br>Another example is when some characters are chased by police officers\non some rooftops and vigorously time after time survives 30 feet jumps\nfrom rooftops down to the concrete street without a scratch. <br><br>However, the most unrealistic and stupid scene is a car chase in the\nend of the movie. I wont spoil it for you but trust me, you will laugh\nor cry as all the laws of physic and logic are boldly defied.\n"
"\nSo a bunch of street racers, suddenly turn into the worlds best\ncriminal masterminds. <br><br>A particular scene which I cant stand is when ludicrous describes a\nbank vault. 'Its a 7 by 6 foot metall alloyy...etc'. How on earth does\nhe know all this, and how to break into it.<br><br>'I had a life before i met you' he says.<br><br>OOOOO... he must of been a bank robber, makes perfect sense...<br><br>So stupid!<br><br>But yeh they tried to mix oceans eleven with cars. It works, its an\neasy watch if you take everything for granted. As for the film making\nsense...HELL NO.\n"
"\nThe L.A. mod/racing scene's not my bag, and it was mostly forced drama.\nBut they seem to have reinvented this franchise as a\nheist/\"Expendables\" thing (and I'm a sucker for a good heist flick).\nThey also brought in Dwayne Johnson. Here, take my money. <br><br>But \"Fast Five\" is a grander/more expensive version of the first movie;\nforced drama and unrelatable characters. And this is a cast that's\nsurprisingly low on charm. So the casting of both Johnson and Joaquim\nde Almeida is indeed a charismatic highlight. <br><br>All in all, this makes for a pretty good mindless entertainment. The\naction's frenetic, the setpieces absurd. Speedy cars, 'splosions and\nwhatnot. I've got no problem with this movie - I'm just not apart of\nthat target audience. <br><br>5/10\n"
"\nFirst of all, let me say, BRAVO for the addition of Dwayne 'the Rock'\nJohnson to the cast of \"Fast &amp; Furious 5\" by director Justin Lin. If\nany director knows how to keep a franchise fresh and invigorating for\nthe viewer, it is him.<br><br>The storyline is excellent and by the end, the viewer is saying to\nhimself, \"what the heck?\" The twists and turns of F&amp;F5 keep you\nguessing and wanting more. The story takes off right as \"Fast &amp;\nFurious\" ended, with Dom heading to prison. But what you see at the\nbeginning of F&amp;F5 will blow you out of your seat if you haven't seen it\nalready. It was amazing.<br><br>The addition of the character Luke Hobbs (played by the Rock), an\nantagonist to Dominic Toretto (played by Vin Diesel) is a perfect\ncasting job. Even as an authority figure, Hobbs is a very likable\ncharacter. Kudos! If \"Fast &amp; Furious 6\" is as amazing as this film, we\nare all in for a treat. And anticipation for \"Fast &amp; Furious 7\" just as\nmuch, I hear that Jason Statham will be appearing in that film. Think\nof it as an \"Expendables\" on really fast wheels.\n"
"\nI've seen the rest of the Fast and the Furious movies, and hoped this\none was going to be just as good. And it was! In fact, i liked this one\nbetter than the original! It had great action, thrills, and was the\nsame kind of story as the other ones. Of course, i have to comment on\nthe undeveloped story, flat characters, and unrealistic parts of the\nmovie. Of course, i knew i was going to have to suspend disbelief going\nin, but some of the sequences of action in this movie were too hard to\noverlook. They fall from a 1000 ft high bridge, plummeting into water,\nbut of course, they are okay! Also, the plot and acting was iffy. This\nis a generic action thriller with lots of one-liners and car crashes.\nBut that's all that we came for right? So that makes it a little bit\nbetter. If car chases, thrills, and kills are your criteria that you\nlook for in movies, then definitely see this one. You won't be\ndisappointed.<br><br>HandHStudios Rating: 6.2/10\n"
"\nI cant believe Im actullay saying this but they came out with a Fast\nand Furious sequel that I actually liked. No they did not improve on\nthe acting but everything else is done much better. The dialouge and\nplot were much better this time around and the action scenes actually\nheart racing.<br><br>This movie follows Dominic Toretto and his crew of street racers who\nplan a massive heist to buy their freedom while in the sights of a\npowerful Brazilian drug lord and a dangerous federal agent.<br><br>This movie was actually a pleasant surprise. After all the other\nsequels I was really going to give up on this franchise and Im really\nglad I didn't and decided to watch this one.\n"
"\nA great film, I was impressed with the action sequences and really\nloved the Dwayne Johnson-Vin diesel action sequence parts. The moment\nthey blow up the prison bus in the first scene, I knew this movie was\ngonna be fun.<br><br>The following part after the bus trashing sequence is a little boring\nbut the fun comes when they steal the muscle cars from the train. It\nwas fun to watch this movie but I must say a little technical glitches\nand hard to believe concept in the later action sequences was kind of\nboring. Dwayne Johnson made the movie a great watch and the muscle cars\nwere also pretty good. A had earned action fast paced movie but\ndefinitely one of the action movies of the year. This movie will turn\nout to be a entertaining watch, not the best in the franchise but still\nan entertaining watch. A hard earned movie, go for it!\n"
"\nFast Five. Action packed thrill ride gun firing explosion blowing WOW\nof a film. You would think that after all the other four films that\nfive would be pushing the sequel's too far. now i can see that, However\n\"Fast Five\" is by far the best one out of all of them. i guess because\nthey have put much more money into this film, the budget was an\nestimated $125,000,000, the film was well advertised and people were\nmore aware of this film coming to the cinema and there was a big \"hype\"\nabout it coming out. I think the hype towards this film was the\naudience responding to all the characters from the previous films are\nnow featured together as one \"big family\" and working together as a\nteam to do this last job. This films got it all, comedy action thrill\nsuspense, muscle and guns and girls in next to nothing washing\nbeautiful cars, i mean seriously can anything top that? watch and see,\nyet another must see film and will rock your night at the cinema.\n"
"\nGreat action scenes, destroyed cars and mayhem. These words describe\nthe movie best. More or less you know what's gonna happen at the end\nbut there are key facts that this movie is a successor. The direction\nof the film is great, even in the most unrealistic scenes you can feel\nthe tense in which case you feel certain that you're actually\nphysically there. I think that the fun part begins on the second half\nof the movie. And of course I must not forget to mention the epic fight\nbetween Luke Hobbs \"The Rock\" &amp; Vin Diesel \"XXX\". (I wish Luke Hobbs\nwore less Sun Tanning Lotion &amp; Baby-Oil. A personal remark to Mr Hobbs:\n\"You look too shiny dude.. relax!! We know you got muscles!\"). Besides\nsome minor mistakes and some bad acting I think that this movie is\nworth watching.\n"
"\nI've seen all the others so I was expecting nothing more and possibly\nless. I was not disappointed. Action, action and more action, YES!\nActing, direction, story, ehh. Who cares: they destroyed more cars in\n60 seconds than I ever thought possible. The Rock was in top physical\ncondition compared to a flabby and fast aging Vin Diesel. The brawl was\nso darkly shot that I suppose they could have been naked mud wrestling\nand nobody would have been the wiser.<br><br>Overall, fast and fun. Do not expect ANYONE to win ANY awards for\nANYTHING that happened here; just let it flow over you. BTW, are foley\nartists retarded? Beer in a bottle being tipped back for a drink does\nnot sound like a half-filled bottle of water being inverted. And, not\nevery motion has to have some artificial sound effect attached to it.\nMuch more satisfying is the slight sucking sound as the bottle leaves\nthe lips and a mild belch following. Pullleeez.<br><br>Ciao, babies.\n"
"\nThe expectation is always great when is a film in the franchise F&amp;F.\nAll previous films were great, could not be different with \"Fast 5\".\nYeah, it has many unrealistic scenes, but what makes this movie good\nare these exaggerated as the final scenes, where Brian and Don hold a\nmulti-ton safe in their cars. The performances were great, as always,\nand the soundtrack is another great thing in the film. One of the few\nthings I dislike in the plot was this not to be the last film in the\nfranchise. Had a great end. But instead, we find something else to make\na new movie. A good idea with the return of a character lost, but that\ncould have been discarded. With a few races, forget it if expected a\nmovie full of speed as 2 Fast 2 Furious. But for fans, it's a good\nchance to see three movie stars in action in a single movie.\n"
"\nAfter I have read all the positive international reviews I thought this\nmust be a real action movie and above all the best one of this\nfranchise. But I was wrong because in my opinion there were only three\ngreat respectable scenes with full of adrenaline. The remaining story\nwas too long. The running time could have been reduced at maximal 95\nminutes. There were dialogs where I felt nearly asleep. The characters\nand actors didn't convince me. Then I missed a fresh and intelligent\nstory with intriguing, mysterious or adventure elements to take me\ndefinitely on a great ride in Rio. The story is so simply sticked as in\nThe Expendables or Swordfish. That's why this movie is far away from\nblockbusters such as DIE HARD, TERMINATOR, JAMES BOND or THE BOURNE\nIDENTITY series. I am so disappointed and I won't give another chance\nin future. Too overrated on IMDb. My vote is slow five out of ten.\n"
"\nI must ask was Vin Diesel on some kind of drugs while he was filming\nthis? Seriously, every time he appeared on screen he looked like he\ncould use a nap. Maybe he realized how bad this is and did not want to\ngive an effort.<br><br>I enjoyed 1 and 2nd FnF and did not watch rest of them except this last\none.<br><br>Except for few funny scenes and Dwayne Johnson rest is plain crap.\nNothing is consistent. Pretty much like Transformers 3. You simply jump\nfrom one scene in no particular order and that is annoyance.<br><br>Supporting cast is completely obnoxious and that was not easy to\nachieve.<br><br>Don't bother to watch as I can not with describing how bad it is any\nlonger.\n"
"\nFF5 is a real thrill a minute ride - and given that it's over 2 hours\nlong - it never flags or loses it's way for a moment. There's less\nracing and more action in this one and it could well be the best of the\nseries - intelligent, fun, exciting, and even some heart, this really\ndoes have it all - and it a great guys' popcorn movie.<br><br>The action takes place in Rio - and after corrupt cops and the FBI all\nstart chasing our heroes they decide to go for one last big score both\nfor the money and revenge.<br><br>Honestly, this is entertaining action, and an absolute knock-out of a\nmovie - don't let the fact that this is the 5th installment fool you -\nthis is full-blown with a real budget and action stars - all in all a\ntruly entertaining movie.\n"
"\nOnly watching four movies a year at the theaters now, I went to see\nthis movie out of my vestigial interest in fast cars left over after\nyears of owning sports cars and fast cars...<br><br>The plot line is pretty much just an excuse for insane chase scenes\nthat defy the laws of physics and just all the other laws out there.<br><br>The target audience will enjoy the movie, but this movie did not really\nbring anything new to the table as far as the cars, it brings in cast\nmembers from the previous sequels and does'nt even try to explain the\nconnections. <br><br>Besides these little quibbles, I have never seen a movie where they\nused so little actual real natives. They only used Rio as a backdrop\nand huge set, clearing the streets almost completely for all the\nscenes. <br><br>But now that I think about it, that was the way all of the movies have\nbeen made. Tokyo drifts main Japanese protagonists were all either\nmixed or Korean!\n"
"\nWaatching the previous F&amp;F movies !i Thought this movie dint live up to\nexpectation. They tried to get all the old stars but many of them look\nquite old. And seriously dint have the tedious race sequences as it was\nmore abut robbery....!!! Whatever it sure is good in terms of the\nattitude and the final sequence of chase is simply awesome. Especially,\nloved it when the truck right in between the road to surprise its true\nreason for being on roads. Sure is worth a watch. Among all the\nprevious F&amp;F movies, i guess the \"Tokyo Drift\" is the best of movies I\nhave ever watched. Find it really hard for any of the movies to come\nclose to that. I guess the next part of the movie they should pick up\nsome of the latest model and told something about the latest car. In\nfact, they should bring in those Aston Martins, Bugatis, Formula-1\ncars, allthose re completely missing. If you watch Transporter-series,\nthey focused so much on the car, even F&amp;F needs something more &amp; abit\nextra X-factore :)\n"
"\nthis is for you! <br><br>Great car scenes and fights! Okay story line and BEAUTIFUL shots of Rio\nde Janeiro throughout. See one of the world's most picturesque cities\nfrom a vantage point not often seen.<br><br>The final \"chase scene\" is one to behold, as a large vault is dragged\nthough the streets and the last twist makes it all memorable. <br><br>If you tend to not like the nonsensical and unbelievable look for\nanother movie, but as I said IF action is what you seek, go see Fast\nFive! It's also good if you're familiar with the storyline from it's\nprevious releases and be prepared for Fast Six!\n"
"\nIf You've seen the trailer, this review won't spoil anything: There is\na car chase in the end, but if you feel it kinda drags on I will tell\nwhy I felt that.<br><br>In an usual police chase the policemen needs to catch on first and then\nthere is constant pressure from their side to knock you out. But in\nFast Five I felt that after first destroyed vehicle the cops needed to\nspend another 5 seconds to even hit the runners. After that police car\ngets destroyed, another 10 seconds till they are near: Not constant\ndanger of doing a wrong turn and being busted.<br><br>In contrast to what they give us in trailers: Few seconds for police to\narrive and then constant mayhem. Tho a lot of car crashes is quite\nexpensive only for one minute, you need to put some effort to make it a\nfive minutes worth car chase.\n"
"\nI loved this movie, it was exciting and constantly surprised you. I\nthink Vin is gorgeous and Brian and Mia are such a cute couple! My\nboyfriend and I couldn't figure out which movie it was where the chick\nshot the guy in his penis. I'm pretty sure it was fast five but I don't\nremember. i do have one question that i need answered for this debate,\ni tried looking it up online and nothing helped. in the scene where\nDominic and Brian, and Mia are running from the cops didn't agent Hobbs\nagent chick (elena Pataky) shoot some guys and one in the penis???\nplease help, my email is hello_nurse16@hotmail.com thanks!!!!!!!!!!!!\nWho else thought this was the best fast movie yet? the end is what made\nme sooo excited for the 6th one!\n"
"\nI watched the movie few days ago and I enjoyed it very much. The\nstoryline, casting, directing and more specially the team of stars in\nthe previous fasts. In fact, all stars in the previous parts play their\nrole in this part (sometime very short) and gathering such a group of\nactors in a sequel is unique after \"Godfather 3\".<br><br>The story is a little different with previous parts and this time, the\nmovie is more similar to movies like \"Italian job\". However the\nstoryline is really interesting and it causes you forget the time. I\ngive 9 because I think that some part of the movie is not very logical\n(like stealing the police cars scene).<br><br>Generally I suggest the movie to every racing movies lover and moreover\naction movies.\n"
"\nI watched Thor last weekend. A comic book movie with other universes,\nand I think there are more plot devices in Fast Five that requires the\naudience to suspend logic than there are in Thor! <br><br>Not trying to do a spoiler post here, so I won't go in to them. Its the\nkind of big action, big Ka-pow movie that the audience doesn't want to\nget bogged down in the details on if they just want to have fun.\n(Where's all the money for stuff coming from, how'd that car do that,\nfederal agents really have that on their computers, very rich criminals\nwould really do that?) Ha. <br><br>Don't sweat the details and its a good movie to romp around with.\n"
"\nThe action was awesome, the cars were incredible, and it had a great\nstoryline! There was character development. There were twists. There\nwas some predictably, but that is to be expected. However, I don't\nthink anyone saw the awesome twist at the end! I also really liked the\nfalling action after the climax.<br><br>Most of the characters from the other movies were in here and played\nimportant roles. There was even a new big character. <br><br>And of course the ending was awesome, while still leaving an opening\nfor a sequel.<br><br>Especially if you are a \"car guy\", you have to see this movie.\n"
"\nThe Fast and the Furious was Oh My God! FnF: New Model Original Parts\nwas AMAZIN. If this is true with you, get set for a more pumpin\nadrenaline session. The movie focuses on Dom, cars and action but in an\nall together different way. With the backdrop of Rio De Janeiro, it\nfeels needed to add a kick ass character and so comes Dwayne Johnson.\nDwayne is like a different spice in the movie and that too so damn\neasily.<br><br>A superb hell crazy film, you would love to watch it back to back. And\nplease be seated after you are over with many OMG moments, as when you\nare done with the movie........BOOOOOOM! comes a surprise after the\ncredits roll up (This is really the cherry over the cake).<br><br>You love cars, you love them in action and finally if you love watchin\na hardcore manly film, this is your take.<br><br>Go Fast and buy yourself a ticket to epinephrine.\n"
"\nFor those of us who watched all of the Fast and the Furious series,\nsimply the thought of having most of the main characters from the past\neditions in one movie is a valid reason to pay. The result is just what\nwe expect of a Fast and Furious: stunts, rides and babes. The\natmosphere of Rio is a refreshing alternative to American centered\nfilming. However, ultimately, the film goes over the top. By telling\nthe story through the view of the (not that) good guys, the bad guys,\nand, also, a third perspective, that of a team of elite FBI agents led\nby \"The Rock\", time worthy of boiling oil and pumping adrenaline is\nlost. Instead, we get more of the sit-at-home work-out-plan kind of\nscenes that are often unnecessary. Nevertheless, a true fan of cars and\naction will find Fast Five very enjoyable.\n"
"\nExcellent movie with as expected Great Hip Hop Music. The movie was\npretty much up to the mark. Sexy Cars, Hot Chicks and a full fledge\naction pack; what else can you think about such titles.Loved the movie\nas a whole. Got a little bored in middle but climax was just\noutstanding, this movie is in a sequel to the previous F&amp;F. Vin diesel\nas usual rocks, \"The Rock\" added a lot of spice to action. Guess What;\nVin got a new girl friend. The best piece i liked was Dodge cars all\nover the movie and the best flick was when these guys actually stole\nthe whole bank out of the building and tossing the traffic with that\nsafe. GReat Idea...!\n"
"\nGreat movie but didn't close up to the expectations. As usual the base\ncast was great. Vin Diesel was awesome as expected. The rock was\nrocking in the movie, his character matched his true personality. As in\nthe previous movies stunts performed were mind boggling and full of\nthrill, can't wait do do them myself. Cool and solid cars as in\nprevious movies. Chicks wearing bikinis and riding hot bikes. Has some\nirrelevant superman fighting sequences but what about it every movie\nneeds it. Good casting everyone fits well in their characters. Full of\nawesome stunts from the start to the end. One can never fall asleep\nwhile watching such a movie. The heist plot is very difficult to\npredict till the end which keeps your mind on the movie and not on the\nchick on the next seat. Full of thrills and twists. Not the best of\nFast And Furious, seen better but still a must watch as the previous\nflicks...\n"
"\nthis is best one of the franchise, the action is just in your face. I\nonly saw the first two Fast and the Furious sequels. I didn't see the\n3rd or the 4th. But when I saw trailer to this, I knew it was a film\nnot to be missed, and I was right.<br><br>Dominic(Vin Diesel), Brian(Paul Walker), and Mia(Jordana Brewster)\nhatch a plan for the perfect heist, they put together a team, and map\nout the plan, but it gets short sided when a enforcement agent(Dwayne\nThe Rock Johnson) is hot on there trail, and he and his team will stop\nat nothing till they bring down Dominic and his team down. but will\nthey? <br><br>In all these movies the shiny cars become a character themselves. The\naction is ten times intense then ever, it has awesome chase scenes. Not\nto mention an awesome confrontation between Vin Diesel and Dwayne The\nRock Johnson, watching those two muscle bound action stars slug it out\non film, is like a dream come true. like I said you'll get what you\npaid for.\n"
"\nThis movie is pure fantasy and rush that logic does not apply. I always\nliked the original the best so I would peg this as the second best in\nthe series. This is a definitely a must movie for fans of this genre.\nAfter the movie when the credits are playing, there was a cameo scene\nwith Eva Mendez with the Dwayne Johnson at FBI headquarters talking\nabout a robbery using cars. <br><br>He was not interested because Toretto was not involved but Mendez told\nJohnson that he needed to take a second look because a security camera\ncaught the picture of Michelle Rodriquez as one of the robbers who was\nkilled in the fourth movie of this series. This sets up another movie\nand most people missed this because they left when the credits were\nplaying.\n"
"\nThere is a blooper in the movie - \" The villain used his right hand as\na key to open the vault in the police station when he went to check out\nhis money but the girl took the impression of his left hand when she\nmet him at the beach and sit on his lap she had her left hand running\non her back not the right hand.<br><br>Since we know that impressions of both the hands are not alike for any\nhuman being there is no way they could have used it for opening the\nlocker.<br><br>Very small but a very silly mistake but when you are making such a high\nprofile movie need to be extra careful.\n"
"\nI'll give it a 3 out of 10 for at least showing something that was\nvisually pleasing. But other than that it was complete garbage. Lets\nput of team of people that are already wealthy to act out as criminal\nmasterminds that want a lifetime lumpsum of money for multiple people.\nThis movie was one of those, \"stop making these\" movies. The actions\nscenes in these movies were less believable than Die hard or Charlie's\nAngels full throttle. The writing and directing tried to make a super\nmovie by bringing everyone back from the first and second to play in\nthis movie. If you don't believe me on how Ludicrous this movie is (no\npun intended). Prepare for the Fast and Furiuous 6 introduction at the\nend of this one. It might make you want to stab your eyes out.\n"
"\nI don't even know if we can call it cinema. This is full of cliché\n(sex, money, women, big cars, muscles, American imperialism etc..) and\naction scenes totally surrealistic. And once again the Americans think\nthey can go in a foreign country and rule as if they were back home. I\nmean by that when the American police crew, led by the Rock, arrive in\nBrazil they behave like they have jurisdiction and an authority\nthere... They come in and talk like xxxx to the Brazilian police and\nstart giving orders all around (in a foreign country, like if it's even\nremotely possible). Only Americans can like this kind of thing and not\nfind it suspicious. I'm not even gonna start with the actions scenes or\nthe scenario which are like bad science fiction or I could write 10\npages. Anyway, I put 3 stars because there is some humor and if you\nreally don't know what to do, you can waste 2 hours watching this with\nfriends to have a good laugh (not only at the jokes but at the movie\noverall).\n"
"\nThis movie is the best among all the 'Fast ant furious' series... <br><br>It has got great action, comedy.. But its Vin Diesel, Dwayne Johnson\nand Paul Walker who steals the show.. Not much races they got in the\nmovie as I had expected but what they got is really amazing.. The\nclimax is the most amazing part in the movie... <br><br>They do it so brilliantly and smartly... Its just amazing... Must watch\nfor all the F&amp;F fans.. Your are gonna love this one....!!!!<br><br>I enjoyed the movie right from the start to the end.. Its really\nfreaking insanity.. I hadn't expected so much from this movie, but it\nwas a surprise how the movie turned out to be...<br><br>I just loved Vin Diesel and Dwayne Johnson, they were so awesome..\nPeople here in India didn't stop whistling when their intro scene came\nup.. I just enjoyed the movie and so did my friends...<br><br>In short, it's a movie that shouldn't be missed... So go and watch it..\nIts way FAST and way FURIOUS...\n"
"\nMy opinion.. This movie was so bad!! Not worth 1 star.. If it wasn't\nfor all the sexualizing of women and all the girls in revealing clothes\nwalking around zooming in on girls it may have been a half decent\nmovie, anorexic looking girls in skimpy outfits half the movie is all\nabout.. It just doesn't do it for me.. It's just wrong.. If you they\nneed to use that much crap in it for it to get ratings well it mustn't\nbe that good.. I thought it was awful!!!I can't wait to see a movie\nwhere they have guys walking around in G Strings the whole time..\nZooming up on their privates.. You almost never see that.. It's just\ngetting tiring.. It definitely could have been better without the\ngirls!!\n"
"\nTerrible movie. <br><br>It's true that it had some nice action scenes, specially the last chase\nscene. But the plot was weak. A lack of care for the Brazilian\naudience. <br><br>Some of the facts of the past of Brazil were not accurate. How about\nthat train scene? Was it supposed to happen in Brazil? We DON'T have\ndeserts or that kind of train here!! <br><br>Further, most of the actors who were supposed to be Brazilians were\neither Americans or Hispanics. They had a really weird Portuguese\naccent. Sometimes, we Portuguese speakers needed subtitles to\nunderstand what they were saying. <br><br>Although the Portuguese of Jordana Brewster is perfect, non-Portuguese\nspeakers won't notice the differences. As well as those who know\nnothing about Brazil. <br><br>Unfortunately, this movie rate will remain as high as it.\n"
"\nWith faster Cars, hot girls, great action sequences, the return of many\ncharacters from the previous versions of the franchise, Vin Diesel vs\nThe Rock Dwayne Johnson-the two big bald heads of Hollywood going at\neach other in the back drop of gritty, narrow streets of Brazil-this\nfifth movie of the franchise had all the ingredients to make this the\nbest one in the series.<br><br>But unfortunately it is let down by a poor story and poorer acting by\nsurprisingly everyone in the cast (except for the cars, of course).\nThere has been an attempt to intentionally make every scene too tense\nand every dialogue a \"one liner\", which wasn't necessary.<br><br>But, with the basic essence of the movie(the cars, the chases &amp; great\naction) still retained, fans of the franchise will still love it.\nOverall, this movie still makes a pleasant viewing and is definitely\nbetter than the previous version.\n"
"\nAs you should know before you read more I only rate movies 1 or 10. So\npass on this one, there are many other films like this that things blow\nup there is a silly plot twist at the end like two safes yes it was\nsilly and it could not save a pathetic film. All the cops in Brazil are\nless corrupt then the ones in the good old USA. What are you crazy? I\nsaw fast five and the steroid actors from USA were way better than all\nthe crooked Brazilins with Spanish accents so thick that I, I had a\nflash back thing all the Nazis have British ascents but the British\nfought the Nazis and the Americans only came in at the end of the war\nafter all the money was gone in selling to the Nazis. Well the dumbest\nthing about the film is the Cars try out driving a Caraochi in Rio you\nmay as well speak Paulistia Portuguse. The film is a waste of film and\nso full of bull that it can only continue to reinforce a stereotype\nthat is apparent as I ain't no uncle Tom but .................\n"
"\nThe amount of plot holes in this movie make it difficult to classify it\nas an action movie. Much has been written here about the absurdity of\nthe script. Just to give one extra example: sneaking into a police\nstation to examine a safe by blowing up the men's room and breaking a\nman size hole in the wall, and still letting your audience believe it\nwent unnoticed; it is to silly for words. So, I tried to look at it as\na comedy, but it didn't fit either. The only objection I want to add to\nthe list is the way Luke Hobbs shoots a defenceless man begging for\nhelp, even though he is the bad guy in this movie. I know, it's the\nAmerican fairytale, the good guys shoot the bad guys and everybody\nlives happily ever after, but this is the glorification of brutal\nmurder. You can't do that, not even in silly movies like this.\n"
"\nOK, OK, I'll be honest, I haven't seen this one, but what does that\nmatter? I saw the \"Fast &amp; the Furious,\" &amp; then, thanks to friends I saw\n\"2 Fast, 2 Furious\" &amp; outside of the cast change, I thought I was\nwatching the same movie.<br><br>You know, the same movie.<br><br>The one with Nick Cage \"Gone in 60 Seconds.\" No, I'm joking, \"Gone in\n60 Seconds\" was a lot better.<br><br>I think I missed a few, the next one I saw was \"Tokyo Drift.\" It was\nreally \"The Fast &amp; the Furious,\" only in Japan, with a slightly\ndifferent cast.<br><br>Any way you look at it, if you have seen one you have honestly seen\nthem all. And if you have an IQ above 80, you probably hate them as\nmuch as I do.<br><br>So just re-watch the first one five times. You won't know the\ndifference.\n"
"\nI'm not upset that people make movies this horrible. I'm upset that I\ntrusted IMDb with a 7.3 rating and managed to waste an hour+ of my life\nwatching this piece of crap movie. I'm embarrassed for those of you\nthat enjoy films like this, unless of course you are 12 years old or\nyounger. In that case, please don't try to drive like these people when\nyou get your license.

"\nWhat a movie this was!!!!! I watched it and now its scenes are not\ngetting out of my mind. This movie has everything unlike other remakes\nwere not having that much as they would have expected. But this one\nwill surprise you all. It has speed n cars for which fast &amp; furious\nseries is known. Along with this it has the perfect story, twists &amp;\nturns. And if I talk about action that this movie has got so much in\nit. Jonathon was great in his role n all others played their roles very\nwell. So don't waste your time in reading reviews just go and watch\nthis movie. It will take you on a long ride of excitement and fun ;)...\nand do not forget to vote this movie after watching it because these\nkind of movies deserves you votes and love both.\n"
"\nI went into this movie with big expectations with Vin Diesel &amp; The Rock\nin it. This movie surpassed my expectations by A LOT. Simply put, this\nmovie is AWESOME. I saw this movie at 11 PM at night and when I got out\nI was so pumped up to do...anything.<br><br>This movie has a GOOD story. GREAT scenes. GREAT actions. I really\nenjoyed this movie, and I'm a picky one.<br><br>My favorite movie since the first one..and I actually think this may\nhave been even better.<br><br>GO SEE THIS MOVIE NOW. IF YOU ARE THINKING ABOUT IT, GO! It will be\nworth it..I rated it 10/10. I can't imagine anyone rating it less then\na 7.5 and that would be weird to me.\n"
