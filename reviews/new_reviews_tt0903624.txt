the lord of the rings trilogy has always been heavy reading a very somber story
but the hobbit is much lighter reading and quite humorous
consequently when i saw the movie i thought i was watching an extension of the lotr movies
yes it had a few humorous scenes but the overall feel of the movie was heavy and somber
and i dont remember radagast having bird dung running down the side of his head in the book
i also felt that the overthetop gross depiction of the orc king was not in keeping with the book
i think that mr
jackson missed the mark with this movie
the book was fun for me the movie wasnt
i am so disappointed in this movie i probably will not purchase it when it comes out in video
saw the hobbit last night and was very disappointed
having read the hobbit amp lotr in the 70s and reread a couple of times since i really enjoyed lotr because they were as true as possible to the books
in my opinion the hobbit couldnt be further from the book
the book was written for children
yes theres battle and violence in the book but not on the scale of the movie
if anything the movie is darker than the three lotr movies
the movie also take liberties with the story
i dont remember thorins grudge match with the head goblin
it just makes if more violent and darker
lotr movie came out i looked forward to each new one
i have no desire to see the last two hobbit movies even when theyre offered in the local library
i have read and reread the tolkein books many times over the years
i enjoyed the lotr films despite numerous niggles and looked forward to the hobbit with great anticipation
unfortunately it turned out to be a laboured tedious mess
it has been severely stretched to make a trilogy and as happens far too often the filmmakers have arrogantly decided that hey know better than the author and made arbitrary tweaks that lessen the story
with lotr i felt that the changes would make no difference for a newcomer to the story and were not enough to spoil it for a confirmed fan like myself
unfortunately i cannot say the same for the hobbit
both my wife and i persevered through the film and ended up determined to avoid the second and third films at all costs
i was intriguedyet concernedto see producer peter jackson resurrecting the same cast of characters some ten years later to work on the hobbit
i was even more concerned to behold that jackson intended to stretch the hobbit out to three overlong films particularly since tolkiens original work measures a scant 200 pages or so compared to 1100 pages for lord of the rings
my concern was borne out when i suffered through the hobbit an unexpected journey
why does bilbo not even meet golluman episode that occurs early in the bookuntil the picture is threefourths over
answer jackson had to inject umpteen largely irrelevant tales from tolkiens silmarillion to flesh out the picture combined with rather unimpressive cgi animation folks weve seen it all before
where is the reasonably exciting certainly entertaining episode where the dwarfs are captured by the giant spiders
answer i guess we have to wait until the sequelor even the threequel
this is commercialist greed at its worst
some may like it some may not but tolkien its definitely not
far too long drawn out and boring
i actually got up and walked away for a bit to get some fresh air then came back and watched the rest
the story is from a small book yet they have drawn it out into 3 movies at 3 hours each and the story really suffers as a result
like what were they thinking except money money money
i understand why the lord of the rings trilogy was well a trilogy because it is based off 3 books
i am a childhood fan of the books but i will not waste my time on the next two movies as they have ruined the whole series in my eyes
i am just going to have to pretend this movie didnt exist for my own sanity
please if you are a fan of the books or the lord of the rings trilogy do not waste your time on this poor movie
i thought this movie was so bad much like jacksons king kong was really bad
it was so overlong that i sat in the movie theater and pondered when it would end
i will most certainly not see the rest of series
i know that if jackson had followed the book with some adaptation changes to keep the continuity with lotr in check like the rivendell sequence and made a two hour movie adaptation i would be very happy
considering that the original book wasnt a great masterpiece like lotr was a single movie would be the best
it seems like that jackson was so preoccupied with subplots that he lost his way with the main plot again like with king kong
this was simply a bad overlong movie made by a now very pretentious film maker
on the whole it wouldnt be bad but the original story is vanishing in the flood of fight scenes
and its way too much
of course i understand that they want to make three time as much money with 3 movies instead of a really good and pure one
in the original story fight is not emphasized at all only a few page from the novel
on the other hand i like the cast and the their acting
no problem with that
i hate this and this is why i gave 1 out of 10
and i wont watch the other two parts no way
it is very sad because i like this story very much but simply i just cant watch other 6 hours of massive fight in a movie which not supposed to be an action movie
this is not going to be one of those long reviews consisting of detailed writings about what was good or wrong that is for you to decide once it hits the cinemas
all i am saying to you is that you should definitely find some time and read the book before you go and see the movie
book is very complex sometimes hard to keep up with but has a bit more ambient depth into it while the movie offers you all the eyecandy that even your imagination wouldnt be able to conjure
the movie is pretty well acted and has a good script that sticks to what was in the book but much less detailed well it is a movie so thats normal
this movie is not enough to understand everything behind the hobbit and the story behind it but it does give a nice illustrative try to simplify things
i am a huge movie buff and also a huge lord of the rings fan
so when i heard that director peter jackson was finally directing the hobbit i immediately ordered my ticket
i went to see this movie in imax which made my viewing experience all the more fun
everything in this movie was perfect
in my opinion it followed the book so well
i loved the fact that peter put thorins enemy azog in the film even though his name was only mentioned once in the book
this made it all the more exciting
i am a huge gollum fan so when bilbo stumbled upon him in the goblin tunnels i got goosebumps
it was hilarious when the two took part in riddles in the dark
all in all this movie was absolutely amazing
im so excited to go see the second installment the hobbit the desolation of smaug
after being blown away by the beauty majesty and magic of jackons lotr trilogy i kept waiting and hoping for a fantastic hobbit movie
sadly not to happen
the best parts of the book particularly the exceptionally humorous bits with the trolls and beorn get truncated and even changed
same with the addition of an elfdwarf love story
what is up with that i have to wonder
still there are some nice interweaving of threads from the silmarillion
also tolkien filled the hobbit with songs
where are they here
with the exception of the opening at bilbos home the music gets relegated to the closing titles
all in all most disappointed in this effort and the final chapter in this hobbit trilogy of films too
the new characters are not as 3 dimensional
i didnt find myself really caring about them
some of the dwarfs are muppetlike and goofy in how they looked
too much computer animation of which was not well done especially with the forest creators and the main bad guy
they tried too hard to stay true to the original characters and in doing so some of them were too wooden or two dimensional
the humour wasnt the same it was more silly or ridiculous than fun and purposeful
there were some repeated actions or catch lines from the trilogy
i guess i hoped for the same indepth characters and attention to detail and high standards that was in the trilogy
it simply wasnt there in the hobbit
i grew up reading and rereading and loving the hobbit and the lord of the rings
i enjoyed jacksons trilogy but i think hobbit has suffered greatly in the translation from book to screen
the scene with bilbo the burglartobe at bag end and the dwarfs rivals the approach to the enterprise star trek the motion picture 1979 for being unnecessarily interminable
the escape sequence cave of the misty mountain goblins is so unrealistic that it becomes a ridiculous caricature of something out of indiana jones
to add insult to injury it is only part i of iii
youve got to be kidding
the hobbit is all of about 300 pages versus nearly 1500 pages for the trilogy
this is simply gross moneymongering at the expense of the audiences
sorry i love tolkiens the hobbit just not the hobbit movie
i loved the original trilogy
but this was so disappointing
i bought for my wife for xmas
we both were looking forward to watching it
i must have fallen asleep 3 times and each time i woke up i was gutted to see the film was still on
this surely is a cash cow franchise now
boring
slow
pointless
the detailanimationcgi was amazing as you would expect
but it felt like i was being told the story in slow motion
the first 30 mins of the film set the standard
i wanted to turn off at this point
im so angry i bought and sat through this rubbish
hopefully this review will prevent someone else from suffering
after watching this movie i just couldnt wait to see the sequelwhich at the time i didnt know if there was going to be one and was filled with amazementthe good kind
even though it was rather dark and brooding it was actually very interesting in the fact that most of those kind of movies are not very good at all
i liked it also because of martin freeman who is one of my favorite british actors
its special effects where god as well with the battle scenes and scenes with giant creatures and stuff
after watching at night was actually really cool because it was kinda scary as far as the whats right outside my door
theory due to the ogres and things
so if youre looking for a good intense movie that doesnt have any junk in it this is the one
ok not a complete miss but it was not what i was led to believe it was going to be
all day yesterday i was reading reviews on here praising this film as being one of the best of this year in my opinion this was leaning more toward the worstwell not worst more like not living up to expectations
this is far from being on the same level as the lor trilogy which i am a huge fan of
im not sure if peter jackson was aiming at a younger target audience for this film but thats how i felt the entire 169 min
if i were him i would have shorten this film up and spiced it up with more realistic violence and lost the comic feel to all of the fighting
just wait till you see the goblin king fight smh
but like i said being a fan i had to see it but i was expecting more
what a perfectly awful movie
sadly the folks that put together this mess had the opportunity to take one of the greatest tales ever told and bring it to life via film
what a failure
first they changed the story
second they left out the best parts and added a bunch of nonsense that doesnt fit
add in some truly dreadful performances scenes that are simply stupid and you have a terrible film
ok ill admit i went to see this film in 3d when it first came out and i had very very high expectations of the hobbit i loved lotr so much i probably watched it more than 10 times i also played the hobbit game so had an idea of what was to come i think it was just too slow for me and the story was a bit over the top a dragon has taken over our mountain we must get it back just leave the damn mountain it just lacked what lotr had the sequels were better though but none the less i think these three films were a good starter for probably the best trilogy ive seen so if you are like me and are a hard core lotr fan id recommend watching it with a bit of caution for first you might even like it a lot more and wonder why i criticized it
an unexpected abomination of a classic
if you read the book or not doesnt actually matter because most of this film is asides made up sub plots extra characters and other awfulness
massive shifting of characters from believable to unrecognisable seems to be the norm here
one boring action set piece after another actual plot is something you dont even dare dream about
hard to believe this is the man that fans demanded to direct the films i think even michael bay would have been a better choice and more faithful to the source material
after shouting for the hundred time when does this happen in the book
i suddenly felt a calm descend over me and realised this is not the story of a hobbit who goes on a journey and finds his courage this is the story of a great of director who went on a journey and gets seduced by money churning out awful cash in prequels like this for ever more
george lucas disease strikes again peter jackson rip
contains spoilers the film of course in personal opinion was too lengthy and dry
then action when it happened was too quick paced and underchoreographed
additionally the film had in some places over animated graphics which looked very phony and ruined any chance at realistic graphics that the movie had
then when picked up by the giant birds it is easily noticed how horrid the feather texture was
in 3d animation a texture is the image applied to the surface of an object
then at the ending of the movie it cuts out the battle with smaug only for making a sequel which should have been just put in this movie with less of the dry pointless time consumed in the beginning
to tell the truth if i had watched it in theaters when it first came out i would have demanded a refund for my ticket because of the ending
but the cinematography besides plot and digital graphics was rather good
just for that it has 4 stars
but no more
okay this movie is plain bad
im not saying this because im a fanboy even though i am im saying this because its just bad
whats wrong with it
well theres a lot of things
im going to try to express what is wrong with this movie without spoiling it
1there should only be one movie not three
i say this because the hobbit isnt that long of a book
my copy is 306 pages
i know that peter jackson used material from tolkiens notes but that is the kind of thing that should only be in an extended edition
but instead it makes up the almost the whole movie
the general plot of the movie is the same as the book
there just isnt enough material to make three movies
2this movie is too long
this movie is so long and stretched out that it makes it hard to watch
this movie didnt need to be 3 hours long especially because nothing happens except for bilbo leaves he finds the ring and they all fight goblins
there are problems beyond this but if you want to really know them see the movie
i recommend this movie only to hardcore fans of the series
overly long with nothing much happening for long periods
the pace of the film was pedantic at best and i found myself losing interest quite easily
when the action parts started they were very good and entertaining its just the bits in between that had me nodding off
i gave it 5  10 but the action parts are good so 8 10 for the action parts alone
the overall 5  10 is because it was slow in telling the story
like avatar i was expecting great things and came out of the cinema in a so so frame of mind but were avatar copied the core in regard to unobtainium and had the ending like the lion king and circle of life and all that this film has at least left me optimistic about the sequel
as a massive fan of the lord of the rings saga and reader of all the books i must say i was very disappointed with this new film
lacks all the good stuff that made the book one of my favourites back when i was a teenager and hinders all peter jacksons good work in the previous films
it looks to me more as a film for twilight fans than anything else plain childish and overall predictable in gags and action
shame
im pretty sure tolkien would have not enjoyed the adaptation this time
lets see what happens with the next two films though my expectations are already quite low and i still dont understand the need of exploiting one book into a new trilogy
marketing versus quality
in one of the making of
interviews for lord of the rings peter jackson pointed out that this movie really needs to be made by someone who understands special effects otherwise the special effects can easily overwhelm the story im paraphrasing and then did exactly that in the hobbit
in the lord of the rings tolkiens tale ruled supreme and the special effects were in their proper place
in this one tolkiens story is revised and pushed aside by the special effects
in lord of the rings live actors are used as much as possible even with gollum whereas in this one computer graphics seem to be preferred
i think the introduction of a new character as the main antagonist is especially heavyhanded
to peters credit it was probably a doomed project from the first
lord of the rings was a pseudosequel to the hobbit and the 2 books are entirely different in character
the lord of the rings is a dark dramatic adult epic
the hobbit was a whimsical childs fairytale
but the screen wont have it
i was truly disappointed by this movie although i could have seen it coming based on the decision to split up this short story in tree 3hour movies
slow is the word to describe the first half although very childish also comes to mind especially comparing to the lotr movies
the second half is just too much 3d actionoverkill without any storyline whatsoever
there is really no excitement in the movie at all but maybe this is because you truly do not connect with the main characters except maybe for thorin
i was really hoping for bilbo to get slaughtered brutelessly by one of the nazgul after the first half our although fair to say his acting did improve a bit later on in the movie
anyway sorry but the current 84 rating is really not justified
excellent
this is the first fantastic film ive ever watched
i havent watched lord of the rings
okay okay dont hit me
yes i havent watched but neither i nor my friends have watched
this shame isnt only for me
i have friends to be shown with fingers of a hand btw
i have a few friends
some people say lord of the rings should be watched before the hobbit
i dont agree with them
the hobbit comes before i mean this all thing starts at the hobbit
the hobbit is before
if you watch the hobbit before lord of the rings youll understand better
i love martin freeman
i love the film series
after i write this review im gonna watch the desolation of smaug
the cgi is great in this movie
the problem is in some cases they are not very believable
the dwarfs fall several stories in one scene if it had been in real life the characters would have all died yet not one of them even got a broken arm or leg
in several scenes the dwarfs are near death and most surely going to die and bam all of the sudden they are fighting back and winning against all odds
many of the special effects are way beyond belief to actually be able to happen
i know this is a fantasy but they need to scale back the cgi a little
i kept saying to myself wow this looks great but its unrealistic
other movies with cgi are doing the same thing
how about less cgi and more acting with emotions
this is why this movie did not win an oscar
at least the cgi was very detailed and life like
yes spend the money to make the special effects as great as possible but in a realistic possible way
i saw the movie as special effect scene after special effect scene with some actors acting edited between them
i still like the movie but it could have been much better
in this movie a wizard gandalf the gray asks a hobbit bilbo to join him in an adventure
bilbo refuses so gandalf marks a symbol on bilbos door
later in evening many dwarfs and gandalf gathered in his home for a group meeting
i think this is a perfect movie for lord of the rings movie fans
it is a must watch movie for all
the teaser trailer for this movie was the first time i was introduced to the magical world that j
r
r tolkien created
i had very high hopes for it and it exceeded my expectations
nothing can compare to peter jacksons lotr trilogy but there are many things people dont understand about this film
the story does a fantastic job of capturing what the book was about
the visual effects were some of the best i had ever seen especially gollum and the trolls
the only reason i will not give this a perfect 10 is the fact that some lotr characters were pushed into the movie
overall this is a visually stunning fun and great prequel to the lord of the rings
really sad that peter jackson isnt more creative
he basically ruined a perfectly good story by making gandalf the hero
bilbo is the actual hero here but every time he gets into a situation gandalf magically appears
to many added fight scenes and extra story lines with characters that werent even in the book
just another over done movie
i was really sad i spent all that money and time to see it in the theater
if your a true hobbit fan this movie will disappoint
aside from the horrible lack of creativity the adventure is fun
the graphics are good
gollum is awesome and i was stoked about the bilbogollum scene
that was one star worth
the rest of the movie is over done
i think jackson forgot that this is a childs story
the culture today is about shoot them and kill them so if that is what you are into then this movie is for you
enjoy i on the other hand will not see the second installment
overpriced poorly done story telling
sad he ruined a tolkien story probably why he never wanted his books sold out to hollywood to begin with
compared to lotr this is a major disappointment
as one who bought lotr on bluray in their extended editions because of the magnificent quality of the films it is hard for me to accept such a followup effort
the decision to stretch this to 3 films has ruined it
the story plods with nothing more than one action sequence after another tying it together
unfortunately the action sequences are utterly unbelievable with hardly a scratch to show for a battle with thousands or a fall that should kill
there is a line to be drawn between fantasy and a lack of reality and it has not been drawn at all here
the cgi is obviously cgi in many places too which i found frankly puzzling given how well it blended in on lotr
doubtless when all 3 films have been released they will again release an even more pointless extended edition
i earnestly hope some enterprising soul edits these down to the one film it should have been all along
it can only be better
the lord of the rings and the hobbit films are quite frankly the greatest films of alltime
nothing has surpassed them and i do not suspect anything soon will
the world it is set in is so rich so unique and so beautiful that you will often find yourself marveling at the sheer wonder of it all
the set and the locations are incredible and absolutely gorgeous
the characters and writing are superb and they are translated to screen wonderfully
they are all exactly how i imagined them while reading the books
the special effects are the best i have ever seen
the action scenes are amazing but the films does incredible even when it is just people talking
overall they are the greatest films i have ever seen and anyone who has yet to watch them needs to do so immediately
there are very few movie that are better then the lord of the rings movies
this is one of then
all the middle earth movies are great
this movie as a great story line
great acting
great special effects
great visual effects

s need to see more good fantasy movie
and stop carrying so mush about silly childish things like hockey
great movie great movie great movie great movie
see it see it see it see it
it is very scary
it has a lot action
see it see it see it see it see it
great movie great movie great movie great movie
one of the beast prequels ever
a fantasy masterpiece
see it see it see see it see it see it
peter jackson is one of the beast directors
the movie is a bit disappointing
this split in 3 parts seems like a big commercial thing
the rhythm get slower because of this and the movie which is good looses interest
also trolls are not very well made they look like a joke whereas they where really bad asses in the book
compared to the lord of the ring we do not really get into the characters they seems very simple and lots of first degree jokes about all the dwarfs makes it silly
what i did however like  the introduction of golum real nice and scary
best in the movie
i think that this book deserved better and that peter jackson has a bit lowered his standards after the success of the previous movies
bouh
i went to see the hobbit with not much expectation of seeing great story
i already knew that the special effects and imagery would be beyond comparison
the acting would be very highclass
but i got surprise the way the story was told
one can argue that it has many similarities with fellowship of the ring
there are few extra things that was not really needed
such as the troll scene the goblin part was not needed and the mountain scene was not needed
i feel that these scenes slow don the movie a bit
however i really enjoyed the hobbit
it would have been a masterpiece if more consideration was given on the script
now to the thing that compelled me to write this review is the scene between gollum and bilbo
oh my god i got tears in my eyes just before bilbo escape when bilbo pulled the sword
this is what happens when you dont focus enough on character development and have a thin storyline
i was so disappointed but it you never follow up the best trilogy in history with a knockout
highlights of the movie are the new elements but they are few meaning you walk out of this movie wishing you had of just rented it and could stop yawning
firstly the relationships just arent there
unlike the trilogy there is no buddy movie start with mr froddo and sam
no slow building up of the troop and the link from gandalf to bilbo is tenuous
and gandalf is just plonked in the movie without much back story
its hard to care about the characters if they dont really care that much for each other
this prequel pushes the concept of home hard but the writer should have spent more time on the characters and less on assumed knowledge of those involved
the high frame rate version absolutely looks horrible
the sound is awesome
the characters are great
so upset though very disappointed
the motion looks like the characters were moving 1
5 times speed like an old black and white silent film
the action is non stop so it is very hard to tell what the hell is going on
the detail is there but the high frame rate ruined the movie for me
it looks like a cheesy cartoon
like most critics said it looks like a video not a high end film
the story and effects are top notch of course
do not see the gimmicky high frame rate version
what was wrong with 24 fps
waste of 30
wait for the dvd
the 169 minute version of the movie was an opportunity to watch some of the characters from the ring trilogy develop and grow into the what they will be in the later series
we get to see a young bilbo unsure and unchallenged become something more resilient an intrepid
watching the 169 minute movie in a private setting allowed for any number of breaks and rewinds of the movie to catch on scenery and missed dialog
furthermore for a health enthusiast it allowed the opportunity to workout and watch a movie at the same time
the scenery in the movie was breathtaking
sharing the movie with 3 teenagers allowed them to explain and relate parts of the hobbit an unexpected journey to the ring trilogy
good for someone like me who had seen the trilogy series a long time ago and forgotten some of the previous characters

com201312thehobbit unexpectedjourney
html look forward to the hobbit the desolation of smaug
the beginning of the great journey starts with an unexpected visit and expected pleasure for the audience
cast is brilliant you can see that every actor is the embodiment of their characters
martin freeman was born to play bilbo and completely gets the character
the dwarfs are awesome
kili and thorin are the best dwarf characters
the misty mountains melody lets us immerse in the mysterious adventures that are to come
gollum will lead you through a cavern of riddles thorin will fight his own past bilbo finds his courage gandalf calls his eagles at the most right moment and suddenly you forget all the real world around you
regret if you havent seen the movie yet
its awesome and brilliant
