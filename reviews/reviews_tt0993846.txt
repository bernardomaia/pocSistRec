"\nHow can a film this bad costing $100M get past any adult review\nprocess. It seemed like Scorcese and DiCaprio made it for their own\negos -- big budget/Gatsby-level theatrics and face-time respectively.\nDiCaprio does a good job in the role but we all (age range 25 to 65)\nkept waiting for the movie to come to the point. Hours of redundancy of\nplot and gratuitous over use of swearing and sex scenes the message and\ncontext could have been delivered with about sixty percent less: we\nkept waiting for a fatal drug overdose to change the direction of the\nplot and give it some purpose . . We almost walked out a couple of\ntimes but did not and waited for the plot to come to a point. We didn't\nand suffered the full three hours.\n"
"\nCricky, lets start of with saying how long and drawn out this movie\nwas. Gosh 3 hours to sit through watching a porn movie(basically) along\nside drug abuse and lying cheating behavior. <br><br>Quite a few people actually got up and left during the movie,maybe it\ngot a bit to much for them seeing that you saw naked woman every couple\nof minutes. <br><br>Overall the movie glamorized greed. Sad part is there was only about 15\nminutes of the whole movie that showed any consequence to this false\nimmoral lifestyle. I feel the message of the movie was wrong and the\nmovie could have had a lot more emotional impact if they had showed\nthis lifestyle in a less glamorous way.\n"
"\nMartin Scorsese scores a huge hit in this seminal celebration of human\npiggishness, rot and squalor. Sure one will face daunting challenges to\nself-indulgence, but if he tries hard enough and stays the course in\ndissipation and exploitation, he can become a King like Jordan Belfort,\nwith a fawning, obsequious following. And what's wrong with that?\nWhat's wrong with living the good life, by whatever means necessary, if\nyou have the talent and only care about yourself? <br><br>Human baseness and predation are honored in the film through Belfort's\ngraphic gluttonous sex and extraordinary drug use, constantly extolled\nas giving the edge one needs to dominate and manipulate. That, with\nunapologetic predation, are critical parts of the road map to the good\nlife in the Scorsese model.<br><br>And with that, Scorsese proves a master in describing a modern day\nInferno (like Dante's) with the new paradigm that being bad is not so\nbad after all if you win in the end.\n"
"\nBy far the Best Movie of the Year, Best Actor, Best Director! The whole\nsupporting cast is excellent as well. This movie will not disappoint it\nwas much better than I expected and the duration of the movie is not\nfelt at all. It definitely did not feel like a 3 hour production.\nScorsese put this movie together brilliantly! You are on your toes and\nengaged throughout from beginning to end. Leonardo DiCaprio is at his\nbest! He will take you through the highs and lows of the movie with an\nOscar Winning Performance. I read about Jordan Belfort and it appears\nthat Scorsese and DiCaprio made this movie as accurate as possible\nwhich I really appreciate. I commend Scorsese and DiCaprio for keeping\nthis epic picture as authentic as possible. After all this is\nHollywood.\n"
"\nI wish I could say anything positive about it, but I feel the\nresponsibility to keep people, especially kids and teenagers, away from\nthis movie. This is literally the worst movie ever and one of the few I\nwalked out on. I do not understand that this movie can be entertaining\nin any way. The scenes are merely numbing and the time span could be\nreduced to an hour at most. The plot is nothing new. Even worse, left\nalone as it seems. The possible moral value that it has to carry is not\ntraceable. It appears that the producers caught themselves too much in\nthe story. Therefore, they could not see that they are actually\ndisplaying something that should be categorized in the \"adult section\".\n"
"\nEverything nowadays is so over hyped like breaking bad the dark knight\nand now this crap this movie is such a mess it's a comedy that is 3\nhours long that's right a comedy that is so long and so over the top\nand it drags on and on and on. This movie is what other country's see\nus as stupid people that spend money on drugs and take from people to\nwaste it . This movie is so stupid you will ask your self did I really\npay $8:50 for this and why and you will find out that your day was\nwasted too. This movie is just a movie that will be forgotten in a year\nfrom now no one will know what it is because no one will remember this\ncrap it is not a classic like scarface it is a anti American film that\nshow' show great Jordan Belford with his middle school language and\nintellect that make you feel dumb that you watch it. It's a trashy\nmovie with no real meaning but to waste your time and life so stay away\nif you have one this movie is just a nether epic fail that might get a\naward because it was over-hyped and this movie will be on a award\nmistake list in the near future.\n"
"\nHi, I never write reviews here.. ever.<br><br>However, I need to say something about how terrible this movie is.<br><br>I told my wife one evening, \"Hey, there's a really high IMDb rated\nmovie do you want to see it?\" She says yes.<br><br>We literally get through maybe 30 minutes of the movie before turning\nto each other and saying, \"This is horrible.\" and turning it off.<br><br>The gratuitous nudity and debauchery seemed to be all encompassing,\ncompletely drowning out any semblance of a 'story' in this movie. It is\nliterally a non-stop bombardment of softcore porn for the first 30\nminutes..<br><br>If you go to see this movie, keep that in mind. If you can get past the\nhalf hour mark before being bored with it, then maybe there's a movie\nin there somewhere.<br><br>I don't think there is, though...\n"
"\nI really can't believe anyone likes this movie. It is an over-budgeted\nindulgence in offensive (intentionally, I think)...what I guess you\nwould call \"soft porn\"...that seems to have no point. The filmmakers\nseem to show the same contempt for the audience that the \"wolf\" shows\nto his clients. Throw a bunch of lewd, disgusting debauchery into EVERY\nframe, every scene, over and over again, and they will eat it up as if\nthere was something there. But there is nothing there. There is no real\nstory, no real character development, no real reason to watch these\nimmoral characters indulge themselves. I truly felt traumatized, and\nwith no that reason I could see. <br><br>Unless you love porn, and senseless violence on every level, don't go\nsee this movie. You deserve better.\n"
"\nA group of us watched this film with high expectations, but by a third\nof the way through everybody seemed to be shuffling in their seats with\nthe repetitive boredom of it all; but no-one daring to actually say out\nloud what they were thinking. It seemed to be an over indulgent love-in\nof quality actors overplaying everything, the director trying to show\noff how fast he could get the cast to talk over each other with\nirrelevant excruciatingly long conversations of no interest to anybody\nexcept presumably the writer; and every character a ridiculous\noverplayed cartoon cutout. Even the steadfast investigating cop had to\nbecome a wisecracking Caprio mark 2 when the pair finally got together\nfor their \"showdown\". The movie ground on relentlessly with orgy and\ncoke snorting scenes: OK, we've seen you can do that: please can we\nhave some plot now and learn in much more detail how he got to the top\nand how he fell from grace? A waste of too much time.\n"
"\nMartin Scorsese is losing his gift as a director. The Wolf of Wall\nStreet is another rendition of Scorsese's other movies. The narration,\nactions, and flow of Wolf of Wall Street is similar to Goodfellas,\nCasino and Mean Streets. Di Capiro's lead character is just another\nversion of the Henry Hill character from the movie Goodfellas. Through\nthe streetwise narration of Di Capiro one learns how the system is\nscammed, and experiences dysfunctional behaviour of drugs, and\nprostitutes. The characters lack of morals creates the usual drama stew\nof low lives. Scorsese tries to spice up the old recycled formula with\nnudity, massive drug use, over the top sex, which can not compensate\nfor the lack of story depth. 3 hours was way too long for a half hour\nstory. Five stars out of ten.\n"
"\nNot for an instant can I recommend going to this movie. It has a few\nhilarious moments and for that it gets a non-zero rating, but it is\nreally too much to stomach 3 (three!) hours of dumb jackasses behaving\nlike wild reckless dumb jackasses, like the world only exists to serve\nand reward them. And time and time again, confronted with the truth\nthat some actions eventually have their harsh consequences, they fail\nto react rationally and don't ever get out when things get hot until\ntheir actions take them to the critical point of no return where they\ncan't keep escaping the inevitable and everything falls apart. The\nstory seems to me just as an excuse to depict all that stupidity. I\ndon't know if many people will bear it, I really didn't. It was a\nrelief to see the movie end.\n"
"\nThis was like watching a cheap soft porn flick. The drugs were\nglamorized as if they were harmless, like crack being smoked as if it\nhad no more harm than a cigarette. The sex was like watching a cheap\nporn flick, with full frontal female nudity in several scenes and the\nsex scenes left little to the imagination. The only thing not shown in\nthe sex scenes was penetration. But the sex, too, was careless sex,\nlike whores who use condoms, unless you pay them more, which is what he\nclaims to do and then another statements when he went nuts over a\nbeautiful woman, that he does not care if he gets aids from her, he\njust wants sex with her. This movie was recklessly and carelessly done\nfor the younger viewers.\n"
"\nPainfully long - this could have been a 90minute movie with pace and\nprecision - instead it was a 180minute nose bleed full of irrelevancy\nthat should have been left on the cutting room floor.<br><br>Really slack storytelling - key bits never explained or exposed and\noften rushed. Dull peripheral stuff laboured over for 20 minutes a\ntime.<br><br>Such an obvious plot - after the first 10 minutes you knew EXACTLY what\nwas going to happen - and then it did and then finally you got to go\nhome.<br><br>This is a classic case of a A List actor and director being allowed to\ndo just whatever they damn well wanted to do. They needed a really\nstrong script editor and a real producer who wasn't going to put up\nwith their prima donna nonsense. Overall a wasted opportunity -\nalthough Leonardo's performance was really pretty good which is where\nthe 2 points come from.\n"
"\nThis was a terrible movie. One couple left the theater after 45\nminutes. This is an utterly boring movie that dragged on for 3 hours. I\ndon't know what part of the movie made it to the cutting room floor.\nThe entire plot can be aired in no more than an hour and a half. I do\nbelieve I saw more t-n-a than I have in the past decade in this movie.\nThe amount of drug and money glorification was sickening, but only to\nbe out done when the main character punches his \"wife\", steals their\nkid while on a cocaine high and crashes the car with the child in the\nfront seat. Sadly I stayed until the end only to be courteous to my\nout-of-town guests. Otherwise, I would have bailed!\n"
"\nExtremely horrible movie with no motive other than making money by\nshowing horrible content including sexuality, drugs and inhumane\nscenes, which has unfortunately become the fashion of today and is\nenjoyed by many.<br><br>If a movie this horrible can gain such popularity it only means that\nhuman kind is asking for their own destruction, and I am afraid at this\nrate they will get it soon! One must think what base are they preparing\nfor their future generations and I don't think they are doing a very\ngood job by encouraging such kind of movies, where there is nothing\ngood at all.<br><br>My comments might seem a bit harsh but sadly its the truth.\n"
"\nSome genius slapped Scorcese and Leonard DiCaprio together and knew\nthat the world would love the turd baby, that is, The Wolf of Wall\nStreet. Add some drugs, hookers and a narcissist (somehow they even\nscrewed up the typical 'loveable asshole'- there is nothing likable or\nsympathetic about this character). 8.5/10? Really? Nothing stands out\nin this movie except for the fact that it is certainly verrry loooong\nwinded and, wow, I don't think i could watch another character-narrated\nMartin Scorsese film without being reminded of the bitter stench of\nthis stinker. The Wolf of Wall Street, my god. I liked Jonah Hill\nbefore. So dull. Poor acting. Unintelligent.\n"
"\nI would just like to say that I got absolutely nothing out of the\nviewing of The Wolf Of Wall Street. It is easily the worst effort ever\nfrom Martin Scorsese. The story line is almost non existent , DiCaprio\nis just a loser with a loud mouth, and all the surrounding characters\nare one dimensional. I don't see any moral battle being fought, I don't\ncare about seeing hookers, lots of drugs being taken , or stupid\nparties, very boring. The real role model in the story cites his hero's\nas Gordon Gekko of Wall Street, Don Johnson of Miami Vice, and Richard\nGere in Pretty Woman, what a completely shallow loser, even in todays\nbottom feeding America. The whole effort is simple B movie territory,\nnot just because of the 80's and 90's settings. Couple this film with\nAmerican Hustle, and you have a pretty awful state of 2014 film-making.\n"
"\nWhile Leonardo is one talented actor and does an incredible job in this\nmovie, the film could have been shortened to 2 hours to make its point.\nStronger cautions of content should been out there. Pornography was\nclearly evident Several people left the theater and we thought about it\nmidway through. Seemed like 2000 f-bombs versus the reported 500+ were\nvoiced. We liked Leonardo way better in \"To Catch a Thief and\n\"Titanic\". People have mentioned a possible Oscar nod for Mr. DeCaprio\nfor this, but my preference would be for him would to get it one day\nfor a future body of work. Actually writing this review is not a good\nuse of my time, so...stopping here.\n"
"\nPeople for whom money matters please don't watch this in theatre.\nPlease read the negative reviews by others. They are writing the truth.<br><br>Movie is extremely brash, audacious and full of ......<br><br>Some urinating scenes, number of times Di Caprio or some others use the\nexpletives like M***** F****** or any other equally horrible expletives\nis unbelievable. And number of times he keeps shouting is equally\nhorrible and disgusting. Is shouting justified as acting? Di Caprio's\nlast best film is Inception.<br><br>I hope people who didn't watch will take the negative reviews\nseriously. Some might have a good laugh and enjoy the movie but please\nask yourself. Do you really want to pay for this kind of movie?\nRemember you are paying your hard earned money not like they earn in\nthe movie. I spent my time on this movie but not my money. Please make\na wise decision. Watch it on TV/computer/other device. Please don't get\nfooled.\n"
"\nI'm not sure what they are trying to do here, other then glamorize\nlecherousness. The movie has no original theme, and you can tell how\nthe story will progress from the very beginning, indeed even just be\nlooking at the title. I'm amazed at why this movie was presented for\nOscar nomination. There is absolutely nothing interesting or original\nabout it. It was a total waste of time watching it, especially because\nit is so damn long. I forwarded it most of the time. It also reflects\non how powerless the American public has become that they can no longer\nsteer what they are made to watch by the powerful media. I hope that\nthe number of negative reviews will serve to put this movie back in its\nproper place.\n"
"\nThe title of the film and its director were clearly enough to warrant\nseeing this one. But I was annoyed at how poor the acting was, and the\nincessant ultra-sharp close-ups of bad actors speaking mindless dialog\nmade it too hard to watch more than the first half. While the storyline\nhad a decent premise, its portrayal was shallow at best. <br><br>There was almost no character development and no one you could identify\nwith, which made it a bit better than a SNL skit. While the photography\nwas good, it was put too bad use unless you like watching bimbos and\ngreedy nerds frolic in cartoonish and gratuitous sex scenes.<br><br>This wolf was a total dog. I'm not a great lover of Oliver Stone\nflicks, but his \"Wall Street\" puts this one to shame.\n"
"\nThe humor is not bad and there is a decent amount of it throughout the\nmovie. (7/10) The acting, mainly Leonardo, was fantastic! (9.5/10) The\nstory is a bit shallow. Basically a bunch of people lying, cheating,\nstealing, and running/escaping on Wall Street and making a lot of\n\"dirty\" illegal money. Then talking talk and talking bad about other\npeople who are honest but make less. The movie portrays a picture that\nmoney is the most important thing and it is what brings you happiness\nvery well. (2/10) Near the end it shows that being controlled by money\nis very bad, but it wasn't portrayed as well as it did trying to argue\nfor money bringing happiness. It shows a bunch of \"rich\" folks who have\nnothing but money thinking they're above everyone else. No health, no\nrelationships, no integrity, no manners, no respect, no honesty, no\ntime, nothing but money and the animalistic drive to get more and\ndestroy everything in the way.\n"
"\nThis movie should be rated x. Still impressed the American public is so\ndesirous of porn and drugs use...and thinks it is funny.\nCongratulations to Scorsese for knowing his audience. Interesting to\nsee so many people under 18 laughing at the drug abuse. IMDb requires\n10 lines of text to issue this review, but really, how long was\nScorsese's outline of this movie. I doubt it was that long. Let's see,\nshow lots of naked bodies, throw in continuous offensive language,\nsnort all the cocaine off the naked bodies, villanize\nstockbrokers...yep, that is a great formula for getting high ratings\nand making lots of money.\n"
"\nAnyone who feels there is a shred of merit to this movie needs to take\na second look at the emperorhe has no clothes. That an iconic director\nlike Scorsese would fashion such a juvenile, indulgent and ultimately\nboring piece of trash like this is unimaginable. It's as if Shakespeare\nwere to pen a couple of episodes of Gilligan's Island or Mozart to\ncompose a jingle for Justin Bieber. That it was nominated in the\nAcademy's Best Picture category to the exclusion of movies like The\nButler or Inside Llewyn Davis is reprehensible. It's also pathetic that\nMr. Scorsese seems to be following in the dirty old man-director\nfootsteps of Stanley Kubrick (Eyes Wide Shut) by offering as much\nnudity and sex as possible for no apparent reason other than crass\ntitillation. But that's not the biggest problem here. I don't have any\nproblem with pictures that deal with sex or aberrant relationships or\nviolence or excess as long as they're created with some artistry. I DO\nhave a problem with pictures that are simply tedious. Shame on you, Mr.\nScorsese.\n"
"\nI went to this movie with a group of six other people. Six of the seven\nof us deeply wished we had not wasted our money on a really stupid\nwoman hating movie. Anyone who tells you that the movie is criticizing\nthe woman hating attitudes of the Wall Streeters in the movie is\nignoring the fact that not a single woman in the movie gets to say\nanything with the slightest bit of intelligence or criticism of the\nattitudes of the men towards them which another filmmaker would have\ndone to make women in the audience have at least someone to identify\nwith and cheer on for even two minutes of this three hour self-\nindulgent crap.\n"
"\nAmerican hustle was great a movie for grownups unlike wolf of wall\nstreet yet I am kinda ticked of at Cristian Bale acting like Robert\nDeniro and Leonardo Dicaprio wanting to be the next Jack Nicholson. The\nwolf has some serious parts very few the rest is a mindless carnival of\nbull I am surprised how bad everything was even hated DiCaprio's\nperformance for the first time he was phenomenal in Django I had big\nexpectations for this movie it tries to take a stab at a lot of film\nstyles but succeeds in none it is a shameful movie from great artist a\nI was disgusted walking out of the treater. i will have to watch the\ndeparted a few times to get this out of my system.\n"
"\nFrom the very first scenes, the film is embarrassingly crass and\nvulgar, setting new lows in cinematic tastes, and assaults the ears\nwith a volume of swearwords that would not have been found on the\nstands of Millwall Fc. <br><br>It astounds me that Martin Scores and Leonardo Di Carrie would allow\nthemselves to be involved with such trash. <br><br>The only reason for allotting 2 stars is the quality of colour, audio\nand scenography.<br><br>I really looked forward to seeing an updated and improved Wall Street\nbut ended up with 3 hours of torment. Save your time and money and do\nnot encourage Hollywood to make such disgusting nonsense in future.\n"
"\nI give DiCaprio a thumbs up for his impeccable portrayal of the\nperpetually greedy Jordan Belfort, but overall I disliked the movie.\nThis is based on the memoirs of Jordan Belfort, a notorious stockbroker\nand self-made millionaire who's penny stock brokerage defrauded 1,500\nclients of $200 million during the 1990's. He used aggressive sales\ntactics and adrenaline charged locker room motivational chants to\npersuade his vagabond group of 1,000 wannabes to follow his lead, get\nrich at any cost, especially to the client, and make a name for their\nbrokerage, Stratton Oakmont. At three hours the movie is overly long\ngiven the numerous scenes of drug use, drinking, sex and raucous office\nparties, not to mention the nonstop foul language throughout. One\nclearly gets the message that Mr. Belfort is a debaucher, gluttonous,\ndisloyal, lewd, immoral, fanatical, corrupt, demanding and ambitious,\nhence the title. Two hours would have been sufficient for this intense\nroller coaster ride of greed. I wonder if Mr. Scorsese is vicariously\ntrying to relive the wild '60's in this film.\n"
"\nThere have been big Scorsese productions that I wasn't particularly\nfond of, like Gangs of New York and The Age of Innocence, but this is a\nfirst: a Scorsese picture I actually disliked. Nothing can change the\nfact that Martin Scorsese is one of the great American film auteurs.\nHis body of work is virtually unparalleled. But this picture is a big\nmisstep for the great director. It is a failed satire, if indeed it was\nmeant to be a satire. It's overlong, overwrought, and ultimately\nboring. He means to show us something about wretched excess, I suppose,\nbut he fails to create a single character about whom we might give a\ndamn, except for the antagonist, and in the end all you can do is yawn\nand be happy it's over.\n"
"\nI have just switched off The Wolf of Wall Street in.....well, shock\nfrankly. After persevering for quite some time, because this is a film\ndirected by Martin Scorcese for goodness sake! So felt it just had to\nget better any minute NOW.<br><br>Unfortunately, it did not. Flabby and self indulgent. This required an\nexcellent editor to step up and shout over the ego's: 'No really\nfellas......that just goes on and on and on.....keep it sharp!' Just\nshocked at how appalling this actually is. If this was a couple of guys\njust out of film school, would the critics have raved about it? Would\nit get nominated for Awards? <br><br>More evidence of the ridiculousness of big award nights. <br><br>I have read the reviews here of people who liked this film, and all\nrespect to you. Everything is perception is it not? Where they see\n'innovation' I see self indulgence and lack of editorial discipline.\nSee what you think.\n"
"\nI really can't wrap my mind around the rates given to this movie.\nThough I love Scorsese and Dicaprio's work with him there is just no\nreason to consider this movie more than a playful comedy. <br><br>3 hours of, in all honesty, nothing. No context, no punch not even that\ngreat of acting. There is really not a line to follow or any\nbiographical data to grab on. It's just an endless display of \"funny\"\n(was it really?) scenes where the main characters display their\nexcesses and appetite for luxury.<br><br>By the second hour of Leo getting drugged I was completely fed up with\nitat least these kind of teen/party/drug funny movies are short and\ngive no higher expectations <br><br>I was really expecting more of Leo and especially more of Scorsese...\n"
"\nWhen you start checking the time while in the theater, you know the\nmoving needs editing. In this case, a good hour and a half could have\nbeen easily edited of orgies and drugs without losing the effect of\nlots of orgies and drugs. Actually gets boring after a while, more\norgies and drug taking. <br><br>On top of that, nothing whatsoever new or original here. Just more.\nMaybe bigger (if bigger means more minutes on drugs and orgies).<br><br>Lot of (soon boring) scenes of the brokerage firm employees all acting\nhappy and nuts -- more editing would have helped.<br><br>And did anyone else see a couple scenes where you envisioned Tom Cruise\nin the role rather than Leonardo?<br><br>In all, boring, too long, uninspired. Waste of time and money.\n"
"\nLet me start of with the basics, prior to watching this movie I heard\nthe city of Dubai censored this movie down by ~40mins by cutting out\nrude scenes involving sex, nudity and so forth. At first I was rather\nflabbergasted at this opinion, however when I saw this movie last\nnight, I realized they had every right to do so. Most of the scenes\ndragged on way beyond it's point where it started venturing near a soft\nporn clip.<br><br>The movie will be much more enjoyable had it been a 2hr running time\nwith 85% of the useless sexual references removed. If I wanted to see\nsomething as full-frontal I would have watched Eyes Wide Shut.<br><br>To me it seemed the jump from the garage operated boiler-room to the\nfull-blown office was slightly over expedited. We never got to see\nJordan's \"lows\".<br><br>Leo does a fabulous job with his performance however as the title\nsuggests, I think the movie had better potential in many different\nways.<br><br>Final thought? If you're a Leo die-hard fan, watch it, otherwise be\nprepared for a soft-porno of drugs and sex.\n"
"\nI'm known for dragging out a story but the first 2 hours could have\nbeen covered in 25 minutes, only then would I have contemplated a 5.5\nrating. About 3 comedy moments and a long drawn out story that only the\ndownfall was worth watching. I can only think the prevalence of naked\nwomen, men and sex has somehow merited the 8.5 rating as \"art\". Shall\nnow go and do something more interesting, sleep. Sorry, I now have to\nwaffle on and drag this review out as it must be a minimum of 10 lines,\nwhat more can I say, I'm tired after 3 hours of boredom and want some\nsleep.<br><br>Thoroughly disappointed.\n"
"\nWolf on Wall Street should be renamed \"Filthy Rich\"! Two hours and\nfifty nine minutes of filth. I was mislead by the previews featuring a\ntop notch actor in DiCaprio and Director Scorese. That was the primary\nreason why I went to see this film. I cannot believe this film showed\ngraphic sex and foul language scenes for almost 3 hours. Watching this\nfilm amongst 50 people at a AMC theater they sat as I did in stunned\ndisbelief. I do not need 1,000 words to describe how disappointed I am\nin wasting my monies seeing this filthy film. I hope I was not\nrecognized by anyone whom I knew coming out of this AMC Theater. If I\nwanted to see a Porno Movie I would pay monies to see a Porno Movie.\nProducers should be fined for misleading Movie goers.\n"
"\nI am quite surprised to see this film in the top 250 IMDb. Certainly it\nis a very well realized film and I must say we do not really see past 3\nhours (ok this is a very good point, and the film deserves a good\nrating) film, but 8.7? <br><br>See nipples and pussies for three hours does not bother me. I am\nsurprised to see kids and little girls in the movie theater. It is a\nbiopic of a guy that these kids probably do not know. So they are in\nthe room because the film is a film version of \"Skins\".<br><br>I must say that I went to see the movie at the cinema for Di Caprio,\nand AGAIN, he is really really good in the film. But it is still over\nrated for me ... Come on guys ... Is that the film comparable to a\n\"Goodfellas\" or \"Casino\"? :-) I don't think so! Go see these movies\nkids!\n"
"\nWould you like to watch a bunch of douchebags being douchebags, for\nthree hours? I guess the only thing worse would be actually knowing\nthese guys for a large portion of their lives. <br><br>How about that one scene, where the former single mom gets all\nteary-eyed at how Wolfie gave her a chance? Yeah, no, I still want to\nsmash his face through a window. <br><br>How about the scene where he \"writes a note\" warning his bud he was\nwearing a wire, but then you find out it didn't matter because he gave\nthem all up anyway and still made his deal with the dorkiest FBI agent\nto grace the screen. <br><br>Moral of the story, if you're sitting in an auditorium, listening to\nsomeone selling you his get rich scheme, get out, before you too become\na douchebag. (Well, that's not exactly the moral in the movie, you have\nto come up with that take-away on your own.)\n"
"\nThere are great actors in this movie. The story line is awful. The\ncharacters are awful. This is the boring life story of a crook from\nwall street. Why do we care. So what if it is real. It is boring. It is\nnot an 8.2. It is one of the worst crime dramas ever. A movie best on a\ntrue story can be good. This is not one of then. To many people like\nmovies just because they are best on a true story. It does not matter\nthat the writing stinks. Good actors wasted there time being in this\nawful movie. Do not waste your money. Do not waste your time. Do not\nsee this awful movie. Bad movie bad movie bad movie. I need more lines\nand I am running out of things to say.\n"
"\nThis is without a doubt the most disgusting movie I have seen in years.\nWelcome to modern day Babylon folks. Those of you who thought this a\ngreat movie, take a good look at yourselves in the mirror! I am a\nperson that enjoys a good or great movie but I struggled to get through\nthis one. What is the matter with humanity today that we worship\nthieves that have no alliance to anything but their own greed. It truly\nis a sorry ass world that we live in today that lets Hollywood rewrite\nthis guys past. How many trusting folks have put their money in this\ncrooks hands only to lose their life savings. If he had done this to my\nfamily, he would be dead!\n"
"\nThe Wolf at Wall Street is an utterly awful movie and a complete waste\nof three hours. The movie offers absolutely nothing in terms of depth\nor insight beyond 'these stock brokers are bad'. There is no substance,\nwith a plot that moves painfully slowly and characters that, by design,\ndon't change one bit throughout the entire movie. Okay, we get the\nidea. These guys suck. And they will never change. And the justice\nsystem is screwed up. You could have showed us that in 5 minutes.\nInstead we get three hours of shallow, meaningless, repetitive, and\nmost of all completely unfunny nothingness, with stock brokers screwing\nprostitutes and snorting cocaine. There is no depth here. This is\nnothing but cheap entertainment, and if you don't find something as\nshallow as what is portrayed as entertaining, then you'll be staring at\nyour watch for three hours, wondering how time can pass so slowly. The\none redeeming feature is Dicaprio's acting. A complete waste of time\nand money.\n"
"\nA true story I believethat still continues to this very day, all over\nthe world! The movie itself was very well done but the content and the\nstory was really bad and disappointing. Only drugs and obscenity during\nthe entire film based on lies and deception to rob innocent people of\ntheir money to gain their own wealth... The movie is worth seeingto\ntake learning of the moral of the movie! The society cannot function in\na good manner if this kind of behavior is accepted and would inspire\nothers to do the same if successfulworldwide moral is declining and\npeople are more than never behaving disgracefully and bad. Money is for\nmany the true goal in life and the more you have the better life and\npower over others you gain! Unfortunately yesits true, but to what\ncost?! To make others suffer and get hurt?! No thank you! I rather stay\npoor and happy than rich and miserable! I will not see the movie again,\nbut its not a \"bad\" movie in that way, its very well directed and well\nmade but its moral and content is depressing and sad\n"
"\nI think this is a very well crafted movie. The performances are\nexcellent and the director and all his staff made a wonderful job. And\nthis has the best dialog I have heard in years - despite the frequent\nf-words. Yes, this is one of the rags-to-riches-and-then-to-jail\n-movie. But somehow I missed the larger-in-life -character Gordon\nGekko, who has already become a living legend although he is only a\nfiction from Stone's Wall Street. The main character is just a brat\nwith addictions: drug, sex and money. Like a teenager-for-ever -type.\nHe never grows and he never learns. At the end he is still making money\nfor himself and some avid listeners. I hope his methods are legitimate\nnow. But there is virtually no reference to the outside world. No\npolitical or philosophical connotations. And during this time inside\nWall street was happening a lot! Later we found out what... So my only\ncomplaint is that this movie tries to be a Novel (apparently Epic Novel\nfor 3 hours!)but manages in only being a short story.\n"
"\n... boggles my mind why this crappy movie is hailed as such a work of\nart. It's a terrible movie. Virtually a work of pornography, really...\nFilth, drug use, irresponsible behavior and all of it a pack of lies.\nMay be based on some true story somewhere, but it certainly doesn't\nmirror any semblance of reality anywhere.<br><br>The acting... Yeah it's great when the script is crap and the actors\njust have to pretend to hump like rabbits and get high left, right and\nsideways. Doesn't take much acting skill to pull of a porno.<br><br>Horrible waste of time movie! Something is definitely wrong in\nHollywood when this type of crap is lauded as a great award worthy\nmovie. Should be ashamed of themselves, honestly...\n"
"\nWhere to begin with this one? There's no question that the events\ndepicted are fascinating and that Scorsese is a superb director. There\nare actually a few laugh-out-loud moments sprinkled throughout this\nfilm. Still, the movie is three hours long and, at times, feels that\nway. I kept expecting it to end half hour before it actually did. As\nhas been noted everywhere, there is absolutely no one to root for or\nlike during this entire running time. However, the performances are all\nquite good. You don't see many Oscar contenders like Leo get nominated\nfor a film in which a candle appears in his ass. On that note, so much\nof this film focuses on the extremely vulgar and extremely decedent\nliving. That certainly was the point but is it possible to drive home\nthat point too much? Excess living depicted through excess film making? <br><br>One thing's for sure, this is NOT a film to take your parents or\ngrandparents to.\n"
"\nLeonardo and Jonah's acting was so overshadowed by the sever vulgarity\nof this film. I don't understand how it is possible that this film got\nthe R rating and wasn't NC17??? I get that the director wanted to\ncapture the essence of the \"true story\" but if he was going to be this\ngraphic it should have been NC17 to give the audience some warning!!!\nWe saw it before anyone I knew did so I had no idea how extremely\nvulgar it was. If u haven't seen it read IMDb's parent guide\ndescription and you'll Definitely know what you're in for. Just wish I\nhad, then I would have passed on seeing this explicitly vulgar film.\nI'll definitely be reading the IMDb parent guides for all R rated films\nI see in the future since apparently Critics love XXX films\nmasquerading as R rated\n"
"\nThere are movies with sex,drugs and money in all shapes and forms in\nHollywood,but this movie is just repulsive.I didn't get to ''midget\nthrowing'' part but i've watched on the trailer.Really??Are\nmillionaire's morons?? There were no funny moments at all.Plain stupid\nlines.The ''no you didn't'' kind of movie that i regret watching even\nthe hour i did watch. What really made me stop watching was the scene\nwhere a hooker inserted a candle in Dicaprio's ass...Why show this\nstuff??I don't care what people do in private,but why do i need to see\na scene like this??And pay for it??Repulsive... This movie is\nScorsese's worst job ever,worst than that movie with Nicholas Cage that\nwas pretty crappy...but this one is actually disgusting... DON'T WATCH\n!!!!\n"
"\nAbout 75% of the movie consist of sexual content and consumption of\nforbidden substances. When I went to see it, I hoped to see another\n\"Aviator\" or \"Catch me, if you can\". Unfortunately, this movie is not\neven close to any of mentioned masterpieces. The main character is an\nordinary control freak, who is constantly anxious and tortured by the\nfear of losing control and tries to remedy that by sex, drugs and\nbooze. Teenagers will be happy to watch something \"Hangoverish\" here,\nbut for a responsible adult the main character would look despicable\nand offensive. If you are a teenager, you should see this movie for\nsure: you will catch a lols and fun. If you are a grownup man with a\nsense of responsibility, this may be plainly boring for you. And God\nforbid you from taking your wife to watch it together.\n"
"\nThree hours of story and I had no reaction to any of the characters -\nno likes, no hates, no caring, no nothing.<br><br>There is no comedy, no drama, no scary scenes, no thrills, no acting!\nIt's just a bunch of name and no name actors running around thinking\nthey are making one of those goofy frat college flicks.<br><br>This episodic tale of Jordan Belfort wants to be so much of what it is\nnot and that not is 'entertaining'. The plot line just goes in circles\nand we all know he's got to have his downfall - otherwise there is no\nstory.<br><br>And if there is a message hidden somewhere in this tale it's that you\ncan't trust Wall Street - what a shock! Who knew?\n"
"\nDON'T PAY TO SEE THIS MOVIE. <br><br>The film reminds me most of The Ring, but this time the demonic\noppression is real. The unstoppable corrupter in this case reaches his\nspiny fingers through the silver screen and into your wallet. <br><br>This is a true story and he (who doesn't deserve to be named) isn't\ndone finding ways to cheat us. According to The Wall Street Journal,\nthis guy is still laughing all the way to the bank, making a killing on\nbook sales and movie royalties, while failing to pay full restitution\nto his victims. If you mistakenly see this film, like I did, you leave\nthe theater an unwitting accomplice.\n"
"\nDear potential viewers,<br><br>I must warn you that in the time you will spend watching this film, you\ncould:<br><br>1. Watch a better film 2. Sleep for three hours 3. Paint a rabbit on\nyour face and run outside 4. Thoroughly wash your hands 5. Drive from\nBielefeld to Berlin 6. Giggle <br><br>And all of these activities will be more enriching. The plot is very\npoor. To distract from that fact, the makers put in a million of sex\nand drug scenes - a quarter of it would have done as well, you get the\npoint quite quickly. Nothing against Leo, he's a babe but not even he\nmakes up for the waste of time. In Spanish the movie is even worse.\nVery one-dimensional. Not a single female character who has brains. And\nwho the hell decided to make it 3 hours??? <br><br>In summary, watch something else.\n"
"\nThis film might have been made the best way it could be made. Seeing as\nit was chronicling the real life of a stock market corrupt team. But it\nwasn't enjoyable to me at all. It might have served the role of\ninforming us that Stock Market workers are corrupt. But I think most\npeople going in were already convinced of that. My take is that the\nsubject of stock market corruption could be better covered as a dark\ncomedy in a similar style as Dr. Strangelove. Or the film could have\nbeen entertaining if the entire thing was covered from the perspective\nof the cops who took Belfort down. The way this film was made just\nmakes me hate the world for producing such nastiness both in the real\nworld and on the big screen. Not all films have to be happy. But there\nhas to be some hope involved in the story somewhere. Sure the guy went\nto jail at the end. But his sentence was so small that it felt just\nlike another defeat. Also, the film was REAAALLY long.\n"
"\nThere was not one character in this movie that I didn't despise. They\nwere all absolutely disgusting and if anybody was going to become\nkarma's bitch it would have been them. Their ego's are out of control\nfor no reason. They're basically the equivalent of call centre\noperators or conmen. Their only skill is lying.<br><br>I just don't know what to say because for what it was it wasn't a\nterrible movie but three hours of deplorable human behaviour is far too\nmuch. I got sick of seeing the same thing over and over again. It began\nto lose it's shock value and became uninteresting. After about forty\nminutes I was just holding out for the end of the movie when they\nfinally get brought down.\n"
"\nHardly a masterpiece. Very uneven in terms of quality. Some good\nmoments, and DiCaprio is at times very effective... at times. It can't\nquite decide what it wants to be. It can't really explain the central\ncharacter's decline into debauchery and self-destruction, so it is\ninstead a kind of celebration of decadence. The humor is truly juvenile\nand the constant parade of sex rarely reveals character or furthers the\nplot. It seems more an opportunity for the director to explore his own\npornographic interests. It actually gets boring. Indeed, the film is at\nleast an hour too long. Just when you think DeCaprio has reached the\nend of the line, another meaningless hour is ahead. A strange\ncombination of long scenes of exposition and rapidly moving decadence.\nIt doesn't work.\n"
"\nI'm sorry to say but for the first time, the critics were pretty spot\non with this. The acting performances of both Leonardo DeCaprio and\nJonah Hill were top notch and most definitely worthy of the accolades\nthey have received, but the movie it self seemed like it was on massive\nquantities of drugs. It was a great story, but it was told in such a\nchoppy manner, some of the scenes were so over the top I felt like I\nwas watching another Tucker Maxx movie. I was really hoping for more.\nGreat acting (Rob Reiner deserved an Oscar nomination too)...OK\nmovie...and it was WAY too long!!! I don't know how he did it, but\nScorsese managed to drag this out for almost 3 full hours. He couldn't\ndo a 3 hour version of Goodfellas or The Departed, but managed to\nextend the life of this for 3 hours? Again, I was really hoping for\nmore.\n"
"\nIn person DiCaprio paints himself as a caring environmentalist and\nhumanitarian who is standing up against governments and co-operations.\nYou get the sense the celebrities really do think they are amazing\npeople who can change the world by using their popularity for good\ncauses. <br><br>How he has the nerve to do so whilst making his livelihood from\nglorifying a true story and making all of the actions of the lead\ncharacter is beyond me. Ninety percent of this movie glorified the 1%\nwho rip of the 99% and live shallow lives with no thoughts of the\nconsequences for others in their actions.<br><br>A shocking movie, showing the true values and priorities of Hollywood\nand Wall Street combined.\n"
"\nBefore this film, I could start watching a DeCaprio flick without\nsecond thought and I would know that the movie is going to be\nbrilliant; but this movie changed it all. Although, it has the element\nof entertainment; performances were good, direction good but had too\nmuch of crass element in it. A man who has no respect for law, no\nrespect of people's feelings, no sensitivities toward anyone but\nhimself and that man is being shown as a hero is just untoward. Never\nexpected such lowly kind of film from brilliant artists like DeCaprio\nand Scorsese. Although, its doesn't matter to anyone, but I no longer\nfeel like calling myself a DeCaprio fan. Way to go...\n"
"\nI know it was based on a real person but i'm sure there must have been\nhealthy amounts of literary licensing taking place. It was just\noverdone and STUPID STUPID STUPID. literally made me want to kill\nDicaprio's entire team. Literally. It was just that dumb. I was really\ndisappointed since I was expecting a good movie. I'M surprised this got\ngood reviews from the critics but what the hell do they know. Back then\nI wondered why this movie didn't receive any Oscars when it had such\nhigh reviews and acclaim. But i guess now I know why. This was more\nlike watching Animal House on Wall Street than anything else. So WHACK!\nI couldn't believe how disappointed I was in both Dicaprio and Scorsese\n"
"\nThis is a terrible film: simply 3 hours of shouting. It's repetitive;\nlacking in narrative or plot; no drama; no character development; no\nwit; no light and shade; no insights - in short nothing at all to\nrecommend it. It's true that DiCaprio gives a good performance, but the\ntotality of the film is so bad it's not worth watching just to see him.\nThe great puzzle is how director Martin Scorsese with his track record\ncould come up with this rubbish? The fact that it gets good reviews\njust confirms to me that people get dazzled by star names and\ndirectors, and lose their sense of judgement. I can't see any other\nexplanation for an 8.2 IMDb rating.\n"
"\nThe movie shows bad habits and inspires young people to hope for\nsomething like this. Easy money, scams, no moral, no humanity! Maybe\nuse the movie as a bad example. I do not understand why someone would\nlike this movie? This movie could be liked by people that were born\nwith a lot of money, spoiled and search for new ways to be amused. For\nthe rest of the world, we have another important thing, called life.\nAnd in order to live, You have to work, be honest, try hard, no\ncheating, no shortcuts... That's my opinion. Leonardo di Caprio has a\nfew good movies but lately a lot of bad ones. I believe that there are\npeople like this, but I have no idea how do they live with themselves.\nIt is not the life anyone should hope for.\n"
"\nSupporters of this outright horrible movie miss the point. I can watch\nsex and nudity and violence, and can listen to cursing, but I can't\ntolerate pictures that are just outrageous. If I hadn't known that this\nis a Scorcese film, I would have thought it to be Oliver Stone, with\ntotal distortion of truth in business and the reality of doing\nbusiness. Nobody can function daily with that much intake of alcohol\nand drugs. Plus normal people have problems with any story that gives\nthe viewer absolutely no one to root or hope for. My rating is a\nreluctant 1 of 10!<br><br>We watched this mess for one hour and gave up on it. The Dicaprio\nperformance is laughable.\n"
"\nHow IMDb ends up rating this 8+ would make a better story than this\npiece of junk. Scorcese should be ashamed to release this trash. did\nthis really run 3 hours? I wouldn't know because I kept walking way,\nthen coming back, and the same crap was going on, different locale. Sex\nand drugs and money. Really, did we need that for 3 hours to get the\npoint that these a-holes were low life scum that scammed millions and\nloved it? <br><br>No. we didn't need that. I ended up ejecting it after I don't remember\nhow many scenes of masturbation and peeing into waste baskets and\nsimilar ridiculous excuses for movie making. Scorcese - this movie\nsucked. <br><br>The only reason I have it two stars was because the actors did a good\njob portraying their characters. But the director, screenplay writers,\nand the producers let this one get way out of control.<br><br>Skip this piece of junk. It stinks!\n"
"\nI was excited to see this film. The trailer scene with Matthew\nMcConaughey looked fun... but come to find out that was the ONLY scene\nwith MM.<br><br>The entire rest of the movie is scene after scene of drugs and sex and\ndrunken behavior. I'm not puritan, and that's all good and well for a\nmovie like Bachelor Party or The Hangover, but it's not what I expected\nhere. Not to mention the movie is 3 hours long. Had they sold this\nmovie as a slapstick comedy and shaved it to 90-120 minutes, I'd give\nit a different rating.<br><br>Disappointing.\n"
"\nWhat a noisy, stupid movie this is. And repetitive, too. An hour could\nhave been cut from the film with no harm done. It is oddly like a drama\nby Christopher Marlowe, or one of the other lesser Elizabethan\nplaywrights: there is no real plot line, no character development, but\nrather a constant and increasingly frenetic repetition of what has gone\nbefore. The self-indulgence of the whole is reflected in the\nperformances. McConaughey's chest-thumping scene is painful to watch.\nJonah Hill does his usual thing. Leonardo diCaprio smirks his way\nthrough the film, though admittedly that may suit the character. (But\npity those early enthusiasts who referred to the 'lude scene as\n\"brilliant.\") Bright spots are Kyle Chandler as the FBI agent;\nadmittedly I may have liked him because I hoped he would arrest Jordan,\nand cut the movie short. Margot Robbie, however, was unabashedly\nterrific, and really the only reason for watching.\n"
"\nLeonardo DiCaprio is such a Brilliant actor. Everyone in this movie\nperformed nothing short of excellence. Martin Scorsese has done\nwonderful work in this movie as in all his others, in bringing out the\nbest in all characters. I have watched several movies that have won\naccolades for various performances. At the very least,The Wold of Wall\nStreet is as remarkable as other great works. I watched the movie on\nblue-ray but wish the experience in the the theater would have taken\nthe experience to a new level. Prior to watching the movie, I watched\nthe trailer and read about the plot which provide a glimpse only.\nWatching this movie has been gripping, enthralling, captivating and a\ngood learning experience.\n"
"\n** (Spoiler Alert) ** All this movie has is sex, drugs and filthy\nlanguage. There is no actual \"financial\" anything about this movie....\nWaaaaaaaayyyyyyy too much nudity and foul language. This movie should\nhave been rated X not R. The acting was horrible. The plot was so\npredictable. The photography and scenes were pointless and uninspired.\nToo say the very least----&gt; It was a porno.... Who in their right frame\nof mind would make this movie let alone pay to make this movie or even\npay to watch this movie.. I really think that the producers needed to\nreally think this project through before proceeding. I hated it and\nwould not recommend this trash to anyone looking for a decent movie to\nwatch. It was a complete waste of money. I will be completely honest\nwith you. The last few projects Leonardo DiCaprio has down have really\ngone down hill. This one was the icing on the cake. From now on, any\nmovie that comes out with Leo in it... I will know not to see it and\navoid at all cost. Because it will be bad, bad and horribly bad!!!!\n"
"\nThis movie was great.<br><br>There is no boring scenes, all of them are very important. The story of\na man who has nothing and thanks to his intelligence become the king of\nwall street with his unusual tricks to succeed and a team of unexpected\npeople. The energy of the actors, the story, the script, everything is\nbalanced and addictive. it's a smart and funny movie, I love the\nscenebetween Leonardo Di Caprio and his car when he tries to come back\nhome,hilarious, just like when he got hired, he has lunch with one of\nhis new colleague and he asks him to sing a melody hitting the tempo\nwith his hand on his chest, total hilarious, awkward and uncomfortable\nmoment. The movie also shows the deviant aspect of a quick success\nbetween sexual experiences, different partners, lies, friendship, drug\nabuses but always in a funny way. <br><br>I recommend it and I will watch it again. Good job !\n"
"\nDidn't have the charm of a typical Scorsese Movie. Leo did great but\neverything he does and almost the entire move feels one-dimensional. It\nlacks the depth that leads to deeper thinking and reflecting, which I'm\nsure Mr. Scorsese would love the audience to have. People all say Jonah\nHill is great, but I'm not sure he can hold up such a big supporting\nrole against Leo, with all due respect of course. I loved his small\nroles across the board which were all absolutely hilarious, but in this\none, again, I think his role lacks depth too. All said, Matthew\nMcconaughey is absolutely brilliant in his short appearance. I'm glad\nhe and Leo both won Golden Globe, but I'm gonna have to go with him for\nthe Oscar even though Leo is long due for sure.\n"
"\nThree hours is simply too much of a half good thing. Scorsese probably\nwanted to emanate in the montage the coke fueled consciousness of stock\nbroker Di Caprio who can't decide if he wants to portray the main\ncharacter as a parody or as a biography.<br><br>How many drug and sex inspired scenes can one endure in three hours,\nwithout getting bored by the repetition? After the first amusing hour,\nthe movie goes over the top and hysterical and one can't help to be\nrelived of the ramblings. The Wolf of Wall Street wants to be dramatic\nand funny at the same time but only achieves half of both. You'll get a\nfew laughs out of it (mostly out of embarrassment) , but if this wasn't\nannounced as a Scorsese in big letters, one would probably not think\nit's a Scorsese movie in the first place.<br><br>Not 'bad' by any means, but under par for Scorsese.\n"
"\nWhy Leonardo DiCaprio didn't win the Oscar for best actor, I will never\nunderstand. Matthew McConaughey must have put on an absolutely\nindescribable performance in Dallas Buyers Club. I have yet to see\nDallas Buyers Club, so I can't say Matthew didn't deserve it.<br><br>The Wolf of Wall Street is insane though! It is a very well directed\nmovie by my favorite director of all time, Martin Scorsese. This movie\nshows what it was like as a stockbroker in a very unique way as a\ncomedy. However, if it wasn't a comedy, it would be a very boring\nmovie. Well done by the writers.<br><br>This is definitely my favorite movie of all time now. Even at 3 hours\nlong, I wish the movie continued. I would recommend seeing it, but\nchildren should NOT see this movie.\n"
"\nAnyone with a fraction of a brain cell could predict that this film was\none which was bound to be an amazing, from the moment it was announced,\ndue to the extraordinarily talented actors (DiCaprio, Hill, Robbie, and\nMcConaughey), fantastic director (Scorsese), and frankly, ridiculous\nstory of Jordan Belfort.<br><br>Although on the long side, almost every moment of this movie was\nenjoyed, and I would highly recommend it. I would warn that this is\ndefinitely not a family film, and what you can expect from many\nScorsese movies.<br><br>Enjoy.\n"
"\nI'm going to keep this short and sweet, DiCaprio was the main reason I\nwent to watch this film, Scorsese... movie genius but this... this was\ntotal garbage, 2 1/2 hours of swearing, drug abuse, sex... wait there\nwas sex?? 1/2 hour of somewhat suspense, well... Jonah hill was a waste\nof time in that movie, the other characters I have no damn clue what\ntheir soul purpose was in the film, movie lacks substance, its\nfabricated truth, I just don't get why I got sucked into watching it...\nthis movie should be called \"DiCaprio\" cause he's the only reason why\nthis movie was worth watching... I take that back... I wish I never\nwatched it.. Hyped up, Over-Rated... DiCaprio deserved the Grammy\nthough..\n"
"\nwell as we all know this movie is the talk of the world and i was so\nkeen to watch it could not wait, and all i have to say is why?. i have\nseen so much better from all actors and producers. don't get me wrong\nits a good movie but with how much hype and awards this movie is\ngetting its not that good at all i thought it was a biography about\nJordan Belfort, and all it really showed was him running a muck and\nhaving a good time no effort in showing how he got to where he was and\njust about nothing on how he was punished, pretty much it was a ripoff\nof project-x so i rate this movie 5/10 like i said its a good watch but\nnothing to what everyone make it out to be\n"
"\nFirst, the good: DiCaprio does a very good job of portraying a sleazy\nsociopath. It was truly a great performance.<br><br>However, the main problem of this movie was lack of editing. There were\nway too many scenes in which a point was being made or a mood created--\nand this took place in about 20 seconds--a nod to good film making... <br><br>...However, these same scenes then droned on and on for, in some cases,\nover 5 minutes! We get it--he's making a pep-talk speech to his staff--\nwe got that in the first 15 seconds. But why continue the same rah-rah\npep-talk for a full 5 minutes without adding *anything* new?? <br><br>This was just one example of many scenes that got so stale and I kept\nthinking--where was the editor? Why didn't he shave a few minutes off\nthese scenes and keep the pace going?<br><br>So all in all--I felt what could have been a decent movie was just a\nlong, boring slog.\n"
"\nRated R Post... within the first 5 minutes, Leonardo Dicaprio snorts\ncocaine off a hooker's ass. The rest of the movie is just as excessive.\nA spectacular orgy of excess: cocaine, Quaalude, materialism and full\nfrontal female nudity. Check your morals and you might have a good\ntime. But DEFINITELY NOT for everyone.<br><br>Scorcese directs in his usual High NRG style (like \"After Hours\" and\n\"The Color of Money\", the camera never stops moving.) DiCarpio goes all\nout with this character, making him human, though not heroic at all.\nThese are awful people doing awful things, and the film might revel too\nmuch in that, without showing the consequences of it. <br><br>A definite GUY film, probably could complement with Pacino and\nDiPalma's \"Scarface\".\n"
"\nJust back from the wolf of wall street. Its story is based on\nautobiography written by Jordan Belfort. So as is usual with all\nautobiography, the author will portray himself a hero. Its an\nentertaining film but a stupid film. Right from the selling techniques\nof de caprio to the money laundering in swiss banks , everything is too\nconvenient and at times plain stupid.Its supposed to be a dark comedy\nbut the tone is Over the top.De Caprio is good in some scenes and has\noveracted in a lot of scenes. His scene where he has an excessive\neffective of a drug is so loud and drags too much its almost\nirritating.He looks like an overgrown kid with wrinkles. Jonah Hill is\nalso good in some scenes and hammed in many other. Margot Robbie plays\nDe Caprio's wife. Looks hot and acts the best among the cast. I am\nsurprised how it has won so many award nominations, May be due to the\nbig names associated.That is how most of the jury around the world\nworks\n"
"\nI don't understand why this movie has consistently been given high\nratings. The plot can be summed up in 30 minutes, yet the movie is very\nlong. An hour and a half is devoted to establishing Jordan Belfort's\ndebauchery, but it is overkill. We do not need this many scenes\ndepicting his lifestyle. The acting and cinematography are very good,\nbut since it has these two aspects and no plot, it only has two of\nthree very important pieces and does not deserve higher than a 66.\nAdditionally, each time the movie is viewed, Belfort makes money. He is\nonly required to give 50% of his profit to his victims, to whom he\nstill owes millions of dollars.\n"
"\nwell filmed, per the usual for Scorcese, funny in parts, but that's\npart of the problem, funny ha ha about massive greed and addiction??\nThe story is a mess as well, you really don't know why things are\nillegal, people really don't, on screen, suffer much from their\naddictions, there is little here that balances the celebratory with the\ndownside so you never really get a sense of the actual consequences, in\nother words, the artistic message is muddled, characters come and go.\nMostly we are shown a wonderful world of luxury with little real irony,\nno matter the feeble attempts to show the \"downside.\" And what about\nthe shipwreck??? that's a whole story in itself, yet it's treated like\na lark. Maybe it's all suppose to be a cartoon fantasy, but this reeks\nof obtuseness given the massive inequalities in the US. Strange misfire\nfrom Scorcese.\n"
"\nI like movies like Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, Scarface and Wall\nStreet. That doesn't mean I like to see it all combined into a movie\nthat is basically an exploitation flick showing Wall Street guys\ngetting \"fucked up\".<br><br>Essentially this film is about ruthlessness and decadence and very\nlittle else. There are no sympathetic characters, there is no moral\ndilemma, no twists and not even a real story.<br><br>DiCaprio is great and all the other actors are pretty great too and you\nwill enjoy the first half of the movie, laughing about all the crazy\nthings they do. Then you will feel that you just see more crazy \"fucked\nup\" things and not much else. Even when the FBI closes in on DiCaprio's\ncharacter, you don't feel tension, you don't feel sorry for him, nor do\nyou feel satisfaction that he is punished.<br><br>So, I'm all in for the absurd humor of this flick, but it could have\nbeen done in half the time. Yet even then it still lacks any emotional\nanchors for the audience and when the credits roll you just don't care.\nThat can't be what they had in mind...\n"
"\nIf this movie had been sharper and shorter it would have been OK.<br><br>As it is, the fairly rudimentary story of a sort that has been told so\nmany time before is dragged out for three soporific hours.<br><br>DiCaprio is fine in his role, but not great. You see the moves but\nnever feel them. The rest of the characters are cardboard cut outs.<br><br>The nudity is there, I think, to distract viewers and keep them\ntitillated so that the predictable script is accepted.<br><br>With average acting, a mediocre script and too much time it is far from\nthe great movie I was expecting it to be.<br><br>The biggest disappointment of the season.<br><br>I think it is time to go and rent 1987's Wall Street.\n"
"\nOne of the rare occasions when a potentially great film becomes BAD\ncourtesy of its running time. <br><br>I have truly never experienced so much fluff in a movie before. And\nwhat's worse it was totally unnecessary because the material was there\nand it was more than enough. <br><br>I can't even begin to praise the merits of The Wolf of Wall Street (it\ndid have a few) because the redundant scenes and dialogue are too much\nto get over. It's sort of like trying to enjoy a fine steak while tofu\nis being forcibly stuffed down your throat. It's all ruined.<br><br>All and all what a pity. It could have been the best movie of the year\nif only.....\n"
"\nCan't understand why this movie is getting the acclaim that it is\ngetting. Yes, there's many like me who found the three hours\nsquirm-inducing,dull and much in need of an editing scissors. For a\nmuch better choice in the same subject matter, try \"Boiler Room\",\nbetter acting, better story, and much more disciplined direction and\nediting. Although it is contrary to my nature and even though I'm\nwriting a review which is essentially saying that this movie is\noverlong, too wordy, repetitive, and should be edited down to remove\nall the superfluous fluff, I find myself repeating myself here even\nthough my credibility as someone who appreciates conciseness is now in\njeopardy.\n"
"\nI didn't like it, I've seen the hedonist-to-riches-to-rags story\nbefore, as in the bigger they rise the harder they fall, yada, yada,\nyada....<br><br>If they're going to make a movie that pushes the envelope, which this\nmovie does, moviegoers should have as much warning as possible as to\nwhat they are about to endure. Sure, some people might think that \"It's\na Scorsese movie, you know what you're getting into,\" and for some\npeople that's true, but there are people who don't research every movie\nthey go to, and who feel they usually get enough information from a\npreview, or they decide to go spontaneously. More upbeat: the movie had\nsome good irreverent humour.<br><br>At the rate of moral decay on screen, we will be watching porn on the\nbig screen in just a few years now. My feeling on the matter is that I\ncan stay at home and jerk off to porn for free, so why do I want to pay\nmoney to go see porn in the theatre.\n"
"\nJordan Belfort scammed the public for MONEY, SEX &amp; DRUGS! DiCaprio &amp;\nScorcese are no different !!! This movie was solely about making MONEY.\nIt's filth, Smut and Pornography sold as \"art\" in the name of freedom\nof speech.<br><br>No GREAT Actor/Director/Producer or Critic would sell their soul for\nMONEY, they don't have to..<br><br>You have a voice. BOYCOTT DiCaprio &amp; Scorcese and others like them!\nShow Hollywood, you have had enough<br><br>This movie was an \"X\" not an \"R\" rating. Shame on those who rated this\nMovie<br><br>1/3 of the people left the Lowes theater I went to. Some left in 15\nminutes others 1/2 hour. I too left after I realized the foul language\nand scenes weren't going to stop. The lobby had quite a few people\nasking for their money back. From viewers reviews, it appears other\ntheaters had similar results.\n"
"\nThe Wolf of Wall Street is a black comedy, giving hints of drama.\nNatural comparisons will fly to Oliver Stone's Wall Street which is\naccurate but you can see subtle hints of films like Trading Places,\nGlengarry Glen Ross, and even American Psycho. That's a testament to\nScorsese's outstanding direction and Terence Winter's masterful\nscreenplay. Scorsese keeps Wolf life-size, sprinkled with characters\nthat are both geniuses and morons, but functioning morons. They're like\nthe frat pack group that sat in a corner on my college campus, being\nloud and obnoxious, and made terrible life choices that they still\naren't aware of until this day. Scorsese puts together an all-star cast\nto inhabit these beings that includes DiCaprio, Jonah Hill, Margot\nRobbie, Matthew McConaughey, Jon Bernathal, and Kyle Chandler. All of\nwhich seem to be having the time of their lives.\n"
"\nI've seen this movie twice. I have done it because I still do not\nunderstand what he wants to tell me. All I see is sex and drugs. Does\nScorsese really mean to me that this world is just that? Are we still\nlike this? I think I'm not the only person who knows people who work in\nthe bag and they do not seem at all. I have become so bored that the\nsecond time I had a hard time seeing it and it becomes eternal.<br><br>I love DiCaprio and I think it's great, like all the actors. The\nproblem is that they do not know where they are going.<br><br>I do not like his address, I never liked it and this time it was not\ngoing to be less. But this time the photography is not good, at least\nin the street.<br><br>The worst thing is that you can not say much more, because the film so\nlittle inwardly that you can not criticize much.\n"
"\nI have mixed feelings about this picture. I expected great things\nbecause of the critical acclaim and viewers' response that it received\nand it stars Jonah Hill and Leo DiCaprio both of whom I am a big fan\nof. Did it deliver? Yeah kind of I guess. I mean it was wickedly funny\nand the acting really was convincing,Oscar-worthy even. But to say it\nwas overrated is a bit of an understatement. The negatives were that\nfirstly, it dragged and dragged- in fact, it could have been half as\nlong and still achieved everything. Secondly, I felt that it glorified\nthis disgusting, greedy and hedonistic behaviour. I know this sounds\nreally lame, but I like a movie to have a message at the end. But you\ndidn't get that with this one. Finally, I felt that nothing much\nhappened. They had tons of sex. Did tons of drugs. Got richer.<br><br>Maybe because I'm a teenage girl I didn't full appreciate it for what\nit was but I feel that this is one of those films that guys would like\nmore than girls. A pretty good film but I would probably not watch it\nagain any time soon.\n"
"\nSelf-indulgent film that glorifies instead of satirizing the excess.\n40-50% could have been cut and the movie would have been better for it.\nEndlessly repetitive and not even remotely believable party scenes, as\nif all the apparent idiots in the audience had not yet fully grasped\nthe idea that these characters were a group of truly awful people\nincapable of evolution or redemption. No motivation to keep watching. I\nwas done after the scene when Jordan was so loaded he could not walk\ndown the country club's stairway. I was so looking forward to his being\nkilled in a one-car accident after he crawled into his Porsche, and\nthat would finally put an end to this movie. No such luck, but\nthankfully, there is a stop button on my remote. So glad I didn't waste\nmy money going to the theater for this one.\n"
"\nI had a co-worker raving about this movie for weeks. I had heard it was\nessentially porn with a story, but for lack of better judgment, I\nwatched it (and should have quit after the first 10 minutes; I want the\n3 hours of my life back!). This movie should have been 90 minutes, not\n3 hours plus! (just removing the F-bombs would have cut it down to 2\nhours ;) ) There needed to be an editor for this sleaze-fest! There\nwere some funny lines/scenes, which is the only reason I didn't rate it\n1. Scorsese seems to like to portray people who have no redeeming\nqualities (like the boxer in Raging Bull), and seems to have a habit of\ndragging his movies out way too long! If you are into porn, drugs, and\nprofanity, you will love this movie!\n"
"\nThis movie is a crap, a real crap. How is possible many people to\npraise it. It does not even deserve a second from you time to watch it.\nBoring plot, it is really bad. Better watch a puppet show than this.\nWallstreet? where is the Wallstreet guys? show it! the trading, the\nstock, where are they. Lower Manhattan style... Totally bad movie, real\ntrash. No catchy soundtrack, bad actors selection. Bad\ndirector....................what this kind of movies are still being\nmade is the question? Some trashy pop-culture, \"cool drunk\nstuff\".........what else. this movie does not offer something more that\nthat.\n"
"\nMuch like a tired prostitute downtown this movie tried too hard but got\nnowhere. The story, while not inherently bad, was non-descript and\nreasonably predictable from the movie summary listed online. Somehow it\nstill took 3 hours to squeeze in every possibly ounce of tired tropes.\nGuy has money. Guy likes drugs and women. Guy progresses through a\ntypical set of circumstances from that point forward. Why this movie\nhas received this degree of celebration and praise is beyond me.\nHalfway through you don't notice nudity or drugs because it blends into\nthe background. While I can respect that as an artistic choice in this\ncase it just seemed like they added a half cup too many boobs, and a\ntablespoon too much coke to the film recipe and no one had the heart to\ntell them. After an hour I started watching the clock, wondering how\nmuch longer they could stretch this story out. It's very, very rare\nthat after a movie I have that feeling of frustration at an evening\nwasted. In this case I can resoundingly say that I wasted my night on\nthis particular movie.\n"
"\nThe Wolf of Wall Street 75<br><br>This film as a whole was very good. But I expected much more of a\nserious, dark story of greed, power, and immorality and the path that\nthis can take a person on. This did portray greed, power, and morality\nissues very well, but I was expecting a much more uprising of Leo's\ncharacter in the end, which did not happen. Martin Scorsese, one of the\nbest director's of our time, did bring a very interesting story, that\ndid keep me intrigued for the most part, even at nearly 3 hours long,\nit just didn't go very developed into the harsh consequences of all of\ntheir choices. And as an entirety, the movie was kind of offensive,\nwith 504 f- bombs, constant drug use, and casual sex. Nevertheless, it\nwas well acted, with Leonardo DiCaprio and Jonah Hill being hilarious,\nand was funny, interesting, and intriguing. I was really expecting this\nto be one of the best movies I've ever seen, but was just let down by\nthe ending.\n"
"\nI had heard some negative things about the movie, but finally ended up\nseeing it on a flight. its a long movie but doesn't feel like one.\ndicaprio acts brilliantly yet again. the movie is a true story of a\nwall street guy, and depicts his journey to the top; its a telling\ncommentary on human greed. the fact that it was a true story somehow\nmade a bigger impact on me. a valuable insight i got from the movie was\nhow most of us are suckers as far as aggressive salespeople are\nconcerned. they can cheat us, and yet keep selling to us again and\nagain ! such is our greed and meekness ! scorcese is great at making\nbiopics\n"
"\nThe wolf is brilliant with its fangs; however it veers sometime from\nthe main drama of Wall street; too much sex and drug abuse gives an\nundesirable image of Wall street; Caprio and Scorsese are brilliant; I\nfelt the single concept of Stone's Wall street to be more riveting; the\nfilm is too long and at times repetitive;...on the whole a valuable\nexperience of human traits. 'Money brings in all kinds of comforts as\nwell as problems' has been brilliantly portrayed. The ensemble acting\nis very good. Martin known for his gangster films tackles the financial\nracket with equal poise and is in total control. it gives at times a\nlittle bad taste with its explicit immorality in the money market;\nhowever the human greed is well brought out.\n"
"\nI'm very far to be an expert, so my opinion is just the one of a\n\"common person\" who watches movies in the night to have fun / enjoy\nsome time. My opinion is that the movie is very attracting, it's fast\nand you don't get bored. There is a good plot and when you can get lost\nor bored, there are some scenes that make you laugh or, anyway, catchy\nenough to catch again your attention. Anyway, after 2 hours, I have to\nsay that I've started to look at the watch, because I was tired. That's\nit. It was absolutely enough, without removing anything special to the\nplot, to have a 2 hours movie. Di Caprio is absolutely great, but the\nother main characters are great, too. My vote would have been 9 without\ndoubts.\n"
"\nThe movie breaks the record for number of f-words (506 in number). So\ntrue you can expect for a Scorsese's movie. Leonard gives the best\nperformance in his career. Matt Mc and Dujardin are brief and are\nsuperb. Jonah Hill was very good. This 3 hour movie is filled with so\nmuch energy and comedy dialogs (of course with profanity). As other\nScorsese's films, there is a whole lot of description on drugs. There\nwere three major comedy scenes that were hilarious. Few others were\nforced. <br><br>Pros : Strong acting, direction and screenplay. Cons : Too much xxx\norgy, excessive drugs and profanity. Some bad humor.<br><br>In short, the movie is recommended for fans of Scorsese. For others:\ndon't waste your time on this!!\n"
"\nI saw the movie Wolf of Wall Street and I didn't think it was that\ngreat like everyone has been saying it is. I saw lots of parallels\nbetween that movie and the movie Goodfellas (1990) from the same\ndirector - Scorcese. The same kind of voice-over, the same kind of\ncharacters, plot movements, etc. Scorcese was copying himself, which I\nthought was really really weak from such a renowned director. Like no\noriginal ideas in this one, just a lot of naked women added to it. I\nthink the naked women shocked American audiences and made the movie be\nmore remarkable here, but it's really not that good of a movie. The\ncrooked shenanigans that the traders were doing on Wall Street stock\nexchanges to make tons of money so fast were phony and faked-very\nunrealistic and exaggerated. DiCaprio's acting was over the top, which\nI liked a lot that he could do that. That was the best part of the\nmovie for me, was watching him.\n"
"\nVery rarely a movie comes which is entertaining yet disappointing. The\nWolf Of Wall Street makes you wonder why there was a need to tell a\nstory about a personality like Jordan Belfort. Jordan isn't a hero or a\nrole model whose life should be celebrated or emulated. He made tons of\nmoney illegally, disrespected the law and the system, abused drugs and\nhad multiple sex partners. There is no reason to why he did it and\nnothing extraordinary about how he did it. The movie is about Jordan\nhaving no limits. He did whatever he wanted and how much he wanted.\nThere is no greatness about his life or a lesson to be learned. Sure,\nthe movie is filled with fun, humor and brilliant performances, but for\na biopic, it could have been about a hero.\n"
"\nThe stupid success stories ... It's a stupid message that links success\nto prostitution and drug use and makes them innocent. If you have a lot\nof time to spare, and you can get rid of it, get ready for a 3 hour\ntorture. The fact that such a bad film score so much encourages\nproducers to use only eroticism. And this is not a human look. It's\nsad..\n"
"\nI guess if you had never met anyone like that, the characters in this\nmovie might shock and surprise you. I guess if you didn't already know\nthat sh*tty soulless sociopaths run the world this movie might be edgy\nfor you. Ignorance is bliss. Martin Scorsese is a master film maker.\nOver time we have seen that he has a fascination with the American\nexperience, specifically with the lives of Americans who make their\nfortunes outside of the law. I get it. Martin is doing just fine. The\nWolf Of Wall Street is well directed well acted well written and worthy\nof whatever praise and accolades it can gather. My only complaint is\nthat sociopaths are sh*tty boring people and their stories are unworthy\nof glory. Empathy kicks ass! Mr. Scorsese make a movie of that.\n"
"\nThis movie was interesting,educational and at the same time very very\nfunny. Great performance by Leo as expected!! In my opinion this movie\nwas one of Leo less better movies especially when you consider titles\nsuch as Blood diamond, Inception, Catch me if you can and last but not\nleast Titanic. Which was a great movie. <br><br>One of the things that stood out to me the most in this movie was how\nLeo' character went from a humble, down to earth and loving individual.\nTo a corrupt, self loathing criminal. It really shocked me what money\ncan do to people and how much you can downgrade the people around you.<br><br>All and all great movie! 8/10.\n"
"\nThis is one of the most overrated movies I have ever seen. I can only\ndescribe it as boring and simply overrated. For one, the movie is\nsimply too long. They could have left a whole lot of scenes on the\nediting table. <br><br>I think I have never really been much of a fan of M Scorcese, I did\nreally enjoy Malavita / The Family, but many of his other recent movies\nwere not my favorites. This movie is a new low. Even the sex is\nboring... The movie is tedious, too much talking about nothing (and the\ndialogs aren't all that super either), predictable, drugs and sex seem\nto be an end instead of a means for the story to be told (and as I\nsaid, even the sex is boring). Even DiCaprio could not save this\nincredibly cr*p movie.\n"
"\nWe attended this film with several family members of different genders,\nvarying ages and jobs. We ALL were sorely disappointed (disgusted,\nactually). The previews and notoriety of the cast create a false idea\nof quality and content. Thus, we were \"scammed\" into paying for\ntickets. We hoped it would be a well-acted, intriguing depiction of\ncorruption on Wall St. Basically, it's vile, exaggerated, over-the-top\nand monotonous -- not to mention awkward. This film seems to be all\nabout gratuitous sex and drug use -- sadly, it's more fantasy and less\nreality. It's hard to watch the childish, dumb and dumber behavior of\nthe characters. It's an insult to viewers. This film is skating by due\nto it's well-known director and popular actors. Basically, it brings\ndown the level of film making on many levels. I hope it's seen for what\nit is -- offensive nonsense.\n"
