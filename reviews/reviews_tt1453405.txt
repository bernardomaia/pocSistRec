"\nMonsters University is the prequel to Monsters inc., a wildly popular\nanimation by Pixar. It's basically a college movie set in the monster\nworld, but with a nice deviation from the standard.<br><br>The good. Still the same incredibly interesting world with all its\ncolors, fantastic creatures, and quirks. Interesting story, especially\nfor the twist. Great animation, as usual. Easily enjoyable by adults.\nPerfect ending. Excellent voice acting.<br><br>The bad. Lots of college movie, underdogs, and jocks versus nerds\nclichés.<br><br>The ugly. Nothing.<br><br>The result. If you liked the first one, you'll like this one too.\n"
"\nMonsters, Inc. was the first Pixar movie where I saw their genius. Such\nan incredible mix of themes and emotions. From the basic premise of\n\"humanizing\" monsters to the tiny details in Boo's behavior that I did\nnot notice until I had a daughter of my own, it was beautiful and\noriginal.<br><br>My top Pixar movies are (in no particular order) Finding Nemo,\nMonsters, Inc., Wall-E and The Incredibles. These are movies that\nactually mean something to me.<br><br>Monsters University is definitely better than Cars 2 and Brave, but I\ndid not find that \"magic ingredient\" in it. If anything, it was\nformulaic - the same old story retold for the millionth time.<br><br>It was certainly nice to see Sully and Mike again and see how they\nbecame friends, but the story was rather shallow with little character\ndevelopment (I would have loved to see Randall's evolution for\nexample).\n"
"\nI generally hate prequels. The suspense isn't there because you know\nthe future and they are usually poorly made to boot.<br><br>This is an exception. We already like the characters and they made it\nexciting and somehow put in suspense. You really don't know how the\nwhole thing will unfold and the end is not what you expect.<br><br>Generally, in this sort of movie, Mike and Sully would have triumphed,\nwon the competition and become the stars of the school but they didn't\nfollow this cliché and I liked that.<br><br>They showed that you can fail at one thing and still succeed. I enjoy\nthis much more than most kids' movies.\n"
"\nIt has been 12 years since John Goodman and Billy Crystal voiced the\noriginal star characters. You would think by now Pixar could have come\nup with a better story. The premise is in the title, the story is non\nexistent.<br><br>Perhaps Mike doesn't see how bad this is because he is looking at it\nthrough one big eye. The 3D up charge is wasted on Mike and everyone\nelse. The movie is long for a animated feature and it feels long and\nredundant with scare games, scare contests and scarcely anything\nhappening.<br><br>The good news is it isn't very scary and got a \"G\" rating. The bad news\nis there isn't much there for the adult in the audience. It is not\nfunny.<br><br>There is a message about cheating and consequences but it gives the\nimpression so what if you are kicked out of college. So what if there\nis nothing to this prequel except a big box office.\n"
"\nHaving really enjoyed Monsters Inc when I was younger, I was pleasantly\nsurprised when I heard that there was going to be a prequel released.<br><br>It was interesting to see how all the characters had met and what their\nfriendships were like in the earlier days. The film has a good simple\nplot and is perfect for the whole family to enjoy as there is also some\nfunny parts as well as heartwarming moments. It was great that Mike and\nSulley (the two main characters) had the same voice-overs as the\noriginal film, this made it feel more authentic.<br><br>Overall I really enjoyed this film, but then who doesn't love a good\nDisney Pixar film? <br><br>8/10\n"
"\nMonsters University: the prequel that no one asked for, but everyone\nwill watch. It would appear that Pixar has recently run out of original\nideas and has resorted to making sequels and prequels of older more\nsuccessful movies (Cars 2, Planes, Monsters U and Finding Dory). That\nbeing said, the film was actually pretty decent and was rather\nwatchable and enjoyable. The film had multiple unexpected twists, which\navoided having an all too predictable ending. It also explained many of\nthe features of its sequel, like Randall's rivalry with Mike and Sully\nand the Abominable Snowman. <br><br>Reviving the voice talents of Billy Crystal, John Goodman and Steve\nBuscemi and adding Helen Mirren and Charlie Day, amongst others, this\nfilm stayed within the universe that the original movie had created,\nhowever in comparison failed to live up to its predecessor's greatness.\n"
"\nThis film continues a downward trend at Pixar, whose movies have\ndeclined measurably in quality, especially since being purchased by\nDisney.<br><br>For a sequel, Monsters University makes an earnest effort, and is\nreasonably watchable. But there's not enough meat in the haphazard plot\nto really capture the viewer's imagination. The themes are childish and\nfamiliar.<br><br>Technically, the film looks good, as expected. The voice acting from\nCrystal and Goodman are as good as you would expect.<br><br>There's just not a lot else I can say about a sequel to a film which I\nalways thought was a weaker entry in Pixar's catalog.\n"
"\nThe cruddy trailer hardly filled me with hope for this belated prequel\nto Monsters, Inc., and the relatively laugh-free first thirty minutes\ndid little to change my mind; however, once Mike and Sully and their\nOozma Kappa fraternity brothers enter the Scare Games, the film really\npicks up and the laughs start to come thick and fast. By the time the\nend credits were rolling, Monsters University had given me lots of\ngiggles and even a few genuine belly laughs and I'd completely altered\nmy opinion: the oft-used 'under-dogs do good' plot may not be as fresh\nas the original, but overall I reckon the film is well worth watching.<br><br>Some of the best moments are clever one-liners and subtle fleeting\nvisual gags which could go unseen, or over the head of younger viewers,\nbut that gives the film repeat value; I hope to catch even more funny\nstuff the second time around after I proudly add the DVD to my Pixar\ncollection.<br><br>A very respectable 8/10 (If there had been more funny moments in the\nfirst half-an-hour or so, this would have been right up there with\nPixar's finest).\n"
"\nI really loved Monsters Inc, but this movie failed to meet\nexpectations. Yes, it offers a little back story on two of the most\nmemorable characters of all time, but I was not attached to them like I\nwas during the first movie. The best scenes are at the end when Roz\nmakes an appearance...Mike and Sully are great characters, but in the\nfirst one, you had some minor characters who made the movie much more\ncharming (Roz, Boo, etc...) and I just didn't find myself growing any\nattachment to Mike's college nerd buddies. A good movie and maybe would\nbe much more entertaining to someone who hasn't seen the first (little\nkids would giggle at the monsters I'm sure), but this movie misses the\nmark.\n"
"\nI just prepared for something more all these times after monsters\ncompany. It supposed to be a monsters world with some unique\ncharacteristics that tell the whole story beyond human things,but\nunfortunately \"Monsters University\" wasn't a good second tale about\nthem,also with many goofs about the background of Mike and Sullivan\nwhich my 7 years daughter also noticed it!. But making joke about some\nold fashion universities legitimation,some crazy honored clubs and\ncircles aren't bad at all.Somehow the whole story lowered as some teens\nmovies about going to college and hell of being a freshman.I just hope\nnobody suggest it as Oscar Nominated animation of year!\n"
"\nThis movie brings back the characters we loved from the previous one\nand gives us a nice throwback to their beginnings. Typical\ncollege-laughs and situations that can be extremely related to reality\nmakes both kids and adults enjoy and laugh from the very first minute\nto the end. A very G rated approach to college life sytle with the\nbully-juggies, the studying guy, pretty girls, outcasts, goths amongst\nmany others. Pixar really never fails to amaze me. Like in their\nprevious movies, every little detail is thought and applied form the\nmain characters to the background settings of the movie. An absolute\ngo-see. Oh, and parents, don't go and throw your children to the\nmovies, you might as well enjoy it!\n"
"\nIt's always been said that second parts are never good. However; Pixar\nis an exception to the rule. First with Toy Story 2, and Toy Story 3\nboth moving stories from the point of view of children and adults.\nRealizing how hard is to grow up. Now with Monsters University they\ntake you to a world full of fantasy where Mike Wazowski is the perfect\nmetaphor of a person who follows his dreams, and even exceeds his own\nexpectations. Trying to become a Professional Scarer, he finds his way\nto become the best coach at Monsters University. A touching movie that\nteaches you that if you never learn to be scare you will never learn to\nbe brave.\n"
"\n\"Monsters University\" has my vote for the most unnecessary prequel,\nstory-wise at the very least. If Mike Wazowski is working at Monsters\nInc. in the original movie, then this movie's ending is a foregone\nconclusion; he'll either triumph over adversity or find a loophole. <br><br>It's got a pretty good cast, but Charlie Day steals the movie easily\n(and it's not the first time). But it lacks the heart and soul of the\noriginal. Even Ratzenberger feels shoehorned in, and he's the studio's\nquirky Easter egg. It's not a weak effort because a lot of work went\ninto this. But the story's deeply lacking.<br><br>5/10\n"
"\nMonster university is simply put an amazing film why? Because it has a\nlittle something for every one . I will be soon going to an graduate\nschool so i could relate to the majority of the references and gags. <br><br>But most important it does not have a traditional animated ending .\nThis is one of the times where there truly is an adult life lesson.<br><br>After endless generic fantasy endings I could say one of the best end\nsegments in the history of Pixar.<br><br>If you try hard , success is not always assured But you can enjoy these\nsmall moments and make the most of it . Eventually you will achieve\nSuccess by thinking in the right direction positively.<br><br>I could watch over and over and still laugh especially at the O K\n\"Initiation\" Part . Its simply priceless\n"

"\nThe first Monsters Inc film came out when I was 10 having this film\ncome out in 2013 with me going to University feels so right and is\nproof that these films are made for adults as well as kids. The film\nitself is a great story of the friendship between the impeccable duo\nMike and Sully when they weren't on good terms with each other although\nwe know what the outcome is, the journey throughout the movie of these\n2 characters is great to witness. Although the film never really\ncaptures what University life is like and never really relying on funny\nmaterial from that scenario it instead creates a funny cast of\nmemorable monsters. Although it isn't as good as the first film\nMonsters University is a great nostalgic throwback to my childhood.\nJust like Toy Story 3 and most likely the eagerly anticipated Finding\nDory.\n"
"\nI couldn't wait for this movie to come out. I've been watching the\ntrailers for so long it was great to finally go. I went with two 8 year\nolds and it didn't disappoint!!!! Didn't hear a peep out of either of\nthem. Held their attention from start to finish. Mine too. Great story\nwith Characters we already love. No, there is no BOO! Remember this is\na prequel. (Everyone asks that question)It was great to see how Sully\nand Mike came to be friends. Also how some rivalries were begun. Gives\na true College feel for animated monsters. LOL. The new characters are\ngreat I hope we can look forward to a trilogy from Monsters!! I think\nthis is one for all ages to enjoy. Humor for all. A summer time must\nsee movie!!!\n"
"\nOnce again we see the Monster's University main characters of Sully and\nMike. As they were not the best of friends. This takes place twelve\nyears prior to Monsters Inc.<br><br>As both were enrolled as students at the Monster's University to become\nbetter scarer's. But Mike is anything but scary and Sully is relying on\nhis family's name to be a great scare type monster. That is what makes\nit so great as both have vulnerabilities.<br><br>But also they were enemies and tried to compete with one another. Until\nthey are forced to face reality and with a bunch of other misfits like\nthem, in particular Mike. They enter into the university's own Olympics\nto prove that they belong in the scare program. After both of them are\nkicked out over their overzealousness for being at the top.<br><br>Both must put aside their differences and work together...as a team.\nEnding is a bit bittersweet but it will set up for Monster's Inc twelve\nyears later.<br><br>Cute movie and Pixar proves they are unstoppable once again!\n"
"\nI watched this movie last night and loved it! it's probably my favorite\nmovie, and I watch lots of movies( but I usually say that every movie\nis my favorite movie-this movie beats them all). I only watched\nMonsters Inc. about two weeks ago, probably because I was born in the\nyear that movie came out, s obviously I didn't see it. But, Monsters\nUniversity really made me want to have another movie like it. It's\nabout MIke Wizowski's dream of being a scarer and he goes to\nMU,Monsters University, to learn. But, he gets kicked out of the scare\nprogram, like James Sulivan (they don't like each other yet).Mike forms\na scare team for the scare games, which included monsters that you'd\nnever think would make it, so he could get back in the scare program\n(he made a deal). I'm not going to say anymore(I know this kind of\nspoiled it), because you have to watch it yourself. It's the best! So,\nif you're thinking of which movie to watch, but you're unsure, choose\nthis movie, because you will be pleased. &lt;3\n"
"\nDan Scanlon directs Pixar's sequel to MONSTERS, INC. That cuddly\none-eyed monster Mike Wazowki (Billy Crystal) and his eccentric pal\nJames P. Sullivan (John Goodman) discuss their underdog fraternity days\nat college. The mismatched combo started off as bitter rivals, but\nslowly become best buds in an inseparable friendship. <br><br>This is a high quality animated romp with top notch cinematography.\nMaybe fewer belly laughs than the original, but absolutely nothing\nobjectionable, albeit the youngest of viewers might be scared by some\nof the images. Nonetheless, even grandparents can find enough to enjoy.\nHow can you find time to be scared, when you're laughing!<br><br>Crystal and Goodman get help with other talented voices like: Steve\nBuscemi, Bobby Moynihan, Dave Foley, Helen Mirren, Alfred Molina, Peter\nSohn, Joel Murray, Bonnie Hunt and Charlie Day.\n"
"\nI like the Monsters University but it should not be considered as\nMonsters Inc. 2 considering I'm sure everyone agrees Monsters Inc. 2\nshould consist on what happens after Sully opens boos door in the first\nMonsters Inc. seriously Pixar ends the movie like that makes everyone\nwant to know and expect there to be a sequel and then they say its\ncoming and its not even a sequel to the first movie.....the only thing\ni am very disappointed in Pixar about doing. Toy Story at least has a\nfollowing story of what happens next and cars but what about the whole\nMonsters Inc. instead of going back in time and calling it Monseters\nInc. 2 why not make an actual Monsters Inc. 2......and leave Monsters\nUniversity as just that.\n"
"\nExplores the origins of the Monsters Inc. universe when Sully and Mike\nweren't always the best of friends. Central to the experience, is the\natmosphere. Pixar picked the perfect art style, with meticulous life-\nlike attention to detail but also lots of color and personality. The\nanimation is top-notch and it looks fantastic. It's thrilling, full of\npersonality and entertaining the whole way through.<br><br>It doesn't have the same innovation that the original had, so I'm less\ninterested in rewatching it. It does follow the bandwagon of tropes in\ncollege frat movies: jocks vs nerds, book smarts vs. innate talent,\nunderdog vs. groomed successor and so on. But it promotes good morals\nof friendship and honesty for children.\n"
"\nThe first one hour of the movie is full of cliché and seems very\nchildish.When i saw the twist,it became interesting and i started to\nlike it.This movie is full of cliché and forced humor but doesn't make\nit dull to the end.Mike's intellect impressed me when they scare police\nin the room.Mikes teammates provide most of the humor and punches,which\ni liked very much.One thing which may be embarrassing to even grown ups\nwhen grand pa get engaged and he babbles some dialogs about\nbrother/husband. Most strong point of the movie is its story line which\namazingly keeps the flow of movie impressively.Best thing about the\nHollywood writers these days are that they squeeze lot of content in\nless duration say 1:30 or 1:40. so the verdict is ,some parts may sound\nsilly but overall its a lite entertainment which can be enjoyed by\neveryone.\n"
"\nSo so, neither better nor worse. But I think the movie is not very\ninteresting for me, maybe there are a lot of college movies that\ntalking about friendship, underdogs and how curve wrecker be the number\none in the school.<br><br>Dream is an amazing and wonderful thing. One-eyed Mike became a college\nstudent with hoping. In the beginning, even though the career was not\nsmoothly, his teacher told him \"You cannot be the scarer, you looks not\nscare.\" He didn't surrender. However he determined to attend a\ncompetition. At first, his friends didn't trust him, and told him we\ncan't do that. But so what? Mike overcame the difficulties again and\nagain and finally his team got the top one.<br><br>Life is different from the movie. In reality, you maybe not lucky\nenough, but you also have to do your best.<br><br>P.S. The snail is funny, lol.\n"
"\nCute, inoffensive family fare; it's nice to get back in touch with two\nof my favorite Pixar characters, but this film is so light, airy and\nspacious I couldn't help wondering if we all might have been better\nserved by a short featurette. Most of the returning secondary cast is\nrelegated to brief cameos - particularly Steve Buscemi's serpentine\nvillain Randall, who pops in and out in a set of very brief flashes -\nand their replacements generally play one note at best. In its heart,\nMonsters U is dying to mimic the kind of campus-friendly formula\nperfected by Animal House and Revenge of the Nerds, but it's kneecapped\nby a much younger target audience and the cast feels almost universally\nshoehorned into unfamiliar terrain. It enjoys some lively moments and a\nfew solid laughs, plus the banter between Goodman and Crystal is as\nsharp as ever, but the scope feels much, much smaller than the\npreceding Monsters Inc. and the story never really shifts out of first\ngear.\n"
"\nMonsters University is a pretty decent movie but it lacks a lot of the\ncharm the first film had. I think a lot of that has to do with how\noriginal the story was initially and how that unique element is lost a\nbit in further iterations. I think Boo provided a lot of the charm in\nthe first movie as well. It wasn't so obvious until watching a movie\nwithout her. Obviously Mike and Sully were both great but the\ncompetition with which the film is built upon feels a little weak. I\nknow, it's a children's movie, but that's kind of the problem. While\nMonsters, Inc. was a film that the adults could appreciate, this one is\nmore of a pure kiddy flick. It's still entertaining to a certain extent\nbut without a lot of the depth from the first one, it's ultimately just\na fun kids movie and not much more.\n"
"\nwatched MONSTER UNIVERSITY ..it sure bring back lots of memories..&amp; I\nloved it(both movie n those memories) &amp; you'll love it too..cause this\nfilm rocks...generally when they(makers) try to make a sequel of a\nsuccessful film(for the money) they usually ruins it plus its\nprequel..due to lack of creativity cause their only motivation remains\nis_\"make it n sell it\" BUT that's not the case with MU..it sure did\ncome after a long time BUT it was worth it people behind it worked\nthoroughly hard on the film, its plot, characters n their outlook I\ndon't have much to say now..just its a good film..better than its\nprequel..&amp; fans will love it..even people who haven't watched the\nprequel will enjoy it...its a Fun Family Film <br><br>ergo its a _MUST WATCH\n"
"\nI have a 9 year old daughter and when this came out in the theater she\ndidn't want to see it because she thought monsters were scary. Well\nneedless to say I got her to watch the first one at home and then she\nwouldn't stop talking about seeing University. She was confused at\nfirst because this takes place before the original but once I explained\nthings to her she understood and LOVED the rest of the movie. I loved\nit too, not only because I saw how happy my daughter was but because it\nwas a GREAT \"prequil\" to the original I saw. I give this a full thumbs\nup. I would recommend you take your kids to see this or buy the video\nwhen it comes out because it's WORTH it. If not to let your children\nenjoy but to have in your collection.\n"
"\nI love Pixar, and one of my favorite movies is Monsters Inc. So i was\nreally looking forward to it. It didn't quite measure up to the\noriginal, but it is still an enjoyable film. The only thing i didn't\nlike was that it was an unoriginal story, it was, essentially, revenge\nof the nerds with monsters. That kind of disappointed me. Pixar has\nsucceeded because of their fantastic storytelling, and that definitely\nwas the worst part. Other than that, it was funny, and heartwarming,\nthings that normally see from pixar. Billy Crystal and John Goodman\nwere great with the voice work. I certainly find it better that Brave,\nand Cars 2, so its a step in the right direction for pixar, after 2\ndecent attempts. I give it a solid 8/10.\n"
"\nI feared Pixar had finally spoiled their creative touch and had come\ndown with a terrible case of sequelitis... but then I actual saw\n\"Monsters University.\" This film is a joy to experience from beginning\nto end. It's utterly gorgeous on a technical level sure, but it also\ntranscends the various clichés that could have been with such a\ntouched- on premise. The result is a special film that more than does\nthe terrific \"Monsters Inc\" justice. A really thrilling prequel, always\nfunny and exciting, that takes the clichéd premise of overcoming our\nown limits and turns it into endless fun - and it will leave you sure\nthat Pixar is finally back on track after its two previous weak,\nforgettable entries.\n"
"\nThis is an unique idea to transform monsters to be something educated.\nHow human can be their objective of learning and the biggest dream to\naward the scariest monster ever. Viewers perhaps find the different\nfilming between Monsters University and Monsters Inc. Monsters\nUniversity is more dramatic. Kids can lost the original story because\nof boring conversations on the middle, but the colorful screen and the\nhumorous quotations help kids to imagine what coming next and what is\nthe ending becoming to. The ending is simply mysterious, because some\ncharacters are mentally developed, not only Mike (the one eye). Mike is\nthe trigger to present the genuine of each characters beside him. The\ngood characters become vanished and the evil characters replace the\nmain roles. The ideology that cartoon is always happy-ending perhaps\ncan't stand in Monsters University because Monsters University delivers\nthe new pop ideology. Kids, you should learn from the Monsters! :)\n"
"\nSome of you people are going to hate me on this one.But its just my\nsilly personal opinion.During the summer of 2013 I was over excited to\nsee the long awaited (twelve years) prequel to Monsters Inc.However it\nwas as soon as I watched it.<br><br>First off, the plot is just one big cliché of other colleague films,\nlike Revenge of the Nerds.<br><br>Secondly the characters,they transformed Sulley from a kind and care\nloving monster into a stereotypical dumb jock and Mike into a\nstereotypical smart ass.<br><br>Third the jokes,most of the jokes in this film just fall flat.<br><br>At least if it was released in 2003,it would have gotten more likes.\n"
"\nI am definitely not the type of person would bug without any reason.In\nfact i'm pretty kind-hearted when it comes to rating movies.I\nabsolutely loved Cars 2.Much more then Cars.Brave was amazing as well.I\ndidn't hate it.But unfortunately,i can't do that with MU.Now it feels\nlike Pixar lost it's magic.The movie was very simple.I do like simple\nthings but not in animated movies.The whole movie was spent on just a\nstupid game.Pixar's movies had something we could learn,something we\ncould talk.There was a scene always,where it felt like everything's\ngoing to fall apart,and then there would be that motivational\nscene,where the main leads would muster up the courage and do once\nagain.Obviously i missed Boo.Another thing what i think is\nnecessary,that there should be a female lead along with the male in\nevery animation.Don't get me wrong but almost every movie with both\nleads have been very successful.Among their group,not a single was a\nwoman.A woman character definitely add up excitement to a movie.Sorry\nfolks,but this didn't work for me.\n"
"\nIt had been years since I watched Monsters Inc. so I wasn't sure how\nI'd react to watching this prequel. It actually is quite funny in spots\nbut the drama of Mike trying so hard to fulfill his dreams and how\nSully often fails to life up to his family reputation permeates most of\nthe film. Still, I had a good enough time watching this and also\nhearing Steve Buscemi again as one of the college students was a hoot\nto listen to. Oh, and I recognized another of the voices as that of a\nMurray brother but I thought it was Brian Doyle-Murray and not Joel!\nAnd, yes, Billy Crystal and John Goodman are once again charming enough\nas the lead voices here. So in summary, Monsters University is a good\nenough follow-up to its previous predecessor...\n"
"\nI would first like to say that I liked the original Monster's Inc. I\nwould give it a 7.5. This one is a 2. There is no plot. They go back to\nwhen they are in school together and have scare competitions. Mike\nWazowski is not scary, and is trying so \"find himself\" and the\nGoodman's character is from a long line of stuck up \"my s#@$ don't\nstink\" monsters. Big surprise, they team up, and learn some stuff along\nthe way. You can fill in the predictable blanks yourself. Geniuses\nmust've sat up all night dreaming this one up. Monster's University is\nto Monster's Inc as American Pie:Band Camp is to American Pie. A cheap\nknockoff of the original. The only thing that saves it from being a 1\nis the voice acting. Goodman and Crystal are good at what they do. But,\nI don't know how they signed up for this. Not that your kids will hate\nit for sure. But, you will.\n"
"\nMaybe because we know already from Monsters, Inc. that Mike and Sulley\ngo on to work as a team on the scare floor of the powerful energy\ncompany, there is little drama in the conflict this prequel\nestablishes. That would be less of a problem if the film were non-stop\nfunny, but the humor in Monsters University is sadly lacking. In the\npast, when Pixar films have fallen short on the story level, they've\nbeen jam-packed with business and jokes -- like Mater's confrontation\nwith a bidet in the underwhelming Cars 2 -- and breathtaking visual\nartistry. With Monsters University, it's possible that audiences may\nbegin taking Pixar's continued state-of-the-art technical mastery for\ngranted; people aren't as easily impressed if they don't care about\nwhat they're watching.\n"
"\ni loved this movie. at first i was a little out of it because it's\nunusual seeing characters you know so well in a prequel with characters\nyou don't know. you know where mike and sully are gonna end up but the\nnewbies you have no idea. after about 15 minutes though i was totally\nloving the new guys and by time the whole thing was over i really found\nmyself loving everything about this movie.<br><br>what's also great is also this is not the same as the first one... it's\nnot an adventure flick but instead it's (obviously) a college comedy\nand follows the same rules and format as a live action one... making\nfriends, frats, parties, pranks etc... with the great pixar emotional\ntouch to put it over the top.<br><br>stick around till the very end for a small little extra\n"
"\nMy boyfriend and I went to see this earlier today and I would have to\nsay, it's a pretty good movie. I definitely recommend this to anybody\nwho enjoyed the first Monsters Inc. movie. Good for any age group! I\nwas 6 when the first movie came out so I would have to say it was a\ngood idea to make a movie based on college because I am starting my\nFreshman year in college this fall. I heard a few little kids say after\nthe movie that they were scared but I remember the fear I kind of had\nfor the first movie so it's nothing too serious. There were lots of\ngiggles and laughs in the theater for the most part of the movie. It's\ndefinitely a must see movie for Disney and Pixar fans!\n"
"\nMany people will say that sequel will not live up to the first movie.\nIt happened to Cars 2 and even though I find that movie good I prefer\nthe first movie more. But after seeing this movie, it does live up to\nthe first. The movie has a well written story line, great character\ndevelopment and like all Pixar movies over the years, fantastic CGI.\nThere was so much detail on the monsters that its better then the\nfirst. <br><br>Even though the movie have the clichéd college storyline like the jocks\nthe villains, the nerd and simple people are the lame but good guys and\nof course the 'believe in yourself' plot line. But there are some moral\nteachings like 'You can't change' and 'Even though you aren't what you\nwant to be, you can be surprised' and 'Being different is special'. It\nmay not be the 'box office hit' critics and fans are expecting like\n'Toy Story 3' but it's definitely well worth the ticket price when you\nsee in the cinemas or theaters if you live in America.\n"
"\nIn my opinion University Monster is better than Monsters , Inc , I\nfound it more fun and funny, the new characters are very nice , I liked\nto see how Mike and Sully met, the monsters game times are very good ,\nespecially in race and the library , the soundtrack is good, the final\nmoments are great , them trying to scare the police , the last game\nalso scares , this was the liveliest I most enjoyed , I do not\nunderstand why the critics and much of the public was so negative with\nthis liveliest , the voice work again is very competent , I believe in\nthe near future will have a direct continuation of Monsters , Inc , I\nhope so, University Monster would be second in my Top 3 of Pixar , is\ngreat fun and has very funny moments , it's great to see this pair of\nmonsters back . Note 9.3\n"
"\nThis movie was great! I haven't enjoyed an animation in quite a while\nthe way I enjoyed this. It's not a film for kids and I mean that in the\nbest way possible. It is not simple and superficial, rather it is\nunexpected, new, and deeper than you think. Kids will enjoy it, but\nadults will enjoy, understand, and appreciate it the most.<br><br>The film is unpredictable and furthers the plot in ways that you\nwouldn't expect. The characters grow on you and you already establish a\ngreat connection with them from the very start. I liked that the\nmessage was conveyed fully rather than conveniently - the ending wasn't\nconveniently happy with easy-won success for everyone as if in a\nfantasy world of happy endings, the ending was realistic. <br><br>The film itself spoke of universal concepts; hope, desires, dreams,\nbelonging, rejection, failure, and friendship. The plot was exciting\nand surprising. The characters were lovable and relatable. In\nconclusion, the movie was amazing.\n"
"\nWhat drives the film is a story about friendship. Although we assume\nthe ending of the film, the plot is not at all predictable. The movie\nis full of humor and interesting characters who easily create sympathy\nin the viewer, as well as numerous representations of emotions that\neven the relatively evil monsters make real favorites. It has a lot of\nreferences that are related to real life and the people who have the\nsame or similar viewpoints and problems, because even the monsters are\nafraid of the real world. When all is summed up this is a great movie,\nwhich was not on the same level as legendary Toy Story trilogy project\nor Wall-E. It's funny, interesting and full of emotions. I recommend\nthat you first watch Monster Inc. then Monster University, for a better\nunderstanding.\n"
"\nI really like this movie. I actually like it better than Monsters,\nInc., although that is a good movie. I love prequels, most of the time,\nand I really think they went in a great direction for this movie. <br><br>This movie takes us back before Sulley and Mike worked at Monsters,\nInc., scaring little kids. Before they were best friends. Back to a\ntime when they went to train to become Scarers at Monsters University.\nThey get paired up as roommates, and they don't get along, at all.\nSulley does the least work he can, and Mike always puts his heart and\nsoul into everything he does. But Sulley always seems to get by better\nthan Mike, which of course is very irritating. Eventually, Mike and\nSulley have to team up and work together, otherwise, they'll both be\nexpelled from the Scaring Program.<br><br>Recommended for: Anyone who liked Monsters, Inc., anyone child, or even\nchild at heart.<br><br>Overall, I give this movie an 8 out of 10, which in my ratings book is:\nAwesome.\n"
"\nIn this prequel to Monsters inc, we get to see how Mike and Sulley\nbecome friends and a team of sorts at the end, because in the beginning\nthey are not exactly that.<br><br>This film has much to offer and as many other animation films it has a\nlot for both kids and grownups, We get to meet a whole bunch of new\ncharacters and some of the \"old\" ones but in their youth. It was very\nentertaining for the entire family and filled with joy and pranks and\nmuch more, a very nice film and a very good introduction to the\nmonsters world and their way of education :)<br><br>It is hard to live up to the rep of the first movie and in general my\nexpectations are very high for films from Pixar and Disney, so it gets\na little lower rating then the first one.\n"
"\nIt was a great movie, I loved it just as much as I did Monsters Inc,\nthe script writers did such a good job of keeping it funny, original\nand showed the development well. Kids my age (I'm leaving high school\nthis year) love it, little kids will love it and I'm guessing adults\nwill too. I loved the library scene with Squishy, I didn't even notice\nhim go missing. My favourite line is when the purple scarf (Art)\nscreams \"I can't go back to jail\" and pegs it before the other\ncharacters realise what's going on.<br><br>Honestly, it's a great laugh, fun and nostalgic without living in the\npast. You don't need to have seen Monsters Inc to love this movie.\n"
"\nI really loved the Monsters inc, in 2001.It was a great,touching and\nexciting animation.I was so surprised that the movie wasn't nominated\nfor animated feature.So when monsters university was released,I was\nhoping this one to win an Oscar.<br><br>First of all,I wanted to talk about the story.It was simple but nice\nand understandable.The characters were great,too.The movie not only\nshowed the true meaning of friendship,but also showed moviegoers about\nteamwork or Hard work bring rewards.It was really funny,too.I really\nlike it when the Oozma Kappa went into the library to capture the flag.<br><br>This is a great movie.I know it wasn't as good as Monsters inc, but is\nis very nice.So why wasn't both movies nominated?The Oscar 2013 must be\ncrazy.First was Tom Hanks,and now an animated movie?I think both\nmonsters movie deserved an Oscar.Please subscribe if u like my\nreviews.thanks for reading\n"
"\nA look at the relationship between Mike (Billy Crystal) and Sulley\n(John Goodman) during their days at Monsters University -- when they\nwere not necessarily the best of friends.<br><br>Although I enjoyed \"Monsters Inc\", I probably did not enjoy it as much\nas other people did. This, in turn, taints my outlook on this prequel,\nbecause in many ways the success of this film relies on the enjoyment\nof the first one (these are, after all, the same characters and voice\ntalent).<br><br>Not to say this is a bad film. In fact, it was quite fun and a touching\ntribute to the world of monsters. I enjoyed it far more than \"The\nCroods\" and would rather have seen this nominated for an Oscar than\n\"Croods\", even though neither has much chance of winning. How can\nanything with John Goodman and Steve Buscemi be bad?\n"
"\nThis is the origins story of Mike Wazowski and James P. Sullivan whom\nwe got to know in the 2001 movie. And it's a great origins story. Mike\nand Sulley start out as enemies. Mike has never been scary, but his\ngoal hasn't changed since when he was a kid. He's 'Rudy'. He's the\nlittle guy with heart and drive. Then we have Sulley who's been living\noff on his family's reputation and his natural abilities. When they\naccidentally destroy Dean Hardscrabble (Helen Mirren)'s container, they\nare failed out of the Scare Program. They end up working together to\nget back in.<br><br>The story is pulled from all those college movies like 'Revenge of the\nNerds'. The big thing this movie has is heart. More than the first\nmovie, we grow to love these guys and we see how they grow to love each\nother. This is even better than the original.\n"
"\nDisney made its miracle again.The new version of Monsters is\nclever,funny,pithy at some scenes and much different than the previous\nfilm.<br><br>We see these two heroes of the first film in the university where at\nfirst they did not get on well with each other but after testings they\ndiscover that together could be an incredible duet and this went on to\nthe Monsters corp.Many other interesting characters are introduced\nexcept Mike and Sullivan whose voices are played by the Academy winner\nBilly Crystal and the Well-known John Goodman and Helen Mirren as Dean\nhardscrabble as a strictly teacher of the university.I almost forgot\nthe appearance Randall Boggs where we know why he hates so much Mike\nand Sullivan.<br><br>After toy story 3 and Ralph wreck it Disney made another notable\nmovie.i hope we can see soon another sequel of Monsters.\n"
"\nMonsters University<br><br>Higher education benefits all creatures so long as they don't major in\nMonster Anthropology, Monster Psychology or Monster Fine Arts.<br><br>Luckily, neither creepy co-ed in this animated-comedy is studying the\naforementioned.<br><br>At M.U. for a degree in scaring children to supply energy to their\nworld, one-eyed teenage monster Mike Wazowski (Billy Crystal) isn't as\nwell received at school as his fellow scarer Sulley (John Goodman).<br><br>To prove his frightfulness, Mike joins a rag-tag fraternity (Charlie\nDay, Joel Murray, Dave Foley, Sean Hayes) and competes in the Scare\nGames alongside Sulley.<br><br>But their doubt in each other threatens to cost them the event - and\ntheir education.<br><br>The prequel to Monsters Inc., Monster University reunites the monsters\nbut doesn't give them much to work with in the way of narrative,\nsubstance or laughs.<br><br>What's worse, these monsters will have to carry around their student\nloan debt until angry villagers behead them.

"\nDespite few criticism this film got when it comes to kid audiences.\nIt's actually a fun and emotional movie about friendship and teamwork.\nThe CGI is fluid and top of the line. When it comes to kid's comedy, it\nworks for the most part. And even clever to a degree. As a matter of\nfact with everything combined for this prequel, I enjoyed it and had a\nbetter time with it than \"Monsters, Inc.\" although both films are\ngreat. This one starts out a bit slow, but when it does kicks off, it's\nsmooth sailing from there. It's like watching a cool Pixar flick about\nteen college movies and \"Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire\" but\nfocuses in on the monsters side of things. Overall this one a more\nentertaining Pixar movie than I expected. Thanks to clever execution\nand fun comradery.<br><br>8.4/10\n"
"\nThere was a time when whichever film Pixar made, it never failed to\nimpress me. That time has sadly passed. Cars was the first\ndisappointment. Cars 2 just sucked. Luckily these were the exceptions.\nToy Story 3, WALL-E &amp; Brave were all excellent! The problem with\nMonster U is that it's just a plain and simple highschool movie, but\nwith monsters (duh!). So a real cookie cutter story. The animation is\ngorgeous but it has gotten to a point where cartoon-like characters\nlook as good as they are ever going to look if you don't want them to\nlook photo-realistic. Great for kids I guess, but adults do make up a\nlarge part of the Pixar audience and story wise I feel a bit cheated...\n"
"\nWhen a PIXAR name is attached to any particular animation , there will\nbe heap of expectations riding on the film. Best part is with each film\n, PIXAR have proved they are the best and Monster Univeristy is one\nperfect example.<br><br>Monster University is a prequel to Monster Inc. which tells the story\nof Mike and Sully in their college days when they were arch rivals.<br><br>From the house of powerful animation house who has given us Toy Story\nseries , Cars , UP , Wall-E and recent adventurous BRAVE - Monster\nUniversity is thoroughly enjoyable. With its immensely popular\ncharacters Mike and Sully , add together fun-filled ride and hilarious\nsituations - Monster University is one level ahead to the\nentertainment. You will be completely engrossed in the film when it\nbegins and would be wanting for more once it ends. Animation is\nspellbinding along with superb voice over by Billy Crystal and John\nGoodman.<br><br>Forget everything in the world and fasten your seat belt for the\nexciting, enthralling ride to Monster University. Excellent 4.5/5\n"
"\nI loved to see the two main characters again and this prequel was for\nme nearly good as the original one from 2001. They captured really good\nthe university time, so you will see as student many parallels to your\nown university. Sideinfo: It's just annoying that these times so many\nprequels are released from Hollywood.<br><br>Back to the movie: I also missed many things, more relations to the\nmain movie from 2001 and a better presentation of all secondary\ncharacters. I would like to know more about them. Anyway the story line\nis very good but also very fast. You are going from one point to the\nnext one, thats not bad but u cant really come down one time and enjoy\nthe moment and the animations. After you try you will realize that the\nmovie is already over. :)\n"
"\nIt's predecessor was a celebrated hit but Monsters University (a\nprequel) deserves none of the 'meh' doled out by critics, either in\ncomparison or on its own terms. It's a frat-boy coming of age story\nwith all the inventiveness of the first film intact and thriving.\nThere's a large and well-characterised voice cast for the ensemble with\nHelen Mirren the choice name popping up as a scaly dean of studies.<br><br>As ever with these films, it's the pace of wit which is so attractive\nand arresting on screen and the slapstick is as violent as it can be\ngiven the raucous nature of the invented subjects. If anything I'd like\nto have seen the topsy-turvy 'toxicity of children' predicate of the\nfirst film more thoroughly investigated here. But no matter, it's great\nfun. 7/10\n"
"\nMIke dreams of being a scarer when he grows up. HIs effort was rewarded\nand he is a scare major at Monster University. He meets Sulley this\nplace for the first time. His faults are too small and too cute so he\nis expelled from department. He plans his strategy and he tries to go\nback to former department.<br><br>This movie is so fun and easy to understand so everybody can enjoy to\nwatch. I became to care for Mike because he tries his best to solve his\nproblem and he is so cute. I think Mike and Sulley's combination is so\ngood and they are keeping good balance. The scene that Mike had gone\nalone without permission to the human being world was surprised most. I\nhad butterflies in my stomach. I thought that it was a monster of the\nsnails to have provoked the laughter of the audience because his action\nis so cute and amusing.<br><br>This movie's conclusion is happy ending. A short film \"Blue Umbrella\"\ncan amuse too.\n"
"\nOr the university that is. And while the movie has clichés in it like\nyou wouldn't believe, the movie is still more than enjoyable! The voice\ncast is amazing as always, but it's still Pixar crafting the characters\nand the story that while having a morality to it, it never feels like a\nboring lesson (pun intended).<br><br>So this works as a sort of prequel to the other movie (Monsters Inc.).\nThat means there is no need to have watched the first movie. But even\nif you haven't, after watching this you will want to watch it either\nway. And it holds up to the first movie quite good. Like always (apart\nmaybe from Cars) you know what you're getting with Pixar ... Quality!\n"
"\nThe last few attempts by Disney may not be up to the standards that we\nexpect from Pixar films with the likes of Brave and Cars 2 but Monsters\nUniversity is a step in the right direction even if it doesn't quite\nmatch the 2001 feature Monsters Inc.<br><br>It takes place many years before Monsters Inc, Mike Wazowski is\nattending Monsters University determined to work hard so he can fulfill\nhis dream of being a top scarer. Unfortunately he is rubbed up the\nwrong way by fellow freshman James P 'Sulley' Sullivan who feels he\ndoes not require to put in the work to achieve his goal but they must\npull together if their to win 'the scare games'<br><br>There is some great voice acting from a bunch of misfits who end up\nhouse sharing with. They include Don (Joel Murray), a former salesman,\nThe headed bickering twins Terry and Terri (Sean P.Hayes and David\nFoley) and the doughy looking Scott(Peter Sohn). <br><br>Monsters University might not provide us with any of those emotional\nscenes that we have come to expect from Pixar but it does provide\nlaughs for young and old alike.\n"
"\nJust seen the movie and although it's very enjoyable, I don't feel it's\nhalf as good as the original (which has a very special place in my\nheart)<br><br>Being a Disney movie there was of course a pre-movie short animation,\nin this case titled 'the blue umbrella' which was very similar in plot\nto the one that opened wreck-it Ralph. However whereas that was good\nlooking and appeared unrealistic, this seemed almost as though it was\nshot on film.<br><br>This high quality production continued into the film itself, which was\nbright and colourful with the odd dark scene used to reflect those more\nconflict driven parts of the plot, something we have seen Disney be\neffective at in most, if not all of their animations. <br><br>The plot itself felt somewhat underdeveloped, sure it can't be too\ncomplex for the children in the audience but this came across as being\nquite predictable and that certain moral messages (such as 'it doesn't\nmatter what you look like') where briefly brought up and brushed aside\nbefore they could be fulfilled\n"
"\nThis is nothing short of Monster Inc.; I love it through and through.\nYes, the story is not fresh like the first movie but it is still great\nwith a very good connection between the two. Seriously, this movie is\nso much fun.<br><br>I love the story  it is about friendship, competition, getting to know\noneself, teamwork and so on; very much suitable for kids, as well as\npretty fun for adult too. There are quite a lot of funny scene and a\nlot of cute characters too. <br><br>I love the creativity and how they connect the two movies. Plus with so\nmany characters you will enjoy it even more (somehow they managed to\ngive perfect screen time to each character).<br><br>So that is it. I love it and I highly recommend people see it while it\nis still on the big screen. It is fun, great animation, cute, good\nstory, and really funny.<br><br>Rating: 8/10\n"
"\nI just recently watched Monsters inc. for the first time and really\nenjoyed it so I decided to go see Monsters U. I was pretty happy that I\ndid. Monsters University was an entertaining well done prequel to\nMonsters inc. Its like American Pie Beta House for kids. Im gonna keep\nthis short and not go into to great of detail.<br><br>I really liked seeing the characters from the first movie again\nespecially getting to see how Mike and Sully met. I liked how at first\nthey were not friends and had to grow as characters and work together\nin order to eventually get along. I also really liked seeing what kind\nof person Randy really is. I was expecting him to just be some jerk but\nreally he just wants to fit in with the cool people at any cost( and\nyes I know that pretty much means he's a jerk but he at least has\nreasons for it).<br><br>So the story was fun the characters were cool and it was just an\noverall fun movie.<br><br>I give Monsters University an 8/10\n"
"\nI never expect a lot of sequels, especially seeing I'm not a child like\nI was when the original was released, but this film really did over-\nperform in my books.<br><br>The new characters they brought in were just as lovable as the old\ncharacters and this made the new story fresh and still interesting for\nthe viewers. <br><br>The variation of humour was great too from some slapstick that people\nfrom all ages could enjoy to some more serious humour that could have\nbeen lost on the kids but would impress adults with their kids and\npeople watching the film for nostalgia purposes like myself. <br><br>Lastly, I have so many compliments for the plot-line to write here, it\nwas great for a kids film. There was real depth and twists where you\ndid not expect them, fantastic. One of the best animated films I've\nseen. Must see for anyone who liked the first film or has kids.\n"
"\nvery funny movie every family will enjoy! has a lot of reference to\nmonsters inc and before Sully or even Randal was even a scarer. This is\nset when Sully and mike just met in uni and shows how Sully was trying\nto be cool and how mike became friends after being enemies. This movie\nhas good surprises i still think monsters inc is better this movie also\nfits in some puzzles pieces from monsters inc. There are places for\nimprovement of this film but i think pixar has done a good job in\nmaking this film there are some sad bit like mike gets expelled from\nthe uni but i like the ending and how its done when mike and Sully get\na job as a monster inc mail monsters then to scarers plus you also find\nout why Randal hates Sully and mike!! This is a good film and it is\nworth watching with friends and family!\n"
"\nI really enjoyed this film - but - there were a few moments where it\nseemed like over egging a pudding - or even scraping the barrel -\nalmost. Monsters Inc. is my favourite pixar film - like Miyazaki -\nthere isn't a moment where you're thinking about something else - or\nwhats going to happen. <br><br>A prequel is a sequel so its never going to be as good as the original,\nbut its still great. <br><br>Get Monsters Inc in the wide screen version as well, even though all of\nthe UK DVD's are 4:3. You can get it.<br><br>Always stay till the the end of the credits with Pixar - and mostly\nwith Disney too.\n"
"\nMonsters University is the sequel i.e. prequel to the first movie\nMonsters Inc.It is a very good and funny movie for children, and for\nadults also. I recommend to watch the first Monsters movie first,\nbecause this one will be so much funnier when you connect the dots. I\ndon't think anyone can dislike this movie and you definitely won't\nregret watching it. It has humor, funny scenes, a story and it gives\ngreat message about friendship. The only thing I didn't like about this\nmovie, is that I already predicted some of the up-coming scenes. But,\nmaybe that's just me. Any way, the ending did surprised me, in the best\nway. So, don't waste time reading all reviews, call a friend,make\npopcorn and get ready to laugh out loud.\n"
"\nBefore seeing this movie... I had mixed feelings whether Disney can\ncome up with a new awesome story after they ended Monsters Inc. in a\n\"happily ever after \"(Even though in sad tone) way...... But after\nseeing the movie i got stunned..... Disney has made a pretty good job\nboth with the story and screenplay and all that.... They got everything\nin place as it used to be in Monsters Inc. and the best part about the\nfilm is how friendship develops between mike and sully.... and how the\nrivalry between the duo and randy sparks up.... The way they show the\nUniversity is quite fascinating.... Disney got it all figured out\nincluding which degree one opts to.... and the scary sports they play\nthere,the different clubs in the university and all\nthat.....Surprisingly the movie ends with a happy tone.... So you can\ncome out of the screens with a happy mood.... :)<br><br>So if you are looking for a 1.5 hrs entertainer... JUST GO AND WATCH\nIT.....\n"
"\n\"Monsters University\" won't go down as a Pixar classic, but it's cute\nand diverting enough. Actually, I wasn't that big a fan of \"Monsters,\nInc.,\" so maybe I wasn't the target audience for this in the first\nplace.<br><br>Billy Crystal and John Goodman return as the voices of Mike and Sully,\nand this origins story explains how they meet, first hate each other,\nand then end up as the scaring duo at the center of the earlier film.\nOf the new characters, Helen Mirren makes the biggest impression as the\ndragon lady dean of the college, though I couldn't place her voice and\nhad to wait until the end credits to see who it was.<br><br>My one complaint with the film is that it goes on too long, long past\nthe point where it feels like the story should be resolving itself. But\nthis movie will always have a special place in my heart because it's\nthe first movie I took my four-year-old boy to.<br><br>Grade: B\n"
"\nI had serious worries after seeing the previews, honestly they were not\ngood. But my kids wanted to see it, so I went along. It was much better\nthan I expected. I liked the back story of Mike and Sully, Billy\nCrystal really makes the movie. Most of it was fairly predictable but\nrarely have I seen a children's movie that is not. At the end people in\nthe audience were clapping, my only criticism is when Mike and Sully\nwere not reinstated into the School of Scaring at the end, it would\nhave made sense that the dean did this for them, but it all works out\nfor them, as they go on to work for Monster's Inc. Thus making us all\nremember the first movie in this series, Monsters Inc. Pixar seemed to\nbe back on track after a dud of a movie in Brave. Hopefully the Planes\nmovie will be good as well.\n"

The graphics\nhaven't changed much since Monsters, Inc., but even then they seemed\nflawless, and the characters are equally funny or scary.

"\nWith Monsters Inc being the hit it was it was only natural that we'd\nwant to see more of lovable duo, Mike and Sulley.

Then it\nseemed a bit forced, as the creative team tried to add peril to\ncharacters we knew had to be OK anyway.<br><br>It's a decent film, but I'm happy to watch Monsters Inc instead.\n"
"\nI'm not a big fan of the Pixar movies - I've not seen them all (and\ndon't plan to) and I outright hate The Incredibles, for examples.\nHaving said that, I liked this one. It is definitely an OK movie for a\n\"one-time watch\" and is more interesting and well animated than the\noriginal one. To be honest, I never got the appeal of Monsters Inc. and\nwhy it was considered one, if not the, best Pixar films... What more\ncould be said about \"University\" ? It is very pretty and beautifully\nanimated, but for Pixar is not an achievement . It complements the\nuniverse of monsters with new parts of the world , but not beyond\nanything outlined in \"Inc.\". Sometimes it is a desperately short flight\nof imagination and poetry, but sometimes it takes the original most\nbanal clichés.\n"
"\nMike and Sulley become a good relationship between during their days at\nMonsters University.<br><br>Monsters University is fantastic movie. I see it in the theater on this\nsummer with my friends in Japan. We really enjoy watching the film.\nSometimes laughing, and sometimes moving.

"\nLike most cartoon sequels, MONSTERS UNIVERSITY (a follow-up to\nMONSTERS, INC.) plows more existing ruts than new territory. Helen\nMirren is added to the cast as a counterpart for Hogwart's new\nprincipal (after Dumbledore was ousted in a Nazi coup), Dolores\nUmbridge. Apparently, Imelda Staunton--who played Umbridge in HARRY\nPOTTER AND THE ORDER OF THE PHOENIX--was unavailable to voice her\nMONSTERS clone, Dean Hardscrabble, so Queen Elizabeth II--I mean,\nMirren, took over in her stead. This being aimed at a younger audience\nthan the Potter series, the threat of expulsion is about as serious of\na menace as Hardscrabble can pose; there are no monster hands dripping\nblood from compulsory writing assignments here. The final test of the\nmonster decathlon smacks somewhat as a parallel to the climax of HARRY\nPOTTER AND THE GOBLET OF FIRE, as an ostensibly academic situation\nbecomes a foray into the threatening adult world. Unlike in the Potter\nstoryline, no students die for real here, however; everyone has a\nH.E.A.-type outcome.\n"
"\nSo I'm one of those people that grew up with Monsters Inc. Entering the\ntheatre for this, I was apprehensive - I mean, it's a prequel to a\nclassic movie. Luckily it completely exceeded my expectations.<br><br>Every moment was hilarious, and there were some awesome cameo\nappearances from older characters :D<br><br>This movie made me feel sorry for the young generation now who have to\ngrow up to animated movies aiming for good graphics instead of\nstoryline. The only other animated movies to reach the heights of\nMonsters Inc. and Monsters University are Finding Nemo (and hopefully\nFinding Dory) as well as Despicable Me 1 and 2.\n"
"\nWhat a great movie!! Disney finally did a movie RIGHT! What a great\nmessage to send out- especially to the school age children that will\nget it!!! Glad to have taken our small children, who are ages 3 and 5.\nDefinitely cute enough for the small kids to see it. Some scary parts\nhere and there - hoping my kids will still go to bed and sleep OK\ntonight - but not terribly scary. I am so happy to finally see a movie\nsending out good messages for the kids that WILL get it. Very funny for\nthe adult entertainment! Would go see it again! The whole message is to\nnever give up on your dreams no matter how many people/ how much they\nput you down; use your smarts to get ahead and a great emphasis on\nteamwork! Good Work Pixar/ Disney!\n"
"\nWhen I first heard about Monsters University, I was excited and\nnervous. What if this movie turned the first into a joke because it\nsucked that badly? Well, I was wrong.<br><br>Monsters University revisited old characters and introduced new ones.\nWe saw character development throughout the movie, with Sulley going\nfrom a jock to the big-hearted guy we know and love and Mike going from\na little know-it-all to, well, MIKE WAZOWSKI! We also saw Randall as a\nnerd and friend of Mike become all evil. We defiantly got a better\nunderstanding of his hatred for Mike and Sulley.<br><br>The plot was clever, the characters fresh and cute, and the animation\ntop quality. As a dear friend of mine said after seeing a screening of\nMonsters University, \"If you liked the first one, you'll love this\none.\"\n"
"\nMONSTERS UNIVERSITY (2013) (Voices of : Billy Crystal, John Goodman,\nSteve Buscemi, Helen Mirren, Peter Sohn, Joel Murray, Sean Hayes, Dave\nFoley, Charlie Day, Alfred Molina, Tyler Labine, Nathan Fillion, Aubrey\nPlaza, Bobby Moynihan, Noah Johnston, Julia Sweeney, Bonnie Hunt, John\nKrasinski, Bill Hader, Beth Behrs, Bob Peterson, John Ratzenberger,\nFrank Oz) Superb prequel to the Pixar/Disney classic with the origin\nstory of how dynamic duo Mike Wazowski and James P. \"Sulley\" Sullivan\n(Crystal and Goodman reunited; feels so good) met in college as\ncompetitive rival students aspiring to be 'scarers' and eventually BFFs\nwith a ragtag motley crew of co-eds and frat rats to boot. Funny,\nfrenetic and wonderfully animated thanks to the warm-hearted and\nloose-limbed direction by Dan Scanlon who collaborated on the well-\nconstructed screenplay by Robert L. Baird and Daniel Gerson. Newcomer\nSweeney as the overly sweet mom of one of the duo's classmates steals\nthe show but the true star is the eye candy colored universe of the\nmerry monsters. One of the year's best.\n"
"\nThis movie is one of the Pixar. The story is the past of Monsters Inc.\nSulley and Mike are best friends. But, in the past, they were rival.\nMike enters Monsters university. In the university, Monsters learn the\nway of surprising children. Mike always studies it very hard. However,\nSulley is also a student of the university. He is the best student of\nthe university. There are no person who win Sulley. Mike tries to win\nSulley. But, he can't win him. However, they are cooperated about a\nplan. They fail the plan and are expelled from the university, but\ntheir hardness is considered and said they can enter the university.\nLike these, this story led our think importance of friends. We can't do\neverything live alone, so we should prize your friends. If you have\nrivals, they become friends finally.\n"
"\nI will admit to being nervous about this film because Monsters Inc. is\none of my favourite animated films of all time and I didn't want this\nfilm to be bad like I believe the past few have been. Luckily this film\nis great, not as good as the original but great none the less. This\nprequel to the original is based showing a younger Mike and Sulley in\nUniversity and how they go from enemies to best friends. The main\npositive for this film is it's heart there are scenes that will hit you\nwhere you live and make u feel even more love for these two characters.\nBut also these side characters who I thought would just be an annoyance\nturn out to eventually be almost as important as these two guys and\nthey grow on you. With the great animation, twists and turns and\ncolours that will stand out provide this film with a great coming of\nage story for two characters. However, it does slow down a bit at times\nand gets a bit boring but then a nostalgic moment hits you and makes\nyou laugh. This is a great film hopefully leading to more great Pixar\nfilms.\n"
"\nThis is the latest Pixar film and as usual fairly entertaining. It\nplayed along with a short featuring umbrellas which was also fun.<br><br>Monsters University follows the trails and tribulations of Mike who\nwants to go to scare school. It is a prequel to Monsters Inc. Sullivan\nis from a family of scary people and really doesn't get along with Mike\nwhen they meet at Scare school.<br><br>As ever with Pixar there is a great storyline, script and\ncharacterisation. You feel like you really know a lot about many of the\ncharacters and it's totally unlike many of the real life films which is\nrather ironic. This will be enjoyable to all the family and is well\nworth a watch.\n"
"\nFor Children, this movie is a great 9/10. Filled with all of the humor\nthat always satisfies them, face full of cake, face plants, cute jokes\nand plenty of funny faces.<br><br>For Parents, this movie is a 6/10, for it lacks a few things. The story\nseems to be repetitious, and lacks a good \"Beef\" of a middle. Now, the\nlaughs do seem to slightly make up for this, but its still not so\nentertaining.<br><br>Overall, combining the juvenile and parental ratings above, this movie\nreceives a solid 7 from me. Though it may not entertain the adults...\nHey, it is a kids movie after all.<br><br>This movie is worth your ticket, as well as the disc.<br><br>*Also, I enjoyed the first one better*\n"
"\nMany of the Disney efforts of the past several years have been hampered\nby too much filler in the story line, they have at best an 80 minute\ntale but they stretch it 110 instead (Nemo being a good example). This\nhas a much tighter plot, largely focusing on the college experience of\nMike and Sully. This has all been done before in one fashion or another\nbut the story moves along pleasantly enough to a fair conclusion. Billy\nCrystal and John Goodman fill their roles as well as in the original\nand in fact this is a better story than the first one, the exception\nrather than the rule for sequels. I particularly liked the short played\nbefore this movie, the Blue Umbrella.\n"
"\nIt's hard to review a pixar movie. The benchmark is set too high that\nyou don't expect anything but the best. MU suffers from the same kind\nof expectations that pixar fans carry with them. No doubt, movie is\nnicely built college rivalry story with some funny moments, some heart\nrendering moments. But this is not enough for pixar fans. Movie has\nconventional treatment and very few funny moments in first half. Most\nof the fun is generated by how monsters carry themselves as if they are\nhumans. Second half is much stronger with supporting characters\nproviding lots of fun, movie not following the usual underdog's story\npattern and lead characters getting enough screen time alone. At the\nend, you won't be able to say that it is The Incredibles or Up in the\nseries of pixar movies but it is definitely Brave or Monsters Inc.\n"
"\nThis movie was horrible, i would rate it a 2/10 because the 1st movie\nactually killed this movie! This movie didn't not have a good story\nline to it which also did not deliver. A 2/10 is what i am giving but a\n2/10 could be a bit to nice to rate this movie but i am being kind. My\nFamily decided to see this movie rather than the horror movie the purge\nwhich was said to be good so i was disappointed seeing this movie and\nit annoyed me even more that this movie was so sh...t . The only\npositive was the some funny scenes which made the 2 rating but what\ntype of story- line was this ............................... Horrible.\nMy family give this a 6/10 rating but god knows how they liked this a\n6/10. anyway..............<br><br>Overall a 2/10 !\n"
"\nI have been waiting for this movie since the day that it was confirmed!\nAnd let me just say that if your a fan of the original, this is a\namazing follow up! I love this movie to pieces, mostly because I\nwouldn't had expected a sequel/prequel to this franchise. And the world\nof Monsters Ink has always intrigued/fascinated me ever since I was a\nsmall child, to this very day!<br><br>one other thing that made this movie, was the nostalgia. There were so\nmany characters cameos, including ( Little Mike, The Abominable\nSnowman, Celia Mae, Roz,) and many more! Over all this movie is just as\ngood as Monsters Ink........ For me....... But in the eyes of anyone\nels it probably wont be as good as the original....... But comes close!\n8/10\n"
"\nMonsters University does not live up to the original Monsters, Inc.\nStory line is weak. Watched to the end in hopes there was an\nimprovement. Great disappointment!<br><br>This sequel gives incite to the beginning of Sully and Mike's\nrelationship, but there is nothing to leave you feeling warm and fuzzy.<br><br>I hope the next Monsters sequel will incorporate Boo's efforts to\nreunite with Sully. I do look forward to another sequel, however if it\nis as bad as this one, they can shelve Monsters as far as I'm\nconcerned.<br><br>I can't count the times we have watched Monsters, Inc. I know how many\ntimes I will watch Monsters University. One! I am really looking\nforward to seeing a sequel that complements Monsters, Inc., as the Toy\nStories sequels have.<br><br>I think I am going to watch Monsters, Inc. to recover.\n"
"\nUnfortunately for this movie, the idiots from the production team that\nplanted \"good reviews\" about this movie on here are not enough to save\nit from a complete terrible movie.<br><br>Nothing in these movies is the least bit entertaining. If any of the\npeople who gave this movie positive reviews actually enjoyed it, I\ntruly feel sorry for you. Pixar should be ashamed for putting this\ngarbage in theaters, and the two idiot writer/producer wannabes should\ntake their millions and disappear, and save us from any more torture.<br><br>There's nothing to actually review about this movie. It goes from one\nstupid, completely non-funny scene to another. Please do not even pay\nto see this movie to see how horrible it is. If 9 out of 10 people see\nthis movie to \"see how dumb it is\" then that's more than enough for\nthem to keep making this garbage. It's sad when a movie is so stupid\nthat making fun of it is not even enjoyable.\n"
"\nA cartoon for children should NOT be talking about \"New Age &amp; Souls.\"\nIn fact, one can't help but wonder WHY Hollywood is foisting this\ntrash! New Age is a religion &amp; when it comes to cartoons for children,\nreligion should not not not be subject matter. Next, they'll be\ninjecting satanism into the children's shows! I can't remember in what\ncontext the word \"souls\" was mentioned in the film, but it was\nsomething to the effect of your soul being on the line (of course I'm\nparaphrasing, but you get the gist). Hollywood is slowly but surely\nbecoming more &amp; more brazen with the introduction &amp; in the\nadministering of subject matter to our children.<br><br>People need to start sending a clear message to those moral misfits by\ntaking the time to write words like this, thereby promulgating a\nconsensus. How about a concerted boycott?!?\n"
"\nOK..can someone explain to me pleaz..Disney is like a school to\nkids...what are they trying to tell children from this movie..is it a\nform of di caprio's \"inception'??..and why they are promoting ghosts\nand horror to children..and telling them:yes don't sleep..monsters﻿\nwill come to u...wow...whats happening? should kids watch that movie?\nand what would happen after they do? I dint find any worthy message for\na child.. its like they want to \"mis-direction\" the minds......its like\npresenting posion in some beautiful dish...we should watch those kind\nof movies that talk bout ghosts and monsters before letting our kids\nwatch it...\n"
