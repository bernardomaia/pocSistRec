the lego movie is a winner on several levels
there is a good amount of clever gags and i was constantly bursting with laughter
i was surprised by how it contained so many memorable cameos pop icons and film references providing a strong nostalgia factor to older viewers
the playful approach towards movie clichas made it a really enjoyable and refreshing watch
the animation is absolutely stunning and the blend of cgi with stop motion worked brilliantly
everything can be attachable making the vibe of each scenario feel very unique and unlike anything youve ever seen
the lego movie has plenty of heart too by the end of the journey and its going to be really tough for another animated film to surpass its inventiveness and charm
this film has great animation and a great story it has an all star voice cast example morgan freeman and will ferrell
this film will be up on the shelve as one of the greatest films ever animated ever thought about and ever written
when i was a kid playing with lego i never thought to my self that they will make a film on it now that they have all my christmases have come at once
cant wait for the special features on blue ray
this movie will be up there with toy story 1 2 and 3  the lion king  frozen and wreck it ralph
the power of good films are in lego hands people are genius congrats to all the oscars for the road ahead
i usually enjoy childrens films more than my children shrek and toy story being two examples
this one didnt quite hit the mark with me
theres enough to keep the children amused throughout and the graphics are what you would expect from todays cgi standards
however the humour doesnt sparkle like the titles i mentioned above and the whole film had a claustrophobic feel to it a bit like tron legacy
the ending though charming was a little lame i felt
i went to see it based on the score given by previous viewers but wont be bothered if i dont see it again
one other gripe  the continual playing of the everything is awesome song became very irritating even the children commented on this
cute movie
thats about it
a few funny references and jokes
its not at all an 810
i rented it from redbox for 1
20 and it was well worth that price
i will write more lines because imdb insists on a minimum content
not sure why
my opinions about the movie were easily expressed in the first two sentences
i will simply fill in wasted words and a waste of my time because this site has become so full of itself
used to be a genuine place to investigate and review movies
now we have to log in verify ourselves as ourselves and type encrypted words to be accepted
seems to me that hollywood doesnt really want every mans opinions
they are happy to stay within their own world
just watched the lego movie last night
wow
i havent laughed this hard out loud at a movie in so long
as a lego fan growing up i was eager to see it after the great reviews and it surely didnt disappoint
all the characters are alive and downright hilarious
from batman to green lantern and kitty and abe lincoln
i cant give away the plot but it is clear the producers and directors also have an affinity with legos
the underlying message comes across as fresh a message everyone can relate to
i enjoyed the ending although when it came i was exhausted from laughing and giggling for an hour and a half
this movie earns the high marks due to the attention to detail the humor and the funny story
a definite 10
did i miss something cause i dont know why they made the lego movie  except  possibly to sell more legos
this is a giant piece of advertising for the ubiquitous lego toys  that goes on for two hours and seems to be designed for children under the age of 6 because i cant even think of what it was like to sit in a movie theatre watching this giant toy fest
to think that adults are raving about this extended saturday morning toy commercial is kind of shocking  unless these adults are completely afflicted with a strong dose of add amp adhd
i have a hard time watching a lot of digitally designed animated cartoons  but to watch a bunch of lego toys move around  dance and sing like they were real things  and to have people respond to it like its great entertainment  is very strange  and a little disturbing
ok  i get it  its a commentary on how conformity is a bad thing  and how we are all individuals  but the fact that people responded to the way they did just shows to me that people love conformity
this movie was so so so overrated
the jokes were terrible and emmett was insanely annoying
i mean the first line was hes coming
cover you butt
the moment i heard that line i knew the movie was gonna go downhill from there
and i was right
the jokes flew by so fast they went right over my head
but the ones i did get
werent funny at all
now i will admit i enjoyed the character unikitty i know a catunicorn
stay with me
she was pretty funny with the whole happiness thing and she kept saying no about the negative stuff its called irony
plus the ending got boring
around the time the people appeared on screen the line cues got slower and slower and more boring
most people have been saying that the ending sucked it did but i like it because the movie finally ended
anyway this movie is bad
the only reason why im giving it a generous 5 is because the animation actually was awesome
that was one of the few good things about this movie
so unless you only pay attention to the animation and not the story line this is not for you
i absolutely hated this movie
having paid for my family around a10 each to watch what is basically an advert for lego i just feel cheated
i didnt find the cheeky nods and winks to other classic films funny i didnt find the script funny
it was too loud too slow too
rubbish for me to watch
im not sure if this is a spoiler or not but i have no idea what the ending was about the whole will ferrell thing with its preachy lesson of adults forgetting the value of being able to be creative  complete tosh
my family felt the same by the way
no amount of reading the rave reviews with explanations can hide the fact that this film simply does not live up to the hype
what happens when you mix parody and product placement for a toy brand into one film
you get yourself the lego movie one of the greatest animations of the 2010s
plus there is also the great voice acting specially from liam neeson who plays bad copgood cop
the film follows the history of emmet voiced by chris pratt an ordinary and generic lego construction worker who found the piece of resistance and is prophesied to be the special one the hero who will save the universe from lord business voiced by will farrel
as i said this movie is a parody of chosen one histories where emmet is the most interesting important and talented person of the world but when he is just a generic lego toy
the irony about this film is that it somewhat criticizes capitalism the monopoly of big companies  being alienated by these companies etc
but its one of the biggest product placement of all time to be presented in a movie
this is a film that i contemplated seeing for a long time
it appeared to be another one of those young kid movies with cool explosions and some boring clichas
while yes the movie certainly contains those there an underlying message in this film that is undeniably heartbreaking for all ages
the strict lord business the boring emmett the fun and rebellious wildstyle it all comes together with such grace and entertainment and is surely one of the best animated films of all time
show your kids show your parents
this film will remind you what its like to be a kid and also remind you that sometimes its necessary to break a few rules
when i was a kid i used to love building with legos
i suppose back then i might have liked this movie a bit better but today i really think its lousy
a movie about legos is a great idea but much of the film is rather awkward and confusing
its hard to keep track of whats what
for a little while i was actually having a hard time staying awake
what makes it especially weird is how it eventually starts transitioning from the fantasy animated world to the real world
i can see why some people may like this but i find it to be basically just a weird interruption
if the movie had started out in the real world before going into the main story it wouldve made a little more sense
im an old fart as far as this lego thing is concerned
i remember them from when i was a kid of course but that was before they started doing all the stuff with them that they do now
in my day you could just build buildings with them
not really special buildings either just ordinary stuff
we also used to tie onions on our belts because that was the style at the time but ill leave that story for grampa simpson to tell
anyway the voicework is great
i especially liked morgan freeman as vitruvius
the story is surprisingly pretty good
i was expecting something kind of dumb but its actually a fun movie and smarter than i thought it would be
its something both kids and adults can enjoy
oh and i thought the double decker couch was a good idea
sue me
wow just wow
having grown up with lego through the 70s amp 80s and liking nerdy things star wars super heroes and fantasydundeons amp dragons this movie was just pure awesomeness
along with the nerdfest the cgi computer graphics actually looks more like old school stopstart motion animation
to be honest i have grown to hate cgi
it is over used and has a certain cheap look to it
the animation based company that did the animations in this film have achieved perfection here by making the movie look like stopstart motion animation and creating a sense that the lego is real
a big thumbs up to the australian cgi company that was hired for this job
oh yeah the star wars scene was awesome
the lego movie was a spectacular movie for my wife and kids they enjoyed it thoroughly
the voice talent was also comedic and not over the top type of comedy
emit and wildstyle were the most lovable characters by far
we only wished the film was a bit longer because my three kids couldnt get enough of it but i suppose that was for the better as it leaves room for more in the future
the lego movie is a bit reminiscent of a childhood cartoon i used to watch called gobots where my favorite character or hero was sort of the weak link of the bunch
in all lego movie was fun for ages 5 to 80 and the marketing has been off the wall
i give this movie a 9 out of 10 simply because the awesome song was sung in the car all the way home
this film is probably one of the best films ive ever seen
im amazed with how everything is made of lego
not just do children love it but so do adults
if you ever get the chance to choose a film to go out to watch choose the lego movie
the reason ive given it ten stars is because its funny inspiring and awesome
when i went to see it almost every one was laughing
there are no dull bits or boring bits in it at all
i think its epic how they put in lego city lego star wars and loads more
this film id recommend it to absolutely anyone
i was laughing the whole way through the movie
its the most creative film ive ever seen
whatever you do get buying tickets
by archie aged 8
my son amp i had a blast watching the lego movie
very funny for adults and children
i loled at some parts  great sound track
very good story made me remember what fun it was to play as a kid and how much i miss that
had a lot of action too
i would totally see this again
i got that awesome song stuck in my head
this movie made me way happier than i should be
even hours later while writing this i am still feeling happy
that is weird right
i mean i am normally not unhappy but i am just not happy either i mean i am just normal feeling but i checked
yep still feeling happy
weird but not weird weird  just good weird i guess
you ever notice that weird is kinda weird when you spell it it just looks weird
like kinda wrong but ya know you spelled it right
that is weird
i think i am tired but i still feel happy
i just wish i could get the awesome song out of my brain
uuuugggghhh
stupid ear worms any ways go see the movie and be happy
wish it could have had more substance but from the opening moments of the film the lego movie fires an endless array of jokes at its audience from seemingly every angle
writers phil lord and christopher miller who also directed the film have an expert grasp of the absurd and they use it to great effect ensuring that every scene is stuffed to the gills with laughs
many of the films best moments are derived from the fact that the characters vehicles and environments are created from lego pieces one of the rules established by the filmmakers was that everything appearing on screen must be possible to construct in the real world
its a good mix of humor heart and creativity and provides a great foundation to build on
i was super excited to see this movie when i first saw the commericials for it
i never got a chance to see it in the theater so a few days after it was released on dvd i went to a friends house and we ended up watching it
so the first 45 minutes made me laugh a few times but after they met unikitty i started loosing interest
i really didnt like how they made it that humans were controlling the legos the whole time
once emmet got to the human world i really got confused with what was happening
i was confused if emmet turned out really being the special or if that whole thing was a confusion or something and what ended up happening to bad cop good cops parents
overall this was an ok movie but it should ve been much clearer considering im a kid and i got confused with what was happening in a kids movie
at first glance this movie does not look like it should be appealing
it looks like an advertisement for some toys or to reboot a franchise
however it turns out to be possibly the best animated movie of all time
after seeing this movie my siblings would not stop reenacting the movie with toys playing the video games etc
the film is extremely funny and charming and jokes are timed so well that it looks like a beautiful piece of art
the characters are so separate and unique that their gang looks like the new toy story gang
the movie starts off a bit slow to edge you into the movie and sooner or later youll be in love with all the surprises and events you didnt know could possibly happen in a lego based movie
overall the lego movie is like the perfect animated movie to me
this movie was ok but not great
not too keen on will ferrel or morgan freemam
the move was doing pretty good until they added the human part to it near the end which made it go from a very good movie to just an ok movie
the human part basically explained what was going on in the movie a spoiled brat that didnt like being told what to do or respecting the privacy of others
even with the stop action filming it was pretty good but would have been much better with computer animation like the other lego movies
i suggest that the next time a lego movie is made that it be kept purely lego without adding the human elements to the movie like they did this one
also dont portray the trouble makers as the good guys
i do not understand the fascination with this movie
we took my 10 year old daughter and 4 of her friends to see this and my husband and i were bored to tears
nearly took a snooze
when we asked the girls how they liked it god forbid we be allowed to sit with them during the movie they all said ehhh with a shoulder shrug
understanding which celebrities provided the voices made it more interesting for the adults and the animation was spectacular
after conferring with my husband we agree that its a standard well animated kids movie much like the million others weve been subjected to in the past 10 years
cute but definitely not a must see
originally i was expecting this movie to suck because of the lego tv shows on cartoon network or maybe its also because of the straight to video lego movies but it didnt suck
it was an absolutely hilarious and awesome movie
they actually poke fun at the clichas and it works perfectly
it has now also became of my favorite franchises ever
i have always liked the character emmet after watching this movie because hes pretty much just like me
i wasnt very creative when it comes to building legos and was always following the instructions
batman was awesome in this movie as well
i have even seen the lego batman movie recently last month and it too was awesome
i hope the same thing will happen to the lego ninjago movie six more months later
now this movie feels like if it was influenced by yellow submarine
i know this movie was actually inspired by stopmotion lego brickfilms but this movie also feels like yellow submarine
and yes legos are made to move like stopmotion unless in video games maybe
but either way i love the lego movie
the lego movie is a different and fun animation  see lego that many children playing in childhood into a movie is something very nostalgic the films plot is simple and nothing innovative  the soundtrack is cool and the characters may be the most positive pointer the film the protagonist is funny is charismatic  the animation has participation of comic heroes star wars character  etc
batman is featured in this movie and its really fun  superman also makes an appearance  the villain is to cool more nothing different from other villains in animated films  the end is very good and the pace is great  the animation flies  the films duration also helps  the lego movie is a very fun animation with the participation of many wellknown characters  besides having funny moments
note 7
9
i went into this film thinking that it was going to be another soulless kid film filled to the brim with pop culture references that would be outdated in a year
im glad to say that lego movie isnt that at all
this film starts off with a really catchy song that youll never be able to get out of your head and a main character who is actually relatable
the characters in this film who are licensed works like batman and superman are actually made into funny characters with their own personalities
the ending of this film i wont say here is sort of a twist but its a twist that brings this film a strong sense of depth and astuteness that i totally wasnt expecting at all
i highly recommend this movie to kids and adults alike
i really enjoyed watching this movie
it is one of the most entertaining film i have seen to date
at first i was a bit unsure if the movie was really as great as they say it was
from the trailer it just looked like talking blocks with some lame animations
that all changed after i saw the movie
i loved it
it contained so many funny moments as well as crossovers from many heroes and villains lego fied of course
the animations and special effects of this movie were amazing
i couldnt ask for anything better
it also contained parts where it will warm you heart and make you full of joy
i dont think you can ask for a better movie
i recommend this movie to people of all ages because i dont think there are going to be many movies that will beat the lego movies funny and entertaining story line
the nice thing about legos is that they can be anything
they have the plastic malleability to become structures characters villains you name it
of course just about every movie for kids is about saving the earth or the universe
this is a nonstop fountain of the primary colors that keeps going
the strength isnt so much in the plot but in the multiple way the legos can be used to show emotions and true humanity
there is some romance and some brinkmanship but ultimately it gets down to true creativity
the universe is truly the lego board and if you or your kids have ever played together you know the overwhelming possibilities
there are some pretty good songs in here but i must admit they have become pretty tiresome
far more fun than the concept really had any right to be braving new horizons while still remaining loyal to the beating heart of the product and its passionate generations of fans
simply enough this is a perfect encapsulation of the kind of imagination enthusiasm adaptation and sheer randomness that runs like lifeblood through the spirit of a happy childhood
it jabs in delightfully unexpected directions
it bends physics without an explanation nor a need for one
it casually hops from one licensed fantasy to another mashing green lantern with gandalf and doesnt even slow down to consider the repercussions
at the best of times i felt like i was a kid again myself lost in nostalgia and the infinite potential locked away within every new block
and while the last act overreaches in an effort to really hammer the morals home otherwise this is pretty much a direct hit
crafty funny writing a dazzling array of vocal talent and a playful distinct visual style  this is the kind of family film i can always make room for
the lego movie has been cult well among many fans as a great visual experience and the film can be seen as living to its expectations
it might seem like a reach to base a film essentially on a series of plastic blocks but this 3d animated comedy has some visual inspiration behind it even if the big laughs arent quite plentiful enough to carry a featurelength production
the story essentially follows the misadventures of emmet voiced by chris pratt an ordinary lego construction worker who stumbles on to a diabolical attempt at world domination by president business will ferrell and his henchmen led by a twofaced cop liam neeson
so emmet turns from social outcast to unlikely hero as he teams with batmans girlfriend elizabeth banks and a blind man morgan freeman who dispenses pearls of wisdom in an effort to save the day
overall a very well made film which has been in production for several years back
you might not expect this to hold together the attention of an older audience but this movie is all right angles where it counts and machined to a fine tolerance
its actually a brilliant deconstruction of the interchangeable pieces of the tropes of adventure stories as always centered on a substitutable everyman who just want to fit in
his instincts are not heroic if anything he is actually quite yellow
but the movie builds a magnificent plot out of seemingly disparate yet interlocking components making for a veritable playset of a universe
in all this its a film that is much more than the sum of its parts  duplo
one of the best movies ive ever seen in my life
mostly in story line
this animation was talking about capitalism socialism parallel worlds theory self confidence and
simultaneously
which it was interesting for children and adult audiences
the writers were have been geniuses
by sure it should be nominated for oscar this year
it makes you think about the creation system of world the man upstairs and fin where two different persons
the legos didnt know this at all
the ordinary lego construction worker saw their creator however the wise man didnt see it at all
besides finwho created and was running the story  had another lord who was ruling him the man upstairs
it was philosophical
this 90 minute infomercial for the iconic childrens toy presents about 20 minutes of clever but plodding worldbuilding
at about that mark the filmmakers find this whole other hyperactive gear and the jokes come faster than vin diesel in a street race
enough batman and star wars references fly at the audience to give a geek study group fodder for several nights
the movie runs through genres as often as lego worlds middle zealand being a personal favorite while teeing up clicha bursting oneliners as rapidly as audience members can laugh at them
just at the point of exhaustion they trout out will farrell to play a weirdlyobsessed dad outside the fourth wall
that the writers can take all the plot points the subplots and the metaplot and wrap it up into what actually turns out to be a warm and somehow affecting ending speaks to the level of prowess missing from the lost tv show
in short one of the few movies actually worth buying as well as best commercial ever
i wont repeat what everyone has said
their positive criticisms i agree with
what i would like to add is that there is another layer to this film that hardly gets mentioned
the lego world is like ours mr
business is the government and we are getting distracted by crap that gets put on television
in the lego world the masses are getting subdued into normal life by making them all watch where is my pants
and making them listen to generic music like everything is awesome
media is influencing people into continuing to live their normal and structured lives and this is also evident in our world especially with the miley cyrus garbage and reality tv shows that softens the masses while wars and killings happen overseas and poverty ravages third world countries
but just like the lego world we are influenced into just living our lives and turning a blind eye to what is really happening in our world
a fun entertaining and surprisingly clever film the lego movie combines an amusing script with a terrific cast of characters while also containing a profound and thoughtful message underneath
the exceptionally welldesigned and colorful animation creates a visually very impressive film however perhaps its best feature is the intelligent and creative writing that produces a touching story with a plethora of comedic inputs along the way
for the most part the film relies heavily on its humorous aspect offering numerous pop culture references and a satirical view of different genres and various notable film characters
yet the lego movie ultimately uses its imaginative approach to communicate to its audience many deep and highly significant ideas inspiring creativity and individualism in its viewers
overall it is a delightful comedy adventure with a stimulating story in its core thus making it a film wellworth watching
faster then a speeding bullet fly the jokes in this delightful movie sure to entertain the current crop of attention deficit kids
the allstar voice cast is spot on the animation is bright and colourful and the surprises are plenty
standouts in the voice cast include liam neesons multiple personality cop and cris pratts emmett though there are really no weaknesses here
maybe most amazing for a movie based off of a successful line of toys the story is competently told
it moves at an engaging pace and is interesting enough to keep even the adults watching
nothing at all wrong here except a side quibble about the marketing for the movie
a lot of the movies best jokes were already divulged in the trailers for the film
i went in without expecting much just taking my 6 year old for a fun weekday treat
this movie was absolutely fantastic
i do not know if it was real stop motion all computer or the more likely combination of the 2 but the look is pure real lego all the way through
it is silly and fun and very well written with a great voice cast and some good self aware humor thrown in for the adults
this works both as a kid movie and an adult movie
if you like stop motion animation then this will probably be a no brainer choice to go see but for those on the fence i highly recommend it
a rare breed of lighthearted kids oriented comedy that doesnt talk down to the audience
very well done and if you get a chance go see it in 3d some very good use of it here
i predict this will have cult status in a few years
dads the bad guy
maybe not every dad is exactly like will ferrell toward the end of the lego movie with a hoard of 7
5 million plastic bricks krazy glued together into 82 skyscrapers and scores of other objects filling the basement surrounded by 36 do not touch signs meant for mom and their kids
but very few dads fail to spend huge chunks of their familys budgets on their metaphorical own private lego lands whether its collectible beer cans trout fishing flies vinyl records comic books amp action figures in their original shrinkwrapped boxes etc
the average dad cordons off large swaths or entire rooms of family living space for their time and moneyconsuming hobbies while tattooing do not touch signs on the hearts of the rest of their family members
well its time for moms to lead a rebellion
take your little ones to see the lego movie then storm dads citadel touching everything
touch touch touch touch touch touch touch
only dont do this if dad collects guns
the lego movie is an odd blend of energy and color wrapped around a paper thin narrative
most of the film is an unhinged series of very busy visuals with lots and lots of noise  stimulation overkill
i could imagine the psychotic effects this would have on a child watching before bedtime possibly something along the lines of the child ingesting strychnine and a bottle of nodoze
the lego movie can be an exhausting film to watch but more often than not the film is charming enough without pandering to children
it does transcend its corporate shackles in what could have easily been a feature length toy commercial in lesser hands but phil lord and christopher miller give enough soul to this material
the film is a lot easier to enjoy on a visceral level as these silly lego characters dont really engage and the voice work is well cast and deliver their readings with enough wit
while not exactly deep subversive satire the lego movie does have just enough substance beneath all the noise
the film is very beautiful film in terms of humor which carried the story and that her body representatives brilliantly add visual effects beautiful addition to the end of the film the most wonderful the beginning and before that never simple cash that we are loved thank all the workers on the production of the film for their fun of us in fact we enjoyed and we see this wonderful family film
but after be that the output level of the desired valvkahh and shooting angles were very jamali in addition to the movements and the way the characters talk and fashion either amatherat sound and image was not too bad as the director excelled in making
the lego movie is in the same vein as a pixar production this animated movie will therefore appeal to the younger audience as well as the older viewers thanks to the richness of the references and the characters density its offbeat humour and cynicism
the cinematography and animations are beautiful but since it was made via cgcis its a bit hard to understand why they would want to make it look like its stopmotion
as for the scenario the story is well thoughtout but goes maybe a bit all over the place a especially at the end a you barely could have handled even 15 minutes more
all in all great success for this first opus about the lego world
great movie
there are so many aspects of this movie that make it great
the first is that everything is awesome about it
i just love the way they combined stopmotion animation with cgi to make the film have a classic stopmotion feel to it but also a more modern and smooth feel to it at the same time
also its hilarious
the characters the lines the voices and the relationships between the characters just make the film so creative and funny
in all honesty its probably one of the best films ive ever seen in my life and i wish there was an 11star option for the ratings its that good
overall its an epic funny and overall awesome film
if you havent already seen it go out and see it
this is a fun film for kids and adults alike
had gone to the film with high expectations and wasnt disappointed
the movie is about a ordinary builder and how he was chosen to save the world and the events resulting in this
will arnett voice adds another dimension to this movie
this movie has comedy action and well as a tiny bit of romance into it
visuals and 3d effects are appealing
its soundtrack is pretty good to with my favorite its so awesomeits isnt a fresh story but well its makes up with the direction and the dialogs
hope there ill be a sequel to this movie
well as the film says this film is very awesome
this is a must watch film for all and hopefully we will get to see a sequel
this is my favorite animated film till now
the animation was excellent meaning the directors and animators did a great job making it look like actual lego bricks
the inclusion of batman gave it a wonderful storyline with clever jokes
spoiler alert
loved the live action part having will ferrell as the father resembling lord business
its a film for all ages to enjoy and inspire kids to buy the mini figures
the casting was a great choice by having morgan freeman and will arnett
my only criticism was that the other superheroes like superman and wonder woman werent really involved in the main story
however batmans role was great and added the main comedy to the film alongside emmetts clumsiness
couldnt have asked more from the film and the message of the film was great as well
best animated movie of all time for many reasons
chiefly no cursing which means that anyone can watch it
seriously i was in the theater with both tiny kids and elderly people alike
second it has a wonderful message that imagination and individuality are much better than strict rigidity yet it does so without being childish or overly mature either it hits the sweet spot
it looks amazing too
the characters looks like they are stopmotion animated and the colors are vivid and lovely
and its amazingly funny it never takes itself too seriously and the theme song is the catchiest ever
theres a scene where the characters are singing it and then theres a title card that reads five hours later its completely accurate
youll come out of the movie feeling so happy and singing the song at the top of your lungs
its so good
everything about this movie is amazing
an absolute mustsee
this is a must see
its so good its funny smart and has a few elements of childishness such as the cats meowing or the bruuuummm when the ship goes off but its hilarious
it brings back memories of fun with lego and how colorful and amazing it was
the song of everything is awesome is so catchy and funny
in my opinion the use of things in the film such as lord businesss artifacts was so clever and the ending was so clever as well not gonna give too much away
it pulls everything off so smart and i personally think everything thats lego is hilarious such as the lego games
this is quite a brief kind of insight from me but i would recommend to everyone
alright so im an adult and ive seen just about every single rated r comedy that has come out within the last 5 years and id have to say that i laughed more in this movie than all of those movies combined
this is good genuine comedy and thats definitely hard to come by these days
especially with legos being in my childhood this was a killer combo of nostalgia and good laughs
i was constantly being amazed with the fantastic animation and production that this film possessed
also what a wonderful cast of voices for the characters
it seemed like they all had a blast playing their roles
and what a fantastic job by the writers too
the story line was very much reflective of the society we live in in america
its a wellrounded and enlightening story for kids to hear
the writers really did their homework on this one
i honestly just made an account on imdb cause i was so stoked to write this review
great job lego movie id definitely watch again
legos is one great international company that has redefined itself so successfully in the american marketplace
i guess i cant join what looks to be the large majority of imdb members in saluting their venture into the movie industry
sorry i just didnt get this one
we have this sort of ordinary fungible dweeb in corporate world who becomes the chosen one to save all the fungible dweebs in corporate world from the evil corporate overlord who has his own bizarre plot to freeze all the dweebs for unclear reasons
along the way we see familiar characters from other fantasy movies in their own lego fashion along with some unique to this movie
the world they present is hardly new see cloudy ii and really very unpleasant for kids and dads alike
there are moments of sort of odd and goofy humor and the twist towards the end is sort of interesting but again it doesnt really fit with the rest of the movie
im glad for all of the people who enjoyed this but me and my 8 year old dont share their opinion
lots of good visuals and plot in this film but the idea that mediocrity is greatness and that the world can be magically changed just by wishing it were so is just so inaccurate and inane
this film tries to manufacture emotional depth without actually having any  kind of an example of the main problem which is that just by wishing they made a movie with real meaning it could be so
toy story and up and so many other movies actually have emotional depth and real feeling and the contrast highlights that this facsimile is using pure manipulation
and kids know the difference  my ten year old daughter left shaking her head at the end and wondering what had gone wrong and why we didnt just go see frozen again which would have been a better idea
i cant believe this movie has an 810
that score properly earned would place it in the annals of movie history alongside flawless classics such as alien terminator or the wrath of khan
the reality is the lego movie is a pixarlike cookie cutter plot coupled to nauseainducing stopmotion animation
the jokes are tedious predictable and seemingly unending and the action is mindnumbingly frenetic
sprinkle in some torturelike will ferrell live action and what youre left with might possibly be the most abrasive film ever made
the lego movie makes toy story look like fine art and is a perfect example of cinematic shovelware
everything is awesome
yes many thing are awesome but not this movie
this movie is strange and leaves me confused
this movie encouraged to monitor the time instead of pay attention
animated movies are not that hard to make and there were many animated movies that were amazing
for example finding nemo
a great movie that i have many times
this move is not finding nemo
watch finding nemo
this original creative animation is fantastic and fun for all the family chris pratt who plays emmett is a builder like everybody else at least thats what he thinks
emmett is just an ordinary guy in an extraordinary city and really turns out that he copies everything that everyone else does
he meets a woman named lucywildstyle elizabeth banks and she trusts him to find his skill to be a megabuilder
they go on this great adventure which along the way they meet some extraordinary characters and they all fight together to save the world my favourite part is when good copbad cop is played liam neeson and also when they go into the real world with will ferrell playing the little lads father and they get along so well at the end
fantastic fun for all the family

this movie is hysterical
its so funny and everyone involved with this movie should be proud
its one of those perfect combinations of comedy that reaches both adults and kids
youll fall in love with the characters and theyll make you smile long after the credits
criticism could come as soon as you hear the title and immediately believe itll just be an advertisement used to promote sales but nope this movie is more than that
its heartfelt entertaining and fun to watch
if you missed it in theaters you should defiantly check it out on ondemand netflix or d

because its simply a mustsee
i hope im not raising your expectations too high but even if you dont love its undeniably good
ive heard things about a sequel and am very excited and anxious to see where these rumors lead
i hope you enjoy it as much as i do
personally i remember the great times i had playing with my toys when i was a child
lego playmobil and action figures gave me thousands of hours of fun because i was able to create these really insane worlds where all these toys would interact
the stories i imagined were all more preposterous than the other but in my mind they were all as epic as star wars or lord of the rings
and here we have a film that encapsulates all of that imagination in one story
the story is not important its bad against good but its a fun unique out of the many story with twists and turns you would expect
the story has many action movie tropes such as a prophecy a meeting of heroes a heist and battles
this movie definitely was made for children in mind but adults will enjoy this film nonetheless with the many pop culture references and nostalgia linked with these imaginative toys
i still wish i had this sort of imagination and watching this film was having it back for an hour and a half
