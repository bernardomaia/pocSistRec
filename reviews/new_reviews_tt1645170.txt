just been to see this film and could never stop laughing
sacha baron cohen is a true comedic talent
an excellent writer as the jokes in it are genius
the film is short but packed full of laughter
perhaps im an easy laugher but what can i say i liked it
a lot
as well as the comedy being brilliant the actual plotstoryline is superb also
from watching the trailer and then watching the film it was actually a completely different story to how i thought it was going to be
i wasnt very excited to see the film after the trailers but decided to venture in
i enjoyed it much more than i expected and will likely see it again
it isnt for the easilyoffended but if this is your sort of humor then you need to go and watch it now
one of the funniest movies i know
there are so many good jokes based on whats happening in the world
if you read the news on a daily basis and know whats going on in the world youll like this movie
some people may not like cohen but i think hes a genius
it really takes something to show the problems that we have in a funny way
however you should really go and watch that movie its worth the money
i personally watched it twice in theater
now i really dont know what to write anymore without giving away any jokes because the jokes come one after another
i was already laughing out loud after one minute
its really cool if you watch a movie in theater and everyone in the room is laughing
so my definitive final conclusion is that the dictator is more than a movie its an experience
this movie was absolutely dirty offensive hilarious racist and crazy overthetop moments
its about the same style as sacha baron cohens previous movies but its done much better
cohen plays a silly ruthless dictator named admiral general aladeen
he is very antisemitic and plans on creating nuclear weapons
he hates the very idea of democracy
while on his way to the united nations hes betrayed and shaven so no one would recognize him
hes taken in by zoey a vegan hippie and gives him a job at her store
will aladeen make it to the u
n
to stop democracy from coming to his country or will zoey change his heart
i would definitely recommend the dictator
i really enjoyed sacha baron cohens previous work with borat
i came in to the dictator with relatively high hopes for some good laughs
ill say that i wasnt disappointed in the slightest
cohen gets some great laughs on politically incorrect humour in to this film and its well done
in the first 10 minutes of the film i was laughing my head off with the consistency of the humour but i can see why in the later half this can not be abundant
however sometimes this film falls flat with a lot of humour being delayed in the last half of the movie
sometimes it but very rarely feels like it is not cohen
however these jokes are still a bundle of laughs for the right people
overall its a great film if youre familiar with cohens other work
what do people expect from a movie to be excellent
im an iranian and he was joking about our president
it made me laugh so what
this film is only a comedy a simple but in my opinion magnificent comedy this is not one of those expensive hollywood movies that the turned 200 cars on fire to make
but as a comedy and nothing more it made me laugh several times and having a good time is only thing you expect from a good comedy
i think this ratings are really just not supportive  yeah it seems many people expected some thing real and fancy the same way but the whole point of comedy is to laugh so i dont see why not 10 stars
sorry if there were some grammatical mistakes
and this movie supposed to be a comedy
who was the target group
people with lower iq level i guess
nothing worked here
script was pointless stupid with some odd jokes that make you only puke
acting was terrible
of course what we expected after previous work bruno which was the most stupid and disgusting movie ever made
this one is in some kind of way in same direction
i have no idea what was ben kingsley doing in this rubbish
the role of the dictator by s
b
cohen is just unsatisfying and amateurish even for a comedy
every next role of him is getting worse
maybe i wont watch his movies anymore
this was too much for me
i dont want to waste more words to describe this folly
just avoid it
they are scraping the bottom of the barrel with this movie
please dont waste your time or money watching this
it shouldnt even be called a film
what do we call it then
they really stoop low so low
stooping low is necessary when there is really zero content
the dictator is very poorly done
there is nothing to laugh about
its not funny
the film is a disgrace
it is truly unbelievable what goes out to market these days
who approved this and how could it ever have been approved
i felt embarrassed for the actors
when movies are this bad customers should have the option of getting their money back
the movie goes from scene to scene to scene
there is no consistency and it is complete nonsense
in the previews theyll show you what you will think is funny
i thought other reviewers were exaggerating as to how low the film stooped but they were not
the actors who were paid for this film along with the producers and directors should refund the viewers who were totally disappointed with it
absolute garbage
not since the pest have seen a comedy this bad
oh sure pink panther 2 was horrible but this takes it to a whole new level
cohen should not be allowed to make another movie and farris and kinglsey need to have their heads examined
it simply not funny racist offensive and filled with flat jokes
you can see the jokes coming a mile away and everyone is as lame as you imagined
its funny how most critics would say mel brooks fell off with his last 4 films spaceballs life stinks robin hood and dracula and the box office receipts might agree with them although i never have
all of those films have merit in some ways but this  this is how you fall off
its absolute shite
this film was a disappointment to say the least not just by the terrible acting but also by the structure of the film
sasha has really let himself down with this one from the days of ali g indahouse and borat you can clearly see that he has sold himself out
this film consists of a poor attempt at comedy that cannot be described as more than 2 stars just like the cast
if anybody goes to see this film with any expectation please dont as you will see the harsh reality of what once was a comedy genius selling himself out to hollywood in order to make big money instead of sticking to what he knows best
the surprise element in the dictator was aa nothing
i watched the trailer before and thats all that was in this film apart from a terrible script and woeful acting throughout
all i can say is please just stick to the trailer and do not waste ninety minute of your life you will never get back
sasha cohen is old news
the movie had a cheap comedy
if you will laugh at anything then its not bad
i rather go to sleep
the movie has no sense of direction
the actors are c storyline is weak there are some funny line here and there
borat was excellent however this was disappointment
the ali g show was great when it came out
this was a continuation of the ali g show
there was a lot of racism and typical stereotypes but most were overplayed
this movie was probably done in sasha mind in a 5 minute dream
i am glad i did not pay to watch this movie
i guess when he spilled the ashes on ryan seacrest this was a sign how bad his movie was
he is a great actor i commend him on his work in other movies but this movie was for amateurs
this movie was great in the beginning it was really funny and i loved it
it set itself up to be a great comedy that i would gladly give about a 7 or 8 to but then in the second half it took a major turn for the worse
the movie got really inappropriate and im one who normally likes inappropriate comedy but this just went way too far to the point where it wasnt funny and it ruined the movie for me
the story is fine i mean its a comedy so its not going to be ground breaking so that was fine
its not a movie that im going to want to watch more than the time that i already saw it but you will be entertained if you watch it
overall i would say its not worth your time but if you do watch it its not the worst
awful script awful acting its awful from the beginning to the end but i was surprised that sir ben kingsley agreed to take part in this one sad to see him in the cast
if you are a good viewer you will see the whole summary of the film
im not saying dont expect much i am just saying dont expect anything at all i dont like writing bad reviews but i tried my hardest to write at least something anything good about the film but i couldnt find any
of course we know its an absurd comedy and we put our logics aside before watching the film but we cant ignore horrible acting and weak plot i mean you could have at least shown us that you made some effort and some thinking about making the film
really disappointment
this is up there with one of the worst movies i have ever seen
and i loved borat and bruno
to me its lazy and completely predictable
with none of the shock elements of his previous movies
i cant tell you how bad this movie was
but what i am amazed is it got 6
7 so far in imdb which now makes me doubt this site
overall the core problem is that the subject matter ie dictators just does not offer the same scope nor the opportunity to give you that real scenarios where the main character is causing caos
this to me was sasha with a bigger budget not knowing or caring of the outcome
brutal
every joke was obvious
the accents were terrible
it just like any originality
i sat there with a sense of disbelief about some of the scenes
really really disappointing
but then the trailer didnt suggest much
butni thought given it was sasha that it would be great
brutal
sacha baron cohens outrageous but liberating total lack of political correctness
the amazingly ridiculous beard of aladeen
anna faris and s
b
c
s unexpected chemistry
the music and the songs which are really good and greatly adds to the atmosphere and the humour
the dictator is not as wonderfully great and funny as borat
nothing is
still you cant help comparing
this movie is really funny movie
i laughed so much that my it gave aches in my stomach
should you watch this movie
yes
definitely
just watch it and have a good time
but the movie contains some curse language and little bit of nudity but thats ok just watch it with your friends
the jokes in this movies opening parts are very much hilarious
although their very subjects may be perceived as offensive as most people still they crack out great laughs
i really like how the movie really uses great imagination in depicting the crazily stupid things the dictator may do
couple that with the sensitive issues of race terrorism suspicion and phobia to arabs the movie makes it a fun way to approach such sensitive matters
but then all those good stuff strays away some time near the ending
the movie tries to follow the pattern of mainstream comedies by bringing in the romantic relationship
i think that having the character zoe is nice to add balance to the story
but forcing in to be predictable by following to have a romantic relationship brings the predictability up
the acting is just a standard overall but the jokes are really enjoyable that they cover up the lack of acting quality
abadeen is the dictator of a crappy little north african country and he is modeled after the likes of kadafi and kim jong il
but to make such a character more palatable he is played for laughsalbeit very uneven ones
thats because the dictator is an incredibly uneven filmwith lots of funny parts and lots of unfunny and offensive parts
my advice is to definitely not watch it with your kids your motherinlaw or father jenkins
but if none of them are around and you have a high tolerance for this crude humor then by all means watch
but i am warning youthere are lots of rape jokes some fullfrontal nudity and lots and lots of sex jokes
worth seeing
i dunnobut it did often make me laughespecially when i watched the olympics
a movie where you can be free to laugh at stereotypical jokes even with a friend or your girlfriend from a different culture just to get away from all the racial tension these days
if youre hypersensitive to racial jokes do all of us a favor do not bother watching it
even with the crude and sometimes uncomfortable humor its still a pretty good movie
though most people prefer borat to this movie in my opinion i kind of prefer this
though you might feel guilty afterwards after laughing to the stereotype jokes
however people should remember it is a satire and they should not take the jokes so seriously as some of my friends have
its just a movie kickback relax and enjoy the show
that was just awesome
theres only one is a 100 years like sacha baron cohen
i was worried when i prepared to watch this movie
so ive decided to select a jim carrey movie
just for a moment my eyes stuck at cohen and he got selected
the past 80 minutes of my life has one of the best 80 minutes ive ever been
in short now i turned to be a big fan of him and searched all his works and bought all of them from amazone and just finish watching
this is all a one man show and as it should be
if you want to laugh and to get some relief from tension read the bible first and then watch any movie of sacha baron cohen especially this one
hm disappointing
sure i did not expect a high culture movie from sacha baron cohen but borat was a pleasant surprise
while bruno was somewhat disappointing too i got my hopes up for two reasons
the first was reading this was to have more of a story as well
the second was the surprisingly memorable performance by baron cohen in scorseses hugo
but the dictator is merely a chain of sketches stitched together to form a story
this would not be a problem if most of it was funny see borat but there is too little material which is of good enough comedic value
bruno was disappointing but at least successful in its uncompromising bad humour
this leaves no impression at all
in typical irreverent humor cohen has a unique way of presenting reality in the most provocative way he excels at it
in this movie the character is perhaps chosen because the subject could not be more contemporary
there are some very funny moments and an abundance of not so funny ones
as with all the previous sacha baron cohen characters he plays the role of a character you would really love to beat the sh out of so he provides that outlet like few others do
there are supporting cast members and cameos that also add greatly to an otherwise mediocre production
i did have fun watching it but i picked an appropriate time to do so its perfect when you have a lull in your viewing schedule
this movie is not intended for cultured and educated people
ive seen this one with a friend of mine on the plane heading for home
first i didnt intend to finish watching it but i thought  i have much time why not spend some on this trash
i think this movie was produced completely by israeli ones
it has a political message to deliver to the audience
the theme of the film is utterly absurd
the comedy is artificially unnatural
the is no plausible sequence of events
the main point is how to deform the picture of the other in any possible way
we know mr cohen is an english actor but at the same time he holds the israeli citizenship
the only funny thing about this movie  are the raving reviews of people who thought it was funny
sacha baron coen wrote this movie as a joke
he is now reading all these good reviews of his terribly unfunny film and he is laughing his socks off
no brit is going to be impressed by this film
and he knows it
he is laughing reading imdb reviews
the joke is on the public for sure
i think it was his evil plot all along  to make a terrible movie and then laugh at all the people who laughed
i still love him though
even if he is totally taking the mickey
he cant help himself
he is famous enough now to get away with it
lol
the dictator 2012  sacha baron cohen anna faris jason mantzoukas ben kingsley john c
reilly kevin corrigan bobby lee fred armisen cameo  megan fox as herself lackluster satire from baron cohen as ruthless fictional terrorist leader haffaz alladeen of wadiya as in whatayakiddnme
whose attempt to deliver a fiery speech at the united nations has him replaced by his idiot decoy and the fishoutofwater despot trying desperately to fend for himself in the big apple with the unlikely help from organic food store owner faris again sadly misused and robbed of her naturally comedic talents
hamstrung screenplay by cohen alec berg david mandel and jeff schaffer has more missesthanhits and the static direction by the usually ontarget larry charles is woefully inept
a misfire for baron cohen and co
i found this movie just offensive on so many levels
the thing that just disgusted me the most is what i will deal with here
he blatantly and very obviously ripped off the great dictator and replaced all the grace and beauty in chaplins original with crass crude and very lowest common denominator gags
and that enlightened oh so amazing speech he gives at the end of the movie
watch chaplins original to see what the real thing sounds like and how beautiful and moving it is
this is just a really awful disrespectful abuse of a true geniuss work by someone arrogant enough to think no one would realize it was a complete rip off and a bad one at that
so good i still laugh till i cry two days later
ingenious
you may disagree with its jokes and its bluntness but feel free to have a good laugh
it is ok
if you are a man of any other culture than that of the united states you might be able to relate and enjoy the movie more than the average american
if you are an american who has been exposed to other cultures that would make you above average by the way you can at least learn to appreciate the movie if you do not already
if you are an activist of almost any sort or a feminist you might find it offensive
one thing for certain is that the dictator shine a little light upon our deepest desires the things we discuss among those who share our core values
the dictator is a must see regardless of your orientation religiously sexually politically
success spoils talent
we see it everywhere
this movie is a prime example
the ali g show hbo is cohen at his best
crazy edgy hilarious and above all brave
borat was a tad childish but very good with some amazing moments
bruno was uneven homophobic and a bit cruel  but also with its moments the scenes with the mexican furniture is not to be missed
now we have the dictator
while i commend cohen for giving a shot at scripted comedy and fully abandoning the impromptu reality comedy he excelled at sadly it was a complete miss
i did not laugh a single time in this terrible pointless sellout of a movie
a couple nervous laughs at the beginning as i hoped it would get better
but it never did
a complete and utter embarrassment on a part with hangover ii as one of the biggest comedy disappointments of the decade
awful awful awful
and to make things even worse not a shred of the intelligence or multilayered humor cohen is deservingly famous for
this is really worst movie i have seen
not a single time i feel like laughing
a movie starts with a leader laughing speech on nuclear weapon and obama taking action on weapon
a baby was born with a 5inch beard and long penile hair
what the hell is going on
leader goes to usa and someone cut his care and unwanted story begins
with the help of cute girl and his native country scientist he gave speech on democracy which all like
story revolve round some cheap comedy scenes and a look alike who ejaculates milk from beautiful lady breast
king of wadiya dont know about masturbation and many insane part which make me suffer headache i recommend dont watch this movie
as a fan of borat and ali g i was excited by the launch of the film and was evermore excited anticipating the next 1 and a half hours of another beautifully humorous sacha baron cohen classic
for the dictator is a film among many riddled with tasteless or sometimes in a excessively grotesque and childish demeanour not that the film is mature but consists of comedy that has not yet outgrown the playground distinguishing from previous sacha films
overall it surpasses the classic and highly amusive humour sacha baron cohen has previously achieved originally which has therefore ended the film in an utter disappointment
here is the short story of this movie
the trailers are way much better than the movie
from the beginning to the end the movie is full of jokes but most of them are really not funny
compared to the previous movies of cohen this one is at least worth watching
there was less insult less adult content more jokes that everybody can enjoy
the story line was not so brilliant but at least it was coherent
acting was kind of ok
considering the trailer was better than the movie i must say the directing was not so great
overall an average movie
it was worth the time i spent but i am not so sure whether it was worth the money i paid
i almost split my sides laughing
yes its crude politically incorrect and trivial but  at the end of the day  it is funny uplifting and entertaining
i read the fatuous politically correct review by james berardinelli who picked holes in this film  but hes got his nose so far up his own alladeen that he misses the point
this is a film to make you laugh
people who watch this film expecting to find some wonderful sense of enlightenment will be disappointed  in which case go and see some french film that shows a surly man smoking a cigarette commenting on life the universe and everything
watch this movie if you want a belly laugh and dont want to analyse the film with connoisseurs and pretentious twits over multiple glasses of chardonnay and late coffees
i loved the film
it made me feel good and giggle
its a shame there arent more movies like it
the worlds miserable enough
we need more inane laughter  its good for the soul
the dictator is hilarious although it does not give the same affect as borat and bruno it is still genuinely hilarious
it is shocking disturbing vile
i had to look away sometimes at how terrible it really was the humiliation in the film is unexpected and you can tell when the moments arent unscripted
it is like ali g on acid
it is sensational
all the way through i was hysterical
i nearly peed myself at one moment  it is a very enjoyable film the thing with sacha barron cohen you either love his films or hate them and nothing will change about that
the same rules apply for dictator
you will love it or hate it
simple as
the dictator a catch it b there are some movies people will always watch it even if you tell them dont watch it
the dictator falls under that category its not that movie is dreadful its just its not as great as we had expected from sacha baron cohen since borat
the dictator is mostly funny in addition to being obscene disgusting scatological vulgar crude and so on but somehow it doesnt work all together
especially his scenes with anna faris are tedious
sacha baron cohen is good but certainly not great
anna faris is ok but she isnt that funny with beiber hair cut
megan fox one liner cameo was alright
on the whole the dictator is disappointing but still watchable because crude antics of the dictator
i am not a fan of movies like borat or even a dumb and dumber type film or even the scream parodies are dumb to me
my boss paid for us to see this film
everyone voted and i lost
or should i say i won
i got to leave work early and laugh the entire film
i am so happy i was forced to see it
i was dreading it all week and i ended up thinking it was extremely funny
it is not a pc film
i guess i loved that too which also surprised me
but it is not gimmicky not the same old same old not a shock fest to be one
it is funny
my face and stomach hurt from laughing so much
see it
adults only
but see it
so happily surprised
i have never seen a film quite like this one
if anyone would have bet me in advance id even like it a little i would have lost
i really thought i would hate it
yet i love it
see this film and be happily surprised like i was
absolutely no kids though
it is too adult in humor
one the worst movies i have ever seen gtgt full of unethical scenes and i could even love once  full of hatred and racism  and of course now i know why after knowing that the hero is jewish
awful totally of trash i totally hated this movie but i struggled to watch it till the end
meaningless movie
full of symbolism towards muslim countries
the leader of a country appear like a stupid gay  unaware of everything and care only about sex  with women or men  and killing all people around him literally  how come this is a movie and against racism
stupid movie stupid actor stupid theme stupid direction and for  30 viewers
hollywood is a sanitized labor ward and it takes sacha to rev things up
however this time i am wondering if he has ever been to the movies himself
not only a complete rip off of the extremely talented turturro from dont mess with the zohan it was just boring not funny and a feeling of when will it end or get funny
sacha is clever but maybe with less money less ego and maybe he should go to the movies sometimes i thought this was turturro funny how no reviews mention this
being jewish is not a license for poo jokes
this film could have good maybe with a script
better jokes less poo jokes
65 mill on what
the people who actually enjoy this movie are the same people the film is making fun of
missing this mark is an understatement
this movie is a complete refreshment for any body who understands the arabic influenced english
it will make you laugh and laugh out loud
every dialogue of the movie is worth listening and it gives you smile in return
go for it people it is the best comedy movie and even much more interesting than scary movie series
movie starts with humor and end on a very good and emotional note that will make you think
movie ends up with a critical joke on democracy and its implementation versus the dictatorship
acting is superb and timing of comedy comic sense  is quite awesome
the males in the movie dominate the female actresses
ooops there is only one woman in the movie rest are private guards of the dictator
when i sat down to watch this movie i have to admit that i did so with a few preconceptions about what to expect
i was not impressed by sacha baron cohens ryan seacrestashes stunt as for me it was just publicity for its own sake and yes i know no such thing as bad publicity
but still
poor
that aside this movie simple and following a clash of cultures format that has worked well for cohen in the past as well as for many others before him it was entertaining and funny while at the same time being racist sexist misogynistic homophobic
all of those things we hate in the intolerant shadows of society but all at a level that is made acceptable by the satirical nature of the movie
its intended to be mildly offencive and it is but funny with it
not rolling in the isles funny but funny
if you get bothered by dirty and sick humor youll stay away from this movie or moan on your wasted time and money
there are many cons id mention 1
racism 2
religious prejudice 3
religion abuse 4
poor cast 5
dirty and i mean dirty storyline 6
rubbish dialogues complete crap
when you watch parody movies like vampires suck scary movie etc
thats a thoughtful item but this is pure junk
stay away
moreover its completely inappropriate for family and children
sick nudism and flashing was made part of every scene that is about to come
there are few place where youd like to keep pushing to see full movie but when time keeps passing you get more and more disappointed
if i couldve voted negative i would have
this is by far the worst of his movies ive seen
i wanted to laugh and even tried a few times but it was really only out of pity
i truly wish i could take back the hour and a half that i spent watching it
i cant believe this actually made it to film
dont waste your time or money even if its only a dollar rental
i actually paid 5
99 to rent this on demand and i really feel cheated annoyed and betrayed
sbc should really consider a new line of work because his acting is questionable and really makes him look like a giant goofy ridiculous man
i sort of liked borat and tolerated bruno even though i feel guilty for finishing it
sbc needs to try a different genre if he wants to continue acting because these roles do not suit him or vice versa
dont know where to start
just been to see this film and could never stop laughing
when i thought it couldnt get any funnier it did
sacha baron cohen is clearly an excellent writer as the jokes in it are genius
i love the humour of it
although it is a short film the jokes that it includes seem to pay off
as well as the comedy being brilliant the actual plotstoryline is superb also
from watching the trailer and then watching the film it was actually a completely different story to how i thought it was going to be
the plot made the film funnier
i would recommend that you all watch it as i would certainly watch it again a lot more as this film is a work of art
it isnt for the easilyoffended but if this is your sort of humour then you need to go and watch it now
this movie was so idioticparts of it were unwatchable
unfunnygross with horrible acting
how ben kingsley agreed to do this crap is beyond me
what a waste of time
im glad i didnt have to go out to see this garbage
please someone try to find anything funny in this poor excuse for a movie
the dictator it has to be said is an extremely funny film
sacha baron cohen has undertaken the task of attacking those demigods who consider themselves both impregnable and supreme running their tinpot dictatorships
he is largely successful in his task his aladeen comes across as incredibly narcissistic whose philosophy is simple  execute people first and ask questions later
the film has him coming to the united states to address the united nations this gives director larry charles the chance to make some trenchant points about socalled democratic societies which in their way are almost as repressive as aladeens
some of the jokes are extremely vulgar but delivered with an alan that renders all criticism impossible
ben kingsley copes well with the thankless task of acting as baron cohens foil while anna faris is a feisty loveinterest
not the most memorable comedy perhaps but certainly an entertaining one
i have to say i really enjoyed this movie and look forward to any other new sacha baren cohen films in the future
it had many controversial jokes but i just thought they were hilarious it simply added to my enjoyment
not many recent movies have made me actually laugh out loud
as i said it reminded me of you dont mess with the zohan but thats okay another great film
the dictator in my opinion is cohens second best movie
1
borat its a classic 2
the dictator 3
bruno 4
ali g i didnt find it that funny
the reason why i wouldnt give it 10 is the fact that it had a few recycled jokes such as the aids joke
i highly suggest that you rentbuy it if you havent seen it yet
if you like shocking and controversial scenes black humor in the style of south park this movie is for you
previous works of this team borat amp bruno was too much for me
still even this movie is not for a weak minds
at some points ive asked myself really
you have a nerve to make jokes from these tragic things
it seems that the movie doesnt have any censorship which is adorable
thumbs up for great job of director and actors
perfect reflection of arabic behaves amp pronunciation
id like to emphasize sachas impersonation talent
i could never tell that he is englishman by the movie
he played well too well
i worry of his well being now
as a comedy film which ridicules everything which is discussed in the film the dictator can be seen either with people of ones age juniors or friends
it would be not right to call its opponents victorian prudes but under no circumstances should one watch it with family
american director larry charles and actor sasha baron cohen have contrived nicely to make their film replete with sexual innuendos
they also make a lot of fun of nature loving geeks
some hints of authenticity are witnessed in the portrayal of un delegates especially a chinese diplomat who makes a lot of comical remarks about his wife in order to seek false popularity
american director larry charles film the dictator is a bad work of art for dictators and their megalomania cal images
it is a film which no intelligent dictator would like to endorse
most dictators feel that their actions are always justified
for this reason they would never like to be remembered for this type of hostile portrayal
funniest movie i ever watched and believe me i have watched a lot of movies
you can really use some stopwatch and check and i assure you that this movie will definitely make you laugh every 10 secondsthere may be some exceptions like if you are not mature enough to understand the jokes then do not blame me
every person who watches this movie will surely become a huge fan of sacha baron cohen
i personally think he is the most intelligent guy in hollywood
even the technical parts of movie is awesome
you can see how much moneythought were given to each details in the dictators palace and stuff like that
background score and songs also are very impressive
i dont know how some people get offended by this as its just for fun and people should take it that way as sacha himself is a jew and he offends them the most
compared to his former films such as borat and bruno ill leave ali g out
better best forgotten as some naff pop group used to sing this film is a lot weaker in terms of outrageous humour yes there are parts of the film that begin to push towards sacha baron cohens uniquely outrageous films of the past but then they simmer again as if he has been ordered to behave himself this time round
either way yes its ok as a film it has some funny bits some dull bits to be honest in hindsight id definitely wait for the film to come down in price before i even considered buying it
better spending the money on something else or go watch something at the pictures instead
