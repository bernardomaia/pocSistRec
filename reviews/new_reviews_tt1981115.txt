i dont know how some of the reviews here are so positive
bad
bad movie
all the happenings seem so constructed that i couldnt stop thinking why the figures in the movie act so stupidly
very bad writing
the scenery can be good from time to time
but the events in the movie just seem like none of the characters could make a single logic and useful decision
2 stars because it had some good pictures in it
otherwise more than horrible movie that made me think what
oh come on
about a hundred times
it almost seems like a spoof of a good vs
bad plot
and on the way we have a bunch of bad jokes to mess up this movie even more
disney have produced some fantastic marvel films throughout there takeover
ironman 1 and 3 thor and the avengers were awesome
they dont try to be the dark brooding dc films they cant be theyre of a larger scope more comprehensive in appeal
theyre packed with humour action and riveting twists and as a whole capture the characters spot on ie downey jnr
this however does not
this film is saturated beyond humour with joke after joke after joke
thor has his lighter tales but malekeith is a darker adversary brooding and malicious
thus the plot should reflect this
yet this film kept joking and joking so much i didnt care about malekeith he didnt seem that menacing at all
he butchers millions
yet the humour detracted from that beyond belief
the twist in plot from loki is its saving grace as is hiddlestones acting hopefully thor 3 can recapture that which was thor
i have seen thor 1 and i thought that it was a nice introduction to something good they will come up with in future
i didnt like the character of thor the way it was portrayed later in the avengers and was disappointed with it
then comes thor the dark world and i have been reading pretty descent comments about it everywhere and decided to give it one last chance and boy i was wrong
this movie has thoroughly and utterly disappointed me there wasnt a single wow moment in this movie special effects had nothing special in them story over complicated along with astro physicists and their weird instruments and what not
it was humorous at time but seldom the timing was appropriate
my verdict i will personally not suggest my friends to watch this movie or any future thor movie
i studied the convergence for 25 minutes
this movie gets high ratings for the same reason that the hobbit does people love to see great effects that are neato and rumbling sounds
one more sign of crumbling intelligence in a crumbling society
most of the great movies have no special effects whatsoever
few of them come from modern day hollywood
save your time and pick your nose in the bathroom at home
crap i dont have enough lines
i cant figure out how to write a long review about something as vapid as this movie
if you liked android cop i frankenstein or after earth then you will love this one
i took my son to this and 25 minutes in i told him i would buy him a toy at walmart if we could leave
the total price for the evening was 15 for the movie  45 for the lego set  60
however he got a new toy and i didnt have to watch that crap movie
walking out of thor the dark world i felt i just watched transformers dark of the moon again
it has the spit out formula that blockbuster movies like iron man 2 have
it feels like tv has another spin off cop show
the cgi is bigbudget but the story here has hardly any suspense and is boring
the movie reuses the short action talking villain creates problem talking and conclusion plot line
the movie starts with a smallscale fight with irrelevant enemies to introduce thor
then jane messes with a portal while an ancient vengeful antagonist who lost long ago shows up all the way to the midpoint when marvel recreates the star wars the phantom menace battle with the energy shield dome and two armies run at each other and it ends shortly to restart in the ending
thor has no weaknesses and he needs loki for distraction
describing the ending in one sentence sounds like the premise of the avengers ending
save your money for the next marvel movie
i wrote this review this morning and six hours have passed and i have forgotten most of the movie
we very seldom walk out of a movie but to us our time is worth more than the cost of any movies
this move was bland one dimensional and with no character that you could care for
the girl that was suppose to be portmans assistance was utterly pointless and annoying
to top this there was an assistant to her this man was even dumber than her
i think it has become an sport to make male characters with no spine and brain in hollywood movies it makes the feminist happy
back to the movie 30 minutes through we were literally falling sleep so looked at each other and just left
there is no plot that can have anything remotely to do with any possible laws of physics anything goes
no characters to relate to and special effects well there are explosions that is all
dont waste your time
for starters i loved this film
i was a fan of the first but this one is superior in every way
the actions scenes are better the plot is better and there is great banter throughout the film
due to these factors it is entertaining and has more than enough in it to keep you interested
the acting is fantastic especial by chris hemsworth and tom hiddleston as they work great together and appear to have a great understanding of each others roles
i just cant understand why people dont like this film unless they are not a fan of superheroes
after seeing this film last night i read through a few of the reviews afterwards and was shocked as some people were giving it lower than 7
these people are clearly boring and have no idea about an entertaining film and enjoy watching films that just depress you and have no idea about what a fantastic superhero film this is
i recommend you watch this immediately as you wont be disappointed
i was expecting to be impressed with this movie
instead along comes this endless battle royal that goes on and on and on with sword fights and battle scenes
not to mention the all too typical these days  cars getting tossed around like swatted flies scenes that made me wonder if this was supposed to be a transformers remake or a tolkien version of a rambo movie or something
i was expecting a superhero movie not a war movie
at the start the movie seems promising but as it goes on it becomes painfully obvious that little was invested towards writing an interesting plot line and script for this stinker
evil elves versus azgardians
give me a break
maybe if they make a third movie they can pit thor against an evil villain here on earth and the earthlings can be more than minor window dressing in the plot line
give me the comic books over this movie any time
awful garbage movie
saw this garbage on starz the other night and wished i could get those hours of my life back
the movie was way too underdeveloped and zoomed through the plot me and my son could not understand what was going on at times and we could not keep hold of the characters
with the exception of loki
in addition the last hour or so of the movie became terribly predictable and extremely boring
but regardless
this movie was terrible and awful
the characters were just so superficial and very one dimensional that i did not give a hoots to what happened to any of them
apparently the universe was in trouble and this film managed to make that concept completely boring and uninspired
leave end of world stuff to xmen movies
they do it better
there were also a few pitiful
attempts at humor thrown into the movie
which were all extremely kiddie
and
childish
they fell flat
and in fact were so unfunny they made me cringe
i had to watch xmen movies after this to remind myself why i look comic book films
i watched part one some years ago and i didnt remember a thing until i was reminded in this movie
i forgot the characters and the story i only remember that there was some kind of battle with some ancient enemy
just like in thor tdw
we also have some ancient apowerful enemy which has been defeated aeons ago when he tried to take over control of the universe or something like that
now this enemy is back along with some kind of superweapon
and our heroes evil brother loki is also present and continues with his schemes and tricks
our hero is  as before  invincible and in the end we have big battle on earth and on the plant of whocaresheim
the powerful read boring and forgettable enemy is defeated and in the end of the movie we some some hints for things to come in planned sequels
nothing new
but i must confess that thor is a likable hero so there are some laughs in this installment
see it if you must
not much of expectation
but
the movie was so boring and unreal
no story and felt like its trying to imitate role playing game themes
not much of a real story
the second quarter felt intriguing
but after that it plunged to the sewers d
there was no story
and its a shame of what they did with the potential of good graphics
spoiler alert in next few lines
trying to pose loki as changed person as a twist
too predictable
what was more annoying was getting rid of him instantly
if you dig in a twist in story you let it sink not flush it away
they should try to make a low selling game instead
hope the mistakes are learnt and the pathetic twist and prequel to possible 5 to go are made better
watchable p
adios
thor the dark world is the second installment to the thor sequel when i went to go see it i had high expectations for this movie this did not meet my expectations at all now i am a big action fan and i did not like this movie they had so much plot holes to count the characters did not have very good development this is a warning for readers that there are spoilers up ahead
i did give some credit about loki death but then eventually faked his death and marvel has done a great job at doing things like that the pacing of the movie did have some slowdowns but the pacing went along with the action of the movie spoilers ahead for readers malikieth who is the villain of this movie was not very interesting in fact he was the worst villain i have ever experienced seeing by my waste of time i give this a 410 did not like it
watching this movie represents an alltime low in my life as a consumer of mass entertainment products
this movie clearly is one big predictable run for profit for the movie company director and actors nothing but clichas in every aspect and detail cheesy dialog silly sound effects pretty faces buff bodies overdramatization stupidity and the list goes on and on and on
this movie is a travesty a cartoonists public rape of nordic mythology for money
this movie is sucking up to a wellmapped audience which has no care for quality as long as they get their 10 minutes of something cool to tell their friends about
by being in this movie natalie portman anthony hopkins rene russo and stellan skarsgard have tripped and fallen from any and all artistic grace that they have earned over the years
shame shame shame
i was really excited to watch this when it first came out and i was one of the first at the cinema and the film didnt disappoint
with a fantastic contrast of scenes and emotions this film kept me entertained and hooked until the very end
it made me laugh made me scared and made me cry especially the scenes surrounding loki
kat dennings and stellan skarsgard made some hilarious jokes and made me and all of my family laugh
chris hemsworth and natalie portman conveyed the relationship excellently christopher eccleston was captivating and tom hiddleston made me smile and cry what more can i say he is an amazing actor and my idol
the plot twist at the end was fantastic and totally unexpected the whole plot was well planned and written
i cannot wait for the next installment of this franchise
fantastic writing and acting
halfway through this debacle and struggling to keep my attention from wandering
oh wait im writing this so attention well and truly on a holiday
the only thing good about it is tom hiddlestone
he says his lines as though he means them and understands them
the film is unengaging and i find the actors unconvincing
i saw the first movie and it was just ok
in this one however i find idris elba wasted and unbelievable as a character
even anthony hopkins seemed to have just turned up for the cash
loads of special effects and cgi especially in the asgard scenes but if the story is not involving then they count for nothing
the female friend of jane  cant remember her name seems to have wandered in from some teen movie and is as irritating as hell
i just do not care about anyone in this movie at all
as someone else pointed out it looks as if it were put together by a committee
thor the dark world is an awesome movie
it has great music
some of the best action scenes
effects are mind blowing
a scene loki and thor that takes your breath away
loki is what makes the film
tom hiddleston plays the role as if born to
he brings something to the screen that no one else couldve
there is a good bit of comedy and emotion bouncing back and forth between thor and loki
jane and thor get back together obviously from the picture and thor has been watching over her
chris hemsworth has been bringing peace to the 9 realms after the great battle of new york
an old power thought to be extinct threatens jane and the world
watch and see the twists and turns and pain they have to go to just save the world yet again
i think it was an excellent and enjoyable movie even considering the parts that seemed unnecessary
i say this despite not being able to leave a critical review but an opinion is an opinion whether or not it is an informed one so they all count both the good and the bad
i think the movie got a raw deal with all the other big movies that came out afterwards or maybe it just did not fit peoples tastes even it was a good movie
i dont understand why people are hyping loki yes the actor that played the part did an excellent job but the actor that play thor also did an excellent job in how he portrayed the title character
i cant honestly see anyone else as thor
i liked nearly the entire story the movie told and i did not find the villain to be as lacking as has been claimed by some i just accepted him for who he was
the villain make have had a different personality to differentiate him from his counter part in the marvel comics
the movie offers a great fictional realm asgard it is so rich and unique but the improper cast of the movie often remind us that it is fake
im not talking about chris hemsworth tom hiddelson or god forbid anthony hopkins those guys are well casted and did their jobs well
the story of thor is based of the scandinavic myths and songs and in the movie thor more or less acts as a viking and looks like one too everything in asgard is made to mimic the scandinavian culture or perception of asgard after all thats where the sourse is from and it is such a bummer when you see that heimdall is cast as black nothing against idris elba great actor but thats not how scandinavians describe it in their songs thats not how it is even in the comic book sourse and what about thours gang one of them fights with rapier the other one is asian thanks god he does not fight with nunchaku although that would make more sense
but the real deal comes with the elves shooting bazukas and guns and some of them are black again
when last you saw an afroamerican elf
thor the dark world had the responsibility to make a decent thor movie unfortunately failed even more but is better than the first  this sequel back chris hemsworth  natalie portman  tom hiddlestom  anthony hopkins and etc  the romance of thor and jane still surface and bland  and again a good villain was badly used  the final scene of the film is a little confusing  something that is not explained is how thor came to earth without the bridge that connects asgard to other worlds and does not explain thor ragnarok will be a tremendous error script thor the dark world has good special effects and a cool soundtrack the beginning of the film as well as the first thor makes ne believe that the film will be great unfortunately it is just a movie ok
note 6
8
yes its unintentionally funny stupid and overly long
both superman returns and man of steel have more merit and thats stretching things
watch it for the two hot girls and pumped up chris
watch it for the overthetop computer graphics
check your brain at the door
i didnt even enjoy guardians of the universe that much
i guess i am having sfx overload
think of how much better even superman iiiiv could have been with all these mindless explosions
i was tired after watching the first hour of this mess
everything in the last half was totally predictable
where did papa thor go
back to the smurfs
i thought i was watching independence day 2 for a while
you must watch the easter eggs between the 10 minute credits
mindnumbing and stupid but great for adolescent boys who like manly women wwe and all that stuff
very redundant to the first thor
verdict thor 2 made my head sore
while it still mostly on par with the first thor this sequel feels bigger while also losing a lot of the human connection which made the previous one enjoyable
there are some fleeting moments of humor but theres also a lot of gloom and doom
in thor the dark world thor has to save the universe avengers anyone
from malekith and the aether
sure theres some halfbaked scientific explanation for all of it but the end result is a little disappointing
malekith was a coollooking villain but not very engaging or charismatic
there were also a few too many narrative conveniences a couple involving lokis ability to impersonate other people
nevertheless it was entertaining and kind of what ive come to expect from marvel
the acting is very good as is the action and visual effects
i still dont buy natalie portman as a scientist but oh well
this isnt marvels best but phase 2 is going pretty good so far
if youve liked marvels previous entries you should like this one too
marvel has made a terrible machine for earning money and it is still today a priority at the movies
im not saying that they recorded a very bad films but to me they are just average except for iron man and the avengers
so record a movie and give a teaser to another recording another giving a teaser for the third and so on
what concerns the film itself i was somewhat impressed
theyre great cast assembled for this movie but we know who will spend most of their time on the big screen
fight scenes and cgi are superb as expected but i still want something a little more than a movie
i liked loki who confirmed his class
the effects are excellent although i felt a little robbed star wars but alright
of course there is a scene after the credits and then patience for a minute if a little track you will see they announced another film in the world of marvel
the new machine for printing money
dc what are you waiting for
marvels thor the dark world continues the bigscreen adventures of thor the mighty avenger as he battles to save earth and all the nine realms from a shadowy enemy that predates the universe itself
in the aftermath of marvels thor and marvels the avengers thor fights to restore order across the cosmos
but an ancient race led by the vengeful malekith returns to plunge the universe back into darkness
faced with an enemy that even odin and asgard cannot withstand thor must embark on his most perilous and personal journey yet one that will reunite him with jane foster and force him to sacrifice everything to save us all
i first like to say that i enjoyed the movie and its a very good sequel to the 1st one and the avengers
i think its also better than the first because i like the story better and there are more twists to the story the first one was pretty straight forward
this ones got action drama comedy which is all used very well and everyone that is someone have their good moments
thing is that the alien worlds and space battles made me think of the star wars battles i really like star wars and i didnt really wanted to see it in this movie that is what made me dislike it a little
and of course the use of epicness as in all avengerlike movies is just a little much but i accept it and still enjoyed it
in the end i will recommend it to everyone who enjoys a good superhero movie and ill most likely see it again soon because i like watching movies that i like a few times
although thor the namesake of the movie series is masculinity incarnate there is little doubt that the audience is not really impressed by the hammer brandishing deity  likely because thor pales in comparison whenever the arch villain loki makes an appearance
perhaps one should congratulate marvel on the success of creating this charismatic evil character who even dominates the avengers not to mention the spawning of countless fanfiction and secondary creation
marvel needs to work on the storyline as it is stretching thin what is the remote probability of all this new dark energy targeting thors ladylove as a host out of zillions of beings to choose from the vast universe with the nine realms
the plot feels flimsy to begin with and though the brilliant coup and contracoup actions by the brothers near the end are exciting the actual final scene is an inevitable anticlimax and seems like childs play
the only solace being the hint of yet another sequel  with our favorite villain it of course
it is a good movielots of cool action and great special effects
i find the story slightly weak but that may be just me
this movie is filled with talented actors but the dialog and script arent exactly the best
i felt it was a bit cheesy at times especially with the convergence mumbo jumbo but again that is just my opinion
i think everyone just watched this movie for loki but he seemed like a big plot hole in the end
if you have some time to kill this movie will do it for you its not bad but i dont think its that great either if you really want to see a good moviefind another marvel movie like avengers or the new xmen to watch it will be much better
i really enjoyed this movie although it was a bit over the top
but thats what sold the film for me
the effects and lighting set the perfect back drop and mood
some of the best parts were worked into the effects as well
like thor flying to the scene and holding his arm up waiting for the hammer
some of the space scenes
i also thought the fight scenes were realistic for this film and done well
the anger that turns to rage seem logical and acted well
the costumes fit the characters and were done very well
loki and thor really sold the action for me
driving in the space mobile through people
trees
buildings
great stuff
i wasnt too sure about this movie before watching it but i thought it was exciting and action packed and a wonderful use of effectscgi
id recommend this to fans of this genre and almost anyone else
they may be as surprised and happy you did
good action fodder i enjoyed it
i was perturbed that there was no translation available on my disk for the black elves speech
we had to guess what they were saying
i was wondering if this was only the rental disk i was using if so thats a mean way to treat your audience for renting and not buying
i am hoping the future movies have a lil more plot maybe some deeper character builds
this movie seemed a bit rushed like a lot was left on the cutting room floor
directors cut probably
the black elves were interesting but there was no substance to them they could have been any bad guy
their costumes were cool but again they never got interesting and no subtitles forcing the audience to guess their words made it worse
thor the dark world here comes thor again with his banging thunder hammer to bash the evil forces but this time its jane foster who have some extra role to do in this plot rather just being thors lady love its fight between asgard and svartalfheimthe dark world which gradually extend to earth and ends up in greenwich but this flick provides you many hilarious and wow moments like erik selvig running nude around stonehenge darcys insane act loki turning to be the captain america with help of his illusion etc
this time you find loki being a good guy helping his bro but at last you surely be confused to judge what actually he is overall this is a fine flick that has good storyline revolving around aether you see thor fighting back to save the universe but this time against malekith overall its a good making
okay so another marvel comic flick
the sequel of 2011 thor movie and the avengers
would serve as a prequel to next avengers movie
a superhero movie about the demigod his brother loki his father odin and the asgardians
and yes the audience get to see jane played by portman doctor selvig and friends from london
the movie contains lot of special effects that are good esp
the fight scene at the climax
loki was better among the main characters in this movie while others here are bad
the villain kurse was cool
all the other characters are so much underdeveloped and superficial
the script couldve been way better
the teleport scene was a disappointment
except for cgi i disliked the entire movie
still watchable just once if you are a diehard marvel comic fan
disney might think this film made more money than thor 1 because of its synergy with the other marvel superhero films and while that might be true to a certain extent i think its probably because thor 2 is simply a much better film than thor 1
what it does have in common with the avengers e
g
is an excellent balance of humor action effects and drama
we have arrived at a point where vfx cant hardly improve anymore but in the dark world they pulled out all the stops we get gorgeous vistas battles and large scale destruction effects and not a single shot looks fake
chris hemsworth also seems to be getting more familiar with his character as his performance has certainly improved
i was getting pretty sick of superhero movies but im glad to say this one has restored my faith partially
for me the dark world is certainly better than any of the iron man films
recommended
not directed by kenneth branagh thor the dark world seems to suffer for it
the problem which really made the movie turgid was awful over usage of of sitcom 1liner humor trying to play off as wit
rather there at least a dozen joke lines that are feeble unimaginative and make you wonder if youre watching a superhero movie or a thursday night madefor tv outing
i dont understand how this kind of script gets greenlit devoid of intelligence or editing
the other issue for me is the dull yacking of characters for about the first 30 min of the movie  get on with it filmmakers  stop trying to describe a movie through dialog  show it happening
looking past these the movie starts to take off finally for the 2nd 23 of runtime
it does not have the focus soundtrack wit and direction of its predecessor
give it about a 6
510 closer to a 6 maybe
couldve been much better
the movie was ok and i wish i did not pay 1350 to see it but i needed to kill time and since i liked thor since it aired back in the 70s at 3pm weekdays after school along with iron man the hulk and spider man
but i was let down i dont understand who gave this over 7 it is a 6
5 maybe 6
7 at best
i guess i just expect more from a superhero movie especially after seeing the dark knight iron man man of steel etc
i would wait for it to come out on dvd and i wouldnt spend the extra cash for blueray
but dont get me wrong its not bad but its also not good enough and the extra endings after the credits is getting real tired real quick
i guess itll piece itself altogether one the infinity gauntlet is together and probably a nice set up for avengers 2
i was hoping that the second installment of thor might be memorable well it wasnt
this movieand all of the rest of the marvel trailers i saw suffers from superhero saturation
lets just face it how many times can an alien being destroy a city put the hero and his friends in jeopardy before you just get tired
this is the problem with thor you just get tired while watching it
thor just isnt drawn in this installment interesting enough
he was a great fish out of water in the first movie a egoist brought down by kindness and guilt
in this movie hes just sad and mopey
it doesnt help that his lady love is silly and not very supportive
jane foster is window dressing instead of partner
yes loki steals the scenes but in the end its all for nothing but another chance to do it all again
these marvel movies just keep getting better
the one and only thing i noticed though is the lack of cross over tie in product placement that we have been seeing from the other movies in the franchise
sure there are a couple of mentions and a few guest cameos but there were no logos not a bad thing actually i am bringing this up because i think it is a good factor that makes this a better movie
you are not given a movie that is just a walking toy ad like transformers movies are or that last the wolverinei moviewhich was good but the crossbranding was just too much i think
i really enjoyed this movie even though three stops in the tube would have taken more then the 6 or so minutes that thor was expected to be keeping malekith busy
or the fact that they all have to walk or run across the rainbow bridge which should take a week the thing is so long
however you dont need me to recommend this movie you will see it and you will get a great ride out of it that you can count on
i watched it in premiere in belgium
as they only showed it in 3d i can say
dont go to the 3d version
the quality is bad
some frames are not sharp at all
and you miss a part of the story
as the plot and movie itself i am not saying it is bad
but some solutions are just stupid
i like marvel a lot but in this movie i am missing the feeling of the marvel universe
just to say 1 thing
if you have an army as strong like in the avengers  why is thor fighting them alone
why is iron man not helping captain america or even the hulk
the army was there to shoot at the spaceship
so there are gaps in the story and the 3d version sucked to make a final opinion on the movie
thor the dark world is a film that when i walked into the cinema i had very high expectations of because the first one was very good i was not disappointed and the viewer wont be either
the film has a very good beginning as within only ten minutes of the film starting the character of thor played by chris hemsworth is introduced to the audience just after spoiler a circular storm occurs pouring over jane foster natalie portman ian boothby jonathon howard and darcy lewis kat dennings this is then followed by some mild violence and the action gets better from then onwards
it is extremely gripping and fast paced throughout the whole film there is never a quite moment
spoiler there is even a small appearance from the much loved marvel character captain america only small but it is a cool moment that reminds you that this isnt just any old film this is a marvel film
i really enjoyed this film and i would definitely recommend it to anyone
the ending of this film makes you very excited for the next instalment of the thor films
thor has to stop the evil dark elves from getting the energy that jane has accidentally hosted in her body in order to prevent them from turning the world into darkness
the second thor movie isnt like the first one but it is entertaining
two things that bothered me you have to have watched the avengers before you watch the movie
fortunatelly i did but for someone who hasnt it will be annoying as they are brought up frequently and some of parts of the story are connected to the avengers movie like lokis imprisonment
the first part of the movie is a little shaky as the plot tries to get to the point
so we have jane in london waiting for thor to come and thor trying to find a way to go back to her
in other ways the movie is quite entertaining and enjoyable
i even started to like loki but the end kind of spoiled that
that said the plot was a little complicated but i guess it wasnt that bad
so i give thor a 6 out of 10
having been estranged from thor for two yearsjane goes in search of him and gets a dark matter ether into her body
thor takes her to asgard and odin realizes what a threat she could pose to the safety of all his realms should the ether ever fall into wrong hands
so he decides to offer her a safe haven in asgarddue to the lack of an expedient cure to extricate the ether from her
thors mother dies trying to protect jane from malekith who is after etheryearning for vengeanceloki joins forces with thor
they cart her away to a secret mountainous hideout to where they are followed by malekith and his troops
ether is taken and loki dies in the ensuing battle
jane and thor make their way to protect the realms from malekith grown powerful from the ether
once every 5000years all the nine realms align and malekith aspires to seize the fiefdom from odin
jane and thor frustrate his endeavors in timekilling malekith
thor refuses his fathers offer of kingship and goes back to jane
miraculously odin turns to lokileaving a lot of the imagination of the viewer
so in thor the dark world the dark elves lead by malekith want to take over the 9 realms with an infinity stone known as the ether
the location on earth primarily england provides a different view on the world and that the world knows about thor and most likely the other avengers
tom hiddleston and chris hemesworth do a awesome job as brotherbrother
lokis mind tricks are also seen a lot more
hemdal is just amazing taking down that invisible plane
odin is helpful in explaining what are the infinity stones and who are the dark elves
but hold on a second what happened to odin
lokis now on the thrown of asgard and lucky for him hemdal hasnt alerted thor who is now living on earth with jane
the collector also makes a post credit appearance and so does adam warlock in his cocoon
the collector wants the infinity stones so that thanos wont destroy the universe and all the interesting life
it confused me until i saw it the second time and saw how great this movie is
few months ago
the president of america was kidnapped
and now london is destroyed
i wonder
where the hll is captain america and the strategic homeland intervention enforcement and logistics department
i believe thor is protecting all the nine realms
i wish s
h
i
e
l
d would guard at least one
saw thor the dark world
good work alan taylor
successfully continued the timeline after kenneth branagh and joss whedon
thor was really desperate to take loki with him
and in svartalfheim the most iconic villain in mcu meets his redemption
excellent job by chris hemsworth and tom hiddleston
i do believe before the universe there was darkness and it has survived
i hope it survives till the next convergence
its a marvel movie atleast one important characters have to be sacrificed of course
for now the nine realms are safe and in thor we trust
this is again like the previous chapter too downrated
want to remind that more than a superhero movie the dark world seems a spacefantasy movie
this movie has much action though i somehow managed to get bored at the end
the fact is that just as guardians of the galaxy marvel space scifi overuses energy flares beams and such
and that at the very end gets kinda annoying to me
still thor the dark world has enough humor story and good plotaction to overlook at this slight problem
i want to note down that toward the beginning we have a series of events that reminds deeply of the phenomenas described in the novel roadside picnic of the strugackij brothers the original story that inspired tarkovskijs eternal scifi classic stalker therefore i really appreciated that maybe unwanted reference
score is different than the first one and i didnt like it that much
overall i liked the movie not so much like other stuff this is not at all a deep science fiction
