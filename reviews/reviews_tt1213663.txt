"\nNormally I really enjoy movies written by Simon Pegg. I especially\nliked Shaun of the Dead and Paul. This movie really stumbled.<br><br>Remember that scene in Shaun of the Dead in which they decide the best\nthing to do is head toward a pub and defend themselves from the zombie\nhorde from there? This movie makes that idea its central theme,\nchanging the zombies into some sort of alien robots, and multiplying\nthe pubs. That's it.<br><br>Paul had me laughing out loud every minute or two, and I never get\ntired of watching it. The World's End gave me just a couple of chuckles\nthroughout the film. And I almost nodded off several times.<br><br>The setup before the robots appeared was too long and tedious, and\nafter the robots appeared I couldn't quite understand why our\ncharacters kept running from pub to pub. And worse, I didn't much care.<br><br>It just wasn't silly enough, witty enough, or clever enough to hold my\nattention.\n"
"\nI thought this movie was mediocre at best. I laughed out loud a few\ntimes--as did the rest of the audience, but other than that I found it\nboring and actually nodded off twice. One of the girls sitting in front\nof me stated, \"well it wasn't a bad movie, but it wasn't that good\neither\", which I thought summed it up pretty well. The biggest shock\nwas that it had a 7.9 IMDb rating which normally indicates a\npotentially \"great\" movie in any category--especially a comedy.\n(anything above a 7 tends to consistently be what I consider a GOOD\nmovie).I give it a 5.5 or maybe 6. THere were several other movies in\nthe same theater with lower IMDb ratings that, in retrospect, I wished\nI had spent my time and money on.\n"
"\nHere's the thing about expectations. I loved Hot Fuzz and have watched\nit five or six times with different people, enjoying it anew through\ntheir reactions. The dream team are back together with some stellar\nadditions and the entire plot premise is based around that staple of\nadolescence, the pub crawl. The trailer is fabulous and even gives a\nnod to the collapsing fence gag but done by Pegg this time... What\ncould go wrong?<br><br>Quite a lot actually.<br><br>Pegg plays a character who is so unremittingly obnoxious that by the\ntime the moment of redemption heaves its rotting carcass over the hill\nyou really don't give a damn. He spends the first thirty minutes with\nhis mirthless grin, his back slapping enthusiasm and his voice turned\nup to eleven and I was overwhelmed by the feeling that, in real life,\nsomeone would have punched him by now.<br><br>The other characters are a pretty dull and predictable bunch too and\nfrankly by the time the perilous bits kicked in I really didn't care\nwho lived or died.\n"
"\nI kept waiting for it to be funny. What you get is St. Elmo's fire with\nrobots, 4 grown up friends and 1 stuck in the past, and the end of the\nworld as we know it....except not entirely. As a buddy movie, it barely\nconnects. As science fiction it's not imaginative. It wasn't a complete\nloss, though. Because I saw it at Cinemark and I had purchased the\nrefillable cups and popcorn tubs earlier this year, the wife and I got\ntwo large drinks and two med popcorns for a total of $6. Sadly, that\nwas the highlight of the film. Just as I waited for The Butler to even\nremotely connected to reality, for Two Guns to be anything other that\nan insulting caricature of Texans, and Gangster Squad to be anything\nother than gun play, I waited in vain for The World's End to get really\nfunny. It didn't even get more than slightly humorous.\n"
"\nThe Cornetto series continues with nothing short of what you'd expect\nfrom Wright, Pegg and Frost. Delivering top laughs with great action\nand a little bit of romance to suit all audiences. The film's visual\nstyle is quite appealing. The only downside to this film some may see\nis that the gore is not traditional (being robots). The style of\nviolence in Shaun Of The Dead and Hot Fuzz shine through with just a\nbit of a blue tint. The characters are just plain lovable and hilarious\nin their own ways. Most of the laughs in this film came straight from\ndialogue of characters rather than visuals. All in all I thoroughly\nenjoyed this film, a fun comedy with nothing to pick on whatsoever A\ntop film just like the others!\n"
"\nIf Hot Fuzz is a 10, Shaun of the Dead a 9, then World's End is an 8.\nIt isn't as brilliant as Hot Fuzz which I can watch time and time again\nand still need to watch through till the end. It isn't quite as\ntouching or well executed as Shaun of the Dead, though it does have its\nwarming moments.<br><br>I'm not entirely sure the end is as good as it could have been.<br><br>It is a good end to the trilogy, though. I like how they've switched\naround the friendship between Pegg and Frost this time, so Pegg is the\nidiot who's more likely to get himself killed and Frost is the sensible\none who cares, too much, in spite of all the let downs. I almost\nexpected it to stay the same and wondered how they'd almost kill Frost\nthis time! <br><br>I've always been a Pegg fan, since Big Train, he can't do much wrong by\nme. But I've tried to be as critical as possible considering I was so\nhappy just to see the guys back in action. Best thing that could have\nbeen released this summer for me and I think any other fan will feel\nthe same.\n"
"\ni had great expectations of this film however it was mediocre at best\nand like several other reviews it did not live up to the hype. 7.4\nusually means a good movie to be had. unfortunately not in this case,\ndon't get me wrong i laughed on several occasions but nowhere near\nenough to warrant it up there with the best of the comedies. Basically\nstoryline started off introducing the characters and the film looked\npromising and the chance to relive the youth for one night with a 12\npub pub crawl. after the initial meet up with the Blanks it just got\ndaft and lost the plot a bit with fewer laughs as the film went on. Not\nthe gangs finest hour but i suppose they cant make top films every time\nand lets be honest it wasn't in the same league as Hot Fuzz.\n"
"\n........is self indulgent dogsh*t!<br><br>I would have left it at that, but apparently I have to put 10 lines of\ntext down, so here's a list of what's wrong with this film -<br><br>- The characters - The fight scenes - The plodding direction - The\ncriminal misuse of Pierce Brosnan and Paddy Considine - The complete\nlack of comedy<br><br>Shaun of The Dead and Hot Fuzz are fantastic, even Paul was OK, but\nthis has no charm, lacks any sense of fun and feels like they just\nwanted to get it finished and move on.<br><br>How this is currently rated 7.1 is completely beyond me.\n"
"\nis the coke they serve in the writer's rooms in the UK just boric acid\nand baby powder? or what? are the winters that long and grey? in what\ndamp bog did anyone think to try and make this empty wad of mud and\nsticks attempt to stand and walk on its own? bleeecccchhh. from a hyper\nscattershot beginning of gratuitous sonnyboy backstory, it quickly\nbuilds to...the same joke over and over and over until...out of left\nfield it becomes...oh. wow. I suppose you could call it a reach but\nit's more like the opposite. flat one liners, obvious setups, and sooo\nmuch filler, and fight scenes with things with no face and...omg, what\na stitch, mismatched body parts, and moving awkwardly!! on top of that,\nthey even made a straight face attempt at a sequel or something at the\nend, what was that? Gary and the four blanks, out for action? I just\ndon't understand how crap like this gets made.\n"
"\nThe most bitter end to a trilogy since \"Pirates of the Caribbean: At\nWorld's End.\"<br><br>All right, IMDb won't let me sum it up at that, so let's do a head\ncount of what Wright got wrong with this joint: Unlikeable hero(es)?\nCheck. Tired subject matter? Check. Equally tired jokes? Check.\nPoorly-written villains? Check. Crude attempt at academic appeal at the\nclimax? Uncommon, but check. Abrupt and confounding ending that leaves\nyou empty? Check and mate.<br><br>I have no idea what movie that the critics and fans saw, but judging by\ntheir gushy reviews, I'm guessing LSD was involved.\n"
"\nThe movie is about Gary King (Simon Pegg), a 40 year old whose best\ndays ended in his teens. He reunites his gang - Andy Knightly, Steven\nPrince, Oliver Chamberlain and Peter Page (Nick Frost, Paddy Considine,\nMartin Freeman and Eddie Marsan) - to finish a pub crawl from their\nyouth and along the way, strange stuff happens.<br><br>The movie does start a bit slow while you get to know the characters,\nbut it is still enjoyable. For me, it really got going when you found\nout why everything was weird. From then on, the movie was awesome. It\ngot a lot funnier and the action scenes were brilliant. The humour is\ngreat throughout and a lot of the smaller characters have great scenes.<br><br>The main cast is great. All five do a great job and are all funny and\nbadass in their roles. The secondary cast are awesome too.<br><br>Even after a re-watch, this movie was still very funny. Although I had\nmixed feelings about the ending (I did however love how the main threat\nof the movie was resolved), this is still one of my favourite comedies\nand is a great end to a great trilogy.\n"
"\nBritish films (and I am using here a purely British term, films,\ninstead of more common to my ears word movies) are a weird flock.\nStrange breed. When you're watching a contemporary British film, like\nHot Fuzz or Shaun Of The Dead, or this one, you will most certainly\nexpect all the usual things they love to add to their works in greater\nquantity - profanities galore, crazy tempo, terrible and very quick\nchange of genre from horror to comedy to thriller to drama and back\nagain. And what is on top of it all, nothing is being taken seriously\nor deep. This film is funny, actors are good, Paddy, Martin, Simon and\nPierce all do good job, but then, almost 2 hours of this film render\nmore we can chew or swallow. Then, after some time, the film gets on\nnerves and starts getting very noisy, tiring and draggy. Goo-goo and\nploddy, too. Then, you only wish it were over as soon as possible.\nHonestly, I found the film amusing and some jokes cool, that is why I\ngave it 5, and then I did not get the main point of the work and will\nsurely never come back to watch it at all times.\n"
"\nThe movie is very funny from start to finish. Pegg plays a incredibly\nselfish loser from the start but still manages to make him a\nsympathetic character. It even manages to mix moments of emotional\ndrama with comedy not an easy task.Its a film about growing up and the\nramifications about holding onto youth ,and is the first grown up movie\npegg has ever done.<br><br>Far too dark for the normal cornetto morons,who apparently hated\nit,probably hated watching a movie that wasn't just prat falls and\ntomfoolery .<br><br>Pegg may finally have turned a corner with this movie its good to have\nhim actually being funny again\n"
"\nGood comedy. I think that director of this movie Edgar Wright knows\nwhat he's doing, he has style, he has his actors, he has his sense of\nhumor. I really enjoyed this movie, although my girlfriend said it was\nonly an average film for her. So it depends on what you like. If you\nalready saw Shawn of the Dead, you might know what to expect in this\none too. Crazy, non logical actions, a lot of irony about mankind and\nlife in general! But in the end, movie tells us that traditional values\nof life are irreplaceable - family, friends, life purpose, to know who\nyou are. Because in the end, only these matters.<br><br>Although I spent good time with these fellows in the pubs, I didn't\nlike the super high tempo of this movie. It's impossible to understand\nthe dialogs if you are not English or don't have subtitles! And the\nmain character is quite a hyperactive guy! So I still think that this\nmovie will not change the world, but it can change one of your evenings\nif you like stupid but good-hearted comedies!\n"
"\nIf your idea of a good film is to take a potentially good idea, add a\ncast with zero chemistry, a throughly unfunny and annoying lead\ncharacter and a terrible script then this might be the one for you. The\nopening few minutes are both humorous and engaging but unfortunately\nthats about it. Soon the film starts to happen and the only thing the\nviewer can do is try to work out how it manages to be so bad. I know\nhumour is subjective but in comedic terms this was like watching an emu\ntrying to fly. Unfortunately if you are paying to watch this you might\nnot be so philosophical. The main reason the film refuses to be funny\nis that it seems like the cast, bar Pegg, play their roles in a pretty\nstraight way which really doesn't do anything for the greater comedic\ngood.\n"
"\nI have absolutely no idea how this horrendous movie got such high\nrating both from IMDb and rotten tomatoes. The only thing good about\nthe movie was the epilogue because I knew the movie had almost ended.\nThe movie is totally senseless, the plot is totally meaningless.\nBelieve me, there are a lot better movies out there. Don't think that I\nonly like those boring movies with good plot. I like entertaining\nmovies in general. This movie was so bad that I felt responsible to\nveer other people from watching it, yes this is the first time I have\nreviewed a bad movie. If you want to watch something new and light try\nwatching The hot tub time machine or We are the millers or Horrible\nBosses or The interview or Zombieland or Shawn of the dead or Ted.\nHonestly anything would be better than this movie.\n"
"\nThe summary describes how I felt as the film progressed.<br><br>First 35 minutes or so - promising, seems like it good be a great film,\nand builds up a charming rapport between characters.<br><br>After this, I felt a sense of disappointment, that it was simply going\nto not be any good, but I gradually grew to accept the film...<br><br>Until 1 hour and 22. Oh my. Now we're talking flat out embarrassing to\nwatch.<br><br>Then the last few minutes after 1 hour 38? Pretentious.<br><br>Simply put, if you enjoyed Shaun of the Dead or Hot Fuzz, or both, as I\ndid, you probably won't enjoy The World's End, because The World's End\nis an exceeding poor film.<br><br>It's only had any glimmer of hope in the first half an hour, as\nmentioned.\n"
"\n\"The World's End\" would fit quite nicely in the Simon Pegg box set, if\never there is one. Filled with drinks, laughs, quirky surprises and of\ncourse, unusual misgivings, the film is a twist on a traditional story\narc.<br><br>For those unfamiliar to British humour, you may have to work a little\nharder to 'get it' but no worries, the film still meets the standards\nfor slapstick comedy in Hollywood. <br><br>Although far from perfect, catch the film in theatres or wait for it on\nDVD - in either case, it is worth spending time watching it. View it\nwith being entertained in mind and you won't be disappointed.\n"
"\nIt wasn't 'hilarious', nor was it probing and overly imaginative. It\nwas fun and entertaining and that's exactly what I expected out of it.\nIt became a little too over-the-top and almost 'huh?' 'wh-at?' when\ntrying to explain itself in the last fifteen minutes, but even that\nwasn't enough to dampen the spirit of the overall experience. I was\nhappy with the movie and recommend it, especially if you're going to\nsee it with a group of friends  trust me  there are dozens of scenes\nyou and your friends will absolutely relate to and start elbowing each\nother over! Good enough for anyone in their late teens and older. Teens\nwill have something to look forward to  and those of us past our\nthirties, will get embarrassed reliving the same stunts we used to\npull, or associating with friends 'just like some of those guys'.\n"
"\nIf you seen the other two movies in the so-called Cornetto Trilogy\n(\"Shaun of the Dead\" &amp; \"Hot Fuzz\") then you already know what to expect\nfrom \"The World's End\". Like the others it is funny and full of\nunexpected and crazy twists and turns. The story follows five friends\nwho decide to reunite and finish the pub crawl they were not able to\ncomplete 20 years ago. Everything is going fine and then all hell\nbreaks loose. You know you're probably in for a wild and fun ride and\nthat is exactly what you get. Simon Pegg and Nick Frost kind of switch\nroles from their previous movies, Frost is the one that has it together\nand Pegg doesn't. It works well and they still maintain their great\nhumor and wit. The supporting cast is equally funny with Eddie Marsan\nbeing a highlight. The movie if full of great one liners and some\nabsolutely hilarious moment. If you liked \"Shaun of the Dead\" and \"Hot\nFuzz\" or if you just like wild and fun movies then you'll like \"The\nWorld's End\". It is funny, clever, and a hell of a ride.\n"
"\nIt is hard to believe that the same minds who wrote such clever stories\nas Spaced and Shawn of the Dead could also write The World's End. It\nwas SO slow and boring! And there was hardly any wittiness about it.\nInstead of fun perceptive vocabulary, we are bombarded with one mundane\nfoul word after another, actually, is mostly the same one over and\nover. Really? Simon Pegg and company are SO smart, why do they lean\nmore and more to the mainstream banal crudeness? They're better than\nthat. We know they are. We've seen it. We've heard it. And the\nstoryline this time was very very flat and moved at a snail's pace.\nUsually they have characters that we care about and back stories that\nadd flavor and the action clicks along. The World's End came out flat\nflat flat. Maybe Simon is slowly being taken over, movie by movie, by\nrobots.\n"
"\nWe had a blast with \"The World's End\" last night - it's not wholly, but\nnearly on the level of Hot Fuzz, with some outstanding performances, a\nlot of wit and feeling too, and of course good timing and beautiful\nmusic for an oldtimer like me. The \"message\" - if you care for such\nthings - is about the same as before: Those quaint little English towns\nare just a little too perfect to be true (didn't we know it?).<br><br>Pegg and Frost are irresistible anyway, even if they're playing out of\ntheir usual \"comfort zone\" here - which is actually a good thing, two\nvery good performances! But here they're just part of the fun. Pierce\nBrosnan makes for a \"villain\" nearly as likable as Timothy Dalton,\nFreeman is nice as always, Pike and Considine have good chemistry, but\nit's Eddie Marsan whom I liked best - between this and \"Jack the Giant\nSlayer\" he's having a good year and I hope he'll get some bigger roles\nin the future - he's such a fine actor he's really wasted on Lestrade\nor similar side characters. We'll definitely rewatch this soon -\nrecommended!\n"
"\nThough the movie does start out a bit slowly, it is never boring. Simon\nPegg plays his typical washed out loser, on a quest to reunite the \"old\ngang\" from high school and relive the best night of his life, \"The\ngolden mile\", which is a pub crawl through twelve pubs in his sleepy\ntown. When they get there, they discover their town has been taken over\nby robots filled with blue junk and their new quest is to survive the\nnight in order to leave in the morning. The chemistry between the\nactors is pitch perfect and though the movie could run this risk of\nbecoming brainless and the characters flat, their personal traumas and\nsometimes (very) deep flaws keep them grounded in reality. The ending,\nthough perhaps not expected, was amazing. If you already like Nick\nFrost and Simon Pegg this is a definite must-see, but even if you\naren't a huge fan or haven't even heard of them, this movie is worth a\nshot.\n"
"\nThis is the final instalment of Wright's Cornetto trilogy and it is the\nmost out-there movie of them all. The World's End is an\naction-sci-fi-comedy where a number of familiar faces return to help\nSimon Pegg complete the 'golden mile' by hitting 12 different pubs.<br><br>There are a lot of references to the other movies which I think hurt\nthe film a bit. It's making too many nods to itself instead of just\nbeing a good comedy in its own right, not to mention that people who\nhaven't seen the other films just won't \"get\" all the references and\nin-jokes.<br><br>Still it's a pretty funny movie that is well worth seeing! But you\nshould definitely see his other films first or you'll be missing a lot\nof jokes.<br><br>And it promotes beer drinking which is always a good thing!\n"
"\nI've been such a fan of slapstick comedies of horrible situations and\nevents, 'Shawn of the Dead' set the bar for creating an enjoyable and\ncomfortable horror film. Their inside jokes that last throughout the\nmovie as well as continuing in their second hit 'Hot Fuzz', helped\ndrive the comedy and allowed a sense of involvement with the audience. <br><br>However their 3rd and hopefully final piece was a slight drag. The plot\nwas messy and seemed rushed. They managed to throw in the Pegg and\nFrost humour with fresh jokes and comedic twists but it wasn't enough\nto excuse the miserable plot.<br><br>Don't read this thinking that i'm saying there's no point to watch it,\njust be aware of the limit that these apocalyptic plots can reach. <br><br>Safe!\n"
"\nThe first 3/4 of The World's End is relentlessly laugh-out-loud funny,\nclever and overall brilliant. Perhaps a little too similar to Shaun of\nthe Dead, but I don't mind. Shaun was such a good film; no problem if\nthey want to make it twice. <br><br>But then, just when the story reaches World's End, the film abruptly\nrolls over and dies. It tries to shift gears into... something. I'm not\nsure into what exactly, but the shift fails. The last half hour or so\nis like a completely different film - a quite disappointing one.<br><br>Still, most of The World's End is a riot. The characters are silly but\nengaging, the buildup towards the climax is masterfully done, and the\ndialogue almost reaches Pulp Fiction levels of cleverness. It's such a\nshame they messed up the ending.\n"
"\nI loved Shaun of the Dead, enjoyed Hot Fuzz, and went to the cinema\nexpecting something good from these collaborators. But the film turned\nout to be such a buzz kill. The film does not live up to its hype or\nits cast, with many of the characters feeling one-dimensional and\nunderdeveloped, which is such a shame as the actors are some of my\nfavourites and very talented. I could deal with the unlikely plot, but\nthe ending was just stupid and rushed. The jokes were forced, and only\none man laughed once through the entire film. All my friends and I left\nthe cinema deflated. The one positive I would say is that the special\neffects were good. Apart from that I was bitterly let down.\n"
"\nThe World's End is one of the funniest, wittiest, and just all out\naction-packed movie! Every character grows on you more and more as they\nare very relatable and very deep. The humor in it is incredibly well\nwritten as it is quick-witted, hilarious, and most importantly used at\nthe right time. The action in this movie is very comedic, but it\ndoesn't mean it can't have some awesome super violent fight scenes! To\nme this is the perfect balance a great comedy that has some depth and\nwhen things go down, THINGS WILL GO DOWN! Overall I believe this movie\nisn't for everyone as it is a very different type of comedy, however if\nyou do enjoy the other Blood and Ice Cream movies (Shaun of the Dead\nand Hot Fuzz) you will have a ton of fun with this movie!\n"
"\nAs a huge Simon Pegg and Nick Frost fan, this film is honestly my\nfavourite movie they have been in so far! The movie is great and I was\nnon stop laughing all the way through! The movie is cheeky which, for\nme, makes it appeal more! If you're a big Simon and Nick fan like\nmyself, you would very much enjoy this movie! :) The ending was\nbrilliant, made me laugh the most. It's a proper man's movie but still\nenjoyable for anyone. It's really great to see Nick Frost play a more\nserious character for most of the film! It's film I can watch over and\nover again and not get bored. As a more of a horror movie fanatic, you\nseriously cannot beat a bit of Simon Pegg and Nick Frost.\n"
"\nMe and my friend were doing a comedy night. He assured me that Hot Fuzz\nand Shaun of the Dead are good, so The World's End should be good too.\nI trusted his opinion and gave it a chance. I hadn't seen the trailer\nor read what the movie was about. I had no expectations and still I was\ndisappointed. After giving it a chance the first half hour it's really\nnot funny, very cliché and left me with the feeling that this is the\ntype of movie teenage guys watch (but without really paying attention)\nwhen they get together, drink beer, smoke weed and wish they had\ngirlfriends. After that the story develops into something even more\nridiculous. <br><br>All in all a waste of time, I couldn't bare watching the whole thing.\nI'm giving it a four just because the cast are decent actors, but the\nplot is predictable and boring.\n"
"\nThis wasn't as good as I was expecting it to be based on my love of\n'Sean Of The Dead'. It is still The Cornetto gang though (Simon Pegg,\nNick Frost etc) so it definitely has its moments, but it seemed to be\nthe same movie as SOTD and 'Hot Fuzz' all over again (was that the\npoint?).<br><br>I also just felt sorry for Gary (Pegg's) character; he was sad not\nfunny. Obnoxious, lost in his glory (high school) days from 20 years\nago when he was \"The King\" and refusing to grow up or change.<br><br>I assumed that over the course of the \"epic\" pub crawl he would redeem\nhimself. But not to be. Instead, World's End turned into a Dr. Who type\nsci-fi, as he and his mates ran around fighting Barbie doll type robots\nwith blue blood as their pub crawl continued.<br><br>I'll admit it was fun watching the 5 childhood friends get drunk and I\nwish they'd just expanded on that more but there seemed to be too many\nstory ideas all thrown together. All ending on a weird apocalyptic note\nwith Pierce Brosnan. 12.28.13\n"
"\nfrom the guys that brought you shaun of the dead and hot fuzz comes the\nworld's end. Five friends reunite to recreate the epic pub crawl they\nattempted as teenagers but they soon realize that newton haven has been\ntaken over by robots full of blue stuff and mayhem, fence jumping, and\nhilarity ensues. I haven't laughed this hard in a long time, this is\nliterally the funniest movie I've ever seen in my whole life, the\nlaughs never stop, they just keep on coming, Simon pegg and nick frost\nare ALWAYS hysterical together and they always have a blast lol, i\nhighly recommend this to fans of British humor and Simon pegg and nick\nfrost, you'll have a blast watching and you'll laugh your ass off the\nentire time, Edgar wright has such a great sense of humor lol\n"
"\nI'm a big fan of Pegg and Frost but this film seems to be treading old\nground.There is no real chemistry between the five 'friends', it all\nfeels a bit constipated.Pegg fails to deliver as the swashbuckling\nfailure, he's always better as the anti hero. You get the feeling there\nwon't be any surprises and there aren't any. The introduction of the\nrobots lacked wow factor and just added a cheap zombie element. The\nconfrontation with the alien entity at the end was a piece incredible\nnaffness. Of all the characters Nick Frost comes out on top, he lifts\nthis film from being poor to something just about reasonable. I had\nhigh hopes for this film and, save for one or two genuinely funny\nmoments, it was a bit of a letdown. You'd be advised to wait for the\nDVD release (its not worth investing in the bluray version).\n"
"\nThird in the \"Three colours Cornetto\" trilogy; this is sadly the least\nof them. A promising comedy-drama sort of runs out of steam once the\naliens are introduced - they prove a distraction to an interesting set\nup with interesting actors. Simon Pegg bravely plays a bit of a\ndick-head, and does it very well. A guy who can't move on from his\nadolescence, he invites his old school mates to repeat a pub-crawl they\nnever finished as teenagers, with the final pub the titular World's\nEnd. The reluctant adults are practically dragged along, and quickly\nrealise that the town they left behind all those years ago is not what\nit seems.<br><br>The standout is Nick Frost, playing against type, he quickly displays\nsuperb ninja skills when called into combat! David Bradley has a great\ncameo but Pierce Brosnan is wasted. As sci-fi the movie isn't original\nenough and while funny it would have been better to carry on in the\nsame vein as the opening half-hour.<br><br>So it's reasonably enjoyable, but does not quite succeed.\n"
"\nI must confess with personal affection towards British comedians in\nHollywood movies. In my opinion Simon Pegg (who broke into mainstream\nlong ago), Nick Frost (His partner in crime), and the newest hobbit -\nMartin Freeman are simply incredible, I love seeing all of them,\nwherever they act, so I was looking forward for this one... and got a\nbit disappointed. There are some funny monologues, but the roles were a\nbit off - especially Simon's. I just can't really receive him as a\nfunny-cool leader of the gang that is locked on his own mission, so\nthat felt a bit wrong. Another thing is the plot - could have been\nbetter. The ending simply isn't good enough. In conclusion, worth to\nwatch if you really have nothing else to do.\n"
"\nVery well made with all the usual tropes you expect from and Edgar\nWright/Simon Pegg script. There are an awful lot of references to their\npast work and very subtle nods to other films along the way. I guess\nyou'd have to watch it many times to get them all. All the performances\nwere excellent with Frost and Pegg taking centre stage (of course) but\nwith the talent on show, nobody could really put a foot wrong. Oh, and\nI have to mention Rosamund Pike who plays the female lead, Sam\nChamberlain, I thought she was excellent as well. So was it just a\nclone of 'Shaun of the Dead'? Well, it has many similarities but the\ncharacters are all different and the antagonist is also different. So\nnot a direct clone but you can see where it came from. Over all, I\nliked it, an entertaining romp well worth a look.<br><br>SteelMonster's verdict: RECOMMENDED<br><br>My score: 7.7/10.<br><br>You can find an expanded version of this review on my blog: Thoughts of\na SteelMonster.\n"
"\nThe final film in the Three Flavours Cornetto Trilogy is the most\nmature and maybe even the best. Hot Fuzz is still the funniest, Shaun\nof the Dead is still the most original, but I think The World's End may\nbe my favorite. This movie, which is about a simple pub crawl, has a\nvery epic scale. By the end of this film, it has switched from being a\nwacky comedy into being a sci-fi action thriller, though it still\nprovides plenty of laughs. The story's structure is very similar to\nShaun of the Dead's, which starts slowly but gradually builds until the\nmassive climax. This is by far the funniest film of this year and my\npersonal favorite. It's a great wrap-up to what is now my favorite\nmovie trilogy of all time. Go see it.\n"
"\nThose hoping for another Shaun of the Dead will be disappointed but\nthis one fares much better than hot fuzz. Not to say any of them are\nbad at all. This one centers on a group of friends reuniting to do a\nlegnday pub crawl they couldn't accomplish in their younger years. But\nupon returning they discover the town has been overrun with alien\nrobots. Many laughs ensue as well as touching on thoughtful,\nemotionally resonant themes like friendship, growing up, and\ndiscovering ourselves. It really is a mostly great film almost\nperfectly engaging until a strange drawn out secondary finale unfitting\nthe material and it's direction. Still it's a solid flick that boasts\nmore laughs than most of the films this year. The second best comedy of\nthe year behund this is the end. ***.5/5\n"
"\nThe World's End ... is not the best of Edgar Wright's Cornetto trilogy,\nI just thought I'd get that out of the way. However just like Shaun of\nthe Dead and Hot Fuzz, It does have an undeniable charm to it and It's\nalso known for blending two genres quite well together. The cast\nincludes the usual suspects Nick Frost and Simon Pegg as well as comedy\ngreats like Martin Freeman, Eddie Marsan and strangely enough Paddy\nConsidine and everyone's favorite Gone Girl, Rosamund Pike. The story\nis basically a pub crawl that eventually leads into ... an alien\ninvasion. Now this is what I don't like about The World's End. Whereas\nZombies and Wicker Man/The Village style stories aren't something you\nsee that often today, but Aliens have been done to death every decade\nover. Also It's got to be said the ending is far too bleak for my\nliking, BUT The World's End does maintain the level of originality and\nwell placed humour that Edgar Wright is known for.\n"
"\nWhile this isn't as good as Shaun of the Dead or Hot Fuzz, it's still\nan entertaining watch. <br><br>It has an awesome cast, Simon Pegg and Nick Frost are just amazing\ntogether as well as the newer additions, a great story and plenty of\nlaughs. <br><br>I did find Simon Pegg's character to be annoying at times, okay most of\nthe movie, but was made bearable by the other four main characters.<br><br>Worth a watch at least once, I may watch it a couple of more times but\nnot as much as I watch Shaun of the Dead or Hot Fuzz, the former being\nmy favourite out of The Cornetto Trilogy followed by Hot Fuzz and then\nthis movie.\n"
"\nA curveball of a movie. Like most unconventional films, it has its ups\nand downs... and unlike more commercial releases, it's unpredictable:\njust when you think it's about this... suddenly, it's about something\nelse entirely.<br><br>Love Simon Pegg in Star Trek: The Reboot and thought he was great here.\nManic yet desperate, funny and pathetic.<br><br>The other actors - especially the friend owed 600 quid - were great.\nThe special effects were believable. The script was funny.<br><br>My only complaint was how much of the film's dialogue was bleeped on\nthe broadcast I saw. I'd much rather hear the whole film in its\noriginal context than be bleeped at by some censor-laden TV network.\nI'd like to see this film again uncensored.\n"
"\nThis is my favorite of the 'Cornetto' trilogy.<br><br>It's not the funniest ('Shaun of the Dead' is the funniest).<br><br>But it is the most (I hate too say) 'Mature'.<br><br>It's the story of a man who has never 'grown up' and his efforts to\nrecreate his youth. His friends have all moved on. His town has been\nincorporated and his life has become a Goth cliché.<br><br>The comedy of this film often makes fun of this sad man which makes\nmany viewers uncomfortable. If they had made this as a drama it would\nwin an Oscar.<br><br>It's a new kind of 'tragi-comedy' and not for everyone.\n"
"\nWell, knock yourself out! This movie made me laugh a few times, mostly\nin the first half of the movie. <br><br>The movie is about one guy out of jail summoning his old high school\nfriends for a pub-to-pub night out. Main character Gary has not aged\nmentally and is out with his grown out and established mates. <br><br>There are fighting scenes, they are all short and silly. Actors were\ngood, although I missed good female actors beyond Rosamund Pike. The\nplot involves robots invading Earth and providing technology so that\n\"we\" might enter the peaceful Galactic order. <br><br>The ending was a surprise worth waiting for.\n"
"\nI thought this movie was genius. It starts off as one of those old\npeople get together and then turns into an robot action movie.\nThroughout the whole movie, I laughing like crazy. The plot was\nhilarious, the movie included many British actors (they even included\nthe old bond) and the effects were realistic. I also really liked the\nrobot ink people and how easy they were to kill! <br><br>However, I gave it a six because the second half of the movie didn't\nmake me laugh as much and also, the ending was disappointing but other\nthan that, this movie is worth watching. This review is coming from\nsomebody who hasn't watched the other two movies from the cornetto\nseries!\n"
"\nI like to call this trilogy, \"the easy going trilogy\", cause the\nscreenwriters and the actors can't hide their real friendship and \"easy\ngoing nature\", and the entire movie \"smells\" of friendship and\ntalent... a very good smell. If you want some great English dark\ncomedy, and if you are nostalgic of your high school friends, that were\nused to be funny and now are boring as hell (because they think an\n\"adult\" can't keep his \"easy going\" attitude) Well you will terribly\nenjoy the movie and it's funny story.<br><br>I can't say which one is the best of the trilogy, just watch them all\nguys, they are ALL great and they all deserve a support.<br><br>Cheers from Germany\n"
"\nI initially thought this movie was unfunny and a little bit pathetic\nwhen I started watching it. Thankfully I was incredibly wrong. I\nactually couldn't remember what the movie was about before I watched it\nso I got a nice surprise when the movie started getting interesting.\nIt's such a weird idea but incredibly funny and entertaining.<br><br>Whenever these guys get together they produce a really good inventive\nfilm. It has some brilliant action sequences and is actually quite\nsuspenseful. Probably the funniest bit is watching five middle-age guys\nbusting out their best ninja moves. Towards the end they get off track\na bit but it ties up the loose ends of the story and leaves you\nsatisfied.\n"
"\nThink of \"Village of the Damned\" and \"The Stepford Wives\" and this is\nwhat you get BUT this movie has great comedy lines; funny. Simon Pegg\ndoes a wonderful job as does the rest of the cast but he stands out in\nmy opinion. Good storyline and scenario. I enjoyed the hell out of\n\"Shaun of the Dead\", that is a classic! Watch this movie closely, there\nare quotes and scenes to snicker at. Love it. And this requirement of\n10 lines is crazy. So I will fulfill the rules. Watch this movie and\nenjoy and again, a combination of \"Stepford Wives\" and \"Village\". I\nthink I met the 10 line rule. Let me try again. Good funny movie. This\nshould be ten lines. Post it.\n"
"\n(75%) Released nearly 10 years after the instant classic \"Shaun of the\ndead\" the trio (Wright, Pegg and Frost) show no sign of losing their\nway with this very enjoyable, funny, imaginative comedy hit. This is\nperhaps as strong as their break out movie; although I don't think it\ncomes close to being a better, funnier film. The characters are finely\ncrafted and well observed with plenty of heart in there along side the\nsharp writing and strong comic performances. But on a down side the\nending just isn't as good as the rest of the film, as it just goes a\nlittle too far within in its already stretched reality. They clearly\nhave a lot more money to play with now than they did before, and I just\nhope that the big money factor does not get in the way of good comedy\nin their next film together.\n"
"\nGary King (Simon Pegg) gathers up the childhood gang of Andy Knightley\n(Nick Frost), Oliver Chamberlain (Martin Freeman), Steven Prince (Paddy\nConsidine) and Peter Page (Eddie Marsan) to return home to Newton Haven\nto complete The Golden Mile. It's a club crawl of 12 pubs that the boys\nfailed back in the old days. Gary is still stuck in the past while the\nothers have moved on and grown up. Gary is bent on drinking the Golden\nMile, but the others are getting more sick of him. Then it gets weird.\nAnd Oliver's sister Sam (Rosamund Pike) joins the group.<br><br>The gang is back with some new friends. The first half has a few laughs\nbut Gary has a patheticness about him. Things get weird. The jokes get\nfunnier. I love the discourse about the meaning of words. The problem\nlater on is that the pub crawl gets stupider and the group loses\npeople. The final confrontation is long winded and not that funny. Also\nI don't like the epilogue. It doesn't make it funnier and it just\nextends the ending into a completely different place.\n"
"\nPretty good movie with friends running around with a plan (well no\nplan) in mind and just trying to have fun time. Simon did a fantastic\njob leading the charge and driving the movie forward - with his laid\nback attitude, jokes with reflections of stupidity mixed with\nintelligence. Overall, movie would have fell short if it was not up to\nhim. Just to be clear, everyone else did pretty good job too.<br><br>I mostly liked the first half when it was real fun watching all the\nfriends pulling each others legs while remembering their school days\nand what they did. Second half was less interesting but it was not bad. <br><br>Overall, good comedy and worth watching.\n"
"\n\" . . . 100 bottles of beer; take one down, and pass it around, and\nthere will be 99 bottles of beer on the wall.\" If I continued with the\nremaining 99 verses of this famous English drinking song, this comment\nMIGHT become slightly more repetitious than the latest from SHAUN OF\nTHE DEAD, namely, THE WORLD'S END. If you already have seen BOTH the\ntrailer for this flick and the feature itself, you honestly should ask\nyourself: What did you gain by paying to view the entire movie, after\nwatching the trailer for free? What did co-writer Simon Pegg really\nhave in mind--STAND BY ME meets STEPFORD WIVES?! As funny as it may be\nto see ONE person revealed as an automaton (as in, say, ALIEN), does\nthe joke really improve when the whole town (except for three) is in on\nit? The primary \"tee-hee\" behind THE WORLD'S END seems to be that\nEnglish people spend their evening hours so snookered that apes could\ntake over the planet, and it would take them weeks to notice (if ever).\nWell, if your \"British Empire\" had shrunk down of half an island (not\nunlike Haiti), you might drink, too!\n"
"\nThis movie is terrible. I wasted my time watching it. from the\nbeginning it seemed pointless. A loser, gathering back his old friends\nin order to participate in a beer marathon. Afterwards it becomes much\nworse , with aliens taking over the place and transforming humans into\nrobots and dispose the human bodies. I do not know if there was even\none funny joke in the movie. If it served its purpose as a black comedy\nlet's say. I truly want to say how awful it was. Of course I have\nwatched even worse movies in my life. But this is not the point. The\nwhole thing was not watchable, boring, not funny, bad scenario, bad\nacting and overall it was weird to watch. The main actor was terrible\ntoo. If he was not so antipathetic , maybe the whole film would be a\nlot easier to watch.\n"
"\nNot the funniest of the cornetto trilogy, but possibly the best. This\none is so brilliantly written that i am very, very impressed. Gary King\n(Simon Pegg) is a middle aged man who refuses to grow up, the only\nthing for him is the next drink; he wants to be free to do what he\nwants any old time.... He urges his friends for a one final pub crawl,\na pub crawl of twelve pubs that ends at the one called the worlds end.\nThe analogy between an alcoholic and mankind is a brilliant one. Gary\nKing cannot stop drinking even though he knows it will lead him to his\ndestruction. The robots are actually aliens from other worlds trying to\nsave this one but Gary and the boys know better; they just want to keep\nthe party going. Its nice to finally see a movie whith such strong\nmessage and such powerful imagery. It addresses some of the most fatal\nissues of the world today; we know we are going the wrong way, but\nsomehow we just keep on going... not even aliens from outer space can\nstop us.\n"
"\nthe Blood and Ice Cream Trilogy, The World's End was what I had less\nexpectations , more ended up being my favorite of the trilogy , the\nfilm is very good, even with a very slow start , the film too surprises\nwhen the 5 friends finds out why people so acting strangely , the film\nturns and is very good, the special effects are good , the cast is\nexcellent , the actors have excellent chemistry, Simon Pegg , Nick\nFrost , Martin Freeman , Paddy Considine , Eddie Marsan, Rosamund Pink\n, Pierce Brosnan , all excellent , about the last 30 minutes are great\n, you discover all have revelations , not wait a Plot Twist, do not\ncome to this, the film is also funny, more is not the comedy to die of\nlaughter , and the script is very good, the World's End is the best of\nthe trilogy Blood and Ice Cream is great fun and has a great chemistry\nof the actors. 8.6\n"
"\nOh I love Simon Pegg and Nick Frost, they are a very good and funny\nteam, not just in this one, but in all their movies together. I am a\nsucker for British comedy, especially when it gets a bit weird, black\nor crazy and it really goes in this one :)<br><br>Edgar Wright really goes a great job in the third installment of his\ntrilogy, but with what seems to be the same recipe as the earlier films\nand some of the same cast and crew it should also trod along nicely.<br><br>I guess you have to like this sort of thing, so if you have seen Shaun\nof the dead or hot fuzz and though nah not really something for me,\nthen this will not work for you either. Should you happen to like the\nother two and maybe just British black comedy in general I think you\nwill have a blast with this one.\n"
"\nFive friends re-create the old days attempting a 12 pub pub crawl. The\nWorlds End is a very British comedy and is one that despite a few flaws\nultimately works. <br><br>Anyone that likes Simon Pegg and Nick Frost movies will know what to\nexpect and the duo do not disappoint. This film has plenty of laughs\nand although not as good as the brilliant Shaun of the Dead it is on a\npar with Hot Fuzz and Paul in my opinion. This is thanks in large to\nexcellent performances from a top class British cast. For me the true\ntest of any film is it's re-watch value and having just watched this\nfor the second time, I probably enjoyed it more on second viewing. <br><br>It's maybe not as good as it could have been but there is more than\nenough here to keep you entertained for 100 minutes. <br><br>If you keep your expectations realistic then this is a film to put on\nand enjoy when you are in the mood for a few laughs.\n"
"\nMany people, as I've noticed, blame this movie for not being funny\nenough. That's their point of view I'm not going to argue with. Yes,\nthis movie isn't funny enough compared to the other Simon Pegg's works.\nBut it's not about being funny anymore, and maybe that is why I respect\nhim even more - because of growing, maturing. <br><br>The general topic on the mature/immature take on life in total\nprevails, and the ending shows us how fragile the so-called-mature\nstate is. Maybe this movie isn't that much about laughs, but about a\nlittle bit of thinking?<br><br>I totally admit I'm with the 'Gary King's team, the idea of freedom,\neven though I'm working within the corporate standards - the skills,\nexperience and knowledge make up for the anarchist position. I only\nwish for people in charge to notice our strengths, not our\n'questionable' affiliations.\n"
"\nSimon Pegg, Nick Frost and Martin Freeman reunite again in my favourite\nof the Cornetto trilogy (admittedly I appear to be in the minority with\nthat statement though) <br><br>Plot In A Paragraph: Five friends reunite in an attempt to top their\nepic pub crawl from 20 years earlier become humankind's only hope for\nsurvival. <br><br>All the returning actors do a sterling job, Rosamund Pike is solid\nsupport and following on from Timothy Dalton in \"Hot Fuzz\" former James\nBond star Pierce Broanan turns up and is great fun too.<br><br>This is the funniest of the Cornetto trilogy for me, with several laugh\nout loud moments coming along thick and fast.\n"
"\nIf you liked Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz, this will definitely be\none for you. A good, fun comedy, mix in some action and a few twists\nand turns and it had me laughing throughout. I would definitely\nrecommend this film to someone looking for an easy to watch comedy!\nPegg is constantly delivering witty one liners, and the supporting cast\nplay their roles excellently. Frost taking a slightly different role to\nhis usual dufus sidekick in SotD and HF, but playing it expertly. I\nwatched this film. As per, Pegg and co have managed to create another\nfunny and exciting dramatic comedy that keeps you wanting more! Looking\nforward to another film from this cast.\n"
"\nHilariously mixing two unassumingly fitting 'ingredients': a pub crawl\nand an apocalyptic alien overthrow. Brilliantly directed, adding the\nsame momentary shots as previously seen in Shaun Of The Dead and Hot\nFuzz. Although Simon Pegg and Nick Frost switch roles in The Worlds\nEnd, their characters being the opposite the previous films in this\ntrilogy, where Simon Pegg is the somewhat more sensible, Nick Frost the\nlesser of this characteristic, the roles are played perfectly. The fact\nthat for more than half of this film, the main protagonists are heavily\nintoxicated, therefore being incapable of noting the almost blatantly\nobvious facts that are in need of being explained multiple times,\ncontrary to many others views, is not tedious or even boring, but quite\nthe opposite. One star was dropped in my rating for the lack of acting\nprowess, not equaling Simon Pegg and Nick Frost, from the other main\ncharacters. This aspect of the film was rather disappointing. But aside\nfrom that this film, the last in the \"Cornetto Trilogy\", was a great\nway to conclude this franchise.\n"
"\nTHE WORLD'S END gets off to a slow start- so slow, in fact, that I\nmistook it for a pub-crawl comedy instead of what it turned out to be.\nThe bathroom brawl caught me by surprise. (It reminded me of the\nover-the-top barroom brawl in FROM DUSK TO DAWN: it comes out of\nnowhere after a carefully crafted first half that promises more than\nthe second half delivers.) Once any notion of subtlety is abandoned,\nthe movie devolves into routine unfunny action and special effects\nsequences that only serve to undermine the set-up. It's DR. WHO by way\nof INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS, with a bit of Pink Floyd's HIGH\nHOPES thrown in for good measure. I must admit that I loved the ending:\nafter listening to Pegg's drunken ramblings, the Alien leader gives up\non any notion of helping the Human Race with the classic, \"F*** it.\"\nThe ending made the whole thing worth it.\n"
"\nThe Worlds End is a great movie with a very well developed storyline\nwith a brilliant comedic cast.The film is the finale of the Cornetto\ntrilogy,the other two being Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz,and while I\ncertainly think this one is the weakest of the trilogy,it still is a\nlot of fun with the type of humour we've come to expect from Simon\nPegg,Nick Frost and Edgar Wright.Simon Peggs character Gary King is\ncertainly one of the funniest characters he has played to date,in Shaun\nof the Dead and Hot Fuzz his character was the voice of reason,both in\nthis he plays a hilarious character who is beyond stupid and will do\nanything to get his pint.The Worlds End is a very enjoyable movie that\nI would definitely recommend to anyone looking for a great comedy or\nsci-fi. <br><br>A group of friends reunite to finish a pub crawl they attempted 20\nyears ago,but unexpectedly get involved with extraterrestrial machines. <br><br>Best Performance: Simon Pegg Worst Performance: Pierce Brosnan\n"
"\nThis is a different beast than the previous collaborations. It still is\na comedy mind you, but the pace and the characters are more than\ndifferent. Plus the relationship between Nick and Simon seems to be on\nthe edge to say the least. But it's a much needed change in pace too.\nYou also shouldn't even begin to compare this to the other end of the\nworld movie (this is the end).<br><br>It may seem immature (and some of the jokes are exactly that), but\nthere is a message here about maturing and getting over things. It's\nnot perfectly hinted at or shown off, but the movie it engulfs is more\nthan just a shell. It does entertain all the way through ...\n"
"\nThis movie would have been different without Simon Pegg, but I'm not\nreviewing him now, I'm just saying that he drew as (almost) always lots\nof laughter. Overall the movie was quite entertaining, with only a bit\nof hiccups and goofs here and there, probably if this movie was not\nbased on the popular English humor, it would have miserably failed.\nJust the British accent, their faces and those typical pub jokes are\nworth watching this comedy, and there aren't many good comedy movies\nlately on the screen.<br><br>I gave it 7/10 because it could have been better from multiple points\nof view, but it turned out a good comedy to watch, mostly because of\nPegg's performance. Other good movies I'd recommend you to watch in\ncase you haven't: Shaun of the Dead % Hot Fuzz. (both with Simon Pegg\nin a lead role)\n"
"\nI've gotta say that I'm right in the demographic this film is aimed at.\nIn short I'm a middle aged guy from Britain that likes a drink and\nlooks back with fond memories of pub crawls 20 years ago. That pretty\nmuch sums up the plot of Worlds End. A group of middle aged guys\nreunite to do a famous pub crawl that ends up in the World's End pub. <br><br>Gary King (Pegg) has to do a bit of arm twisting to get the others to\nagree to the reunion, but once they've agreed they soon fall into their\nold routine. This is the final part of a trilogy of Simon Pegg films\nthat included Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz. The comedy, action,\ndirection and acting are all spot on. I really enjoyed the film and\nanybody that liked the humour of SOTD/HF is highly likely to enjoy\nWorlds End! Entertaining!\n"
"\nI never heard of this being some sort of trilogy with \"Shaun of the\nDead\" and \"Hot Fuzz\" but now that I know, I feel this was the perfect\nfit to end it. Ever since \"Shaun of the Dead\" I've been a big fan of\nSimon Pegg. He always seems to be funny in everything he does.<br><br>The story is simple as 5 old friends try to have a pint of beer at 12\ndifferent pubs in the same night. Things are weird though and soon they\nfind out its been taken over by aliens. The concept sounds pretty dumb\nbut it's hilarious and the 5 main characters are all very good.<br><br>The action scenes are also very well choreographed and that was a\npleasant surprise. It's a funny action comedy that most people should\nwatch especially if you enjoyed the first two movies that I mentioned\nearlier.\n"
"\nI was a huge fan of Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz. I'd give them a 10.\nBut for Edgar Wright's next and last part of the Cornetto Trilogy, I'll\nhave to give this a 9.<br><br>This movie was quite funny like the other films. Plus, the acting was\nperfect. This film's unpredictable which is what I'd like in a movie. <br><br>Simon Pegg's performance surprised me considering how he's characters\nare in the previous films but still I loved his performance.. However,\nhaving Nick Frost's performance was quite unexpected but great as well.\nPaddy Considine, Rosamund Pike, Eddie Marsan and Pierce Brosnan's\nperformances in here were perfect. <br><br>The visual effects were nice. The story was (kind of) perfect. The only\nproblem I had with this film was, in fact, the story but that can be\neasily exaggerated.<br><br>Highly recommended for people who just want to have a good laugh.\n"
"\nEdgar Wright, Simon Pegg and Nick Frost do not fail to amaze with this\noriginal, incredible cornerstone of British comedy. The first film of\nthe trilogy 'Shaun of the Dead' set the highest mark possible for\nBritish filmmaking and 'The World's End'- even though it can't beat\n'Shaun of the Dead's ' originality- smashed it with a mixture of\nhilarious and thoughtful dialogue, a 'rather fitting' to the theme\nsoundtrack, Hollywood style cinematography and groundbreaking effects.\nNot to mention the many hidden easter eggs.<br><br>In this film Nick Frost portrays the polar opposite of previous\ncharacters of 'Ed' and 'Danny Butterman' with his depiction of straight\nman Andy Knightley. This pays off for the film and Nick Frost as we see\na new side to him.<br><br>This film is definitely recommended for fans of the Cornetto Trilogy as\nit does not disappoint and gives new vision and cinematic value to\nBritish filmmaking.\n"
"\npersonally ,i never had any expectations while going into the movie..it\nhas the same old back drop of aliens dropping and invading the earth\nand same stuff..but to be honest what makes it different is Simon\nPeg,the guy carries the entire movie on his shoulder as an arrogant aka\nspout kid ,who refuses not to grow up. so if you love watching\nhim,which i do...then go for this one..!! besides it does not have\nanything new to offer in this one. i mean we have seen better movies\nthan this one...if you totally free this weekend then i may say go and\ngrab a popcorn and watch this one...!!!! only for Simon fans ...or else\njust try sating away from it\n"
"\nThe World's End doesn't measure up to the first two particularly in its\nwriting. While I was entertained by it throughout it rarely gave me\nproper laughs. Simon Pegg as Gary King, the middle-aged man who still\nthinks he's a teenager, was often, especially in the early parts of the\nmovie, a bit more annoying than funny with his teenage antics. While\nthe rest of the more grown up crew often came out as dull once again\nespecially early on in the movie. Also the level of drunkenness on the\ncharacters seemed pretty inconsistent. It looked like they jumped from\ndrunk back to sober and drunk again in a few minutes. Nevertheless I\nfound The World's End to be a satisfying conclusion with just enough\nfor me to enjoy it. What's a bit sad though is how the best parts of\nthis movie are probably the fight scenes.\n"
"\nThis film suffers the same problem as last year's (2012) Seven\nPsychopaths - huge expectations, poor satisfactions.<br><br>Out of many films this year, this films is still good. The dialogues\nare still sharp, the editing and special effects are top notch, and the\nsoundtrack is wonderful. One thing that I would like to really mention\nhere is the main theme of the film. Compared to Shaun and Fuzz, The\nWorld's End complex theme on youth and regrets are something rare and\nspecial.<br><br>However, compared to previous films of the Cornetto Trilogy, The\nWorld's End suffers from poor story and character development. The\nswitching of Pegg's and Frost's character personality is a good attempt\nbut unsatisfying. Not trying to contradict myself, the dialogues are\nsharp and fact pace but most of them are not funny. Smart, but\nhumourless.<br><br>In summary, The World's End is a good chapter to end the Cornetto\nTrilogy but don't expect it to be as funny or as smart as Shaun of the\nDead and Hot Fuzz.\n"
"\ngreat cast - -very indulgent and Mr Pegg is lucky to get finance for\nsuch average stuff. buy dusk til dawn it kicks its ass. i found myself\nwriting this review while watching the film which says it all. Simon\nplease do something original. soundtrack may actually be the best part.\nkinda feel i wasted 4 quid on virgin. great cast - -very indulgent and\nMr Pegg is lucky to get finance for such average stuff. buy dusk til\ndawn it kicks its ass. i found myself writing this review while\nwatching the film which says it all.

"\nCount me among the apparent minority that didn't like the previous two\nfilms in this so-called \"Cornetto Trilogy\"; 'Shaun of the Dead' and\n'Hot Fuzz'. So naturally I went into 'The World's End' with pretty low\nexpectations. Expectations that were exceeded for about 2/3 of its\nrunning time. But it over-stays its welcome and runs out of steam long\nbefore its disappointing finale.<br><br>The cast is fantastic, riffing off of one another with consummate\nskill. And the script is chock full of clever bits. But once the\n\"twist\" is revealed, the wheels fall off and it staggers to its drawn\nout finish and falls flat on its face.\n"
"\nI am a big fan of both Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz and was hoping\nfor something similar. Sadly this wasn't a patch on those comedy\nclassics and despite a few moments was a real disappointment. While\n'Shaun' and 'Hot' were parodies of genre classics, this didn't have\nanything to pivot off and, as a result, felt aimless. Sure, there were\nhints of Invasion of the body snatchers or even The Stepford Wives but\nnot enough to impact the narrative. I guess this makes the film more\noriginal - and I didn't think this was a bad film - but it just wasn't\nas good as its brother films and, consequently, was a missed\nopportunity.\n"
"\nSimon Pegg, Nick Frost and Edgar Wright completed the Three Flavors\nCornetto Trilogy with \"The World's End\", featuring Pegg as a boorish\nman who gathers some college buddies to do a pub crawl that they hadn't\ncompleted earlier...only to discover that they might be humanity's best\nhope for survival! I had never heard of Pegg, Frost and Wright before\n\"Shaun of the Dead\" came out, but they've proved to be a very capable\nteam every step of the way. My favorite of their collaborations is\n\"Paul\", which is actually not part of the Cornetto trilogy.\nNonetheless, this movie is a really fun one. It's all about living\none's life to the fullest, with a lot of surprises. The end subtly\nlooks at the risk of excessive reliance on technology. But mostly it's\nan excuse to party. You're sure to love it.\n"
"\nThis last opus of the Cornetto Trilogy is a notch below the two first,\nindeed it seems we're dealing with a rehashed version of a remix\nbetween Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz.<br><br>The movie relies on the same elements (incisive dialogues, off-the-wall\nhumour, refined mise-en-scène), but this time, it doesn't do the trick\nas well as before because the plot is too predictable and too\nredundant. There is no element of surprise anymore and sometimes the\nstory even drags on not helping to keep the viewer's attention.<br><br>Still, even though it is not exceptional, it's undeniable that The\nWorld's End is better than most of comedies and it ends the trilogy on\na rather positive note.\n"
"\nIn a way, this movie is quite different to the other two that comprise\nthe Cornetto Trilogy... in another, it's the same ol' Edgar Wright we\nknow and love. The World's End is not your average dumb comedy,\nalthough for the untrained eye it may look so. TWE is Wright at his\nbest, combining his mastership of VFX and choreography, his thorough\nknowledge of the source material (which he doesn't shy to throw over\nyour face over and over again) and the great writing partnership that\nhe has achieved with Simon Pegg way for over a decade. This\ncoming-of-age/sci-fi/social satire mash-up comedy may not appeal to\neveryone,it may even make some Wright fans raise an eyebrow, but if you\nallow yourself to digest all the things that this movie accomplishes\nyou will not only acknowledge this film as a worthy member of the blood\n&amp; ice cream trilogy but you'll witness the birth of a cult comedy for\nthe years to come. (Having said that, Hot Fuzz is still my favorite)\n"
"\nOne of the most expected British movie of the year. After donning in\nmovies like 'Shaun of the Dead' and 'Hot Fuzz' the most promising actor\ncombo given yet another astonishing performance under the same\ndirector. The other too were acted very well. The movie begins with\nslow especially the opening 30 minutes were like some regular comedy\ndrama but, later, like a wild fire it catches up the speed and ends\nhigh. Most of the people will like the second half of the movie a lot.<br><br>We can call it a counterpart to multi starer Seth Rogen's maiden\ndirectional debut movie 'This is the End'. Coincidentally both movies\nreleased in the same period of time and deals with the same theme. All\nthe above both were excellent movies which I loved a lot. Just like the\ncharacters from the 'Hangover' movies it has been about the bunch of\nold friends who hangouts and face the beginning of the apocalypse. I\npromise you won't get often fun like these two movies where all the\ncomedians comes together to entertain us. So I recommended it to you\nguys.<br><br>8/10\n"
"\nI watched the film as some friends asked me to join them, they\nrecommended it as a film similar to shaun of the dead, which I liked.\nBut afterwards I would say it was a big disappointment. The beginning\nintroducing you to the characters was OK. In the middle part the Story\nwas told quite quick - and there the film could have ended for me. The\nrest was Kind of boring. The end was a bit surprising but in no way\nexciting. I even do not know as what I would describe the genre. I\nwould say: a tiny bit of Action, some way trash, very low Level sci fi\nnot to take serious in any way but also not to laugh about a lot, a bit\nfunny but not enough to call it a comedy. I recommend you to spend the\nMoney for another film or bread which would maybe give you more\nenjoyment.\n"
"\nSo if you enjoy long running humor and drunk Britains your gonna love\nthis movie it is really different and i have read some bad reviews on\nthis movie but to really understand and appreciate the humor u have to\npay attention and know how to listen for running jokes great film and\nmy personal rating witch i give for all my movies is 7.9/10.0 good film\nfor anyone to enjoy and another great production by Simon Pegg and\nEdgar Wright i'm Kneo and this is my first review of many more to come\nso keep an eye out for real and precise ratings from a man who's read\nover 1000 books and seen probably even more movies so until next time.\nThis is Kneo, saying, \"I Am The One'\n"
"\nYou have to enjoy this kind of British comedy. If you are fans of Monty\nPython and Python alum John Cleese \"Fawlty Towers.\" As Simon Pegg is at\nhis best. With him playing a 40-year old man who is in the heart and\nmind of a teen.<br><br>His Gary King does not want to grow up. As four of his friends have and\nhave their own jobs, lives, and families. As they did not as kids get\nto go to the World's End bar, the twelve of the twelve bars they did\nnot complete as teens.<br><br>As all five of them go to the bars to enjoy drinking despite Gary being\nbanned in one of them. And one of them, played by Nick Frost another\ncomedian and Pegg friend a sober man. Still, they find out the town\nthey inhabited as kids, now is run by some alien race.<br><br>As now they are the unwittingly only hope to save the human race. And\ngoing to all twelve bars is the least of their worries. As the friends\nmust learn to trust one another again despite King's acting like a kid\nat heart who never really grew up.<br><br>Funny and you have to stomach the UK kind of humor.\n"
"\nTHE WORLD'S END (2013) *** Simon Pegg, Nick Frost, Martin Freeman,\nPaddy Considine, Eddie Marsan, Rosamund Pike, Pierce Brosnan. Epic\nlaughs ensue in this funny and fast-paced comedy about five childhood\nfriends reunited to relive their youth by another attempt at a pub\ncrawl to end all pub crawls (literally) when they discover their sleepy\nold hometown is being taken over by supernatural beings. The comedy\nteam of Pegg and Frost with their collaborator Edgar Wright continue\ntheir unofficial trilogy with great fun and spirits (of all types) in\nthis frenetic mix of comedy and sci-fi. Belly up to the bar for belly\nlaughs.\n"
"\nI am a huge fan of the previous films \"Shaun of the Dead\" and \"Hot\nFuzz,\" however, there seemed to be something missing from this movie.\nLike its predecessors, this movie circles around humor and camaraderie,\nbut the story feels really lackluster for some reason. Maybe its the\nrandom gory stuff that you don't generally see in comedies that's\nmissing (which was in the previous films) or Nick Frost and Simon Pegg\nswapping roles (Nick generally plays the jackass/ Simon plays serious\nguy). The role swap really changed the vibe of what i was expecting\nfrom this movie, but it still worked out. This is definitely my least\nfavorite in the trilogy, but its still worth a watch if your a fan of\nthe previous films.\n"
"\nLate to the party but this movie had me laughing out loud. A blend of\nvery funny realism and sci-fi led by the crazy lead character Gary King\nand 4 schoolmates who reune to hit 12 bars in one night which they\nfailed to make in their younger days.<br><br>The other four have settled into conventional safe lives but that\ndoesn't mean their lives are that wonderful. The lead character Gary is\nhalf nuts and hasn't accomplished much since school days. But he is\nstill full of juvenile life and leads the group on the marathon pub\ncrawl.<br><br>Along the way some strange things happen. Gary might be nuts but he\nstill has a mind and a will to live life against the odds, and so do\nsome of the others. Whatever the 'best' choices in life, they would\nrather live on as human beings with all the failures and all the\nproblems, than settle into a perfect, predictable life without pain and\nwithout problems.<br><br>If you're over 14 and looking for more then summer hyper schlock, go\nsee the World's End. Just relax and enjoy it.\n"
"\nWhat was Edgar Wright thinking? I think they even forgot the story they\nwere writing. They had to keep reminding themselves, \"We are not\nrobots. Robots are slaves and we are very happy.\" <br><br>The story was bad and inconsistent. Simon Pegg's character has some\nserious emotional issues that don't even make sense. \"Our town has been\noverrun by not robots(?? I don't know what else to call them), but\nstill I need to keep drinking and put everyone at risk.\" I really hated\nthat character. The other films were relatable; I have never known\nanyone to be that stupidly selfish.<br><br>Also, no one told Simon Pegg that gingers can't dye their hair or they\nlook super creepy. <br><br>So bad. This fail is even more upsetting because Shaun of the Dead and\nHot Fuzz were so good.\n"
"\nI have to admit, if the final third of the films comes into its own\nthen I'm the fool for turning off before then. A cast riddled with\nstars and funnymen alike comes across as several actor friends\nproducing a script during a night on the booze and just not re-reading\nit the following morning. Martin Freeman, shame on you for going\nthrough with it. The Hot Fuzz element of the film catches the\nimagination of the viewer until the film just does not improve. Surely\nactors of this fame can't just be cashing in on the public's allegiance\nto the cast? Bizarrely rubbish and not at all rubbish in a funny way.\nMakes Dawn of the Dead look like a blockbuster.\n"
"\n...and do not disappoint. This film is on par with Shaun and Fuzz.\nAlthough certainly different in the characters, Pegg and Frost bring us\ntwo characters completely different from the comedic pairings of Shaun\n&amp; Ed and Angel &amp; Butterman. Seeing Frost play the straight man is a\npleasant surprise. As for the Considine (Steven), Freeman (Oliver), and\nMarsan (Peter), they fit in very well. The writing, subtle in-jokes,\nand foreshadowing that is shown in multiple ways (Gary's opening\nmonologue, the pub signs, things Gary says) provide laughs and make\nthis movie even more worth multiple viewings than it already was. A\nperfect conclusion to the trilogy and worth every penny you spend on it\nto own the trilogy. <br><br>The ending.....a beautiful homage to apocalyptic movies such as Escape\nFrom New York and Mad Max that leaves you cheering and celebrating. The\nonly downside is that this movie is beyond bittersweet. Bitter because\nit's over, sweet because it ended perfectly.\n"
"\nWe all know that Hollywood has some standard movies, so here is another\none. This one is funny but not enough, forced sooooo too much as SF...\nsorry, but I'd skip another like this one next time. The characters are\nweak, the story is even more weak, nothing new under the movies'\nscene... everything was just easy to be foreseen... what a waste of\ntime! Not to say about the low quality of the special effects!!!\nAnyhow, I consider astonishing the difference between the IMDb rate and\nthe quality of the movie :)) I'd say it's at least embarrassing! My\nadvice is not wasting your time with it because is childish, useless as\npoints of view and for sure ... so much overrated!\n"
"\nI am a huge fan of Simon Pegg and Nick Frost movies. I have been\nexcited about this movie for months and when I found out that one of my\nall time favorite actors Martin Freeman was in it too, I could barely\ncontain my excitement! <br><br>I give the movie 2 thumbs up, and I honestly think it was better than\nShaun of the Dead or Hot Fuzz. I love those movies so much, I knew I\nwouldn't be disappointed with The World's End. I was happy to find out\nthat it was better than I could ever imagine. I didn't go 5 minutes\nwithout laughing through the entire movie, from the very beginning to\nthe very end. There is so much comedy, action, excitement and the pure\nrandomness that is to be expected with this type of movie. I am going\nto see it again very soon.\n"
"\nWent to see this film with my little brother and our girlfriend's, we\nall loved Shaun of the dead and hot fuzz, so therefore we were really\nlooking forward to worlds end, but non of us really enjoyed the film\nand all thought we'd just witnessed the worst of the trilogy.<br><br>I found that the film just wasn't that funny, it did have a few good\none liners that made me smile but it didn't have the great stomach\nhurting gags that we on offer in Shaun and hot fuzz (the traditional\ngarden fence joke wasn't even funny, though that can be blamed on the\ntrailers really), to be honest i laughed more at the trailer for 'Grown\nups 2'.<br><br>I will always enjoy the other films in this trilogy and other Pegg,\nFrost films like Paul, but sadly this film won't be going on my DVD\ncollection in the near future.<br><br>Though on the plus side has given me an idea of my next birthday 12\npint pub crawl will be interesting.\n"
"\nSimon Pegg is obviously a talented writer/director and there are some\nexcellent foundations, and many people around his age will empathize\nwith many of the themes in this film. Buried underneath the Hollywood\nproduction style is a funny film. I am not quite sure whether Edgar\nWright is to blame for the ridiculousness that the film descends into\nbut unless you are a fan of constant and ludicrous fighting scenes and\nvacuous characterizations, you will quickly get increasingly bored by\nthis film. The special affects offer a colorful lighting display and I\nguess the plot offers some intrigue. However with such great actors\nlooking totally disgusted by their scripts you must conclude that the\nSimon Pegg Ego show just dominated everything from inception onward and\nthe other actors just gritted their teeth and thought of the money to\nget them through it, before returning to their proper acting careers.\nNobody will watch this film twice.\n"
"\nThis was by far the worst movie ever created in the history of human\nkind. Seeing a 7.1 score on IMDb made me think that the movie would be\nenjoyable but oh my god i was so wrong. It cannot be unseen. After\nseeing this movie I think that I have lost my ability to rate a movie\nbecause everything will seem good when I compare it to this. Now I need\n10 lines of text. I don't want to write 10 lines about this. I just\nwant to forget. Please . Now something to fill the 10 lines. The idea\nof the movie is bad, the action is bad, there is 0 comedy in the movie.\n40 million dollars to create this movie is just like setting it on\nfire. Why would you do that? Better donate to charity. 10 lines.. Cmon.\nThere i did it. Thanks\n"
"\nLet me start off by saying I love \"Shaun of the Dead.\" \"Paul\" was also\nanother good Pegg, Frost picture.<br><br>But, this film isn't very good. It's about as good as \"Hot Fuzz\" which\nwas a major let down coming off \"Shaun of the Dead.\"<br><br>When I say about as good, I mean it's tired. Come on Edgar Wright,\ncan't you come up with anything new? Same old quick transition splices,\nsame old pubs, stuff borrowed off \"Shaun of the Dead\" and done worse. A\nstory borrowed this time off Halloween 3. Pegg looks ridiculous with\nthat black hair. The film is actually boring in parts.<br><br>I wanted to like this film, but I just can't give the crew a pass for\nthis mess and being lazy. About the only thing interesting about the\nfilm is the Very End.<br><br>I'll give it a 4 for the end and some of Pegg and Frost's performance.\n"
"\nI have to say i'd really been looking forward to seeing this film for\nsome time.<br><br>The previous two films were hilarious, this one sadly as hard as they\nwere trying just didn't manage to make me laugh at all. For the first\ntime in a long time i sat in the cinema expecting to be the only person\nnot laughing, i wasn't, it was deathly silent throughout the whole\nfilm.<br><br>On the whole very disappointed, i didn't read any reviews so my\nopinions were not sullied. I've since read a bundle of reviews, where\npeople are raving about how good and funny it was, hence my review\nsummary of Did i just watch the same film as everyone else?\n"
"\nJust can't really figure out if it's the movie that went wrong, or if\nmy humor meter is out of whack.<br><br>I went with a group of my son and his friends -- and they all gave it a\n9.<br><br>So, maybe, it's me. BUT I will say i laugh at just about anything and\nreally liked the other two movies.<br><br>This was just not funny. This is only my opinion so please keep your\ncomments away from my comments. I just always wonder about movies like\nthis: Wasn't there any script doctor involved? Nobody they could run\nthis through? Because there were a lot of conversations going on, and\nnone of them had any funny lines.<br><br>The set-ups were not funny, the movie took a bittersweet, dark turn\nwhich was fine but seemed tacked on. And the whole alien-robot thing?\nJust bad. Unfunny and contrived.<br><br>The ending was tacked on. The fight scenes were well choreographed but\nwent on way too long.<br><br>Just not a whole lot to say positive. Just could have been so much\nbetter.\n"
"\nIf 'Shaun of the Dead' saw Simon Pegg's star rise, 'Hot Fuzz' was the\npeak, then this weak film is surely the decline.<br><br>Yes, it has its moments, and some big names along the for the ride, but\nthis lacks the charm of the two previous films, and therefore all falls\na little bit flat.<br><br>It's rude in places, too sweary in others, and the role reversal\nbetween Pegg and co-star Nick Frost doesn't work for me either.<br><br>Every trilogy has a weak link, this is the weak link here by a long\nway.\n"
"\nThe third movie of the, so called, Cornetto-Trilogy now tackles,\ninstead of Horror or Action, the Sci-Fi-Genre, and with very good\nresults as expected.<br><br>This film also deals with excepting adulthood, which is mirrored in the\nfilmmaking itself, this one feels less energetic and fast paced in\ncomparison to the previous two, which works well, but it's kinda\ndisappointing for me personal...<br><br>The cast is great as always, all the regulars are back and bring their\ncharacters to life expertly.<br><br>The special effects and the look is also great as always, and the bar\nfights are amazing.<br><br>Also the comedy timing is perfect, but that was also clear from the\nget-go...<br><br>All in all a nice end to a great \"Trilogy\"...\n"
"\nThe World's End doesn't know if it's an ensemble R-rated comedy, a\nmiddle-age crisis movie or an action sci fi dystopia movie.....<br><br>and you will be glad it doesn't. The movies sets out to create a weird\nblend of genres and succeeds.<br><br>Some of the disagreement in the user reviews can be explained by\nnoticing that the movie is something of a satire or farce, and what it\ndoes well does not require us to take the characters, tone or plot\nseriously. It uses its monstrous hybrid of genres and tones to\nunseriously bat around a few serious ideas. This rubs some people the\nwrong way. Too bad for them, really.\n"
"\nAs a huge fan of Simon Pegg and Nick Frost and of the other two films\nin the Cornetto trilogy I was really disappointed with this film. I\nknow the other two films are hardly nonfictional, however this was\nunbelievable even for a fiction. The jokes weren't as funny and the\nwhole thing just didn't work. Maybe I would have given this film a 5\nhad it been the first film I had seen in the trilogy... but sadly, that\nwas not the case.<br><br>Despite my love for Simon Pegg and Nick Frost, none of the characters\nin the film are likable. Without feeling some kind of attachment to any\ncharacter it makes the outcome of the film (whatever it is) at best\nunderwhelming and anticlimactic. <br><br>Don't bother watching this film unless you really have nothing better\nto do. You'd be far better off going to the pub yourself.\n"
"\nI Was looking forward to a 4**** film. It was advertised as such in our\nTV guide. Generally that means it should be pretty good and others\nthought so too. Unfortunately not the case for this one, it was\nabsolute rubbish. The initial idea was good enough (and I'm sure a\ngreat story could have been made from it) but was then ruined with the\nappearance of so called aliens trying to take over like so many have in\nthe past. A complete waste of the talented cast in my opinion. I'm sure\nthe good review came off the back of the film \"Paul\". I really enjoyed\nthat film and it was a laugh out loud job. Not this though by a long\nshot, I kid you not. Give it a miss.\n"
