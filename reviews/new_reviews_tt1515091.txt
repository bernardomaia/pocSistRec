this movie was absolutely fantastic
i have been waiting for it for what feels like forever now and it truly did not disappoint
the storyline was clever the dynamic between watson and holmes was charming and beautiful and the effects were incredible
honestly as much of a fan i am of the first movie its sequel surpassed it and my overall expectation
some the effects were unnecessary at times but i really enjoy the style in which these movies are edited
it can be slightly confusing periodically another reason to rewatch still pay attention closely
jude law and robert downey jr
s chemistry was compelling and the supporting actors were on par
i laughed i nearly screamed and i even cried
game of shadows is gripping exciting hilariousand even draws tears
youll be cheering throughout and satisfied with the end
too be honest it is absolutely one of the best movies of this year
talking about sequels more often than not they are disappointment compared to the original
but this team has done again
they brought back the sequel with quality
i enjoyed this film as much as i did in the first part
the action thrill intelligence all are placed perfectly in this film
the screenplay and making pattern is pretty much same as the first part and story moving in good pace
the main characters did a fantastic job once again
holmes and watson chemistry is perfect and delivered a great performance
here i really like the way how the hero and villain play their games both are very clever and the equality was very interesting
simply if you liked the first part just go for this one
this is perfect entertainment and no disappointments
doesnt matter how you look at it this movie is darn good fun
i loved it from opening credits to the close
so what if the acting is a bit over the top so what if there are probably too many explosions and bullets and bombs
the end result is a thoroughly entertaining 2 hours at the movies with popcorn and pearl and dean ads
moriarty is sufficiently creepy and played with restraint holmes is completely over the top but for me if its robert downey jr there are no complaints
the story keeps moving and the action is terrific
the story is loosely based on the last book of the conan doyles first series of holmes stories ending with the famous reisenbach falls in switzerland
it also gives a great image of early 20th century on the brink of the first world war
if you want to enjoy a good story with great imagery and costume then you will enjoy this if you are looking for sherlock  wonderfully called shirley by mycroft  as conan doyle intended then you may be disappointed
not even worth a few lines of review
wasted my budget on this garbage
how can you spoil such a rich collection of characters actorsstory lines or even budget
just a pathetic attempt at
nothing
this is a crime against movie going humanity just because someone has the budget and backing to make a movie for idiots and morons
i wish we could tip the director over the waterfalls just as holmes in the final scene except that he stays there forever
i am so frustrated and feel someone has duped me with a sick sense of humour
wish i had waited and taken the family to see mi next week
want my money back
well i am bit puzzled
what can i say
was the movie well done
yes and no
there are certain weak parts and obvious stronger bits
jude law and robert downey jnr both are great as watson and holmes as well as stephen fry is a very funny microft
but then there are some big mistakes in casting
noomi rapace is the biggest blunder
she was great in the swedish girl who
trilogy but here no
she is weak pale blunt shallow and gray
the only part we remember of her
her eating some food near the eiffel tower
pity that there is no so much rachel mcadamas this time she was great then and good here what else can i say
the movie is well cut and shot it is dark and ominous as intended and some scenes are pure matrixquality
but then there are so many goofs and funny anachronisms that make the whole movie a bit unserious
my opinion
it was ok and fun
a bit too prolonged at times
one of the few films i havent bothered to finish watching
i like an action movie as much as the next guy
mixing it with comedy though  not so much
still couldve been ok
not a huge downey jnr fan though not that believable as an actioneer
but the accent was just brutal and the humour for me just rankled
mightve watched the rest of it if i hadnt skyed something decent
but i had
easily the worst holmes feature ive ever seen  indupitibly so
bring back the holmes of basil rathbone
no bromance with watson in those bampws
and whats with judes watson
the imagination can only stretch so far
please knock this franchise on the head though im sure it made gazillions  look out for laurel and hardy reboot with cruise and crowe
i believe the first sherlock holmes was much closer to the books formula of mystery solved by holmes logic
the second installment is more like an action film
there is more action in this movie but the movie still goes back the original formula when holmes locks his witslogic against the evil professor
the movie is a good mix of humor and action while the storyline keeps the viewer interested
guy richie directs the slow motion action excellently which richie is famously known for
the movie is worth seeing in the theater
it was a good new years eve date
i give sherlock holmes a game of shadows a seven out of ten
i rate this movie with 1 because i expected better movie than its prequel which was a very solid viewing but that is not a reason for this review
i only wanted to point out that it was a serious mistake for holmes to send dr
watson to find or deduce
the assassin in the final moments of the movie
he is trying to find a killer with complicated methods but he only had to consider this  madame simsas brother rene as she is of course is french
the easiest person for him to imitate is also french
it is not easy for him to imitate british or german person because the languages are too different
so only logical deduction would be  french ambassador
probably something holmes would have discovered in notime
or maybe not
too bad that director has tried to make this movie interesting with kungfu skills and slowstop motion instead with cerebral powers of the worlds greatest detective
i wrote my university thesis on sherlock holmes
this is a crock of rubbish
hollywoodized exaggerated unbearable trash
it seems to expect us to believe that holmes is a matrixera neo with superherostyled martial arts abilities
downey could hardly overact more without this film being deemed sheer comedy
indeed that would be what this is were it not so woefully bad
suspension of disbelief anyone
aye
not even worth a free download
one wonders why anyone would pass this script or agree to act in it
it must just be a cynical hope that some money can be made
the first film had at least a slight nod to the brilliant restrained excellence of a tv actor such as jeremy brett in his utterly british ironic and subtle acting of the detective icon
downey and whoever acts holmes hes too 2d for me to care who he issimply dissolve into a pap of loud sfx and rushed stereotypical trash
all that is sloppy with modern hollywood distilled
i give two stars for the waterfall finale with holmes and moiraty that was poignant
sadly undone by a facile ending
i am a sherlock holmes snob
that said i think robert downy jr
is the worst thing that ever happen to holmes right up there with basil rathbone who only did one real holmes story the rest were well i dont know what they were
the best holmes being jeremy brett
holmes didnt like women so he wouldnt be following one around like a dog
he would have never let his good friend dr
watson down nor would he have harmed his wife in anyway
mycroft would never have paraded around his home nude in front of a guest
the list goes on
i had to get up and leave the theater it was so bad
why is it when americans make a holmes movie it is nothing like the story
just follow conan doyles books they are a hit on their own
i will never watch another american made holmes movie again
awful awful awful
the movie is handsomely filmed and has all sorts of clever special effects but the story line was totally incoherent to me
rdjs holmes looks like he has not only shaved in days but he hasnt bathed in days either
jude laws dr
watson looks equally scruffy
didnt anyone shave in the 1890s
theres a lot of bantering between holmes and watson which is entertaining but very little of the deductive reasoning that was the core of every holmes story
and yes in the books holmes did know some sort of asian martial arts but these new movies make him into a martial arts expert an a par with bruce lee
its so incongruous to the rest of the story and the setting as to be very distracting
the character sometimes talks like sherlock but fights like a damn bruce lee shoots like freaking rambo and has a lot of jack sparrow in his humoristic backbone
absurdly nothing like whats in the books
sir arthur conan doyle must be weeping in his grave by now
if you have a contrary view then follow up your disagreement by first reading one of the books
the director seems to have it confused with batman i would not be surprised if he actually had some sort of sherlockbelt along with a baseball bat
the detective role he should play in this movie is replaced by a vicious brawler breaking bones and performing dazzling acrobatic moves
its fun its well edited but it is not sherlock holmes
even if i were to accept the ludicrous ending which offered some obscure bugs as the culprits of the disruption of victorian officials there were still so many plot holes to ignore
in addition the martial arts sequence was too blurry tooclose up to take seriously
we know the actors arent pugilistic experts and it showed
what they should have done was employ long angle shots to convey a sense of majesty and beauty in the martial arts but of course they couldnt because the actors were just not skilled
and the cgi was just so fake
especially that of london the capital city of ancient britannian dynasty and the clock of bing ben
coupled with the lengthy storyline that was so boring this film is a must avoidatallcost
consider yourself warned
waking up early in the morning to catch the first day first show of sherlock holmes because you are a serious guy ritchie fan and have seen all his movies and loved themwell i had some ideas that maybe it wont be good enough and guess what i was right
i was disappointed with guy ritchie and robert downey jr whom people are regarding as an amazing actor well let me just tell you this game of shadows was a complete downer not only because of drifting screenplay and predictable plot but also because of juvenile acting done by our mr holmes here
the script was fine but i sincerely felt the previous movie was way better than this one
only jude law and jared harris saved the day for me throughout this 129 minutes of what they call a movie which actually was a messing up everything sir arthur conan doyle worked on
sometimes one watches a movie and weeps because the story is so strong and compelling that it evokes a cathartic experience
and then there are movies that cause the eyelids to grow heavy and the mind to wander off to slumber land
this movie is in the latter category
sherlock holmes is not a cartoon character yet this movie not only transforms mr
holmes into a cartoon character he is a cross between daffy duck and james bond
not surprisingly the movie provokes some unintended or maybe intended laughter but with a ridiculous story that brings new meaning to the word contrived there is little that can save this movie from dvd land where it belongs
robert downey and jude law give it a try but their efforts are for naught
sometimees the current is just too strong
the story is simply too implausible and the special effects too gratuitous
okay tastes change and maybe the producers are playing to a certain audience
but one thing that does not change is quality and in this respect the movie could have been better
now i have read all the books of sherlock holmes and if you are going to this movie thinking that they have made it from the book then you are wrong and will be disappointed
this movie has as much with the original book of sherlock holmes and moriarty to do as sherlock holmes has to do with the detective colombo
yes they are both detectives and they solve crime but thats about it
many characters in this movie doesnt exist in the original book a lot of the main story of the film dont exist in the book and sherlock holmes dont act like the sherlock holmes in the book would have done
the creator of this movie has not given sherlock holmes the credit that he deserves
this movie doses not deserve to be called sherlock holmes
if this movie had been called something completely else i would have given this movie more stars but since this is called sherlock holmes then i cannot give this movie more stars
because it dont justify to be called sherlock holmes
no no no this is not a sherlock holmes movie
if sherlock holmes was an action hero then this movie would be excellent
but sherlock is not an action hero
he is gifted with an incredible intellect that you virtually see nothing of in this movie
what you see a lot of is running hitting kicking and shooting as well as people who dont die even after being knifed several times and falling 20 meters off a building
falling not only once but three times
well i must admit that this review is based only on the first 60 minutes
i did not want to waist more of my time on this
it was already 60 too many minutes
so dont waist your time on this like i did
this hollywood movie is a disgrace to the intelligent wise intuitive detective sherlock holmes character
instead of being focused on his detective skills it focuses on special effects and violence so much that his character and the shallow plot are minimized
therefore if you enjoy hollywood movies with special effects and violence more than plot then i recommend it
however if that is what you want then why see sherlock holmes
there are hundreds of movies with that emphasis and with even better special effects
if you enjoy a good sherlock holmes detective film with an engaging suspenseful plot then you will be tremendously disappointed
the film is a nauseating mixed up muddy mess from beginning to end
incredibly gimmicky and shallow
nearly unintelligible dialogue
the gimmickry present reminds one of how the works of arthur conan doyle should not be turned into csi batman or james bond
and sadly other recent works within the sherlock franchise fall prey to this evil temptation eg the bbcs recent sherlock series
save your brain
save your money
keep your lunch in your stomach
avoid this film
instead seek out works with jeremy brett
other portrayals by robert downey jr
even by benedict cumbersplatch  smebersmoch  hoobersmich  cumberbatch are rather akin to shallow harlotry in my view
mostly unconvinced
forced
contrived
gimmicky
but jeremy bretts portrays were near perfect
so search for them instead
i was a huge fan of robert downey jr
s performance in the first sherlock holmes and while i was excited to see him again as sherlock on screen i was afraid i would be let down by yet another sequel
however that was not the case at all
sherlock in a game of shadows by far blew away my expectations and surpassed the first movie in my eyes
sherlock is wittier than ever while at the same time more stealthy serious and plays an amazing protagonist to the antagonist professor james moriarty
whether it be an action packed scene funny dialogue or just plain enjoyment i was thoroughly enjoyed and hooked in from start to finish
im glad that im not the only one who thinks that this second movie didnt as good as the first one
from the performance robert downey jr
has did it again with his character as sherlock holmes even dr
john watsons performance by jude law really got a lot of improvement too
but their performance didnt help a lot as the story of this movie got the audiences a little confusing even though i know its quite brilliant to make some twist like that
the other disappointment is noomi rapaces performance which is for me just like a sweetener because of the death of irene adler but shes nowhere for replacing irene adler
overall for me this sequel is a little disappointment but i must appreciate guy ritchies work since he did his best in here so this rating is the best that i can give to this movie
sherlock holmes a game of shadows is not as good as the first film in the series but it does benefit from an interesting villain
dont underestimate how important that is to this kind of movie when you have a hero thats as smart as ol holmes you better have someone that he can match wits with or the whole thing will be a snoozefest as you wait for this lamo to get trounced by the worlds greatest detective
if anything i was disappointed that these adversaries didnt get to share more screen time
the second half is interesting and well crafted enough to keep the audience entertained though so it more than redeems itself for me
its unfortunate that the detective work and mystery play second fiddle to some of the action scenes and humor sequences and i felt that some of the revelations and plot twists were way over the top but overall its enjoyable
i actually feel like im being way too harsh on it i just happened to have really high hopes considering how fresh and intelligent the first installment was
theatrical version on the big screen january 2012
i am not a big fan of sherlock holmes
but i watched films of sherlock holmes
i watched this movie in december of 2011
i like character of robertdowney jr very much
i enjoyed this film as much as i did in the first part
if i was to say something about this movie it would be that it is really good quality
the effects that were used very moving
the costumes and props were also very interesting i still can not over how good it is
this is perfect entertainment and no disappointments
im looking forward series 3 of this film
i can recommend this movie to people wanting to watch something interesting
in general i found this too successful
i could not understand much of robert downeys dialog
his fake english accent seems garbled at times
he lowers his voice and mumbles the words presumably to give the impression of fluency
it is too bad that such an elaborate production was marred by an unintelligible protagonist
this was a problem in the first film that was carried over to the second
surprisingly no one caught it
for some of us that still identify sherlock holmes with basil rathbone the principal actors seemed a bit too silly and glib
it gives the impression that the main characters are simply having fun with the movie instead of taking the acting seriously and making the production believable
depending on amazing special effects and not emphasizing good acting in films is all too common today
directors should direct and actors should act
there is such a thing as allowing top actors too much freedom to improvise
i suppose ill sound like a broken record
i enjoyed this movie but like the first i almost never think of it as a sherlock holmes film
if indiana jones were to be transferred into robert downeys body it wouldnt make any difference
because of the name recognition many entities are capitalizing on the holmes name
making him a quirky indecipherable enigma or making his partner a woman named watson who is of asian descent
these are certainly interesting but so far removed from the holmes mythos that it does nothing for me
this is a wild adventure with lots of twists and turns leading to some really dramatic moments but its also so full of contrivances that i have to suspend so much disbelief
people just know things without the ratiocination that was the whole of the original character
we could use a dose of that in any new holmes incarnation which would really substantiate the character
i really enjoyed this movie from the beginning to the end
a lot of action and i really enjoyed the sherlock holmes character played by robert d jr
a awesome cast and a great story
i was surprised this movie was directed by guy ritchie he did a great job on this one keep them coming
its good to see robert d jr at his best again
the humour in this movie was also very good and made it also the movie that it is
jude law played his character also very well and i was amused by sherlock holmess brother
the costumes and sets looked amazing
i would have loved to see this movie in the cinema but watched it via movie on demand
i definitely recommend this movie to my friends and family and i dont do that quickly
i liked the first sherlock holmes a lot the pace was good the acting too and the chemistry between holmes and watson excellent
quite an arbitrary reinvention of the character but an enjoyable one i appreciated that psychopathic facet of holmes taken to paradox and the injection of fun and action
yet it was still sherlock holmes the genial detective whose logic skills are beyond human
in the second movie one can find all the good ingredients of the first but sherlock holmes now that he has found his match and his nemesis one would expect the main game to be played on the court of cleverness one would want to assist a titanic chess game between the genius of investigation and the genius of crime a sequence of formidable moves and countermoves leading to plot twists one after the other
in truth there is nothing of this lots of speaking of cat and mouse games but no cats no mice and no game
its not even worth to post spoilers
everything is so predictable
the moment i came to know that this movie was gonna be out i was excited to watch it
now the wait is over and this movie has not disappointed any sherlock holmes fans
its an absolute cracker of a movie and some may find it even better than the first one
the dialogues and the flow of the movie is absolutely brilliant
robert downey jr
and jude law
when i see those two together
i wonder whether they are a couple in real life
what a chemistry between these two
they cant show a better bonding in a movie
who needs an actress
robert downey jrs acting
well what can you say
each of his movies is a treat to watch just coz of his acting alone
jared harris
the villain
well it is amazing to see a villain who is as good as a hero
and it is a treat to watch the fight sequences which they create in their minds
dont want to reveal much about it
just go and watch the movie
you wont regret it
reading some reviews i cant understand why some people get so serious about something that is clearly about entertainment and entertaining it certainly is
i enjoyed the whole movie thoroughly and will definitely watch it again
furthermore i particularly liked some of the filming some great camera work going on
for me this is an excellent and highly enjoyable movie
i laughed all the way through and so did the rest of the audience a good sign i suspect dr watson
additionally i really have to say robert downey jr is superb in the role and overall i think it is a must see flick
i hope it leaves you as entertained as i was
enjoy c
well their is not much different from part 1 the main star of sherlock holmes series from my point of view is the directing and photography
the acting of all the movies stars are average but still i didnt like how fast doctor tomson acted like he totally forgot his wife  it was like he was a machine and as soon as the director clicked on a button he totally changed
anyway the story and the act kept a little smile on my face all the time but still i never said wohooo for me sherlok holmes a game of shadows was like a simple dinner which i enjoyed a bit but was not a first class dinner with chicken or meat
i think if they wanna keep this chain running they must produce some real action some speeding in the censes because it was so slow
also i am sure that in the next part ppl will already be bored of the new techniques the director used for the camera
so they really should think hard before making a new part
when my supervisor at dish said that the next sherlock holmes movie was out on dvd i knew i had to watch it
i have been reading the books since i was a child and had always wondered how they would include holmes amazing intellectual insights without using a narrator
they did an amazing job of it
sometimes these amazing leaps of mental agility would be stated plainly or stated as if it were very plain to holmes rather
on other occasions they would actually slow time down and go through step by step what was going through the mind of holmes which was just as good if not better than the former
i would have loved to buy this movie but since i couldnt afford to i rented it with my blockbuster at home subscription
since then i have watched it about three times total now
it is a must see
even if you cant afford to buy it outright you need to see this move
best scenes in it great story line robert downy performed the role excellently
cannot wait for the third one
you have to see it
it is one of the best movies around
do not listen to the other reviewer because it is not a waste of money
excellent work with the speed camera
loved the little hazel scene excellent ending but i wish irene returns in the next one
just putting dots in just to fulfil ten lined rules
the first holmes was well made and hooked us into this travesty
i realize that movie makers think that they have to cater to 14 year olds
were many times that age and we dont need fancy special effects to make the movie enjoyable
the first half was merely a video game with the depth of a trout pond
the second actually came alive with some real dialogue and even a dash of substance like die forelle classical music which madmen have been happy to obsess about since talkies came into being
then the added don giovanni beautifully staged for more musical color
not there is anything wrong with hans zimmers score
that was the highlight of this movie
to have such well tuned actors as law and downey acting more like bugs bunny and mr magoo than the real talents they are is sad
and it will probably only get worse
those of us who enjoy fine acting and a credible plot will simply stop going leaving the audience to an ever attenuating adolescence which is happy with lots of booms and little brilliant dialogue
sad
i have watched this movie 2 times at the first one ive just focused on the main subject the second one was for the details on movie
it was absolutely fantastic i hope that the 3rd one will be on the way soon
by the way the subject choice was better than the first movie because i can truly say that you will have 4 different mood while watching it
jude law is also very successful at playing his role
if you want to go a funny exciting journey with sherlock you should really watch this movie i bet you will understand what i meant  hoping to see next comment will be alright because i dont expect anyone who doesnt like sherlocks interesting life
the new sherlock holmes which had huge boots to fill from the first one had clearly stuck in my mind
action comedy a little mystery it was just brilliant
it brought back the child in me
it had everything you wanted in a film romance great fight scenes a twisting plot and a shocking end big guns witty lines a great theme tune i couldnt stop humming after wards this is the type of movies that should get five stars
i liked stephen fry in the film he was just superb as sherlocks older brother mycroft
people may complain that it is really different from the conan doyle books and that the bbc series is better sherlock holmes is probably in the top five best sherlock holmes movies of all time maybe even number one
worth watching
i must say i was waiting for its release with quite an anxiety but also with some fear didnt want to be disappointed being a sherlock holmes fun and all
however it was even better than the first one
robert d
junior excels as sherlock holmes
also the villain very convincing
you know he will prove to be a worthy adversary from the first scene
fast adventurous funny
a great story nicely put on the big screen
guy ritchie has done it once again
anyone whos seen his movies can see some of his touches in this one as well
also the picturephotography is excellent dark taking you back in time
overall a great job
will watch it again in the future
watching this one you dont make any mistake
the flick contains a great story great acting great action even aboveaverage handtohand combat thanks to downeys individual skills
you hear truly superb dialogues that makes you listen and makes a piece like this so worth while
thanks to the new concept sherlock holmes has become an entertaining mix of wit and action speaking to all audiences
thank you mr downey
rachel mcadams was kinda out of place even in the first movie but that has been resolved in a way well fitting into the story
this is not a spoiler
costumes backgrounds inventions nothing is missing or neglected
looking forward to the third piece
sherlock holmes has always interested me
i saw the first sherlock holmes movie and i really enjoyed it
when i read that this movie was coming out i was really pleased because i liked the first one
im sure you already know the plot so im not going to summarize it but this movie has a great plot and a twist at the end
the last few seconds of the movie really made me excited
i can really see how this movie has a potential for another movie
at some points this movie can be kind of hard to understand but you can put the pieces together and understand the plot
i also really like professor moriartys character a lot
you can tell that watson and holmes are really good friends by their humor and the hard times they give each other
i would suggest this movie to someone else
sir arthur conan doyle is turning over in his grave over this trash
nothing but special effects childish no acting no story line the worst holmes and watson ever  boringdull the lady was about as exciting as a heart attack and the forest scene was the worst ever mycroft was a joke the nude scene was so out of place it was not even funny
i gave it a 1 only because it did not go lower
they should call this movie descent into fx by some 8th grader playing on his computer
many fine actors have played holmes and watson these two gentleman may well be good actors however after viewing this pathetic excuse i am sure that all who have gone before are turning over in their grave at warp speed over this whatever it was
i find that sherlock holmesgame of shadows was an e
m
p
epic
master
performance
but i just feel that somehow they left something behind from the first one
warning the rest of the review contains spoilers
im not sure what it was
the movie had a great scriptamazing actors suspenseful scenes and plenty of twistsmy favorite
the very end was one of my most greater surprises from the movie
i think something that was both a great and yet disappointing element was when sherlock takes some time to plan and we get to see some thing that happens before it actually does
this is great because people might learn from this and its great to see just how intelligent sherlock is
but there is a tradeoff  people can get bored of spoilers and feel the time could have been used for something else
the introduction of new characters was a help to the overall plot an performance
but like i said it still feels like somethings missing
im not sure what it is that keeps me from giving 10 out of 10 stars
this movie was worth every penny i spent on it
i watched it immediately when it was released on the prepremiere on the 16th of december 2011
2 hours and nine minutes just flew by
i couldnt believe it
but whatever
the plot was really well constructed and situations intertwined really smoothly with no rough unnecessary scenes and plot deviations
the humour  very thin light and naughty
full of hilarious and in the same time horrifying deeds of sherlock
the characters fill their positions amazingly well
actually this is the second movie after the devils rejects which is actually better then the first part
i dont want to give details in order not to spoil it
watch it  its going to be worth your time and money
i have no idea why the meta critic score is so low
this film is excellent
the fight scenes were well played out and the relationship between holmes and watson is portrayed by downey and law perfectly
i would like to make a point that i have read all of the sherlock holmes short stories and novels and was extremely entertained
i enjoyed all the references and characters appearances from the short stories and their roles in the film
also the soundtrack for the film is unbelievable
they music keeps you immersed in the film
hans zimmer really out did himself
if youre an avid reader of the holmes novels and short stories you will not be disappointed
i give the movie a 3 because i like downey and law but the plot is so garbaged up with political and social agendas that i couldnt enjoy the movie
just more gayism being shoved on the public
downey should refuse to do another sequel unless another director takes over
its obvious guy gay ritchie the director is using his movies to push his gay lifestyle agenda
i believe that the sherlock holmes franchise could be like the mission impossible franchise but instead of trying to put together good movies they use a good movie to push their social beliefs on the rest of us
i say boycott ritchie and the producers
it was a waste of good acting
downey is a great actor and should take his talents elsewhere
watched sherlock holmes a game of shadows starring robert downey jr
iron man as sherlock holmes  jude lawsky captain as dr
john watson the stunning rachel mcadamsthe notebook as irene adler  eddie marsan mission  impossible iii as inspector lestrade noomi rapacethe girl with dragon tattoo as madame simza heron keilly reillypride amp prejudice as mary watson stephen fryv for vendetta as mycroft holmes and jared harrisextraordinary measuresas prof
james moriarty
i really enjoyed the first sherlock holmes but it was lacking a villain strong is good actor but he is by no means the ultimate baddie which harriss moriarty proved to be more than a match for rdjs holmes which it was a game of shadows the film was brilliant in that aspect moves and counter moves it was a giant giant chess game played on a global scale
amazing music by hans zimmerinceptioncinematography by phillip rousselotlarry crowne costume design by jenny beavanamazing grace and direction by guy ritchierocknrolla truly the best screen adaption of sherlock holmes 910
sherlock holmes in his second outing played by the robert downey jr
who like an old wine is getting better and better with time and his side kick played by charming jude law take on their fiercest adversary professor moriarty played creepily by jared harris
guy ritchie in his second outing gets under the skin of sherlock and his sinister world better than the first time and gives you the show of wit and action that keeps you awed during the whole run time
action scenes like one in the train and one in the jungle are done exceptionally well
the bromance between sherlock and dr
watson holds the movie together overshadowing all female characters what so ever
the story holds many surprises and keeps you engaged till the end
i am going with fantastic 8 out of 10 for sherlock holmes a game of shadows
if you liked first one this one is a bigger treat for eyes ears mind and heart
my respects sent out to guy ritchie and british television
this outstanding movie not only intrigued me to think while watching it gave incredible visuals crazy plot twists and flattering character development did i forget robert downeys insanely clever performance
this movie stands out from a lot of 1800s based films see in this movie it doesnt show the 1800s as a boring depressive age it shows a clever modernizing society that functions outside of the trouble
plus you could watch this movie not caring if it was in the year 3000 or 2013
i think guy chose the 1800s because it was just outside of the age of industrial revolution and it provides an environment where there are more possibilities within the plot and more can be done under the radar so to speak
also the original book series took place in the 1800s anyway
anyway overall id give this movie a 910
i have to say that sherlock holmes a game of shadows was absolutely terrific
it totally blew me away by how great it was
i went to see this on a cold night back in january not expecting much but it ended up delivering
robert downey jr
did an amazing job as sherlock holmes and the way that jude law as watson participated in the plot made him not seem like a sidekick but an equal
jared harris was brilliant as professor moriarty
he is definitely my favorite movie antagonist ever
this film is funny the plot does not drag and it has lots of action and mystery
i love the first movie and this was just as good
this sequel definitely did not suffer the fate of most sequels
it is a rare brilliant sequel that will leave you on the edge of your seat for two amazing hours
with brilliant cinematography great acting an interesting plot a great antagonist and wonderful music this is my favorite movie of all time along with the first movie
i will always feel proud to have this movie in my dvd collection
thats where we are at with this movie rathbone brett are the holmes of old
great actors but now we have another strong group in a well crafted flick
it was entertaining throughout which made up for the little glitches
i read doyle as a child everything in the library before los angeles got over 67 tv channels
i also enjoyed the great rathbone flicks and all of the later productions which were lacking until brett on pbs
the first flick was choppy but it was the fun in spots
they put in work and made this one a sweet ride
they even tied in the most famous scene of all times from the old classics
what i liked most is how they highlighted the social quirks of sherlock and mycroft alike
this movie was the rebirth of holmes
great job
who is the best holmes
this movie is amazing
and i would have given it a 10 rating only if it was the same movie without the sherlock holmes character i mean it is a great action movie but lacks the deduction parts of sherlock holmes i mean if you counted them in this movie they will be less than 4 or 5 deductions
and i didnt expect that from a holmes movie
so i rated it 8 because it is really good full of chases and actions and fights
of course i recommend watching it but i still insist on my opinion that this shouldnt be a holmes movie
the first part of this movie was a far exciting than this one because the deductions were many and amusing
but the effort done in this one is pretty good too
