"\nThe Hobbit is absolutely terrible. Maybe the most uninspired musical\nI've ever seen. Its like they reshot the lord of the rings with a\nveneer of hobbit overlaid on top. <br><br>how many rube goldberg cgi events can you put in one film? Swinging\nbridge jump, swinging giant foot jump, more swinging bridge jumps,\ncollapsing rock jump, etc.<br><br>rabbit powered sleighs, goblin goiters with shakespearian English\naccents, hunky dwarf king, and somehow the 3d model of the giant white\ngod guy from prometheus got a role as an orc.<br><br>the whole time i kept thinking about the marketing meeting that\nresulted in it becoming 3 films, 'why make $1 billion off 1 film when\nwe can make $3 billion off 3 films.' <br><br>the only emotion i had during the entire film was hatred...for Peter\nJackson the soulless nazgul.\n"
"\nThe Lord of the Rings trilogy has always been heavy reading, a very\nsomber story. But The Hobbit is much lighter reading and quite\nhumorous. Consequently, when I saw the movie, I thought I was watching\nan extension of the LOTR movies. Yes, it had a few humorous scenes, but\nthe overall feel of the movie was heavy and somber. And I don't\nremember Radagast having bird dung running down the side of his head in\nthe book. I also felt that the over-the-top gross depiction of the orc\nking was not in keeping with the book. I think that Mr. Jackson missed\nthe mark with this movie. The book was \"fun\", for me the movie wasn't.\nI am so disappointed in this movie, I probably will not purchase it\nwhen it comes out in video.\n"
"\nThis movie is Peter Jackson at his worst. It is King Kong with dwarfs.\nIf you thought Legolas shield surfing and killing oliphants was bad,\nyou haven't seen anything yet. This movie was so bad I was swearing at\nPeter Jackson for the last 45 minutes.<br><br>Here are my top five worst moments:<br><br>5) Rock'em sock'em rock giants<br><br>4) Bilbo goes Rambo on Azog<br><br>3) \"You! What were you doing? You nearly got yourself killed! Did I not\nsay that you would be a burden, that you would not survive in the wild\nand that you have no place amongst us? I've never been so wrong in all\nmy life.\" http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zo-YVqV0v4Q<br><br>2) \"That'll do it\"<br><br>1) Bunny rabbit dog-sled\n"
"\nWARNING, will likely contain spoilers! <br><br>Iam a big fan off this universe and i liked the lord off the rings\nmovies. Don't get me wrong, this movie ain't a 1 out off 10. But it\ndoesn't deserve a 8.5 at all, so i gotto help the rate down. <br><br>Its like they spliced the original lord off the rings with a modern\ntypical Disney movie. The magic is gone and everything is overstated\nfrom the book. I had no problem the with childish scenes, it is a movie\nfor kids. But the atmosphere in the movie feels dull and empty, lines\nare worthy a typical \"want to make money\" film. I don't know what too\nsay, but it usually felt like too much and soulless. And why the super\nfast paste? from this too that, all the time. Liked the beginning\nthough.\n"
"\nI liked the LOTR movies. The first one, I thought was very good and the\nsecond and third were good enough. Nothing spectacular but not junky\neither.<br><br>However, this first installment of The Hobbit movie trilogy is so\nboring...<br><br>Endless scene after scene of characters running, swinging swords,\nshouting, screaming then running and fighting and falling again.<br><br>Who cares? Not much dialogue. Not much story progression. Not much of\nanything. Just 3 hours of really bad CGI and dull, dull characters.<br><br>Just a movie obviously drawn out so it can last 9+ hours over three\ninstallments.<br><br>I didn't care about any of the characters including Gandolf who I\nadored in The Fellowship of The Ring. But, even the brilliant and\nusually interesting Ian McClellan couldn't save this lazily made\nachingly boring mess.<br><br>I don't care if anymore of these movies come out. But I am going to\nread the book over again to recapture the richness and excitement of\nTolkein's wonderful book.\n"
"\nSaw The Hobbit last night and was very disappointed. Having read The\nHobbit &amp; LOTR in the 70's and re-read a couple of times since I really\nenjoyed LOTR because they were as true as possible to the books. In my\nopinion The Hobbit couldn't be further from the book. The book was\nwritten for children. Yes there's battle and violence in the book, but\nnot on the scale of the movie. If anything the movie is darker than the\nthree LOTR movies. The movie also take liberties with the story. I\ndon't remember Thorin's grudge match with the head goblin. It just\nmakes if more violent and darker. LOTR movie came out I looked forward\nto each new one. I have no desire to see the last two Hobbit movies,\neven when they're offered in the local library.\n"
"\nSo I am not the biggest fantasy epic, sword and sorcery fan. I did\nhowever enjoy the Lord of the Rings Trilogy. The huge scale of it was\nimpressive and the story was relatively close to the originals as far\nas I could remember.<br><br>So I rented the Hobbit remembering the fun of the Trolls, the goblin\ncapture, the riddling. All the good stuff.<br><br>What I got was a poorly, poorly crafted piece of crap that was made\nwithout care or quality. Just for laughs and fun.<br><br>I shut this off before even finishing it. It was completely ridiculous.\nessentially it was one long action sequence where all the midgets,\nsorry, little people should have died. I bore little resemblance to the\nbooks and even introduced a new villain that was throughout the movie.\nWTF!<br><br>Apparently the fame went to Peter Jackson's head and now he is pumping\ngout the same trite crap as James Cameron.<br><br>Skip this at all costs. For this movie is truly the death of all Middle\nEarth!\n"
"\nTolkien must be spinning in his grave. This movies bears absolutely no\nresemblance to the book, aside from the names of the characters and the\ngeneral plot.<br><br>There is no character development - everything is just a vehicle for\nthe special effects. The story has been changed... I suppose they\nneeded to to add more growly parts and 3D effects. <br><br>Of course, the technical wizardry is exceptional, but it's nothing we\nhaven't seen before. And, when it comes down to it, it's the story\nthat's the most important part. It's the story and the charming\ncharacters that made the book so popular - I've read it dozens of\ntimes, over the years.<br><br>Bottom line - if you removed all of the growling, you'd trim the movies\ndown to about an hour and a half, at best, and you'd still be no closer\nto understanding the characters and their charm. I can see why they had\nto split the story into 3 parts - just to fit in all of the technical\nwizardry... and, of course, the growling.<br><br>Definitely a disappointment.\n"
"\nI've read a lot of the reviews here and a lot of them have spot on\ninformation. So, I will keep this short and sweet:<br><br>It's terrible. Anyone who grew up reading the books and living in\nTolkien's world would be simply astounded... at how badly they mangled\nthis book into a movie. For all the people out there who have never\nread the books and only see the movies, I feel intense pity and empathy\nfor you because the books and the world created by them are vastly more\nintense and fulfilling than any of the movies portray. It's like trying\nto show the whole universe with 1 small Polaroid picture.<br><br>The LOTR movies were all-in-all pretty good but The Hobbit (Part 1?)\nwas a total disappointment. Parts of the story were completely\ndestroyed, other parts missing altogether and new parts added that\ndidn't need to be there.<br><br>Tolkien is surely rolling in his grave.\n"
"\nAlthough The Hobbit was by far my favorite childhood book, Peter\nJackson managed to turn it into the worst movie that I have ever seen.\nThe movie was devoted only to the journey to the mountain, which did\nnot need to be dragged out for three hours; rereading that portion of\nthe book would have been faster than watching the movie. The Hobbit is\na relatively short book compared to the Lord of the Rings trilogy, so\nthere was no reason to split it into three movies.<br><br>Jackson left out the heart of the book, and instead got lost in the\nscenery and action scenes. If you're the type of person who likes\npicture books, then you'll love this movie. However, if you can\nactually read and are familiar with the elements of a story, then\nyou'll feel like much was missing from this movie.\n"
"\nI have read and re-read the Tolkein books many times over the years. I\nenjoyed the LOTR films, despite numerous niggles, and looked forward to\nthe Hobbit with great anticipation. Unfortunately, it turned out to be\na laboured, tedious mess. It has been severely stretched to make a\ntrilogy and, as happens far too often, the film-makers have arrogantly\ndecided that hey know better than the author and made arbitrary tweaks\nthat lessen the story. With LOTR, I felt that the changes would make no\ndifference for a new-comer to the story and were not enough to spoil it\nfor a confirmed fan like myself. Unfortunately, I cannot say the same\nfor the Hobbit. Both my wife and I persevered through the film and\nended up determined to avoid the second and third films at all costs.\n"
"\nI was intrigued--yet concerned--to see producer Peter Jackson\nresurrecting the same cast of characters some ten years later to work\non The Hobbit. I was even more concerned to behold that Jackson\nintended to stretch The Hobbit out to three overlong films,\nparticularly since Tolkien's original work measures a scant 200 pages\nor so, compared to 1100+ pages for \"Lord of the Rings.\" My concern was\nborne out when I suffered through The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey.\nWhy does Bilbo not even meet Gollum--an episode that occurs early in\nthe book--until the picture is three-fourths over? (Answer: Jackson had\nto inject umpteen largely irrelevant tales from Tolkien's\n\"Silmarillion\" to flesh out the picture, combined with rather\nunimpressive CGI animation (folks, we've seen it all before.) Where is\nthe reasonably exciting, certainly entertaining, episode where the\ndwarfs are captured by the giant spiders? (Answer: I guess we have to\nwait until the sequel--or even the threequel.) This is commercialist\ngreed at its worst. Some may like it, some may not, but Tolkien it's\ndefinitely not!\n"
"\nfar too long, drawn out and boring. I actually got up and walked away\nfor a bit to get some fresh air then came back and watched the rest.\nthe story is from a small book yet they have drawn it out into 3 movies\nat 3 hours each, and the story really suffers as a result. like what\nwere they thinking except money money money. I understand why the Lord\nof the Rings trilogy was well a trilogy, because it is based off 3\nbooks! I am a childhood fan of the books, but I will not waste my time\non the next two movies as they have ruined the whole series in my eyes.\nI am just going to have to pretend this movie didn't exist for my own\nsanity. Please if You are a fan of the books or the lord of the rings\ntrilogy DO NOT waste your time on this poor movie.\n"
"\nI thought this movie was so bad, much like Jackson's King Kong was\nreally bad. It was SO overlong that I sat in the movie theater and\npondered when it would end. I will most certainly NOT see the rest of\nseries. I know that if Jackson had followed the book (with some\nadaptation changes to keep the continuity with LOTR in check, like the\nRivendell sequence) and made a two hour movie adaptation I would be\nvery happy. Considering that the original book wasn't a great\nmasterpiece like LOTR was a single movie would be the best. It seems\nlike that Jackson was SO preoccupied with subplots that he lost his way\nwith the main plot (again like with King Kong). This was simply a bad\noverlong movie made by a now very pretentious film maker.\n"
"\nFirst to say, I'm a true fan of The Lord of the Rings trilogy.<br><br>But for what it offers this movie is way too long and, even for a\nfantasy film, overdone.<br><br>One of overdone scenes: 12 of dwarfs (and a wizard) are so skillful and\nstrong that they are successfully escaping, fighting and killing\nhundreds of goblins in that huge mountain cave while running at full\nspeed over the old wooden bridges full of holes. And finally they are\nfalling hundreds of meters in to the abyss while standing on a piece of\nthe bridge - without a scratch.<br><br>If other two parts will be in the same manner, I'm sorry to say but I\nthink that, after 3 masterpieces, they have decided to make 3\nmastersh..s. After all, that's Hollywood - they simply don't know when\nto stop.\n"
"\nI and some of my family went to see this last weekend and left the\ntheater sorely disappointed. All of us had read The Hobbit during our\nteen years and complained to each other afterward that the movies\ndialog and recreation of events from the book were quite a bit off.<br><br>Not only that, since this was shot in 3D, it contained too many 'roller\ncoaster' action scenes to show this off as well as the seemingly de\nfacto standard of a reliance on CG to help carry a movie. Come on\nHollywood, stop pandering to the lowest common denominator! <br><br>To be fair, if you hadn't read the book and could see past the cheesy\ndialog and physical impossibility in some of the scenes it was OK.\n"
"\nComplete and utter garbage.<br><br>Good --Freeman is the best thing in the film --the stone giants<br><br>Bad --the pacing --The soundtrack is a repeat of LOTR. --several main\ncharacters are pure CGI. --the dwarfs are not individual characters.\n--Thorin is a paste-board cliché. --Bilbo isn't the main character.\n--the pacing --Radagast is portrayed as an imbecile. --rabbits pulling\nsleighs (OMG this was dreadful). --\"I've never been so wrong in all my\nlife.\" --the hedgehog dying. --the giant spiders attacking the hovel,\nthen simply walking away. --the pipeweed joke --did I mention the\npacing? --Bilbo saving Thorin --etc etc\n"
"\n..yes the characters and the settings are good and Lord of the rings\nwas riveting, but this . I am sorry Muppet Show in a big cave ... The\naction scenes are like Tom and Jerry.. come on they are not funny, Tom\nand Jerry is at least funny ..and they are not full of suspense either\nbecause the story is just lacking. and the characters are not\nattractive because they are all hobbits and dwarfs, so why do I need to\nwatch 45 minutes of that. I am not in admiring CGI for the sake of it.\nAnd the opening scene is just way too long..25 minutes for a\nbreakfast??<br><br>As for the story. all this gold we are shown that the dwarfs had..\nwhat's the point if a quarter of the worlds population swims in\nGold..and all it does it attract Dragons? Surely it is as valuable as\niron then. So trying to look past that I was looking forward to a\nsuspenseful film but I could predict almost everything.. and Golem was\nnot as good as last time. The story is just too simple and too drawn\nout. Leave it for your kids under the age of 12.\n"
"\nWasn't impressed, not in the least.<br><br>A waste of my money. Poor acting, lovely scenery, won't be buying the\nDVD.<br><br>Not anywhere near JRR Tolkien's book. Peter Jackson should be ashamed\nof himself. But he won't be. He'll reap the millions. He did great with\nthe Lord of the Rings series.<br><br>But this movie is crap. Poor acting, poor script, poor plot, great\nscenery.<br><br>Jackson deviated big time from the original story line.<br><br>Poetic license? Or just arrogance. I think the latter.<br><br>And the acting by the actors leaves a lot to be desired.<br><br>My advice, give it a miss.\n"
"\nI would like to send a message to Peter and crew: Too much of anything\nis good for nothing. I watched \"the making of Hobbit movie\" in Youtube\nand I noticed people slogging with deadlines on their head, people\nenclosed in rooms working on setting background music, cinematic\neffects etc.. This is not a good/healthy way of creating cinema.<br><br>The movie was good with exceptional shots and sound but it lacked\nconsistency: the fight sequences were rather stretched with \"Age of\nempire style music\", you know, like \"just get done with the fights and\nmove on\" kind of thinking. The CGI was clearly evident, too much of\npixel shading and pretty dented graphic configurations. <br><br>I request the movie makers to be more natural, let the deadlines stay\ndead and work outside the studios to stay in touch with reality and not\nget carried away with too much of imagination and fantasies. <br><br>\"Imagination is a medicine which could turn into poison if taken in\nexcess\".<br><br>Hats off to every low fps part of the movie: exceptional\ncinematography.\n"
"\nI created an Account on IMDb just to Post my Review of this horrible\nmovie.<br><br>This movie was so bad that it prompted me to make the effort to join\nIMDb and write this review.<br><br>Boring. Boring. Boring. I saw the LOTR Trilogy. I expected so much more\nfrom this movie.<br><br>Terrible characters. Terrible Flow. Terrible everything. This movie was\nReprehensible.<br><br>It reminded me of the time that I rented A.I. - Artificial Intelligence\nproduced by Steven Spielberg. AI was a dung pile. I complained to Block\nBuster Video and they agreed. They gave me 3 Free movies for wasting my\ntime.<br><br>This movies dupes you and insults you, by squandering a couple of hours\nof your life.<br><br>I watched this movie on TV right after \"Bigfoot\" which starred Danny\nBonaduce. I expected Mediocrity from Danny. I also got it with The\nHobbit.\n"
"\nOn the whole it wouldn't be bad, but the original story is vanishing in\nthe flood of fight scenes. And it's way too much. Of course I\nunderstand that they want to make three time as much money with 3\nmovies instead of a really good and pure one. In the original story,\nfight is not emphasized at all, only a few page from the novel. On the\nother hand I like the cast and the their acting. No problem with that.\nI hate this, and this is why I gave 1 out of 10. AND I won't watch the\nother two parts, no way! It is very sad, because I like this story very\nmuch, but simply I just can't watch other 6 hours of massive fight in a\nmovie which not supposed to be an action movie!\n"
"\nI saw the 48 frames per second, 3D version and at least in my cinema it\nlooked crap. The 3D looked artificial, the colors were poor, and the\nimage lacked sharpness. And of course it was 3 hours of this.<br><br>Other critiques: Very little humor or cleverness, action sequences were\ntoo over-the-top for my taste, it was too long for the amount of\nmaterial covered, and it didn't have proper end even for a first part\nof a trilogy.<br><br>That said, the acting and special effects (not including 3D) were\nperfectly competent.<br><br>fwiw, I loved the Lord of the Rings trilogy, but this not so much.\n"
"\nThis is not going to be one of those long reviews, consisting of\ndetailed writings about what was good or wrong, that is for you to\ndecide, once it hits the cinemas. All i am saying to you, is that you\nshould definitely find some time and read the book before you go and\nsee the movie. Book is very complex, sometimes hard to keep up with,\nbut has a bit more ambient depth into it, while the movie offers you\nall the eye-candy that even your imagination wouldn't be able to\nconjure. The movie is pretty, well acted and has a good script, that\nsticks to what was in the book, BUT, much less detailed (well, it is a\nmovie, so that's normal). This movie is not enough to understand\neverything behind The Hobbit and the story behind it, but it does give\na nice illustrative try to simplify things.\n"
"\nWatched it last night again, for the first time since it came out and\ncame to the same conclusions: way way way too long and there is way too\nmuch CGI, to the extent it distracts from the story.<br><br>And as much as I adore the (extended versions of) LOTR movies and what\nwas built from the books, I have to say with great regret that Peter\nJackson completely missed the point here: It's a children's story about\nhow a small Hobbit survives all kinds of adventures through his wit and\ncunning. It's not a story about all kinds of LOTR style battles (apart\nfrom the ending of the story, the battle of the 5 armies). They feel\ncompletely out of place here.<br><br>Furthermore, there are many many useless and drawn out scenes: Rivendel\ncomes to mind, and many more.<br><br>I am sad to see this drawn out movie be only the prelude to another 2\nof the same length.<br><br>It could have been so much more powerful in shorter version: right now\nI feeling the pace is lost time and time again.<br><br>Still a 5 out of 10 for effort, but I agree with many of the 1 star\nreviews!\n"
"\nI don't know what is with Hollywood these days. They continue to turn\nout trash for movies or they create these nearly 3 hour movies thinking\nthat longer is better. This movie could have been cut down to just a\nlittle over 2 hours. I did manage to get through the entire movie\nwithout having to get soda refills or bathroom breaks. Most parts of\nthe movie are too long and drawn out. I keep sitting there waiting for\nsomeone else to yell out lets move this along please.<br><br>I will say that the special effects are outstanding as well as the cast\nof this movie. After speaking to a friend about the movie, I was told\nthere are 2 more sequels to this movie. I hope those aren't nearly 3\nhours long either.\n"
"\nI am a huge movie buff and also a huge Lord of the Rings fan. So, when\nI heard that director Peter Jackson was finally directing the Hobbit, I\nimmediately ordered my ticket!I went to see this movie in IMAX which\nmade my viewing experience all the more fun. Everything in this movie\nwas perfect. In my opinion, it followed the book so well. I loved the\nfact that Peter put Thorin's enemy Azog in the film even though his\nname was only mentioned once in the book. This made it all the more\nexciting. I am a huge Gollum fan, so when Bilbo stumbled upon him in\nthe Goblin Tunnels I got goosebumps.It was hilarious when the two took\npart in Riddles in the Dark! All in all, this movie was absolutely\namazing! I'm so excited to go see the second installment The Hobbit:\nThe Desolation of Smaug!\n"
"\nsince this is my first IMDb review, i'll keep it short - this movie is\nsimply bad: too long, too boring, too much CGI, no character\ndevelopment, WAY too many pointless scenes, dialogs, and even pointless\ncharacters and cameo appearances...<br><br>weird mix of (wannabe) epic movie and kids movie... and comedy? oh\nboy...<br><br>maybe i'm being too harsh, but it is weird: it looks exactly the same\nas LOTR (visuals and other ingredients), but leaves very bad taste in\none's mouth.<br><br>i can't remember the last time when i was in such agony: time was\npassing too slowly and i couldn't wait for the movie to end so that i\ncan get away from the movie theater :-/<br><br>it's important to say this: i really really really wanted to like and\nenjoy this movie. so, my review is due to both: movie being really not\ngood + me being very disappointed (i had really high hopes, having LOTR\nin mind).<br><br>so... i hope movie crew will read these 'hate it' reviews and learn\nfrom it and make 2nd and 3rd part better than this one.\n"
"\nAfter being blown away by the beauty, majesty and magic of Jackon's\nLoTR trilogy, I kept waiting and hoping for a fantastic Hobbit movie.\nSadly, not to happen. The best parts of the book, particularly the\nexceptionally humorous bits with the trolls and Beorn get truncated and\neven changed! Same with the addition of an Elf-Dwarf love story?! What\nis up with that, I have to wonder. Still, there are some nice\ninterweaving of threads from The Silmarillion. Also, Tolkien filled The\nHobbit with songs ... where are they here? With the exception of the\nopening at Bilbo's home, the music gets relegated to the closing\ntitles. All in all, most disappointed in this effort, and the final\nchapter in this Hobbit trilogy of films, too.\n"
"\nThe new characters are not as 3 dimensional. I didn't find myself\nreally caring about them. Some of the dwarfs are Muppet-like and goofy\nin how they looked. Too much computer animation, of which was not well\ndone; especially with the forest creators and the main \"bad guy\". They\ntried too hard to stay true to the original characters and in doing so\nsome of them were too \"wooden\" or two dimensional. The humour wasn't\nthe same- it was more silly or ridiculous than fun and purposeful.\nThere were some repeated actions or catch lines from the trilogy. I\nguess I hoped for the same in-depth characters and attention to detail\nand high standards that was in the trilogy. It simply wasn't there in\nthe \"Hobbit\".\n"
"\nThis was too long... way too long. There is no reason to extend the\nmovie to this length. The only reason I could see is that Peter Jackson\ndoesn't have anybody who could say no to him. The pacing drags way too\nmuch in too many places. He tries desperately to add whimsy to this\nmovie. However the slow pace and the hokey characterization really\ncauses a lot of problems.<br><br>Of course, this movie has all the Lord of the Ring grand scale... as\nexpected. That and the fact that the characters are likable and the\nstory watchable means it can't get anything lower than 7 out of 10. I\ncertainly hope Peter Jackson will get a better editor next time who has\nthe guts to say no to him. Let's tighten up the story, Peter.\n"
"\nPeter Jackson turns one of the greatest books of all time in to an\naction movie, consisting primarily of anonymous dwarfs somehow avoiding\ndeath, while being attacked by various enemies including wargs, trolls,\ngoblins, Klingons, zombies, whatever.<br><br>Jackson seems to have lost his love for Tolkien and gone for cheap\nthrills instead. I really can't see any redeeming features other than\nthe performance of Martin Freeman as Bilbo. While the dwarfs look\nphysically distinct (they really don't look or act any differently yo\nthe humans in LoTR), there was zero character development. <br><br>Gandalf does a great job of waiting until the last possible moment to\nuse magic to help the dwarfs get out of precarious situations, which\ncould have helped them avoid the situations in the first place.<br><br>I must admit, I did fall asleep for about 20 minutes but that was\nprobably the only thing that stopped me from walking out. If you\nhaven't read the book, please do so and you'll realize why I'm so\nannoyed.\n"
"\nWhat an enigma this movie is. A great movie will have pages of positive\nreviews and high ratings, with an occasional negative comment here and\nthere if appropriate. The Hobbit, however, has generated comments from\nboth ends of the spectrum, from awesome to awful, and ratings from\n1-10!<br><br>Sadly I must side with the negatives. It may be personal taste, but\nthere was way too much slapstick humour, particularly in the 1st\nquarter, but my main beef was with the physical invulnerability of the\ncharacters. I appreciate this is fantasy and makes for great CGI\nscenes, but it is simply impossibly for flesh and blood humans (well\ndwarfs), to fall hundreds of feet and not get a scratch. Several times\nin the movie the group should have perished to a man/dwarf, but no, not\na bruise amongst them. Fantasy by all means but the utterly impossible,\nno. In my humble opinion this aspect of the movie owes more to Tom and\nJerry an Tolkien. <br><br>A let down to say the least, and the jury's out as to whether I will\nbuy the cinema ticket for the next one, or wait for the video.\n"
"\nThe story was interesting, but the threat of danger became increasingly\ncontrived for all the protagonists. Major disruptions turn out to be\nfairly inconsequential hickups in the quest to walk around to various\nunknown places (we never get to see a map) − part of a larger plan to\nsteal some gold before anyone else does.<br><br>The costumes, lighting, cgi and acting were fantastic.<br><br>The character development of Bilbo consisted of little more than\npondering the question of \"should I have stayed at home and relaxed or\nwas it correct to be a waste of space for these dwarfs?\"<br><br>Fans of this film will invariably use the book to justify the\nunappealing plot developments, but I felt that the film adaptation made\nits own share of contributions towards this film's status as an example\nin the gross overuse of deus ex machina.\n"
"\nI grew up reading and rereading and loving the Hobbit and the Lord of\nthe Rings. I enjoyed Jackson's Trilogy but I think Hobbit has suffered\ngreatly in the translation from book to screen. The scene with Bilbo\nthe burglar-to-be at Bag End and the dwarfs rivals the approach to the\nEnterprise (Star Trek: The Motion Picture, 1979) for being\nunnecessarily interminable. The escape sequence (cave of the Misty\nMountain goblins) is so unrealistic that it becomes a ridiculous\ncaricature of something out of Indiana Jones. To add insult to injury\nit is only part I of III. You've got to be kidding!!! The Hobbit is all\nof about 300 pages versus nearly 1500 pages for the Trilogy. This is\nsimply gross money-mongering at the expense of the audiences. Sorry, I\nlove Tolkien's The Hobbit just not The Hobbit Movie.\n"
"\nYou wait most of your life for the hobbit to come to the big screen. I\nliked the LOTR adaptation a lot, though I do have an issue with PJ's\ncasting and the fact the script was very similar to the animated movie\nof the 80s.<br><br>This movie showcases how a director can destroy a movie by making his\nfirst consideration, how can we make more money. Scenes that look like\nthey should be in a video game. Huge, badly conceived, parts added that\nare not in the book while all the drama and tension of the book is\ntraded for pointless action sequences.<br><br>Amazes me that a director with 3 decent films under his belt decides he\ncan write a more interesting story than an original book which has sold\nover 100,000,000 copies. Give this is miss and pray it gets remade at\nsome time by somebody. Hopefully by somebody who, and I am certain this\nhappened, did not spend a few days trying to work out how he could get\nGandalf riding a transformer, so more toys could be sold for the tie\nins.\n"
"\nWell having watched The Lord Of The Rings trilogy, i was reluctant to\nwatch this movie and i now stand vindicated.<br><br>It is just a boring movie, with no plot and the characters are so fake.\nThe Return Of The King was made in 2003 and their FX were far more\nrealistic than this one.<br><br>The goblins are like characters from the Shrek, and the orcs are so\nfake that you think that you are watching a cartoon. The dwarfs look\nlike characters created on PC and not like real actors and the (few)\nbattle scenes make you wanna cry. When somebody is stabbed, the swords\n\"magically clean themselves\" so there is no blood on their blades.\n"
"\nI loved the original trilogy. But this was so disappointing. I bought\nfor my wife for Xmas. We both were looking forward to watching it. I\nmust have fallen asleep 3 times and each time I woke up I was gutted to\nsee the film was still on. This surely is a cash cow franchise now.\nBoring. Slow. Pointless. The detail/animation/cgi was amazing as you\nwould expect. But it felt like I was being told the story in slow\nmotion. The first 30 mins of the film set the standard. I wanted to\nturn off at this point. I'm so angry I bought and sat through this\nrubbish. Hopefully this review will prevent someone else from\nsuffering!\n"
"\nAfter watching this movie, I just couldn't wait to see the sequel(which\nat the time I didn't know if there was going to be one) and was filled\nwith amazement(the good kind). Even though it was rather dark and\nbrooding, it was actually very interesting in the fact that most of\nthose kind of movies are not very good at all. I liked it also because\nof Martin Freeman who is one of my favorite British actors. It's\nspecial effects where god as well, with the battle scenes, and scenes\nwith giant creatures and stuff. After watching at night was actually\nreally cool because it was kinda scary as far as the \"What's right\noutside my door?\" theory due to the ogres and things. So, if you're\nlooking for a good intense movie that doesn't have any junk in it, this\nis the one.\n"
"\nHad to balance the scale, too much over-rated-ness, which is why I went\nwith 1 star, and because: (1) Characters are gimmicky and NOT\ndeveloped, think Jar Jar Binks.<br><br>(2) Superimposed sentimentality - people may have been able to get away\nwith this in the 1990s but this is the 2010s now, do we really want to\nregress so? The movie did have a 1990s feel.<br><br>(3) A three hour sausage fest. Hundred males of all sizes, creed, and\nbeard lengths occupy the bulk of the film. Too many dicks on the dance\nfloor - this can (and should) be said about most films.<br><br>(4) Shrouded in CGI with stifling after effects. Is this a video game?\n(5) A bore. They take no risks. They bring nothing to the table other\nthan carefully calibrated mush. Did Disney make this?\n"
"\nThe entire movie is just... the party walking 10 feet, fight some orcs,\nparty walking 10 feet, fight some golems, party walking 10 feet, fight\nsome goblins, party walking 10 feet.. fight something else.<br><br>it cannot get more boring then this<br><br>its movie for a bunch of bouncing on the bed going \"AWW COOOOOLL, did\nyou see that guys head get chopped off\" 12 year old.<br><br>thats it.<br><br>don't expect anything else.<br><br>It has been a few years since i watched the other lord of the rings\nmovies but... i remember them having a bit more story.\\<br><br>and the ending... <br><br>somewhat made me throw up a little in my mouth.\n"
"\nLets keep it simple the thing is boring like hell. <br><br>SUMMARY: 1 hour deciding if he is joining in the dwarf quest (although\nwe know he is going ... 4 Pete's sake! The movie has his name) + 2\nhours getting attacked all the time without getting a single scratch!<br><br>This happens when: 1. One bloats a nice simple story into a monster 3x3\ntruck. 2. One wants to amortize previous special effect investments.<br><br>Trust me save money time and .... embarrassment (don't say we didn't\ntell u!).<br><br>I cannot understand the high scores in these reviews though... paid to\nreview or just 5 year old reviewers?\n"
"\nPossible spoilers.<br><br>The pacing is way too slow. The scene where the dwarfs first meets\nBilbo is unnecessarily tedious and dull. <br><br>Spreading the story out over 3 movies has meant there are a lot of\nboring parts to it. This kind of decision makes me very cynical and I'm\nnot even sure if it inspires me to spend money to go see the sequels in\na cinema.<br><br>Oddly enough one of the scenes I do like which other reviews hate are\nthe scenes with Galadriel.<br><br>The image quality also makes it look too much like TV. I'm not 100%\nsure if it is the film rate or the fact it is digital. I can't remember\nRevenge of the Sith suffering this problem.\n"
"\nOK, not a complete miss but it was not what I was led to believe it was\ngoing to be. All day yesterday I was reading reviews on here praising\nthis film as being one of the best of this year, in my opinion this was\nleaning more toward the worst(well not worst more like not living up to\nexpectations). This is far from being on the same level as the LOR\ntrilogy which I am a huge fan of. Im not sure if Peter Jackson was\naiming at a younger target audience for this film but thats how I felt\nthe entire 169 min. If I were him I would have shorten this film up and\nspiced it up with more realistic violence and lost the comic feel to\nall of the fighting. Just wait till you see the goblin king \"fight\"\nSMH. But like I said being a fan I had to see it but I was expecting\nmore...\n"
"\nWhat a perfectly awful movie. Sadly, the folks that put together this\nmess had the opportunity to take one of the greatest tales ever told\nand bring it to life via film. What a failure. First, they changed the\nstory. Second, they left out the best parts and added a bunch of\nnonsense that doesn't fit. Add in some truly dreadful performances,\nscenes that are simply stupid, and you have a terrible film.\n"
"\nOK i'll admit i went to see this film in 3-D when it first came out and\ni had very, very high expectations of the hobbit, i loved LOTR so much\ni probably watched it more than 10 times, i also played the hobbit game\nso had an idea of what was to come, i think it was just too slow for me\nand the story was a bit over the top, a dragon has taken over our\nmountain we must get it back, just leave the damn mountain It just\nlacked what LOTR had, the sequels were better though but none the less\ni think these three films were a good starter for probably the best\ntrilogy i've seen, so if you are like me and are a hard core LOTR fan\ni'd recommend watching it with a bit of caution for first, you might\neven like it a lot more and wonder why i criticized it\n"
"\nI read \"the Lord of the Rings\" including \"the Hobbit\" about 7 times\nbefore Jackson made a very well adaptation of LOTR. Being born in '74 I\nalso witnessed his progress in filmmaking, \"Dead alive\" is still one of\nmy favourites.<br><br>But this? Bloated and pompous, technically well done, but... I went to\nthe cinema and walked out of it half an hour before it ended. It bored\nme to death. Here we have another monster our 14 heroes are running\naway from. And some more orks. And another monster.<br><br>I know it's basically the story, but blowing up a foreplay and origin\nof a real masterpiece to that size?<br><br>8.0 from IMDb users, seriously? I feel no heart in this film, although\nit appeals so hard to the viewer. It's just so superstitious.\n"
"\nThis movie is just horrible. I have seen it many times and don't know\nwhy I bothered to even watch it the first time.<br><br>Unfortunately, this had many dumb scenes and did not compete well as\nthe book, however this made me feel that Peter Jackson was just so\namazed by the achievement which he conjured by the famous good movie \"\nLord of the rings\". So I felt that it was a big let down from the marks\nwhich Lord of the rings came out to be.<br><br>If I had directed the movie I would have made a lot of changes\nespecially adding some entertaining images for when they were walking\nwhich took up approximately 75 percent of this horrible movie.<br><br>Finally, I did not enjoy this movie and many changes would have been\nmade for this movie I were in Peter Jackson's position as director.\n"
"\nI read these books as a kid, many times. I expected to have my heart\nbroken a few times during the movie. And I did - there were a few\nadditions that I found baffling, and a few things left out that I think\nshould have been there. But overall the movie held together, and\ncaptured some of the magic that the book did once upon a time for me. <br><br>I do take umbrage with the fact that they turned it into 3 movies. I\nfind this a bit silly. Maybe, maybe 2 movies, maybe. But they not only\nturned it into 3, but then added material to make it 3 really damn long\nmovies? Bizarre move. And it would be one thing if they just added\nmaterial from the Silmarillion, but they start making up characters and\nevents... I don't know. Just let the source material do its job,\nexecutives. <br><br>Anyway, that aside, it's good. Obviously by the money it's making and\nthe fan base, it will do fine, and hasn't disappointed anyone too\nterribly. Recommend.\n"
"\nAn unexpected Abomination of a classic . If you read the book or not\ndoesn't actually matter because most of this film is asides ,made up\nsub plots, extra characters and other awfulness. Massive shifting of\ncharacters from believable to unrecognisable seems to be the norm here\n.One boring action set piece after another ,actual plot is something\nyou don't even dare dream about. hard to believe this is the man that\nfans demanded to direct the films i think even Michael bay would have\nbeen a better choice and more faithful to the source material. After\nshouting for the hundred time \"when does this happen in the book?\" I\nsuddenly felt a calm descend over me and realised this is not the story\nof a hobbit who goes on a journey and finds his courage this is the\nstory of a great of director who went on a journey and gets seduced by\nmoney churning out awful cash in prequels like this for ever more\n.George Lucas disease strikes again peter Jackson RIP\n"
"\nI \"had to watch the movie last night (I didn't see it yet) because we\nare going to Part 2 today. It's a Christmas Present from my boyfriend's\nparents. <br><br>I absolutely loved LOTR so my expectations were very high, and I got\nvery disappointed. Where LOTR is full of scenes where you can see\nbeautiful surroundings, castles, forests or whatever...the Hobbit (to\nme) has only one pretty scene, and that's when they arrive at\nRivendell.<br><br>The \"fights\" between the Dwarfs/Bilbo/Gandalf and the Orcs, etc were\nnothing more than some pushing and shoving. LOTR already started in the\nfirst movie with an Epic Battle! <br><br>What I am most disappointed about is the fact that the Orcs and other\nevil creatures sound like they came straight from Sesame Street. <br><br>I keep my fingers crossed that part 2 is a bit better, otherwise its a\nwaist of time and money\n"
"\n*Contains Spoilers* The film, of course in personal opinion, was too\nlengthy and dry. Then action, when it happened, was too quick paced and\nunder-choreographed. Additionally the film had (in some places) over\nanimated graphics which looked very phony and ruined any chance at\nrealistic graphics that the movie had. Then when picked up by the giant\nbirds, it is easily noticed how horrid the feather texture was. (In 3D\nanimation, a texture is the image applied to the surface of an object.)\nThen at the ending of the movie it cuts out the battle with Smaug, only\nfor making a sequel, which should have been just put in this movie with\nless of the dry pointless time consumed in the beginning. To tell the\ntruth, if I had watched it in theaters when it first came out, I would\nhave demanded a refund for my ticket because of the ending. But the\ncinematography, besides plot and digital graphics, was rather good.\nJust for that it has 4 stars. BUT NO MORE.\n"
"\nOkay, this movie is plain bad. I'm not saying this because I'm a\nfanboy, even though I am, I'm saying this because it's just bad. What's\nwrong with it? Well, there's a lot of things. I'm going to try to\nexpress what is wrong with this movie without spoiling it. 1:There\nshould only be ONE movie, not three. I say this because The Hobbit\nisn't that long of a book. My copy is 306 pages. I know that Peter\nJackson used material from Tolkien's notes, but that is the kind of\nthing that should only be in an extended edition. But, instead it makes\nup the almost the whole movie. The general plot of the movie is the\nsame as the book. There just isn't enough material to make three\nmovies. 2:This movie is too long. This movie is so long and stretched\nout that it makes it hard to watch. This movie didn't need to be 3\nhours long especially because nothing happens except for Bilbo leaves,\nhe finds the ring, and they all fight goblins. There are problems\nbeyond this, but if you want to really know them, see the movie. I\nrecommend this movie only to hardcore fans of the series.\n"
"\nIts taken me just under a week to finish watching this on and off Meh! <br><br>Lots of running around in the mountains, and getting attacked by ugly\ncreatures... not my cup tea to be honest! <br><br>Visually, the movie was stunning, but in my opinion was just a cash cow\nattempt to re-create the glory days of Lord Of The Rings<br><br>Where was the intriguing story? Fair enough you had Bilbo and golum\ngiving each other riddles under the mountain, and Bilbo escaping by\nmeans of accidentally putting on the ring, which made him invisible...\nbut other than it being a prequel to LOTF the story again in my opinion\nwas very flat.... bunch of dwarfs loose there home because of a gold\nhungry dragon - later generations of dwarfs run around trying to\nre-claim their home...<br><br>The conclusion...a butterfly whispered to by a wizard went to notify a\nbig pack of huge eagles to rescue the party from burning tree tops -\npretty much how the movie ended!\n"
"\nThe Hobbit is an enjoyable enough movie, although it's too long. This\nis a children's book, it doesn't need endless LOTR tie-ins and the\nother additional material. This movie suffers from Peter Jackson's self\nindulgence, and the simple story is almost lost in the scramble for\ntie- ins, back-stories, marketable action figures and a sense of\nsweeping grandeur.<br><br>I shudder to think what the extended edition on DVD will be like (and\nwe all know there is one to come.) <br><br>On the upside, there are some funny moments with the dwarfs descending\non Bilbo Baggins' house and the interactions of a number of characters.<br><br>I gave it 6 - but would love Peter J to lift his game and just tell the\nstory.\n"
"\nOverly long with nothing much happening for long periods. The pace of\nthe film was pedantic at best and I found myself losing interest quite\neasily. When the action parts started they were very good and\nentertaining its just the bits in between that had me nodding off. I\ngave it 5 / 10 but the action parts are good so 8 /10 for the action\nparts alone. The overall 5 / 10 is because it was slow in telling the\nstory . Like Avatar I was expecting great things and came out of the\ncinema in a so so frame of mind but were Avatar copied the core in\nregard to unobtainium and had the ending like the Lion King and circle\nof life and all that, this film has at least left me optimistic about\nthe sequel.\n"
"\nAs a massive fan of the Lord of the Rings saga and reader of all the\nbooks I must say I was very disappointed with this new film. Lacks all\nthe good stuff that made the book one of my favourites back when i was\na teenager and hinders all Peter Jackson's good work in the previous\nfilms. It looks to me more as a film for Twilight fans than anything\nelse: plain, childish and overall predictable in gags and action.\nShame. I'm pretty sure Tolkien would have not enjoyed the adaptation\nthis time. Let's see what happens with the next two films though my\nexpectations are already quite low and I still don't understand the\nneed of exploiting one book into a new trilogy. Marketing versus\nquality?\n"
"\nI don't know if it's more a commentary on the United States or Peter\nJackson. This was the most disgusting, vile, shameful, disappointing,\ndrivel I have wasted 2 hours trying twice now to watch.<br><br>Peter Jackson puts together some amazing visuals. This is why I gave it\na 2 instead of 1 star. Now just team him up with a random 12 year old\nto write the script, and the result is guaranteed to be be 100X better\nthan this garbage. Where is Jar Jar Binks? How did his part get cleaved\nfrom this masterpiece.<br><br>The only positive result from this movie is that I'm inclined to\nre-read The Hobbit, as it's been 10 years or more. Just so I can see\nhow horrifically this junior high school student with millions of\ndollars has mauled the story. <br><br>I nearly vomited during the initial dwarven reverie in Bilbo's house.\nAre you kidding me? Are we 7 years old? Does Jackson get this garbage\nshoved down his throat by execs, or is this his actual incarnation? God\nsave the queen.<br><br>I am ashamed to be American and/or human.\n"
"\nIn one of the 'Making of...\" interviews for Lord of the Rings, Peter\nJackson pointed out that \"this movie really needs to be made by someone\nwho understands special effects, otherwise the special effects can\neasily overwhelm the story\" (I'm paraphrasing), and then did exactly\nthat in the Hobbit. In the Lord of the Rings, Tolkien's tale ruled\nsupreme and the special effects were in their proper place. In this\none, Tolkien's story is revised and pushed aside by the special\neffects. In Lord of the Rings, live actors are used as much as possible\n(even with Gollum) whereas in this one, computer graphics seem to be\npreferred. I think the introduction of a new character as the main\nantagonist is especially heavy-handed. To Peter's credit, it was\nprobably a doomed project from the first. Lord of the Rings was a\npseudo-sequel to the Hobbit and the 2 books are entirely different in\ncharacter. The Lord of the Rings is a dark, dramatic adult epic. The\nHobbit was a whimsical child's fairytale. But the screen won't have it.\n"
"\n- Oh, should I've told you, that we got giant fkin birds? - No problem\nat all, not that we were almost get killed like a dozen times.<br><br>I'm really all for fantasy, but when the plot cannot reach the level of\na kid cartoon that's really a nonsense. The only difference between\nthis and a bad action movie is that Chuck Norris is now a wizard and\ncalled Gandalf.<br><br>- What's the plan Gandalf? - We walk, fight, walk, run, fight, walk,\nrun - if there's a problem then magic. - What if the magic won't work?\n- Miracles my friend, miracles.<br><br>If you liked the LOTR trilogy, avoid this, if you care about common\nsense, avoid this.\n"
"\nI was truly disappointed by this movie, although I could have seen it\ncoming based on the decision to split up this (short) story in tree\n3-hour movies. SLOW is the word to describe the first half (although\n\"very childish\" also comes to mind, especially comparing to the LOTR\nmovies). The second half is just too much 3D action-overkill without\nany storyline whatsoever. There is really NO excitement in the movie at\nall, but maybe this is because you truly do not connect with the main\ncharacters (except maybe for Thorin). I was really hoping for Bilbo to\nget slaughtered brutelessly by one of the Nazgul after the first half\nour (although fair to say his acting did improve a bit later on in the\nmovie). anyway sorry but the current 8,4 rating is really not\njustified!\n"
"\nAfter Lord of the Rings I expected something much better. The first\nhour seems like never ending. Than, a bit of action here and there but\nnothing special. I saw it in 3D as a lady in the cinema told us it\nwould be better - well, my opinion is that 2D would have been better.\nThere were whole 10min in the 2h50min worth seeing in 3D - flying\neagles an flying butterfly. Titanic movie with Leonardo DiCaprio is\nmore exiting than The Hobbit. There's a lot of walking and walking and\nrunning and running in this movie. I honestly think that the movie\ncould have been cut to a shorter version.<br><br>In my opinion, the ratings here are way too high for this movie.\n"
"\nThe Hobbit is truly horrible. It has zero good dialog, zero decent\nwriting, nothing interesting or worthy of a Tolkien book whatsoever.<br><br>I found myself wanting to leave but I was with a group of people.<br><br>It seemed like one long action sequence over and over and over again.\nHORRID! Even 14 year old boys could be bored by this.<br><br>Definitely doesn't live up to the standards of the previous Lord of the\nRings Trilogy -- and even those were fairly tedious.<br><br>Unless you like stupid action movies with no intrigue or character\ndevelopment avoid this at all costs. It's 3 hours you'll never get\nback.\n"
"\nThe graphics are great, but...<br><br>The book is originally well written and a wonderful story, but\nobviously modern film industry had to milk as much money out of it as\npossible. All the morale is gone, and it's just made into an action\nmovie with lots of clobbering - again and again and again. Lots of\nscenes are written into the movie that weren't in the book, and mostly\nthey're just clobbering scenes, with the persons surviving totally\nimprobable situations where they couldn't survive (and the book is not\nlike that). Practically a Tom &amp; Jerry movie. Tom &amp; Jerry are fine, but\nmixing their genre with Tolkien is just stupid and awkward. The movie\nis 3 hour long, and they'll make 3 such movies, 9 hours out of this\nlittle book, good grief. It would be 1 fine 2-3 hour movie. This is\nvery sad, because as I said, it's a great story. Also, because I like\nadventure movies. It's just sad.\n"
"\nUnderwhelmed in 9/10 ways... It's all been intelligently and\npassionately stated by those more credible and insightful than myself.<br><br>Though a work of magical fiction, the movie felt like a bad cartoon,\nunsuitable for a child's appreciation and stinking up the room for an\n\"old\" Hobbit fan....<br><br>Awful treatment of such an meaningful story!<br><br>The absolute worst aspects had to do with the reliance on bathroom\nhumor, gratuitous pot-smoking/mushroom-eating japes, contemporary\nlanguage gag lines, sagging dialog and the ridiculous hi-speed rabbit\nsled (oh, how I found myself wishing a Warg would snap up his\nguano-festooned head as he lead them in an ever-tightening circle\naround the anxious band on the run... and this is the \"Run, I'll\ndistract them and lead them away\", part....huh?). I wont even comment\n(ok, go on and on) about the Goblin King and his whole thing...just\nawful!<br><br>I will not line up for round 2 and 3....perhaps I will wait for the\nbooks...gotta be better!\n"
"\nMy friends and I go to the Cinema almost every week , all 3 loved LotR,\nall 3 thought this movie was a waste of time , literally a waste of\ntime on account of the first hour , nothing happening at all. We\nwatched it in 48fps 3D, maybe that was the mistake, never had the\nfeeling we were watching a movie , more like the making of. The worst\npart imho were the attempts at humor , all the clichés you could think\nof and brought in a very bad way.<br><br>I'm not gonna say this was a bad movie , if they had brought it down to\n2 hours it would have been a reasonable movie, but it doesn't even come\nclose to LotR. Maybe expectations were to high , but Jackson really let\nus down.\n"
"\n8.5?! 94th on the top 250 movies of ALL TIME?! I found myself bored\nhalf ways through. I LOVE the Lord of the Rings trilogy and will be\nhaving a LOTR marathon for the first 3 again soon but 'The Hobbit' was\nslowww, carried out way to long, the acting was cheesy and corny and\nthough the creators attempted to put in lots of 'action' scenes and\nbattles, each one absolutely failed to capture my excitement and keep\nme on the edge of my seat as in the first 3 movies of the trilogy.\nEvery skirmish ended with a victory far to easily won. It was as if\nthis movie was made for a younger audience with the corny acting and PG\nbattles..compared to the raw emotion and excitement and action of the\nfirst 3.<br><br>Bored, and not excited for the next 2...Will keep my original LOTR\nseries as an all time great but will not buy this..\n"
"\nExcellent. This is the first fantastic film I've ever watched. I\nhaven't watched Lord of the Rings. Okay okay, don't hit me! Yes, I\nhaven't watched but neither I nor my friends have watched.this shame\nisn't only for me. (I have friends to be shown with fingers of a hand\nBTW. I have a few friends.) Some people say \"Lord of the Rings should\nbe watched before The Hobbit!\" I don't agree with them. The Hobbit\ncomes before, I mean this all thing starts at The Hobbit. The Hobbit is\nbefore. If you watch The Hobbit before Lord of the Rings, you'll\nunderstand better. I love Martin Freeman. I love the film series. After\nI write this review, I'm gonna watch The Desolation of Smaug.\n"
"\nIf you are a fan of the book avoid the movie.<br><br>If you are not a fan or have never heard of it avoid the movie.<br><br>The distortion, the graphics that bring on migraines.... tragically\nbad.<br><br>Dramatic scenes were enhanced which destroyed the drama and made the\nresult cartoonish.<br><br>Great actors were forced into lousy scenes, and of course we had to\nhave sexual tension between a dwarf and an elf.\n"
"\nThe CGI is great in this movie. The problem is in some cases they are\nnot very believable. The dwarfs fall several stories in one scene, if\nit had been in real life the characters would have all died, yet not\none of them even got a broken arm or leg. In several scenes the dwarfs\nare near death and most surely going to die and bam all of the sudden\nthey are fighting back and winning against all odds. Many of the\nspecial effects are way beyond belief to actually be able to happen. I\nknow this is a fantasy but they need to scale back the CGI a little. I\nkept saying to myself WOW this looks great but its unrealistic. Other\nmovies with CGI are doing the same thing. How about less CGI and more\nacting with emotions. This is why this movie did not win an Oscar. At\nleast the CGI was very detailed and life like. Yes spend the money to\nmake the special effects as great as possible but in a realistic\npossible way. I saw the movie as special effect scene after special\neffect scene with some actors acting edited between them. I still like\nthe movie but it could have been much better.\n"
"\nIn this movie a wizard, Gandalf the gray asks a hobbit, Bilbo to join\nhim in an adventure. Bilbo refuses, so Gandalf marks a symbol on\nBilbo's door. Later in evening, many dwarfs and Gandalf gathered in his\nhome for a group meeting. I think this is a perfect movie for 'Lord Of\nThe Rings' movie fans. It is a must watch movie for all.\n"
"\nThe teaser trailer for this movie was the first time I was introduced\nto the magical world that J.R.R Tolkien created. I had very high hopes\nfor it, and it exceeded my expectations. Nothing can compare to Peter\nJackson's LOTR trilogy, but there are many things people don't\nunderstand about this film. The story does a fantastic job of capturing\nwhat the book was about. The visual effects were some of the best I had\never seen, especially Gollum and the trolls. The only reason I will not\ngive this a perfect 10 is the fact that some LOTR characters were\npushed into the movie. Overall, this is a visually stunning, fun, and\ngreat prequel to the Lord of the Rings...\n"
"\nwell i have better things to do than watching ill-path series of\nhobbit. \"O yes my precious.. they really have made me ill after\nwatching this not so called epic adventure..\" well its not epic ..\npaths of this movie resemble to the modern day film...the whole cast\nlook so desperate to get out of this series as soon as possible... well\ni still love watching lord of the rings trilogy. at least tat series\nhave emotions in each part... <br><br>Thumbs down for this one<br><br>really waiting for an epic adventure like the lord of the rings .. have\na gud day\n"
"\nI think after seeing Peter Jackson before anyone else, it was no\nsurprise that by the end of the movie, I was without any fingers and\ntoes left of how many mistakes there were from the book. The next movie\nwill be titled; The hobbit, Peter Jackson's climb to power, or my\ndelusions of grandeur as big as Saruman's.<br><br>Example: how the troop meets Beorn how the troop enters Laketown how\nthe troop meets the spiders how Thorin is not enchanted by the elves\nand the lights go out how Bilbo sees the butterflies but can't see the\nend of the forest how Bilbo gets to have his song about the spiders,\netc., etc., etc.<br><br>Please don't take my favorite books and turn them into a shot in the\ndark. The Lord of the Ring movies were so close to the books, don't\nmess up The hobbit movies just because you have the rights to the\nstories. Shame on you Peter.\n"
"\nI do not think this contains a spoiler, but it is debatable, because I\ndescribe an aspect of how it ends. But it is an aspect that I wanted to\nknow before gong to see it.<br><br>This review is mainly to point out one issue that bothered me a lot,\nand I hope it does not becomes a trend. The movie is half of an\nepisode, half of a story.<br><br>Many movies can have sequels, and the story can continue, but it is\nmatter of respect to the audience to provide a full episode, not half\nof it, like this one.<br><br>I think the producers and director pick the wrong place to end the\nmovie.<br><br>This is commented very superficially in the reviews, but I came out of\nthe movie wishing for my money back because of this.<br><br>Imagine that the first 'Rocky' movie ended just as they were starting\nthe main redeeming fight... <br><br>Rodrigo Alonso\n"
"\nNot that my childhood memories of here are tarnished but I was slightly\ndisappointed. However is it book to film we're judging? If not, should\nwe compare it to LOTR or a CGI fest of late? McKellen turned in a\nsterling performance again but became Gandalf the irrational. Freeman\nas Bilbo came to life at home adequately. Radagast, a Lunatic Tramp was\nfunny. Elrond &amp; Rivendell were too short stayed to interest.<br><br>I did smile at the Gollum scene &amp; the mines are where the action kicked\nin but got ruined by Helter-Skelter &amp; Gandalf's sudden appearance was\nas out of key as the arboreal dominoes &amp; late spell. You wouldn't like\nany of them hurt bless but they all constantly Death cheated.<br><br>Credit to Jackson for atmospheric scenery &amp; captivating score but I\nfeel almost hustled by or on Tolkien's account as despite the coming\nsequels it's slow, slapstick &amp; lacks enough attention paid to character\nintroduction. It went wrong move for humour &amp; CGI. But it's if you\nstill enjoy the film or not &amp; I did. Rating: Sentimental 6.\n"
"\nIt's unclear why Jackson started things off the way he did, because it\nended up with the result: An Unexpected Journey is the worst of the six\nLord of the Rings/Hobbit films. I only like one part of the first\ninstalment, an Unexpected Journey, and that part is the first fifteen\nor so minutes of the film, before the Journey begins. I despise its use\nof over-the-top uncalled for CGI and effects - they're tolerable in the\nother two films because I find them to be better than the first one.<br><br>An Unexpected Journey is rather uninteresting and a little too bright\nin comparison to Lord of the Rings or the two sequels to the Hobbit. I\nadmire Freeman's acting, though, and it inspires me. Martin Freeman is\na fantastic actor and he truly deserved to play the part of Bilbo since\nhe does it so well. And I guess I still like Jackson as a director\nsince he done the latter which was very good. The Battle of the Five\nArmies was pretty good, too. An Unexpected Journey is by far the least\ninteresting of the three. <br><br>5/10.\n"
"\nFirstly, for this to be an 8 is the worst form of fanboyism as even if\nyou're a rabid Peter Jackson/Tolkien fan you must surely be able to\ndistinguish between the LOTR trilogy and the disjointed saga that this\nmovie turned out to be. I'd also like to agree with the poster who\nstated that this was a film trying to cater for two distinct audiences\n(very young kids/not very discerning adults) as this really nails one\nof the major faults of the film. But anyway...<br><br>I was fortunate enough not to see this in a movie theatre and this\nallowed me to fast forward through all the unnecessary 'filler' (e.g.\nThe mountain giants/ the awful goblin city/ the whole evil Orc arc\netc.). I can only imagine that it's been split to make as much cash as\npossible but I don't really understand why Jackson would want to do\nthis (it's not as though he needs the money).<br><br>Given that it was such a beloved book from my childhood and that I so\nreally enjoyed the LOTR I really feel that they missed a trick here. <br><br>Horribly disappointed :-(\n"
"\nReally sad that Peter Jackson isn't more creative. He basically ruined\na perfectly good story by making Gandalf the hero. Bilbo is the actual\nhero here, but every time he gets into a situation Gandalf magically\nappears. To many added fight scenes and extra story lines with\ncharacters that weren't even in the book. Just another over done movie.\nI was really sad I spent all that money and time to see it in the\ntheater. If your a true Hobbit fan this movie will disappoint. Aside\nfrom the horrible lack of creativity the adventure is fun. The graphics\nare good. Gollum is awesome, and I was stoked about the Bilbo/Gollum\nscene. That was one star worth. The rest of the movie is over done. I\nthink Jackson forgot that this is a child's story. The culture today is\nabout shoot them and kill them, so if that is what you are into then\nthis movie is for you. Enjoy I on the other hand will not see the\nsecond installment. Overpriced poorly done story telling. Sad he ruined\na Tolkien story probably why he never wanted his books sold out to\nHollywood to begin with.\n"
"\nThe Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey<br><br>The best thing about returning to Middle-earth is that you can call\nlittle people dwarfs and not get sued for it.<br><br>But you will be required to join a harrowing campaign similar to the\none in this Fantasy/Adventure.<br><br>Gandalf the Grey (Ian McKellen) tricks the lissome hobbit Bilbo (Martin\nFreeman) into helping nomadic dwarfs - led by their displaced ruler\n(Richard Armitage) - reclaim the Lonely Mountain from an avarice\ndragon.<br><br>Before they can get to the scaly usurper, they must first contend with\ntrolls, giants, elves, goblins, Orcs, a Necromancer, Gollum (Andy\nSerkis) and the White Council (Christopher Lee, Hugo Weaving, Cate\nBlanchett).<br><br>An ocular feast featuring new and familiar faces, this pulse-pounding\nLord of the Rings prequel may be jocular but it's as high a caliber an\nadventure as its successor.<br><br>Incidentally, the upside to traveling with hirsute dwarfs is they never\nborrow your voltage converter for their electric shavers.<br><br>Green Light<br><br>vidiotreviews.blogspot.com\n"
"\nCompared to LOTR this is a major disappointment. As one who bought LOTR\non blu-ray in their extended editions because of the magnificent\nquality of the films it is hard for me to accept such a follow-up\neffort. The decision to stretch this to 3 films has ruined it. The\nstory plods, with nothing more than one action sequence after another\ntying it together. Unfortunately the action sequences are utterly\nunbelievable with hardly a scratch to show for a battle with thousands\nor a fall that should kill. There is a line to be drawn between fantasy\nand a lack of reality and it has not been drawn at all here. The CGI is\nobviously CGI in many places too which I found frankly puzzling given\nhow well it blended in on LOTR. Doubtless when all 3 films have been\nreleased they will again release an even more pointless extended\nedition. I earnestly hope some enterprising soul edits these down to\nthe one film it should have been all along. It can only be better.\n"
"\nThe Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit films are, quite frankly, the\ngreatest films of all-time. Nothing has surpassed them, and I do not\nsuspect anything soon will. The world it is set in is so rich, so\nunique, and so beautiful that you will often find yourself marveling at\nthe sheer wonder of it all. The set and the locations are incredible,\nand absolutely gorgeous. The characters and writing are superb, and\nthey are translated to screen wonderfully. They are all exactly how I\nimagined them while reading the books. The special effects are the best\nI have ever seen. The action scenes are amazing, but the films does\nincredible even when it is just people talking. Overall, they are the\ngreatest films I have ever seen, and anyone who has yet to watch them\nneeds to do so immediately.\n"
"\nThere are very few movie that are better then The lord of the rings\nmovies. This is one of then. All the middle earth movies are great.\nThis movie as a great story line. Great acting. Great special effects.\nGreat visual effects. C.a.d.i.n.a.s need to see more good fantasy\nmovie. And stop carrying so mush about silly childish things like\nhockey. Great movie great movie great movie great movie. See it see it\nsee it see it. It is very scary. It has a lot action. See it see it see\nit see it see it. Great movie great movie great movie great movie. One\nof the beast prequels ever. A fantasy masterpiece. See it see it see\nsee it see it see it. Peter Jackson is one of the beast directors.\n"
"\nThe first time I heard about the release of the first film of the\nHobbit trilogy, at first I know that this is the prequel to the Lord of\nthe Rings trilogy. At the moment that I first watched this movie, I was\nreally amazed on the direction and acting style of the actors\nespecially to Martin Freeman. Martin Freeman was really appropriate for\nthe role as Bilbo Baggins showing his profound sense of the personality\nof a Baggins and at the same time a Took.<br><br>Recently, I read the Revised Edition of The Hobbit Novel. Yes, most of\nthe events mentioned in the book happened in the film. The tough\nexplanation of Bilbo and the company's escape from the Misty Mountains\nwas one proof.<br><br>Lastly,the excellent and professional riddles that were mentioned both\nin the book and the film were surprisingly amazing. This film is one of\nthe best films I've seen in my entire life. Amazing direction by Peter\nJackson.\n"
"\nPadding. Padding padding padding.<br><br>This was very thin. There are arguments for and against literal\ninterpretations of popular classics, and this is against.Nothing\nhappens for almost two hours, and then, when it does, you don't really\ncare. I like Martin Freeman, even in the awful (nay sacrilegious\nHitchhikers) but I wouldn't chose to spend this much time in his\ncompany without a drink - a fate not suffered by any of the crew.<br><br>The original LOTR is approx. 1000 pages over 3 movies. The original\nHobbit is approx. 400. The LOTR covers the destruction of an evil\nempire and hordes of hundreds of thousands of distorted man forms to\nrecover the purity of Middle Earth from a messianic overlord.<br><br>The Hobbit effectively covers exterminating a rogue frog.<br><br>Padding! Enjoy.\n"
"\nThis is not 2001 anymore. Lot has been changed. Yet this movie remains\nthe same. &gt; In this movie no major villain die :( &gt; In this movie\nnobody achieve nothing &gt; And the worst part is when some one is about\nto die or slain, there comes help immediately bullshit... not a second\nearlier ,or a second later. &gt; They have eagles but they won't ride them\nat the first time or whole the distance because then they will not face\nany trouble :P &gt; Director always focus the elvish sword ... yet he do\nnot put it in real use in the movie... &gt; And so on<br><br>Actually I did not like this movie.... I lost my valuable time watching\nthis movie :( I Could Have Been Like It If It Was Made 10-15 Years Ago\n.\n"
"\nSummarizing my thoughts on the movie (may contain SPOILERS): Seeing the\n\"An Unexpected Journey\" made me realize that they should have sticked\nwith the two movie plan. Three parts is one too much and it probably\nmakes the pacing of each part a bit of a dire. Too many things which do\nnot happen in the book, but are only there to make an arch to the LOTR.\nOne can always whine afterward, but in my opinion LOTR could have been\nfour parts long (last movie too quickly!), while two would have been\nenough for the Hobbit.<br><br>48fps took some time for my eyes to settle in, since for example Bilbo\nwalking in his home looked a bit paced. They should really think about\ncamera angles and especially distances when shooting a fast-pace action\nscenes. It was hard to see what was really going on in the first action\nscenes since they were shot too close and cut in a very distracting\nway.<br><br>Acting and sceneries were very beautiful and heart-warming, and\nprobably the best thing in the movie.\n"
"\nThe movie is a bit disappointing. This split in 3 parts seems like a\nbig commercial thing. The rhythm get slower because of this, and the\nmovie which is good looses interest. Also, trolls are not very well\nmade, they look like a joke whereas they where really bad asses in the\nbook. Compared to the lord of the ring, we do not really get into the\ncharacters, they seems very simple and lots of first degree jokes about\nall the dwarfs makes it silly. What i did however like : the\nintroduction of golum, real nice and scary ! Best in the movie. I think\nthat this book deserved better and that peter jackson has a bit lowered\nhis standards after the success of the previous movies. Bouh !\n"
"\nI went to see the Hobbit with not much expectation of seeing Great\nStory. I already knew that the special effects and imagery would be\nbeyond comparison. The acting would be very high-class. But, I got\nsurprise the way the story was told. One can argue that it has many\nsimilarities with Fellowship of the Ring. There are few extra things\nthat was not really needed. Such as the troll scene, the Goblin part\nwas not needed, and the Mountain Scene was not needed. I feel that\nthese scenes slow don the movie a bit. However, I really enjoyed the\nHobbit. It would have been a Masterpiece if more consideration was\ngiven on the script. NOw to the thing that compelled me to write this\nreview is the scene between GOLLUM AND BILBO. OH MY GOD, I GOT TEARs IN\nMY EYES just before BILBO ESCAPE, when Bilbo pulled the sword.\n"
"\nI almost fall asleep the first 45 minutes, the post production should\nhave reduced the first minutes so nobody gets bored. A movie in which\nyou start bored will be a difficult to like one. The movie should have\nbeen at least 30 minutes shorter. Nothing new, the 3 previous ones\nwhere much better. <br><br>I would not recommend the movie if you are not a real fan of trilogy.<br><br>If you like the history, you can watch it, if you haven't seen the\ntrilogy then you might like it more.<br><br>Anyways, nice effects, nice production, you will find everything very\nreal and the movie will make you feel like you were in the scene.\n"
"\nthis is what happens when you don't focus enough on character\ndevelopment and have a thin storyline. I was so disappointed, but it\nyou never follow up the best trilogy in history with a knockout.\nhighlights of the movie are the new elements, but they are few, meaning\nyou walk out of this movie wishing you had of just rented it (and could\nstop yawning). Firstly, the relationships just aren't there. Unlike the\nTrilogy there is no buddy movie start with Mr Froddo and SAM. no slow\nbuilding up of the troop, and the link from Gandalf to Bilbo is\ntenuous. And Gandalf is just plonked in the movie without much back\nstory. Its hard to care about the characters if they don't really care\nthat much for each other. This prequel pushes the concept of home hard,\nbut the writer should have spent more time on the characters, and less\non assumed knowledge of those involved.\n"
"\nThe fact that this movie took almost 3 hours of my life and I didn't\neven flinch while watching it, multiplied by 4 (times watching it) ..\nsays a lot. <br><br>Yes, I love the book, but I don't see any purpose comparing it with the\nmovie. Movie is a whole another instrument of expression and director\nof this version of the Hobbit did a fine work (his impression and\nexpression).<br><br>Pace of drama, action, comedy elements are done very well. Actors did a\nvery good performances of their roles. 'Riddles in the Dark' chapter\nwhere Bilbo and Gollum have their encounter with each other is\nhistorical moment of human actor and CGI (human) actor where for the\nfirst time you can see the emotions on Gollum's face (and the Oscar\ngoes to ...).<br><br>Sound and music are also very good - exiting the theater I was humming\nthe main theme song. Director uses sound good for better immersion in\nthe story, but there is some space for improvement. Overall, movie that\nwill resist the test of time for years to come.\n"
"\nThe LOTR trilogy which came out in movie theaters 11 years ago is one\nof the best trilogies and most successful of them ever made. So to say\nthat The Hobbit movies coming out has a little bit to live up to would\nbe a very big understatement.<br><br>I'm glad that Peter Jackson ended up being the director of the trilogy\nsince his style of filmmaking is perfect for Middle Earth based\nstories. Guillermo del Toro would've done a fine job himself but PJ was\nbasically born to make these movies. His style of being able to make\nmovies with the action, fantasy, humor and story structure like this\nbrings a certain style to this movie that other directors wouldn't have\nbeen able to pull off as well.<br><br>And for the fans of LOTR who haven't read any of the books you get\nintroduced to a bunch of new characters you haven't seen before but\nalso get some returning characters from the LOTR trilogy like the\ncharacters played by Frodo, Bilbo, Smeagol, Elrond and Galadriel.\n"
"\nDespite being a big fan of Peter Jackson's earlier work, this time I\nmust admit that the story did not captivated me as I expected and\nleaves much to be desired.<br><br>It was hard for me to connect emotionally with the story and get\nexcited with the main characters' mission . I feel that the film tried\nto integrate many elements at once, and that could saturates the story\nwith to much information disturbing those who are not familiar with the\noverall story. the film has splendid moments that captivated me and\nothers where it feels slow. It could be found some filler scenes,and\nalthough I enjoy the film, I got the final impression that the plot was\nunnecessarily expanded.\n"
"\nThe high frame rate version absolutely looks horrible. The sound is\nawesome. The characters are great. So upset though, very disappointed.\nThe motion looks like the characters were moving 1.5 times speed like\nan old black and white silent film. The action is non stop so it is\nvery hard to tell what the hell is going on. The detail is there but\nthe high frame rate ruined the movie for me. It looks like a cheesy\ncartoon. Like most critics said it looks like a video not a high end\nfilm. The story and effects are top notch of course. Do not see the\ngimmicky high frame rate version. What was wrong with 24 fps? Waste of\n$30. Wait for the DVD.....\n"
"\nIn my opinion the Hobbit saga is not as good as the Lord of the Rings.\nBut, nevertheless, it is a good trilogy, one of the best pieces of\naudiovisual fiction, within the medieval fantasy genre. Unexpected\njourney is my favorite of this new saga. <br><br>The narrative is not so perceptible to understand as in LOTR, it is\nbased on several purposes. But this adventure shows us another\nscenarios of the savage beauty of Middle-earth. And our guides on this\ntrip are fun. A group of dwarfs, each with a special personality, a\ntimid but charismatic and resourceful protagonist, a pretender to the\nthrone blinded by hatred, a Grey Wizard among elves and other\nacquaintances. A troublesome journey, through a landscape dominated by\ngiants, giant spiders, warlocks and dragons. A feast for the eyes,\nbrought to us through the lens of Peter Jackson. Hobbit has everything\na fan of this genre may want, but it's not the LOTR; In my opinion it's\ngood that it is not.<br><br>8 stars out of 10\n"
"\nThe Hobbit : an unexpected journey is a surprising comeback in a\nwell-known fantasy world and I think a great joy for a lot of people.\nThe story explain what happened 60 years before the events narrated in\nthe Lord Of The Ring.<br><br>First, it was fantastic to see again a lot of famous actor from the\ntrilogy (Ian McKellen, Christopher Lee, etc.) in a complete new\nadventure full of details that can help to a better understanding of\nthe world imagined by J.R.R. Tolkien (How did Sauron come back? How did\nBilbo find the one ring?). However, the film contains some\ninconsistencies that are annoying after a short time.. I'll give the\nfamous example of Legolas, a character coming from the trilogy who's\ncoming back again although he's not mentioned in the Hobbit's book.<br><br>To conclude, I recommend the film to the fans of the Trilogy, but\nexperts of the Middle-Earth who are looking on every details could be\ndisappointed.\n"
"\nThe 169 minute version of the movie was an opportunity to watch some of\nthe characters from the Ring trilogy develop and grow into the what\nthey will be in the later series. We get to see a young Bilbo, unsure\nand unchallenged, become something more resilient an intrepid. Watching\nthe 169 minute movie in a private setting allowed for any number of\nbreaks and rewinds of the movie to catch on scenery and missed dialog.\nFurthermore, for a health enthusiast it allowed the opportunity to\nworkout and watch a movie at the same time. The scenery in the movie\nwas breathtaking. Sharing the movie with 3 teenagers allowed them to\nexplain and relate parts of the \"hobbit: an unexpected journey\" to the\nring trilogy. Good for someone like me who had seen the trilogy series\na long time ago and forgotten some of the previous characters.

"\nThe beginning of the great journey starts with an unexpected visit and\nexpected pleasure for the audience!!! Cast is brilliant, you can see\nthat every actor is the embodiment of their characters. Martin Freeman\nwas BORN to play Bilbo and completely gets the character. The dwarfs\nare awesome! Kili and Thorin are the best dwarf characters. The Misty\nMountains melody lets us immerse in the mysterious adventures that are\nto come. Gollum will lead you through a cavern of riddles, Thorin will\nfight his own past, Bilbo finds his courage, Gandalf calls his eagles\nat the most right moment and suddenly you forget all the real world\naround you.
