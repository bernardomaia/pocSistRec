i was on the irish premier of the movie last thursday with simon pegg and nick frost showing up and saying few words before the movie
first of all i would like to say great cast especially sigourney weaver  jason bateman and my two mini stars of the movie bill hader and joe lo truglio as agents haggard and oreilly
the movie its self is very funny and the script well written  the small alien with voice from seth rogen its very real and well made by cg artists
obviously the chemistry between frost and pegg is great like always  you know what im saying if you remember shaun of the dead or hot fuzz rogen as alien is a perfect cast with his im smoking weed voice and great lines
in summary well made  great cast  funny script what else do you need for friday night
for me seven stars
i must admit i laughed throughout this movie
it had every stereotype imaginable
drunken bigoted red necks creationists christians sci fi nerds men in blacksci fi movie references were in abundance
what made it sophomoric was the profanity
too much to make it funny for any one over the age of twelve
as paul told ruth when she first learned to curse you must use it sparingly and at the right time to paraphrase
profanity was used too much in this movie
i was not offended but bored by it
it would have been a movie targeted for the older audience if the profanity was used sparingly
i am not shocked or tickled by the f bomb or potty humor or references to gays or penises
however the appearance of veteran actors sigourney weaver jane lynch jeffery tambor and blythe danner was a delightful and funny surprise
seth grogan was brilliant as paul
jason bateman was convincing as agent zoil
the two primary british actors of whom i had never seen were perfect
all in all a nice surprise of a movie and a hoot in the afternoon
paul
the swearing nonreligious weedsmoking alien
this film is so funny i have seen it about 10 times and it never gets old
seth rogen is perfect casting as pauland kristen wiig fits in great as well
simon pegg and nick frost make complete legends in this as two not gay science nerds
i would recommend to all that like a bit of a laugh and all those who enjoy simon peggnick frost films shaun of the deadhot fuzz
teenagers would love it just as much as adults do because of its humour and fab plot line
i wouldnt recommend if you are strictly religious as it may appear offensive if you are due to the religious comments and swearing
at the beginning does not expect much from this movie the way it is filmed may displease some people i personally like
here in portugal this movie was unknown to me and some friends of mine
someone told me it was a fun movie and i decided to see this movie at home by accident
i was not expecting that was special but after seeing it i can say that is special to the point of coming here to write a very positive reviews
paul is the alien friendliest and most fun ive ever seen
it is a movie that sees quite well and even after finishing we are still thinking about the scenes and smiling for a while
im going back to see him more times for sure
strongly recommend watching this movie
i loved this movie it was the most totally hilarious sci fic movie i have ever seen the movie wasnt given enough much of a rating though which sucks
if you love the little bug eyed creatures then this movie s for you from making a man pee himself to being grouped by and agent in a costume shop this little guy was the coolest alien i have seen in a movie ever
there is a lot of alien swearing in the movie so maybe not for little kids but definitely a movie i could watch more then once just for the laughs i got from the funny alien parts its nothing like any other alien movie you have seen before
so if your religious and dont like swearing then i suggest you dont watch it but if you love aliens and dont mind the language then it is definitely worth renting
really rubbish effort from a team that a lot more could have been expected from
the same joke alien acts just like us
is constantly repeated to the precise same effect namely muted half smile turning to groan when you realise that the 4 year olds that the joke can only be aimed at cannot see the film
the best of the film is when the pegg and frost are bouncing lines off each other but any of that chemistry is completely missing when the cgi blob alien on screen and wiig is an empty vessel in this
sean of the dead was impeccably written and hilarious hot fuzz had some good jokes in it but they seemed badly stuck together with chewing gum and this is just desperate
could it be that they are not being given enough time to come up with a decent script or could it be that they struck lucky with sean
only the next effort will tell
huge fan of nick frost and simon pegg
they make a brilliant duo theyre the actioncomedy kings and this film proves it
brilliant comedy great voicedubbing by seth rogen surprisingly great action sequences and great original story
the directing was spectacular the writing was great as well and everything is handled fantastic
im definitely gonna watch this film again had a blast with it and basically anyone who loves comedy can enjoy it
a very humorous look at the mysteries behind area 51
greg mottola really nailed the directing here truly enjoyed that aspect
other than that my only issues with this film is that i wanted a little more background about nick and simon and i wanted more background about the big guy she felt kinda too mysterious and had a bit of an empty personality
besides that i really recommend this film if you love either nick and simon or just a fan of comedy check it out
this movie was fun and interesting
but it contains an odd ham fisted attempted slam against christianity that makes little sense
upon the sight of an alien a conservative christian woman abruptly turns athiest
im a christian
ive also learned all about the facts of evolution at the christian schools i attended
just about every christian i know thinks that the vastness of space inevitably contains extraterrestrial life
this is not at all incompatible with faith
it would have made just as much since if she had turned athiest on the sight of a vacuum or cheeseburger
im not sure why the writers of this movie thought that christians would lose faith upon encountering extraterrestrial life
it comes across as forced and ignorant
its an otherwise fine film
in fact you are more likely to find a green pot smoking alien that has the voice of seth rogen than a christian who loses her faith due to the discovery of alien life
i think the most problematic part of making a comedy with an alien is not to have it become to cheezy too childish too much human perhaps
in the case of paul it seems that by making it more down to earth and cheezy beyond any measure a kind of the movie is so bad its good effect though in a very positive way is achieved
paul is not just funny but its original it also reinvents many jokes in a way that doesnt seem to be ripping off any other movies
the movie is enjoyable from start to finish with a number of interesting twists and is entertaining even though some jokes are just childish but have just the right amount of adult humor that will keep 99 of the audience laughing
if you have not seen this movie  get your friends together get some beers and a pizza and have a fun evening
paul delivers in every scene
i am a big fan of pegg amp frost  spaced and shaun of the dead are amazing pieces of comedy
and even though hot fuzz has some funny moments  its kind of a mess
and when i first watched paul i enjoyed it but thought the beginning was rather slow and forced
but i watched it for a second time because my wife hadnt seen it and i really enjoyed it much more the second time
pegg and frost have such great rapport and chemistry and the film is full of terrific actors  kristen wiig bill hader jason bateman etc
the film pokes a lot of fun at et and other scifi alien films
i really liked the wiig character and that she was a repressed woman trapped at a rv park by a crazy religious father
as she tasted freedom for the first time with the guys she tries to make up for last time w cursing and partying
some nice cameos by jeffrey tambor jane lynch and also sigourney weaver
this isnt quite as clever as shaun but it is fun and exciting
well done mates
really liked the movie  very quirky  spielbergy  surprising  usuk  curse nerd worthy and others dialogue  good cast and very appropriate alien appearances of  actors seemingly had a lot of fun  story dialogues  its very humanist even so its alien  i always wondered why people are writing so much in those reviews and now i know you will have to
a short review will not get published
i somehow need to fill 10 lines even so i wanted to keep it really really short as i was always a bit annoyed by all these very long reviews and simply wanted to have a short cool or not cool plus
i need to keep writing to fill line number 10  enjoy
paul has a very promising beginning with a good laugh count
the fish out of water scenario of an alien needing assistance to get home works initially
however just passed the midway point after the religious zealot girl gets involved things change from clever to redundant bordering on boring
i mean the cursing angle is way over done and the film seems to have run out of ideas
the last third of the film is nothing more than a cartoonlike car chase
overall paul is enjoyable enough for a watch but repeat viewings seem unlikely
its really a shame because the alien creature is well done but paul ultimately wears out his welcome
merk
paul is not perfect but it is not as good as shaun of the dead and hot fuzz
however i for one found it an enjoyable movie and much better than people i know made it out to be
i mainly wanted to see it for the concept which seemed fun and intriguing and for the most part it was
the story is mostly fastpaced and entertaining but there are some predictable moments with some gags going on for too long
also while i loved kristen wiig in bridesmaids i didnt find her character here anywhere near as well written or engaging this time round
however paul does look great and has an appealing soundtrack
a vast majority of the writing and gags are very funny and on target and the direction is well above average as well
simon pegg and nick frost are a wellmatched pair both are likable and their chemistry infectious while seth rogan an actor i dont really care for is surprisingly good as paul
overall far better than expected even with the flaws
710 bethany cox
i thought of seeing this movie because of the high rating and the very positive reviews on imdb
in general i love to see comedies
however this movie did not make me impressed
in other words it did not made me laugh which is supposed to be done by a comedy
movie mostly relies on heavy use of swear words to create jokes but it didnt work for me
two leading characters looked dumb
30mins into the movie i was wondering how on earth this movie got this much of positive reviews
to me this was one of the most boring comedies i have ever seen
this reminded me a similar movie called idiocracy
at least it conveyed a good thoughtful message even though it was boring
this is the funniest sciencefiction movie i have seen in a while
actually i dont remember the last one i saw offhand
the two nerds did their parts perfectly
the interaction between took a little getting used to at the beginning of the movie
but once i tuned in it was a riot till the end
the christian creationist woman was a nice touch in the story
if you are looking for a xfiles type story then this is not it
this is more of a hey dude where is my car sort of thing with an alien thrown in for good measure
at least that is the way i see it
the xrated dialog kinda surprised me as i would have thought this movie would be targeted at a young audience
but if there was this much in it at all there should have been more
this movie is no hot fuzz but it is definitely entertaining
simon and nicks sense of humor i think is always spot on
i love how their jokes are so subtle and dry and move through the film without skipping a beat
not as funny as it couldve been i believe but i will for sure be seeing it again
i do have one question however why is it whenever religious people are shown in movies they are always made out to be way over the top and crazy almost cult like
just because someone has religion or beliefs doesnt mean that they are super closed minded and act as though they just had a frontal lobotomy
but anyway still funny nonetheless i look forward to seeing what simon and nick roll up with next
let me begin by saying that paul is a movie by nerds for nerds about nerds
if you dont enjoy movies that glibly poke fun at themselves and fanboys you might as well go watch the kings speech or something
paul is not meant to be high brow cerebral entertainment
its meant to be funny and does an excellent job of it
there are a ton of giggly did you find the hidden and occasionally not so hidden reference to a beloved scifi film moments that will appeal to all of us who live for space aliens and epic comic book movies
there are curse words and other cringe worthy language in such abundance you might want to leave the under 16 crowd at home but not much worse than that aside from continual references to boobs
enjoy the action enjoy the fun and leave the moral subplots to the foreign films
i really thought that this movie was going to be a good one how wrong i was
with the actors from shaun of the dead  i thought it would be a good one but it is really bad
the special effects are the only things good about this turkey
the story line is about the same as any b alien movie
paul is an alien captured by the government tries to escape to get back home some humans are helping him get away from the evil government agents and so on
it seems like the writers went out of their way to make an antireligious antichristian movie and that really gets in the way of the plot
they spend way too much time on the antireligious part and not enough on making the movie funny
dont waste a minute of your life watching this foolish stupid piece of crap
one mans opinion
being a huge fan of pegg and frost my expectations were high
yarp
maybe that was the problem
or maybe i didnt smoke a few joints before seeing this movie
no wait no amount of weed could make me laugh at this movie
narp
pegg and frost are fatter slower less funny and give a stilted performance and look like theyre going through the motions
parodying religion can be funny but if i want to see a movie making fun of religion ill go see life of brian
dont give it to me kindergarten teacher style in a comedy about an alien a boring alien named paul played by seth rogan who reads the script like hes reading an instruction manual for a lawn mower
dont waste any of your resources on this movie which includes your money your time your brain cell activity or any physical exertion
seriously stop reading now and navigate away from this review
we got fooled by the imdb rating 7
4 so far and went to see a funny and interesting movie
got so disappointed of that and we dont want anyone else experience it
no story  no real story behind it
just full of foul language that might not even make sense to use
my guess is this is for individual male adults and with certain mind stream
it was a waste of our time
dont go to this movie to expect a nice scifi movie because it is not
it is just full of gibberish and cussing that does not make any sense at all
it is so bad that there are a few talented actors and actresses have been wasted on this movie
and i have no clue where in the hell
the rating of 7
4 came from
i hope a little bit later the rating goes low enough that people get some clues about the content and value of this stupid movie
i have been a fan of pegg n frost since their first notably collaboration in the cult channel 4 series spaced
regrettably this film paul is not as good as i had imagined it would be
the story is weak many parts seem bland in its delivery some scenes are too wordy some lacking of liveliness and creativity
even more those two english comedians genius couldnt afford to bring up a solid humorous atmosphere as well as they had done in shaun of the dead to save the day
nay they look trying too hard to be funny
more over there are some disrupting performances of the supporting characters baroque in their awfulness
the only one that caught my attention in this film is the alien
to be fair pauls cgi is nicely made smooth and intriguing
in a nut shell this is a strictly disaster scifi flick
i love the actors in this movie every one of them are high end comics and they kill in each and every movie they play in
the two main characters you would know the comic duo simon pegg graeme willy  and nick frost as clive gollings from hilarious movies such as hot fuzz and shaun of the dead
the acting is good and the ideas are funny up until about 20 minutes after they meet the alien after that it gets old very fast
i get it the alien is a bro and after you see the alien fart and tell a few dirty jokes you get the point and the gimick is over
from that point i had nothing to watch the film for
over all the acting is excellent the beginning is funny up to about 20 minutes after they meet the alien
for other people it might be a 78 movie for me its a 6
i wouldnt watch it again and did watch trough till the end but maybe if it was 2 in morning and i was wasted on pot or beer or something it would be more watchable
two british scifiloving nerds simon pegg and nick frost from shaun of the dead and hot fuzz go on a road trip across america visiting ufo hot spots when they come across a real alien voiced by the ubiquitous seth rogen
passably funny though one suspects even diehard scifi buffs will find the films walltowall pop referencing tiring and a tad lazy
in conclusion paul is an entertaining film and that is the main thing which makes it worthy of a moderate recommendation
however if paul had lacked from its geek elements for example if the alien was a fugitive from the law or a mexican trying to cross the border i think that the screenplay would have not been enough to sustain the film
paul is the most overrated movie of the year and thats the case for one reason its not funny
i mean what the hell i chuckled a few times but this movie is almost completely devoid of humor
now of course thats my opinion if you found this film to be hilarious than i envy you
i havent seen any other simon pegg and nick frost movies and this movie didnt really make me want to
i really couldnt care less for paul himself i mean if he had been captured and disected than i probably would have just shrugged and sighed
also the sigorney weaver cameo was way too obvious no i am not putting a spoiler alert down if you know who sigorney weaver is then you will know she is in this movie the first time you hear her voice
now there are things i did like but most of them were the science fiction elements i loved whenever they would make a reference to a science fiction film and the steven spielberg voice cameo was awesome
it does a good job of showing how crazy scifi fanboys can be
and the end twist was actually pretty good
who do i see to get that 2 hours back
worst movie i have seen in a long time
usually like simon pegg but as my son said did he write this as they were going to shoot
not sure if this was to be a true comedy or a weak attempt at satire focusing on et and other early space alien movies
the movie starts off promising with comic con and a few good laughs at nerdy stereotypes
then jumps into a few typical jokes of laughs at homosexuals and straights but falls very flat
then the movie tries very weakly to make a statement on religion and then continues into a mishmash of tripe
i will give simon pegg a pass as the rest of his movies had a cutting edge that was funny
its one of the best simon pegg and nick frost movie i have ever seen
i liked them in the cornetto trilogy and from then trying to have a look at all of their work
boy they can give you a good laugh
i think the director did a pretty good job
references to other films like star wars and aliens gave me a chuckle
the screenplay is captivating visuals are great comedy is fantastic
good job on writing the story by mr
pegg and mr
frost
if i had known about this film when it was released i definitely would have watched in theater
a pretty good nerd film if i can say
trust me if you are a bit nerdy like me you are gonna love it
even if nerd movies are not your cup of tea this movie is not gonna disappoint you
10 rating for all the fun and entertainment
a cool film to spend hour and a half on
i watched it quite long ago so i dont really remember details
i remember that the film had some good humour in it and provided witty references about a lot of stuff
this is the kind of films i sometimes want to watch on my spare time
id like to hear from the director in the future even though i couldnt watch superbad to the end it gained some good critic
maybe it was due to poor quality of my version of the film
cast as i remember did their job ok
i dont even know what to write next i wanna just leave these brief notes for myself not attempting for them to be useful for other people
if anyone is aware of more convenient way to do so please tell me
two english geeks take a road trip across america and run into a foul mouthed alien
surprisingly enough paul is the joke that becomes least tiring throughout this film
he isnt always trying to be offensive and actually brings a little heart and soul to the piece
i found there to be a lot of unnecessary christian bashing going on throughout
as it was done without the slightest hint of satire and in the movie god is disproved by the existence of a fictitious alien it seemed a poor argument
otherwise its quite fun
it never had me laughing out loud but i was mildly amused
unfortunately towards the end it is nothing but quotes from greater film
i mean the entire last 20 minutes seemed comprised of quotes delivered in all seriousness by the cast
will aid a nice drinking game for cinephiles but was tiresome while sober
my friends and i gave paul a shot last weekend
i wasnt too hopeful as the trailer didnt make the movie seem all that great
i was presently surprised at how funny it was
as much as i am already tired of seth rogen i thought he was a really great choice as the voice of paul
simon pegg and nick frost were also a good choice for this movie
the only thing that really turned me off about the movie was its agenda
throughout the movie the writers continually portray christians as sensational ridiculous idiots and heavily promote science
i suppose maybe i shouldnt expect a lot different from a scifi comedy but it irritated me
i feel that the movie was funny but nowhere near hangover funny
its in the category of movies that will be continually shown on comedy central in 23 years much like shaun of the dead and super troopers
i give it a 7
paul is the name of a dog who one assumes the alien originally rescued but then disposed of
this only occurs to you after thinking about why some things just dont seem to match up when you watch this film for the first time
there are other conceits that probably fly straight over the audiences heads too
never mind this is a healthily funny take on scifi and the people who love the genre
it takes a number of affectionate sideswipes at the icons well known to all of us
it reminded me of the live mime show based on the puppet series created by gerry anderson thunderbirds
funny because you cant really take some fictions seriously can you
a great laugh just unfortunate that the writing wasnt given to a professional screenwriter to provide rude dialogue without so much need for expletives
could have been a great film but alas was yet again hamstrung by peggs non existent talent complete lack of anything approaching likableor more honestly barable
the plot is familiar enough alien comes to earth and meets humanstwo of the most stupid annoying fat nerds your ever likely to meet this side of a far scape convention
as with most of these one note movies i found myself waiting for the funny stuff to start happening until i was rudely surprised by the closing credits
i imagine itll make 100s of billions of pounds this movie solely by virtue of it being utter dross and people have low to no standardsit doesnt look like pegg is in a hurry to change his most profitable formula
i watched much of what simon pegg has done and found it to be very clever in an understated manner probably the british in him
this though was a seth rogen movie which is curse words and fart jokes humor
this had such a chance to be funny and clever at such a high level but instead sunk to seth rogens level
there seems to be a lot of people who like that and i am sure they preorder the newest recording of larry the cable guy as soon as they can but i am not a fan
the acting was fine and the plot while overdone was ok but there was nothing to pull it together and for most part entirly and utterly without humor 95 of the time
i cant wait to get back to when pervasive foul language was not funny and you need to actually be clever to write a script
now and then a film emerges and does everything it is meant to domakes you laugh from start to finish
simon pegg and nick frost have done it again and i am oh so pleased we dont have to wait a lifetime between them getting together to work on a new projectthe chemistry between them is simply magicone could almost call them the laurel and hardy of the 21st century
throw in seth rogan and sigourney weaver and be ready for all hell to break loose on the big screen
paul hits your funnybone from the first scene to the last and the humour is infectiousi havent heard an audience laugh so much in the theatre since
well since hot fuzz
lets hope that mrs pegg and frost continue to team up on such a regular basisthe world of cinema is a much better place thanks to them both
i like pegg and frost movies but this one seems to have been given the hollywood treatment by someone who does not understand why their other movies were so funny
there are a few laughs but this film fails because it tries to be too much at once
the director doesnt seem to know whether he wants this to be a teen gross out comedy road movie childrens family comedy or critique of christianity
having tried and failed at all these elements there is no time to get to know the characters enough to make them believable or to fully exploit the idea of a comedy alien
rather than being placed in funny situations paul the alien seems to exist purely to lecture us in an unsubtle way about how idiotic christians are
if you are aiming at satire fine but not in a movie marketed as light comedy
since when did it become acceptable to lecture people during a comedy film
i was embarrassed for the woman next to us who had brought her daughter
it was full of forced obscenities clearly and artificially trying to make the movie funny
for people who kneejerk laugh when obscenities are used
yawn i got numb to that after a while but what was really offensive it that apparently the real purpose for the movie was to debunk any belief in god and christians were shown to be idiots
any believer who watched this movie would have to be offended
if they just hadnt cheapened it with excessive and unnecessary gutter language and hadnt pushed their agenda of godlessness this could have been a funny movie
i wish i had gone in for a rootcanal instead
just plain offensive
paul 2011  simon pegg nick frost voice of seth rogen kristen wiig jason bateman bill hader joe lo truglio jeffrey tambor john carroll lynch jane lynch david koechner jesse plemons sigourney weaver cameo voice over as himself steven spielberg
close encounters of the geek kind couldve been the working title for this funnierthanithasarighttobe scifi valentine comedy from brit duo pegg amp frost who coscripted as two uk scifi geeks who trek to the usa to see every genre landmark and find themselves with a fugitive alien rogen toking good times
attempting to get home after the feds are hot on their tails
slacker homages to all things genre in the pop culture riffing best bit a redneck roadhouses rendition of john williams cantina theme from star wars goes a long way but director greg mottola keeps things at an even keel
i wasnt sure what to expect before watching this but this was probably the funniest pegg and frost movie yet
i though that it had a very good story line and it had some real depth
i also thought that once again pegg and frost were both good
i thought that seth rogen as paul was an excellent choice as if there was ever an alien i would imagine it to sound like him and i thought he fitted the character perfectly
the ending was a bit of a tearjerker and a little bit of gore but one line makes everything better
overall i would say that paul is a great comedy film if you like typical pegg and frost films this one is definitely worth a watch
i would rate it 910 and say that it is suitable for anyone 13
shaun of the dead and especially hot fuzz are two great movies
hot fuzz has great special effects with solid acting and a good script that is well directed paul is not lacking in special effects and seth rogen as paul was enough to make it worth watching but in other areas such as story and real laugh out loudedness it lacks
it is surelyyy no superbad so expect nothing more than a pretty entertaining whacky good time
i would wait for dvd
i would have rather seen a number of the other movies in theaters now than spend the time and money on this one
i dont know what these people who love it and say run out and see it now omgomg are smoking but i want some it wouldve probably made this movie much better
i was really anxious to see this movie once i heard about it
i am a big fan of simon pegg and nick frost those guys are hilarious
i loved them in shaun of the dead and hot fuzz
when i saw that these two were pairing up again i was 100 sure i would like this movie
to me this movie did not disappoint me at all
i really like it
it was funny and if your a nerd or kind of a nerd like me and into scifi you can relate to it
im not a fan of seth rogen either but i thought he did as awesome job as paul
i know a lot of people are upset because of comments made on christianity in the movie but i mean come on
im not religious but in my opinion ive heard wayway worse in either other movies or standup
i loved this movie and i am 100 sure that i will be buying it to add to my collection
i went to see paul today sunday march 20th i have to say it was very funny the graphics of some of the things in that movie were really good the creator of paul the alien did very well
the eye detailfeatures were amazing and the way the skin and body shape looked was pretty much dead on
as i watched the movie i didnt honestly expect there to be a alien with awesome powers and to swear drink and smoke at all
the end of the movie was pretty sad a lot of people in the theater cried when graeme was shot
i can say i did expect the healing part to come in from the part with the bird but i did not expect paul to recover
i was expecting an extremely sad movie but all in all it was funny and i enjoyed watching it
