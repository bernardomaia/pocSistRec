i was very fortunate to be at the world premiere at sxsw in austin and attended the qampa after with james duncan vera farmiga michelle monaghan jake gyllenhaal and ben ripley
the story line keeps you on the edge of your seat and adds in enough humor to make it a thoroughly enjoyable experience
there is amazing subtle chemistry between jake and michelle which really is the star of the film performances by all the actors are excellent
beautiful cinematography that will make chicago proud
the ending brings up more questions than answers but it feels right so thats ok with me
i am not a big scifi fan but this film delivers on romance suspense mystery and thrills
highly recommended
source code is one of those few actionscifi movies that work effectively without exaggeration or embellishment
when we see source code we see the certain resemblance it has with daja  vu with denzel washington but duncan jones with his own talent his own style prevent that from happening
source code has is own method and approach which is quite entertaining and enjoyable
this movie is certainly recommended for all the actionjunkies because this has all to be a summer hit which confuses me why hasnt this opened in june or july it had the potential and the content of an summer blockbuster
jake gyllenhaal is not your typical action hero since but he really pulls everything off really well
michelle monaghan and vera farmiga are both absolutely gorgeous women with talent
on the whole source code is pure entertainment at its best
i was looking forward to seeing  source code  ever since i saw the 1st trailer and i was lucky enough to catch it in an advance screening before it officially released here and it just exceeded my expectations
this is the type of movies that will keep you interested till the very ending
its probably the best scifithriller since inception
no big action scenes no big explosions no usage of unnecessary cgi wellwritten story solid performance from mr
gyllenhaal  who is now officially one of my favorite actors  and another hit from my newest favorite filmmaker duncan jones
dont miss it
the hole technology on which movies story is based was conflicting with the story itself so badly that it ruined the movie even for a scifi lover as myself
and it comes in 15min
i tried to forget that illogical details and enjoy the movie but the end just killed me
if the movie would end 10 minutes earlier i would put much better vote
but now the movie could be rated good only if you didnt understand the hole concept then comes wow  how nice
but if you follow the story and have logical thinking  youll be very disappointed
the acting wasnt so bad as many reviewers said the hole story was a bit banal and in such case you cant act neither brilliant neither bad
the idea is nice it begins very mysteriously and when the general concept is presented you sense there are going to be mind blowing things something like inception perhaps
sadly the scientific idea is purely presented and the writers give too much place to romance it seems like the movie tries to attract women and do so by weakening the scifi part
i hate movies that try too grab too many aspects the movie could go a little bit longer and actually build the idea of source code
the romance is forced upon the story like the writers were told they had to insert love and did it wrong
to sum it up a great concept not so greatly presented
see if you want to satisfy your thrill hunger
a young man is caught in limbo  in religions the state between death and rebirth and used for the war against terrorism
now the prospect of somebody caught in limbo or something similar was used in dark star by john carpenter and that film showed what could be done with such a concept
this film however is a totally different matter
even beyond death this poor soul is haunted by lackeys with the gibberish war on terror bs
nowhere it is pronounced that only the most powerful nation on earth could be said to engage in any terror
of course not because this is by no means a leftist film and instead a film for idiots
vance packard once wrote that the american society defended the right of the businessman to seek out the morons and make them still more moronic
this film seems to work along these lines
i had to write this review only because the film had received such good rating on imdb
this shenanigans must be stopped
this movie as far fetched as it is wasnt that bad up until the last 5 minutes or so
i lovehatehow writers throw the illogical in at the end to spin the whole story around
then you get all these dumb ass intellectuals coming in trying to explain it
their explanations are more incoherent than the movie itself
its a lazy version of deja vu
i would love to hear an explanation of how this guys memory is incepted into jakes head
how can he see other people and places the original guy didnt even view
and as for parallel time lines give me a break you cant possibly rationalize that
just do yourself a favor and go see something else
this movie like inception portrays as an intelligent script but really just insults peoples intelligence with nothing but holes in the story line
i would never say source code is a bad movie but there are simply way too many gushing reviews  from critics and viewers alike  than this film warrants
that the film is a highly suspenseful thriller cannot be argued
i quite enjoyed the main characters recurring trips inside the source code scenario
the problem is that the central premise of source code is implausible at best and quite possibly ludicrous
its as if the filmmakers felt that if they peel away the layers of plausibility very slowly the audience wont notice
it does seem like many viewers either didnt notice or didnt mind the holes
im willing to entertain the occasional logical stretch but when it is the films central premise being stretched beyond recognition thats when i begin to have a problem
as much as i wanted to go along for the ride i just couldnt go all the way
by the end the cumulative effect of all the liberties taken by the filmmakers became enough to bump source code from out of the scifi genre and into the fantasy world
not sure what other people are seeing in this
within 10 minutes i had the plot worked out
i very much disliked the cinematography
from the first scene with the cut aerial shots sweeping to the train and over the city i did not like it
the relationship between the girl on the train and the man was ridiculous
he had more on screen time and a better relationship with the military girl
i just thought it was not very good boring shots very like good tv very little drama
i do not understand the people on the edge of there seats comments
a 6 film not awful but it felt like payola to me
the studio must be delighted to have somehow gotten away with it
i love movies that make you think and source code will do that the problem is that what youre thinking is probably whats going to happen
this film is a take on the tv show quantum leap but instead of leaping until the issue is solved the leaper only has 8 minutes to try and solve the problem
jake gyllenhaal stars and while i usually dont care for him much he was excellent here
i have a feeling this character may have been written specifically for him because hes got a strange style and seems to not fit many of his roles
source code is another film in a genre of endless possibilities it tries really hard to stand out and be special but sadly its pretty predictable while playing off other established material such as quantum leap and the matrix
it is an enjoyable film and one of gyllenhaals best performances that ive seen but if youre into science fiction the way that i am youre not gonna have much trouble figuring this one out
this film could had been great
i think the story is decent the plot well crafted just dont think about it too much  and it relies more on acting and human interaction than mindless action
it has its flaws but they are not as nearly irritating as the war on terrorism and afghanistan war hero bs
it feels like the government and its agencies own hollywood
you know what
if you are a true american soldier you will serve your country after you die
if you block this part out of your mind you may enjoy this film
if they were conducting the source code experiment at a university and they used a man who lets say offered his body for scientific purposes i would give this film a 7
but i cant overlook the annoying propaganda so its a 5
maybe its just because i was tired cranky and my date cancelled bummer but i thought source code was nowhere near as good as moon duncan jones debut
sure its an interesting premise and jake gyllenhaal finally proves he can stand his ground as a lead in an action feature but it had to deal with a bit of a credibility problem
also as i have a bit of a celeb crush on her i think vera farmigas character came across slightly underdeveloped you just didnt get to know anything about her
but yeah great visuals good camera work
not a bad sophomore effort but it did have some big shoes to fill
ill rewatch it in a better mood
initially i thought this film was your typical action movie but i heard some really great things about it so i went and watched it anyway
little did i know film reviewers sometimes tend to have quite bad taste
let me clarify  it wasnt a horrible movie
it just wasnt great
jake gyllenhall and vera farmiga are good in this movie but their performances didnt exactly blow me away
pun definitely not intended the film was almost comically patriotic and extremely clichad
also there are some pretty major plot holes  assuming that ive understood the whole premise correctly
like why he can leave the train for example
i think my problem was that i had high expectations for source code and it just didnt quite live up to them
as a scifi  action film with its pretty good
source code is a sciencefiction mystery film set in modern day chicago and a government facility in an unknown place
this is one of those movies that will make you think hard trying to figure out what is reality and what isnt
unless you pay close attention to whats happening you can easily get confused and lost
it is thus somewhat comparable to the matrix and inception
as you might expect the scifi aspect of this film was totally ridiculous unrealistic and unscientific
the mystery or whodunit aspect couldve been more suspenseful and couldve used some twists and turns to keep you guessing
if you watch carefully it is fairly obvious near the beginning of the movie who the bomber was
overall this is an above average scifi film that is worth watching
during the first 45 mins of the movie i remember uttering the words this movie is annoying
the constant going back to the scene of the train was just getting very repetitive and reminded me of another awful movie called vantage point
also nothing more annoying than the flirting in the middle of the mission
i think once he was able to find the bomber the rest of the movie became bearable and actually exciting
i just dont get the end though
so do the people in the train survive
isnt that against the quantum physics parabolic calculus thingy
and if he does get to survive does he live the rest of his life as that other character
quite frankly this movie is not worth any of my brain cells contemplating on the ending
i think a 6 out of ten rating is just due
jake gyllenhaal fleshes out the characters he portrays and rightfully makes it his own
whether its donnie darko or zodiac he ups the ante
this is absolutely the case in source code
think groundhog day meets the best scifi you can think of
gyllenhaal is colter stevens a soldier whos forced to use the source code repeating a reallife train journey to chicago and its eventual explosion and the death of everyone on board
his mission is to find the bomb and its detonator
the investigations only half the hoot
on the train opposite stevens whos in someone elses body on the train is christina michelle monaghan a beautiful downtoearth woman that knows the person stevens has taken over
colters subconscious actions bring them closer together but is it a relationship destined to fail the moment he enters the source code
only 8 minutes of time will tell as director duncan jones successfully balances romance or not timetravelling with heartstopping action
i am such a big fan of this guys movies
when was the last time i watched a movie that jake featured and wasnt good
i cannot remember
although source code is not my favorite i found it to be really entertaining
in this film jake gyllenhaal is a soldier that wakes up in someone elses body and through an experiment by the government he has got 8 minutes to find the bomber in a train
when the bomb goes off and stevens finds himself in the pod again
he is sent back another time yet still cannot find out anything
this sequence is repeated over and over again until he is able to complete the mission cause if he does he is in in fact changing the reality of today
a little bit like what happens in back to the future 2
the movie has tension drama and has an uncertain ending
all of it make for a movie that may not have you on the edge of your seat but that is intense enough to make you alert until the end
source code i did enjoy and its also worth of time to watch this movie as a fan of scifi this is movie however little similar to tom cruise movie edge of tomorrow but i like this one much in movie you can see how there is a science stuff who is sending back to a caption to explore the person who did bomb explode in train he got 8 min to find that when he failed he sent back again well with a view angle of science maybe its possible to force someone to think about its past very deeply with some science machine i understand when its go behind time not really just with his brain amazing movie at all when men change the future and stop to being explosion however it is not possible but its give very amazing end like happy end but i dont know they did change some science that is not possible but it gives movie a good end and well its all about entertainment so its good to give end like this nice movie at all

with moon duncan jones created an interesting scifi premise based on some vague implausible science and used it to explore questions of identity and free will
here he does the same thing but the emphasis is more on the vague implausible science and less on the characterbased struggles
so when the science starts getting more and more complicated and making less and less sense its a problem
i didnt really care how jake gyllenhaal was doing these things or what the scientific implications are except that the movie kept trying to make me care about them
i liked the suspense and action of the first hour and the more emotional route the film takes in the last part
but all this silly science kept getting in the way leading to an unsatisfying ending that has little to do with the humanity of the story
i should also note that even though moon was derivative in a lot of ways this felt less original to me
it is a mildly enjoyable entertainment wellcrafted and refreshingly brief
but none of it really lingers with me and the cast is entirely lackluster
this film was really good i thought the acting is there and so is the script both well done
the only criticism of the script i would say is the theme it has been done before with minority reports with tom cruise and dejavuwith denzel washington thats why i only gave it 710 but still definitely worth watching
duncan jones pulls an excellent script together top producer and jake gyllenhaal and michelle monaghan are both good actors and play their parts well in the film
the ending is really good as you dont expect jake to review back to the team an addition to what the source code can achieve i thought it was a good turn
i would imagine there will be a 2nd source code being produced soon i think it will work as the ending was left un answered and open
the dialog is a bit too cheesy at most parts
it is cringeworthy very poor screen writing but overall the story is fascinating unpredictable and original
like with moon director duncan jones brings up very interesting food for thought
there are some real heavy ethical points here but the film never dives into any depth with them
i felt there was so much more to explore with source code and it would have been very rewarding if the the film was about 30 40 minutes longer and ventured into some of the issues that the film only scratched the surface of
i felt the film barely had time to handle the fastpaced surface aspect of the story
the acting and action of the film was spoton though i wish the film would have had a different ending
overall source code is a great film but had the potential to be something absolutely amazing like moon was
this is a film that defies genre labels
its not a time travel film but it does seem to be able to change the recent past
its a unique blend of science fiction and thriller with a little bit of romance thrown in
for me the connection between colter and christina really clicked and made me want more of these two characters
ive seen some reviews that panned the ending as being unnecessary but after the stunning revelation a little more than midway through they had to provide more of a kick in the pants for the end
definitely worked for me
towards the end it seemed it would end with colter dying in a virtual reality fairy tale and goodwin throwing her career away to make it happen
but we then get left with a completely altered reality that actually works
i enjoyed this immensely
hi there in reviewing this movie i mean its so difficult to explain its not one of those movies that you can really keep up with your eyes close you have to be alert at all times
i honestly didnt really enjoy it the only reason i went to see it is because i think jake gyllenhaal is hot
thats about it
and i like michelle monagan on the movie that she did with patrick dempsey made of honor
if you are an action buff this might be your style
i honestly rather see movies like limitless or the lincoln lawyer scream 4 that i might go far this its on a genre completely on its own
you have to keep following everything over and over and over at times i just wanted to walk out of the theatre because i was getting bored i am sorry it was not entertaining enough for me
i was counting the seconds so i can leave so in my opinion pass it up or wait til it comes out on dvd blu ray or whatever
not for me
i guess jake was great michelle stay in romantic comedies
thats it
i give this movie a seven because i must admit it kept my attention and was well actededited
however although i realize this is just escapist lore i think the science behind the time loop could have been better explained
one thing i noticed that although he is cascading from one parallel universe to another with each one being slightly different the identity of the villain never changes
also how does the controller know that the returning controllee is the same entity that originally went on the mission
nevertheless as pure entertainment and if one allows oneself to release everything learned in physics 101 its worth seeing
source code deals with interesting issues and themes for which if i reveal them then it could be seen as a spoiler alert so i guess youll have to see it for yourself to see if you can highlight them but what i can say is that with an exceptional cast and a clever plot which is easy to follow source code keeps you watching to see if you can see where the twists and turns will be coming from
jake gyllenhaal brings substance to his character and the film and is a great actor in this film
his costar michelle who played in eagle eye 2008 plays a similar role for which she does really well and both of them together have a great chemistry
theres not much more to say except that it has a great cast cool and original plot with cool twists and turns coming your way
wow
having just watched source code i must say that this is a great movie
the storyline is filled with twists and turns
the movie is smartly built and wonderfully acted
jake gyllenhaal acts with emotional depth and gives us a look into the life of someone thrown into such a strange and unsettling circumstances
the movie makes you feel very smart for understanding each twist and turn
every single second is well thought out and has the rest of the movie in mind
the movie is clever
of course the movie does toy around with some very profound ideas especially in the last few minutes and sometimes they dont always work
however most of the time the movie leaves you guessing and feeling sad for the loss and pain of the characters escpically the main character
the sheer complexity makes it mind bending
but at the same time its very straightforward to understand
all in all its a great film with a few missteps are outdone by the brilliance of the film
thank you for reading
goodbye
source code is one of the best entertaining scifi thrillers i have seen so far
its concept is kinda innovative and impressive also
loved the film
though the main idea behind this technology may be confusing but its welcome all the way
after all we all love new technology and new concepts in movie making
lead actors of this movie play as per the role demanded
direction is also great
the shooting places are gorgeous
the most important thing isthis movie never gets slowed down anywhere
it keeps its pace throughout
it would have been better if the confusing technology which was shown here was explained more clearly
but it wont be a problem to enjoy this masterpiece at all
its that kind of movie which you will like to watch again and again and still the beauty of this flick remains the same
giving it 10 out of 10
ive just finished watching it and it really brought me to a different realityi couldnt see anything else until it was over it was that kind of a movie
great job to the actors amp to the one who wrote that script
i would love to see more movies like this one and i love the idea of parallel worlds where anything can happen it makes you wonder
the concept of the movie is quite new never seen it in movies before and i think thats exactly what people are looking for  it enriches our imagination
to think beyond the limits and to believe that death is not the end  these are two of most important ideas from this movie please excuse my english still learning
this has got to be the best scifilove story plot ive ever watched since the lakehouse
i definitely recommend this movie for anyone who has got a knack of dealing with mindboggling scenarios while enjoying the melodramatic mood
this of course has some violent scenes typical for its own stretchedout plot of a time bomb set on a train and afterward the possibility a citywide holocaust
jakes acting has been driving and very involving
michelle monaghan is cute
she did it well and much relaxed
though the mystery is easy off since the crime perpetrator can be guessed off pretty in the early minutes of the movie the winning part of the movie is by how every piece of evidence is stitched into one whole revelation and the realization that this has go to be a love story
the ending surprisingly is most rewarding and would bring you to several what ifs and howcomes
definitely worth watching and a genre mainstay until another farfetched killer brainchild comes across the big screen
this movie is as predictable as the trailer leads it to be
whatever you think will happen does
i didnt want to see this movie but did because my friends were going and had nothing else to do
waste of time and money and im surprised the 2 actors that are recognizable agreed to sign on
i would compare this movie to unstoppable not only because it is on a train but because i could have told you the ending without ever seeing it
the acting is ok but unworthy of these 2 actors and the underlining story is undermined by the superfulous action
the villain in this movie is left with questions unanswered cane and the overall purpose of the program is not layed out
the movie was good for a pop corn night or to kill your time if you have nothing better to do
according to my expectations it was kinda what i suspected although i am sure i will not remember much of it tomorrow
sadly it is a reproduction of many movies like 12 monkeys deja vu butterfly effect etc etc etc etc
so it delivers nothing new but at least the acting is good
the story is a bit boring too and it is obvious from the beginning that the guy is not where he thinks he is
but overall i did not feel sorry for watching it but i am not thrilled either
so i guess that makes it an ok movie
i would suggest dvd rental
i usually like foreign and independent movies so i dont need to be entertained by a bunch of explosions
but this movie was incredibly dull and nonsensical
dry and the longer the movie goes on the more you start to realize that youve wasted your time and can never get those minutes of your life back
a plot line of jake gyllenhaals character trying to go back in time to stop a tragic accident devolves into an unnecessary conspiracy type story with characters you couldnt care less about
and i now hate michelle monaghan because if i ever hear the words i took your advice
again its repeated as a loop throughout the movie i might punch someone
this is the poor mans memento
source code is a very good scifi movie which has come up in the recent years
the only thing which i feel couldve rated this movie down is its ending part where the hero sends a text message to the lady in charge in reality from inside simulation of a code to the real world
thus it gives a sense of feeling to the audience that its actually a time travel
in a particular scene in the movie source code is described as a time displacement
its not a time travel
but the last scene of the movie confuses the audience totally
rest apart all parts of the movie are really thrilling and exciting
worth watching and youll enjoy this movie like anything
when decorated soldier captain colter stevens jake gyllenhaal wakes up in the body of an unknown man he discovers hes part of a mission to find the bomber of a chicago commuter train
in an assignment unlike any hes ever known he learns hes part of a government experiment called the source code a program that enables him to cross over into another mans identity in the last 8 minutes of his life
with a second much larger target threatening to kill millions in downtown chicago colter relives the incident over and over again gathering clues each time until he can solve the mystery of who is behind the bombs and prevent the next attack
finally he complete the mission
the climax was superb
thats a suspense u will love it when u see it so watch this movie
after sitting down and watching this supposedly good film i became indulged by the plot of the film of how anyone could think of and create such a complex and manage to pull it off this film was well acted and with large actors such as jake gyllenhaal i expected none the less
although this film is not the greatest and it may not be the best directed but i throughout enjoyed the idea of the film
the reason i have rated this film so high is due to the acting and the great film plot
with such a complex idea and film plot i am surprised that the director managed to pull it together so nicely
although the film could of done with a few more sets other than the source code and the train station it was very good and i would happily recommend it
great movie to watch
i never expected the story line
i appreciate the way directer presented the movie and the way he choose the characters
when the movie started and first 8 minutes gone i thought that this will be some terrorist related bomb finder movie
yes it is but in a different way
though the same 8 minutes is repeated throughout the movie the directer and actors managed us to travel throughout the movie interestingly
all the actors acted really good
music is too good
creation of whole new world with only time difference is a new concept i never ever come across in hollywood movies
i lost my sleep at the night i saw the movie thinking about the story
as a whole great movie for scifri lovers
the plot of this movie was far different from the others and the ending was very impressive
this movie can be considered as one of the best movies in 2010s because of its plot and you can take 2 or 3 great messages that will help you in your personal life
the main actors and actresses played their roles in the best way possible
the most considerable negative point about the movie was that there were some redundant scenes
actually the scenes are a bit similar but due to its plot this movie has to have such thing
overalli recommend this movie to you and you should feel obliged to see movies which are different from even the ones that are the best in the world
thanks legend
