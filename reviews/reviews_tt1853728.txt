"\nAbsolutely loved every minute of this movie. Usually I'm not too crazy\nabout Tarantino's movies, but this one is definitely the best one I've\nseen in a long time. The actors were picked perfectly. The overall\nexperience of a movie is amazing. When we first went to watch it, I was\na bit skeptical and thought I'd end up leaving an hour into the movie\n(it's a 3 hr movie), but it grabbed my attention from the very\nbeginning and I didn't even wanna get up to go to the bathroom, afraid\nto miss something. I'm usually very particular about the movies,\nnothing can hardly satisfy me, but this one is definitely in the top 5.\nSoundtrack was perfect. When I got home, I've done some more research\non it and loved it even more! Overall, I would highly recommend this\nfilm!\n"
"\nAt first I didn't want to see this movie because of some political\nremarks made by Jamie Foxx and Samuel Jackson, two of my previously\nfavorite actors, but Quintin Tarentino is a great director, so I broke\ndown and saw it. Glad I did. This was absolutely one of the best movies\nof the year. Although Jamie Foxx has top billing, this film would not\nhave been anywhere as good without Christoph Waltz. He stole every\nscene he was in. Brilliant acting and great comedic delivery. Leo was\ngreat too. Lots of blood, something expected in most of Quintins\nmovies, but a great story. Also expect to hear the N word about 2000\ntimes. Cristoph Waltz should get the Oscar for his performance. Should\nget nominated for best picture. This is absolutely a must see.\n"
"\nJesus, where to begin. Completely juvenile, rabbit trails galore, slow\nmoving, get to the firkin point. The way the scenes drag and the\nendless explaining and talking. This movie was so distasteful,\npredictable and irritating. First of all, Foxx was miscast, he does not\ndo period well, at all, totally unbelievable here, after years of\nslavery he's suddenly the fastes gun in the west, PLEASE! <br><br>The music, what are we to make of the modern day music with the period\nevents here, you can't take any of it seriously. I had to laugh was so\nabsolutely silly and out of place. I have lost all respect for\nwriter/director, the actors I can only hope were in it for the money,\nbut they lose my vote now too.<br><br>Open your EYES folks, for god sakes this is all about bringing\ndivision, \"I wanna shoot white people and get paid for it\". WOW, talk\nabout the globalist elite wanting to distract and divide, this is one\nof their vehicles. Good for you Hollywood and Washington DC, add\nanother notch to your ugly crown.\n"
"\nThis is teenage garbage, plain and simple, and teenage in terms of the\ndirector/writer. Let's set aside that Tarantino's movies never have any\nsubstance and are exercises in retro, gory, fetishist camp. Let's\nignore that the story arc is off and the film is way too long. Also,\nthat there are massive issues regarding all kinds of credibility. Which\nleaves the two main problems with this adolescent mess. The first is:\nwhat would you say about any film centered on two races of people, in\nwhich one race is, with a single exception, shown to be nothing but a\nvast collection of savage, cruel, stupid buffoons? That's what QT\nhappily does to the white race in this, his attack on racism. Then,\nthere's the blatant theft of Mel Brooks's 'Blazing Saddles' in the many\nn-word remarks geared for laughs and the idiot pre- Klansmen. Never was\na big Brooks fan, but at least he never had the gall to pretend he was\nmaking a statement.\n"
"\nCant believe that he messed this up, had such high hopes. This wasn't\neven a movie, not even a Tarantino creation! Just some attempts for\ncool lines, cool shots and funny characters. DiCaprio, as excellent as\nalways. Mr. Miami Vice, also good performance. The rest, especially\nJackuel M. Samsonite (as my eloquent friends calls him) just wasted\ntime and stole peoples money.<br><br>My only point is: IT'S Tarantino! Should have been so much better than\nthis junk that just USED the name Django! Messed up, want my money back\nor \"sambadi gonna get hurt reel bad\", Russel Peters style! Hope anyone\ndoes not get offended, don't really care but my two cents about this\ngarbage movie, stays as they are! Haha!\n"
"\nI felt dirty watching it and am embarrassed I stayed until the end. A\nweak story with cruelty &amp; violence beyond the pale. For those who can\nseparate fiction from reality, yet have a peculiar bent towards\nviolence, this movie may be manageable. For those without good filters,\nthis is fodder for another Newtown. Sorry I gave Tarantino my money-\nthat I wasted my $ is incidental, that I encouraged him to make more\ntrash is deplorable. I think there is a place for violence, where it\nadds to the story, in this case the movie was solely about violence. Is\nthere a plot? Yes, but it is incedential; this is about blood &amp;\nguts-and I don't mean bravery. There is no redeeming aspect to the\nmovie, don' waste your time.\n"
"\nNormally I wouldn't bother commenting such an awful movie or even\nwatching it to the end. But this after all was the great Tarantino, who\ndirected some of the most brilliant movies in the last 20 years or so\nand invented a style of his own, so I soldiered on and hoped to be\nsurprised. In the end, I felt more than disappointed, I felt\nembarrassed for him. This is not the meta-trash he specializes in, this\nis just pure unadultered trash: no intelligence, no originality, no\nirony, no second layer of meaning, no redeeming grace. It is badly\nwritten, badly directed, badly shot, badly cut. The actors - with the\nnotable exception of Cristoph Walz - are laughable. This is the gory\nmush a dumb semi-illiterate teenager would produce if you gave him a\nfew million dollars and told him: go write and direct a movie.<br><br>So I must repeat the question that has been daunting me since Poseidon\nby Riddley Scott and Black Horse by Spielberg: what is happening to the\ngreat Hollywood directors? Has a zombie plague stricken them all?\n"
"\nMy last favorite movie ever! Django doesn't have any decent personality\nat all. He makes me sick!<br><br>The movie is about equalization only. No logical story line, and it\ndoesn't make any sense!<br><br>This is about revenge and blood. If you don't like QT, don't watch this\nmovie!<br><br>Every other actor has better performance than Jamie Foxx. The only\nthing he did is to show his angry but stupid face.<br><br>However,Leonardo did a great job in the movie.His facial expression is\nreally great.\n"
"\nWhat on earth was Tarantino thinking of with this Turkey?<br><br>I feel that I just wasted 2 and a half hours of my life on this\nnonsense, some good actors have certainly abandoned their\nprofessionalism for this over long ( by an hour and a half) bunch of\nclaptrap.<br><br>Are we really supposed to believe that this in any way represents the\ntreatment of slaves in the USA, can the character of Django be believed\nor stand up to any kind of reasoned examination in the historical\ncontext? NO of course not, it's just a blood and guys fest with no\nredeeming features.<br><br>Never watching a Tarantino film again and this one is just about to be\njettisoned into the trash can.<br><br>Awful awful awful...\n"
"\nI expected this movie to be awesome, since the director is awesome. I\nwas sadly mistaken. I have to admit it had good points, but over all I\nwish I wouldn't have wasted my money. Not only did it throw me off when\nthey were playing rap music in a western movie, but in one second they\nwere talking about going to find someone and the next second they knew\nexactly where they were and they were already there...really? And the\nsad thing is, is that I always use this website to compare the \"good\"\nmovies that are out and this one had the highest rating... now it makes\nme wonder where the ratings really come from. I expected so much more\nwith all the good actors in this movie. I never expected Samuel l\nJackson, Leo DiCaprio, or Jamie fox to be in a movie this horrible.\n"
"\nQuentin Tarantino needs to undergo some serious rehab before directing\nanother movie. This movie was as racist as it gets with the gratuitous\nuse of the N word and the over-hyped violence of white men torturing\nand killing black men and black men taking vengeance on white men.\nHistorically, the film is schizophrenic jumping from what appears to be\nthe 1880s in the mountainous West, right down to the costumes and the\nweapons to the ol' southern plantation life of the pre-civil war twenty\nfive-years earlier. (With shots of hilly California thrown in for good\nmeasure.) The only saving grace of this movie is Christoph Waltz as the\nGerman bounty hunter and Jamie Foxx looking uncomfortable on horseback.\nFor the life of me, I don't understand what prompted Leon DiCaprio to\ntake part in this fraud.\n"
"\nThe movie started with some potential. I like the bounty hunter but\nafter the initial appearance the movie just repeated itself over and\nover and over and over. It was the same predictable scene in a\ndifferent place and with different characters. Further as the movie\nprogressed, the action became more absurd but because the movie was not\nfunny or entertaining, it just became a drag. Midway through the film I\njust wanted both bounty hunters, all the slaves, and all the slavers to\ndie in an brief atomic blast so I can just leave the theater.\nUnfortunately I was there with 2 friends and I really didn't want to\nruin their night though I discovered that they hated the movie too...\nwe should have all asked for our money back.<br><br>These types of movies are just garbage. All artistic, without any\nsubstance or any reason to be made into a movie but hey, its the land\nof the free so to all their own. Next time just do us a favor and put a\nhuge warning on the poster with the words \"Artsy Farsty\" so we all know\nwhat we are paying for.\n"
"\nAfter the huge success of this movie over the past few weeks I started\nwondering what is Tarantino's winning recipe for this movie. Was it the\ndepiction of brutality African people were subjected to during the\nslavery? Certainly not, since there are movies that do a much better\njob in that area. Was it the spaghetti western style? Not the best one\nin that area either. The satirical portrayal of some characters or\nsituations? The movie has its funny moments, but with all of my\ngenerosity I could not call it a comedy nor a satire. And then it\nstruck me. Profanity. Profanity spiced with a few jokes and the right\ndose of blood spatter. Thinking back to his previous work I started to\nsee the pattern. This recipe seems to be very successful with the\naudience. Why not give the masses what they want, right? That one\nworked for Rome too. At least for a while. It seems to me the prophecy\nof the movie Idiocracy regarding our society is becoming a reality much\nsooner than expected.\n"
"\nBeing a big Tarantino fan, I was exited for this film, and I did not\nget disappointed! It was fantastic! The film played truly to\nTarantino's style and with the use of good music, I felt it was a\n'Tarantino film'.<br><br>Lets start off with the actors, most of the cast did a great job\nperforming. However, Christoph Waltz, Samuel L Jackson, Leonardo Di\nCaprio and Kerry Washington stood out the most! When you have all of\nthem in one scene, you know its gonna be a good one! Jamie Foxx did a\ngreat job as Django, but didn't shine like the others.<br><br>The actual film was amazing! The plot was more complex than it sounds,\nit's not just 'A slave gets revenge on a plantation owner who has his\nwife'. There are many other paths the film goes into. The film was\nlonger than most Tarantino films and you start to think, 'Mabye a\ncouple of scenes should have been taken out'. But then it's hard to\nthink of a scene to cut out! I suppose the KKK scene wasn't very\nrelevant, but it was a great scene! This film should not be missed!\n"
"\nAbsolutely zero artistic merit. The only reason why this is getting any\nratings at all is because Hollywood is fawning over anything that makes\nthe black man the hero.<br><br>One dimensional characters, horrid dialogue, poor pacing and even worse\nspecial effects.<br><br>Jamie Foxx is one of the absolute biggest racists in Hollywood and this\nmovie definitely plays to his sad strengths. <br><br>Anything, I guess for him to be able to beat on the white man for their\nenslavement of blacks. Well guess what? That was over one hundred and\nfifty years ago. Isn't it time y'all got the hell over it?<br><br>This movie should have been burnt in a fire.\n"
"\nThis is a waste of time. Very predictable and unrealistic. For one, why\nis Leonardo DiCaprio playing in this type of movie. He is not\nbelievable as a Bad A or tough guy. Jamie Fox is no cowboy / bounty\nhunter. There is no chance that Jamie Foxx is going to be the next\nClint Eastwood. Casting was terrible. I did find one thing very\nentertainingThese \"actors\" are anti-firearm / Second Amendment. Hmmm,\nand they are trying to cash in on a movie based on saving a poor\ndefenseless slave girl and fighting oppressors &amp; tyranny with FIREARMS.\nThe hypocrisy of the whole thing ruins it.<br><br>Don't waste your money.\n"
"\nOver rated indeed...<br><br>The movie had several points where something could have been made with\nit or done with the characters - but all were lost...<br><br>Waltz was amazing and really the only saving grace to the movie. Had he\nnot been in it, I would not have finished it. DeCaprio was decent, and\ndefinitely the second best in a movie of underwritten characters.\nJackson was a horrible actor in a horrible role - amazing that he felt\nit was an Oscar worthy performance...<br><br>The special effects were over the top and not realistic - but I think\nthat gore is what it was going for - but between that and the violence,\nI was lost in the point.<br><br>Definitely not worth the Oscar buzz it got, and another loser from a\nwriter/director that has so much undirected, unrefined talent...\n"
"\nTarantino's third casting choice Jamie Foxx plays Django, a freed slave\non a quest to rescue his woman from a plantation owner played by\nDiCaprio. The aim of the movie is to satirize the Spaghetti western and\nblaxploitation film and the way to achieve this, apparently, is to\nbotch the entire thing as humanly possible as to make the end result so\nunwatchable, no one in their right minds could offer a serious critique\nanymore.<br><br>The film consists primarily of intentionally bad shoot-em-up scenes,\nsuperfluous dialog, outrageous yet totally unwitty cinematic clichés,\nlousy editing and ridiculous cameos. The soundtrack has to be heard to\nbe believed.<br><br>The heap of adolescent nonsense Tarantino has been writing/directing\nover the last decade or so fails to meet any expectations one might\nhave had after seeing Pulp Fiction almost 20 years ago. Quentin's films\nhave been so consistently and distinctly inferior compared to that\nmasterpiece, they can hardly be considered disappointments anymore.\n"
"\nNo spoilers here. Liberal violence and lots of banter, that's the a la\ncarte menu but today's specials include using the phrase 'son of a\nbitch' so many times it deserves its own drinking game and a script\nthat generally repeats itself rather often leaving it a bit flabby\nround the edges and less taut than Tarantino classics. The violence,\nwhen it comes, seems provoked but unexpected and unnecessary for the\ncharacters involved as I could find no empathetic bond with any of the\ncharacters to explain their actions although being a QT film you know\nthat unspeakable violence is always a misplaced word away. <br><br>Given the serious themes covered it just felt really lightweight and\ndisrespectful. In interview QT seems to think he's dealt with the\nthemes quite sensitively but I couldn't see it. It is caricatured QT\nand so if there is a spoiler it's that you know exactly what you're\ngoing to get.\n"
"\nI adore Tarantino movies, but unfortunately this was not only the worst\nmovie he ever made..it was the worst movie ever made period. I like the\npremise of the story, however it was delivered in a terrible way.\nNormally Tarantino incorporates violence in a way that is both artful\nand natural for his storyline. In Django the violence seems to be\nsloppily thrown in to add the shock value that Tarantino is known for. <br><br>Tarantino is also known for his exaggerated characterization of\ndifferent social/ethnic groups...which is another quality I enjoy about\nhis films. But in Django he is so off the mark that it is despicable\nand I can not believe such great actors would agree to play these\nroles.<br><br>Like I said before I adore Tarantino movies, and I like the premise of\nDjango. However, I feel Tarantino didn't put his best effort into this\nfilm and totally misrepresented \"The South\" for both the black and\nwhite people that lived through that time.<br><br>There was so much promise for this film and it is very disappointing\nthat it was ruined by carelessness.\n"
"\nTarantino's best movies were Pulp Fiction, True Romance and Reservoir\nDogs.<br><br>Tarantino's last few films have been the same old recycled crap.\nBasically the story is about someone being wronged and then that person\ntakes violent revenge on everyone to blame for the rest of the film.\nOver and over Tarantino is spewing the same old story with gratuitously\nviolent scenes. Kill Bill, Inglorious Bastards, and now Django are all\nthe same story. I think Django is getting a lot of buzz because it\ndeals with slavery. I found Django to be sleepy and boring. The cameo\nTarantino treats audiences to is useless and unnecessary. The\ngratuitous violence is acceptable because the people killed are big,\nbad, white slave owners (yawn).<br><br>Django is not a great film. Really, it isn't. Don't be such a follower\nand pretend you enjoy it like the rest of the herd. Go see Pulp Fiction\nor True Romance if you want to see a great Tarantino flick.\n"
"\nI tried to like this movie but I didn't.<br><br>The \"story\" is really weak, only a pretext to show pointless violence\nthat someone finds funny (not me).<br><br>Waltz was OK but I didn't like his character. Foxx character on the\nother side is really awful. The way he behaves is really annoying and\nthe fact that he becomes a skilled gunman in one lesson only is really\nunbelievable.<br><br>The only actor that stands up is Di Caprio, but the violence he enjoys\nis similar to that of far fetched rated-18 horror comics; maybe\nteenagers finds that entertaining.<br><br>I expected a surprising movie I found a boring and pointless one.\n"
"\nTruly typical Tarantino effort.<br><br>Violence for the sake of it, interspersed with long-winded speeches,\nand then more ridiculous violence, and as many offensive swear words as\nhe thinks he can squeeze in. <br><br>Tarantino sticks to his usual style of stealing tricks from better\ndirectors, and then not executing them properly. He continues to cast\nsome of the biggest heavyweight actors on the planet, and then not\ntrust them to both speak and move at the same time. <br><br>Much like Inglorious he just cuts back and forward between pointless\nviolent action scenes, and then people sitting or standing still while\nhe has one of them ramble along with some story filler (very little of\nwhich makes any sense) and then back to another scene of ridiculously\nover the top violence.\n"
"\nWhen will Hollywood QUIT with the RIP-OFFS AND RE-MAKES??? This movie\nwas full of them from Blazing Saddles to Star Wars!!!! I've only got\n1000 words so go back and watch then you'll see what I'm talking about.<br><br>I went in this with the thought that a Quinton Tarantino's Movie would\nbe different. But no he even ripped himself off from the Kill Bill saga\n(Crazy 88's).<br><br>This Movie was also said to be Tarantino's venture into \"Spaghetti\nWesterns\". Yeah all noddle no sauce and still in the box.....<br><br>Hey Quinton it may have won an award or 2 but it was PURE CRAP to those\nwho still REMEMBER what a GREAT Movie was and what it should be!! This\nwas NOT IT!! From me it gets on -10 on the Snore Awards.\n"
"\nthe story was OK at first, if the doc didn't kill those two brothers.\nthose people who trades slaves are not really bad, just the world at\nthat time give them the wrong values. but they're not sine as they\ncan't change the world..<br><br>the movie was sicken me since the doc killed Calvin, he might not be a\ngood guy, but he follow the law at least. And Django is just evil, he\ndidn't save that slave who ate by dogs, and he killed so many innocent\npeople, it's really awful he went back and slaughter all the people,\nincluded the unarmed woman. and he was like a hero in this stupid\nmovie.<br><br>I agree that the whole slave thing is stupid, but this movie is giving\npeople wrong values. And i'm sure it will be one of the reasons lead to\nthe next black man crime.\n"
"\nIf you do not have 30 years of heavy drug intoxication as Mr.\nTarantino, who would need to be hospitalized, or if you're a masochist\neager for 3 hours long treatment, little worthy of attention would have\nmissed if you would not see this movie.<br><br>The only fascinating fact about these film is the phenomenon of\n\"TARANTINO\" who , with a smile on his face, feeds us with a pile of\ncrap for all this years,and we,full of gratitude,paid him for that.<br><br>Snap out of it people! Enough swallowing piles of crap at the expense\nof so-called \"artistic freedom\".<br><br>Leonardo's masterful performance is a rare bright spot.To him aging\nobviously feels good.\n"
"\nNope...no spoiler alerts here other than proper caveats to warn you\nthat you shouldn't bother watching this. I write this only because\nnobody took the trouble to warn me! Going by the Oscar wins and\navailability, decided to watch it to my complete disappointment and\ndisgust. What bad lies and nil-to-non-existent acting. When it became\nclear there was going to be no improvement in the story or the pace, I\nstopped watching. So saving you the trouble before you get as far. And\nI believe that I have to write 10 lines on a minimum to make you\nbelieve it is true. I am a history buff. I love historical fictions and\nfictional histories. This movie falls in a category all in itself.\nOther than some glossy historical costumes, it might have been set in\nWashington D.C. Since then I've read things that say there may be a\npolitical agenda in this. Nope- the independent cinema viewer in me\ncouldn't watch it long enough to agree. Unentertaining and tiresome!\n"
"\nI thought it was absolutely idiotic. OK, so Django gets a couple\nlessons in gun play and then kills 200 people without ever taking a\nbullet the rest of the movie. Not to mention he takes down 30 people at\nthe end of the movie by himself. They should have just called it Rambo\nVI. Christopher Waltz is pretty grand in it but his character makes out\nGermans to be this great altruistic people. Ya, uhm dude, hate to\ninform you of this but Germans become the worst humans in history.\nPersonally, I think it's just too touchy a subject to make an action\ncomedy about, but to each their own I guess. Honestly, I believe the\nmost intriguing character of the film is the one Samuel Jackson plays\nas an obedient former slave to Candie/DiCaprio. His character would be\nan intriguing study but in this film he merely gets a few scenes.\n"
"\nThis movie is unwatchable for those who value human life and take a\nstand in opposition to extreme violence as art. I found myself having\nto endure it as a compromise group movie choice. I walked out.<br><br>Spattering blood everywhere is not art. Art is not coming up with new\nand shocking ways to kill. Art is not found in seeing a semi-detached\nhuman head continue to bleed, the result of multiple gun shots.<br><br>Whether practiced by street crooks or fawned-over Tarantino, serial\nkilling is ghastly. When defended as art, it becomes ghastlier yet.<br><br>I know there is a market for this type of horrific violence, and that's\ntragic.<br><br>When your creative juices run dry, shoot a gun. That's Tarantino.\nThat's this movie.\n"
"\nNow I can finally say Quentin Tarantino is the most sh*tty and\noverrated director of all times, How on earth you call this movie\ngood??? its just the acting of these marvelous stars that even let me\nwatch it for these almost three fu**in hours, just his Kill bill 1 is\nthe movie I can say is worth watching, shitty director just full of\nsh*t\n"
"\nyou will be better watching an old jet lee movie or something because\nif you are in this movie for the good acting of Leonardo you wont find\nit. Jamie fox and his bad acting.. not that good really. the movie does\nnot build up to the quality that we have seen in previous movies that\ntalk about racism nor it shows anything real for that matter. the movie\ndoes not deliver the message that you might expect\n"
"\nI had to hold the control in my hand because the music would be too\nloud and the dialog too low. Good cast, though. If it hadn't been for\nthe all-star cast, I probably wouldn't have chosen it to start with. I\nhave never been disappointed with a Samuel Jackson movie, although I\ndidn't recognize him at first. Leonardo DeCaprio plays a villain with\nglee. It was well acted and believable. It was a fairly good story, I\nlike to watch a film that strays from the average and predictable,\nespecially in westerns. It well filmed, with beautiful scenery. I\nrecognized the Grand Tetons. But the film was way too long and bloody.\nI spent the last half hour just hoping for it all to end.\n"
"\nThis was a poor movie, poor actor play, except for Leo Di Caprio who\nwas very good as always, the play of Django, Brumhilda and Dr Shultz\nwere all especially poor . Completely unrealistic story, kind of stupid\neven, that could never happen in the wild wild west, they would have\nboth been killed right at the start of the movie. A cock-and-bull\nstory. Too much stupid Tarantino-like effects like fake blood and '1\nman kills 1000' scenes, a small bag of dynamite destroys a huge\nbuilding. This movie doesn't deserve its high rating, it should be a 7\nat max. I guess the stupid and blacks all voted 10 :-) and the smart\ndid not even watch it\n"
"\nIf you LOVE Tarantino flicks, you'll likely enjoy this one. It has the\ntypical Tarantino \"look\", the gratuitous - even surreal - violence, the\npointless, totally uncalled for and non-sequitor warfare, and a rather\nweak storyline.<br><br>I found myself not caring much for any of the characters after a very\nshort while. And the unbelievably good fortune of Django to take on\nDOZENS of crazed, white, Southerners and manage to kill them all\nwithout getting so much as a fleshwound strains credulity to the\nbreaking point. And then the climax of the epic is that Django gets his\ngirl back. Awww.<br><br>It wasn't horrible, but it was kinda lame.\n"
"\nA generous 5 for a few good scenes but overall just crap Worst QT\nouting ever. The whole premise is weak - the whole Dr King Schultz\ncharacter and his actions would have gotten him killed The way they\nambushed the guys and destroyed the wagon - stupid Why they didn't\nsimply buy the wife - makes no sense whatsoever The mark of a film\nmaker that has nobody in the editing room or reviewing the script and\nsaying \"this is pretty far fetched\" You have to be a real fan boy to\ngive this a good rating There are a lot of fan boys here of course I\nhope his next outing is better to say the least This wasn't Highlander\n2 bad - but it was bad\n"
"\nI guess my relationship to Quentin Tarentino's movies is one of equal\nlove &amp; hate.<br><br>Definitely I enjoy watching most of his movies; Inglorious Bastards,\nPulp Fiction, Reservoir Dogs &amp; Four Rooms are all pretty good. But on\nthe other hand I believe the Kill Bill movies to be overrated, and now\nI can add yet another movie to my \"Quentin Tarantino's  Black List\":\nDjango Unchained.<br><br>Excessive violence, blood and gore are all fine trademarks to put in\none's movie, but in this case it's just too much. And then there are\nthe endless combinations of weird cutting sequences, strange colors,\nand sounds/music/noises from a 4th grade child in a music instrument\nshop, and what about a blue velvet suit with white laces; I mean come\non; really? <br><br>in combination with an almost 3 hour runtime, i were not impressed!<br><br>My believe is, that the very same things that make some of his movies\nso very good, are the same things ruining this movie, when they are\noverdone. And they truly are; overdone.\n"
"\nInteresting plot, story and events. Above average soundtrack and good\nactors who are really amiable and suitable. Excellent photography and\ndirecting of the movie. Holds excellent messages though many things\nneed to be clearer. Just enough comedy to be mixed with drama. Sequence\nof events is good to very good but could've been much better. The movie\nwas very good and had just the perfect amount of western style\ninclusion but for most people I think they expected more in addition to\nthe amount of drama. The movie showed how crucial the slavery of black\npeople was but didn't show how crucial it was for the other blacks\n(other than him and his wife and couple of others) and this was very\ndisappointing taking into consideration how long the movie was. I think\nthe movie should've been also count as a drama and an action. Overall,\nthe movie was very good and fun to watch and sophisticated in a way,\nplus it was just enough western and drama that will not make you\ndepressed. Rating: 7.125/10 Final rating percentage: 71%\n"
"\nDon't get me wrong: I am a fan of Tarantino's works. But this one is\njust as much of a shame as 'Munich' for Spielberg or 'Inland Empire'\nfor David Lynch. It has all the signature elements of the great\ndirector, but it ridiculously falls apart. Seriously, what's this crap?<br><br>I admit that I couldn't even watch it to the end. I stopped watching it\nhalfway because there was absolutely no story unfolding. Nothing worthy\nto watch at least. Indeed, a strange character who's half a Karl\nMay-figure and half a typical Tarantino-ish mass murderer appears, then\nfrees a shady looking shade to be his partner in murders, and then they\ntry to rescue a maid. Almost two hours into the story they still\nhaven't even started. We have a ridiculous amount of fake blood\nsquirting, badly overdone violent scenes and a lot of nowadays non- PC\nexpression. Where does it lead? I don't even care. It couldn't catch my\nattention. What has Tarantino became?\n"
"\nThe story and the acting were good but the implementation could have\nbeen better. The main character is nothing more than a black Clint\nEastwood, so in that respect it's kind of a rip-off of his spaghetti\nwesterns. The musical score is terrible. It doesn't come close to\nmatching the era or the scenes themselves. Gunfights are very graphic\nand most will find them over the top. It's not something I'd put in my\ncollection, neither is it something that is good for repeated viewing.\nEveryone seems to give it rave reviews but I think it's because they\nare just Tarantino movie fans and are letting his reputation feed into\ntheir opinion.\n"
"\nHow unrealistic can a move be?? Some reviewers actually gave this movie\na 10! Based on what? It started out OK and had some situations that\nhappen, maybe. But for the last ten minutes I didn't know if I was\nwatching a western movie gone bad or the writer was just making a big\njoke of the whole thing. When Django jumps on a horse bareback, with no\nbridle and rides off with the horse under total control over the horse,\nthat about did it for me. How phony can you get! It went downhill fast\nfrom there turning a sort of interesting movie into a cartoon. I shoot\nin competition and I wish I could shoot 1/10th as good as Django. My\ngoodness. The first time he shoots a gun(a rifle), it's a 200 yard shot\nat a guy on a running horse, .....and he hit him! And he shoots from\nthe hip (not really taking aim) and never misses! How anybody could\ngive this movie high marks is a real wonder. And at the end, when he\nride his horse like he was trained for the circus, I just cracked up.\n"
"\nI could have...... washed my dirty laundry...... played with my\nneighbors dog.......brought out my cleats and kicked a ball\naround.......... but unfortunately I did none of these things and chose\nto watch \"Django Unchained\" instead.<br><br>Why people tout this movie as a work of genius is beyond me. A 3 hour\nlong runtime was hardly justified for the material at hand. The story\nis predictable and the characters (barring Stevens and Calvin)\npretentiously self-righteous and boring. <br><br>While the film did possess panache in delivery, as all Tarantinos do,\nit lacked a central character and premise strong enough to make it\nengaging. The intelligent script and characterization that is a\nhallmark of films such as \"Reservoir Dogs\", \"Pulp Fiction\", \"Death\nProof\" etc is dampened due to Django's portrayal as a virtual mute with\nan attitude.<br><br>Bottom line is, there are a lot of things that you can do in 3 hours,\nmake sure you do them.\n"
"\nGreat start, Tarantino is a favorite of mine but this goes on, and on,\nand round in circles, and on... and I thought it would never get to the\npoint, or end. Not tight, too much corn-pone corny dialog, was hoping\nthey'd shoot the bitch and get it over with. Don't know why it won\nanything, a famous director wallowing in his own cleverness.<br><br>More specifically, the film is not tight, like I expect from Tarantino.\nWhy spend hours in tense dialog and repetitive situations when you can\njust get to the point. And the endless tension of \"ooh he might kill or\ndo something nasty to the black person\" gets boring, and it's to easy.\nAnd for once his musical interludes just annoy me and sometimes seem\ntotally inappropriate.<br><br>Watch the start, leave early and miss the last two or so hours.\n"
"\nA bounty hunter helps a slave rescue his wife. Tarantino has a sick\nobsession with violence. In films like \"Pulp Fiction\" and \"Inglorious\nBasterds,\" the scripts are so interesting that one can overlook the\nblood-fest. Unfortunately, the script for this Western is so long and\ndreary that the repellent violence can't be ignored. The film actually\ngets off to a fairly engaging start, thanks to a gem of a performance\nfrom Waltz as dentist slash bounty hunter. Foxx is much less\ninteresting as Django, a perpetually angry and arrogant slave. Things\ntake a turn for the dreary when DiCaprio enters the picture as an evil\nslave owner. Soon thereafter the film runs out of steam but still\nrambles on for about an hour.\n"
"\nAnother disappointment from Tarantino. A juvenile, self-indulgent and\nboring movie from a video rental clerk that repeats the same gimmicks\nas all the previous movies since Jackie Brown, his masterpiece.\nPointless music, pointless violence, pointless humor and a pointless\nstory. A western blood-fest with a hip-hop soundtrack made to look like\na black power movie, please.<br><br>Still hoping that Tarantino would group up and become the great film\nmaker that he was becoming with his first three movies. Now he just\nmakes pointless and violent genre bending movies with no ambition. The\nmovies have become his persona playground with no artistic vision or\nambition.\n"
"\nThis movie seemed rushed, and pointless. He has done enough revenge\nmovies already! I didn't care about any of the characters. I normal\nlike the soundtracks of Tarantino's movies, but I didn't like hearing a\nrap (or whatever you call it) song in a western. People complained\nabout the number of times they said the word n*gg*r. That didn't really\nbother me. Its a movie about slavery. The usage did, it sounded to\nmodern. It was funny, a whole theater full of people didn't bat an eye\nover a man getting beat to death. Yet they all jumped and cringed every\ntime someone said n*gg*r. It was filled with the usual references and\nhommages to the genre Tarantino is ripping off. Like the cameo by\n\"Hang'Em Highs\" Bruce Dern. An like Django spelling his name to the\nreal Django, Franco Nero. Which I liked. But it seemed forced. This\nmovie just seemed like a good idea that was poorly executed to me.\n"
"\nI felt compelled to create an account just so I could give this film a\nreview of 1. It's a shame that you cannot give a review of 0.<br><br>There is not much to say other than it is just plain boring. Waltz\nmanages to give it something positive but once he is killed the movie\nbecomes unwatchable.<br><br>Foxx is boring and bland. The best movie I saw Foxx in was Any Given\nSunday. Since then...nothing from this guy. <br><br>The violence and constant use of N****r gets boring after about 5\nminutes. <br><br>The jokes aren't funny.<br><br>What more to say? <br><br>The most ridiculous moment is when Django is being transported to the\nmines. Here we get a guest appearance by Tarantino and John Jarrat an\nAussie actor. This scene is completely insane, the guys are Australians\nin the US. In 1858...very unlikely and there is no sense or reason for\nthem to be there. OK so Tarantino does cool weird movies that don't\nmake sense but this was just plain sh*t and added nothing to the story.<br><br>Just plain bad. Nothing more to say, please don't waste your time.\n"
"\nDjango Unchained is filmmaker Quenton Tarantino's latest off-beat\nadventure for the big screen. Highlighting this film are great\nperformances by Christoph Waltz, Jamie Foxx, Samuel L. Jackson and an\nensemble supporting cast that includes former television stars Don\nJohnson, Tom Wopat, Bruce Dern, Don Stroud and Amber Tamblyn. However,\nit is the sharp performance of Leonardo DiCaprio as the cruel and\nmerciless plantation owner Calvin Candie that steals the show in this\nviolent tale set in the south prior to the civil war. Inspired by the\n1966 Italian made western Django, Tarantino wrote a script for this\nfilm that accent and combine his unique style of filmmaking with the\n\"spaghetti western\" genre while presenting an eye-opening look at\nslavery in the deep- south during that period. In typical Tarantino\nfashion this movie was not made for the faint of heart with its extreme\ngraphic depiction of violence and torture...so be warned. Even though\nthis movie runs long at just under 3 hours it maintains your interest\nat a high level.\n"
"\nWhile throwing money down a sinkhole will not employ an entire cast of\ncoat hangers(actors) it does compare to junk food. Ultra violence, then\na chuckle, then more violence and a big ooh and a ha ha. So forth it\ngrinds. Until you cast an eye around the cinema to discover yourself\nsurrounded by teenage minds caught in a emotional seesaw of an\ninfantile relapse. And then our hero gets the girl in the end like a\nkick in the shin. I could also have feed the pigeons with the popcorn.\nDecoupage narratives from this director are so last century. So\nTarantino, that you would want to forget the many works he references\nendlessly only to discover these for yourself. There is basically no\nway this piece of junk could have been saved by another director. As\nevery element save the cinematography and costumes reek of sloppy work.\n"
"\nWaltz and Jackson were great. The story should have ended shortly after\nDr. Shultz loses in a cheap buy for Django's wife. Good story to that\npoint, but from there it turns to fantasy.<br><br>Ten lines needed to complete--okay. At the end Django hides behind a\nbody and shoots who knows how many rifle and pistol shooters. These\nshooters can only hit the body he is hiding behind. These are shooters\nwho are used to firearms, but they can't hit the Django--what B.S.\nAfter the Candie episode, It should have been cut short without all the\nfantasy at the end. I thought Shultz should have shook hands and ended\nthe film shortly thereafter. I guess I got hyped into going to a\ntheater to see this movie as I expected more from Tarantino in his\nediting abilities.\n"
"\nQuentin Tarantino's Django Unchained is a long movie so be prepared. It\nis set during the slave period of the US south and there are very\ngraphic depictions of the physical violence used during that time.\nJamie Foxx does a fine job as Django, a slave required by a bounty\nhunter Dr King Shultz, played by Christoph Waltz, to identify brothers\nthat are wanted for crimes. As Django and Shultz team up the movie\nunfolds with much violence and use of the \"N\" word. It reaches a point\nwhere Dr Shultz is killed and that is where the movie ends in my mind.\nShultz was by far the most interesting character in the movie and after\nhis death, I did not care anymore. Leonardo DiCaprio overplayed his\nrole as he can easily do as a villainous slave and plantation owner.\nActors Samuel Jackson and Don Johnson both were excellent in their\nrespective roles but Christoph Waltz was the standout in this film and\nas mentioned, after his death, there is no movie anymore.\n"
"\nOverall, I was disappointed with the movie. I'm a fan of Tanantino and\nlike many of his movies, other wise I wouldn't have bothered with this\none.<br><br>It started out well, both funny and violent, but spoof violent and\ngory, kind of tongue in cheek. The actors and actresses acted very\nwell, and the sets and costumes were well done.<br><br>The problem I had was the movie became less interesting and more brutal\nand violent just for the sake of being violent. It didn't enhance the\nstory and actually detracted from it. I found the later half to be\nsomewhat far fetched, and far less entertaining than the first half. I\nthink the movie would have been better with a completely different 2nd\nhalf.\n"
"\nI was looking forward to this movie and even more after I learned that\nChristoph Waltz, who impressed me in Inglorious bastards is playing\nhere as well. The idea of the movie was ... interesting, director did a\ngreat job, Christoph Waltz was again flawless and Quentin Tarantino did\nagain very good job at taking only inspiration from the original and\nnot just copy it (which I value highly in these times when big\npercentage of Hollywood movies are just copies). So... why only 6/10? I\nknow that black had it hard in times of slavery. Everyone does (at\nleast I hope everyone does). So why I have to watch testament to it in\naction movie? The movie would be great if it didn't waste one hour on\nthis topic. This way it was just long and I was yawing from the middle.\n"
"\nI am not a Quentin Tarantino fan. I am not a Jamie Foxx fan. Christoph\nWaltz gives me the creeps. All of the pre-film cons aside, I still\ndidn't like it. It was actually not bad for Tarantino, not too gritty\nand over-the-top. Jamie Foxx was not ridiculously over-acting for once,\nand you actually get used to him after a little while. Christoph Waltz\nplayed a really good guys and you end up rooting for him till the end.\nI still didn't like it. I can't say exactly what it was. The story too\nfar-fetched, or maybe too much just rubbing me the wrong way. I think\nparts of it may have been played to casual and others too dramatic. I\nwatched it, and I am not disappointed because I expected to hate it. I\njust dislike it. Leonardo DiCaprio, stellar performance as always, even\nas the bad guy, and thanks Tarantino for blowing yourself up, I could\nwatch that scene again and again!\n"
"\nOOOOOOHHHHHHHHH.....<br><br>Hey everyone, Tarantino has a new movie out and it's controversial and\nuses the word ni**er a lot. It must be good. No...it WILL be good\nbecause I want it to be so badly.<br><br>Thanks a lot you hoighty toighty Harvard educated critics - you're\nsupposed to protect us from this crap.<br><br>This movie is sooooo overrated. Save your money and your time. Long\ngone are the days of 'dogs' and 'romance', Tarantino has lost his\ntouch.<br><br>Ugggghhhhh....\n"
"\nNo kidding, Samuel Jackson just absolutely nailed his Uncle Tom role.\nHe was hilarious. Not the best role for DiCaprio but he did OK as well.\nDon Johnson was cool and James Remar is always good. Not Tarantino's\nbest but an enjoyable slice of historical fiction even though it was\nrife with plot holes and quite unlikely scenarios. Fan's of Samuel\nJackson should consider it a must see. Even though I really like James\nRemar, Tarantino should noy have used him for two separate roles. It\nwas a bit confusing. Especially when all of the other cameos (Lee\nHorsely, Tom Wopat, etc)were cool and he could have dredged up so many\nmore forgotten actors to appear.\n"
"\nboring and baffling..i don't get it...the tone is wrong. is Tarantino\ntrying to be funny? serious? what's he trying to say? there's an odd,\nif not downright insensitive, dissonance between the historical\nsuffering underlying the narrative and absurdity of django's\n'liberation' story...'django' was basically another 'white-boy-fantasy-\nfilm,' except this time around Tarantino gets to vicariously be the\navenger through 'django.' it's no different than the white hero in\navatar saving the planet from the super-evil-eco-wreckers, or kevin\ncostner saving the loud- mouthed, spoiled black girl in 'bodyguard,' or\ntom cruise going to battle with the samurais saving japan's honor in\n'the last samurai...'<br><br>it's too bad...this film was just cheap. 'pulp fiction' is one of my\nfavorites of all time. i didn't even mind 'inglourious basterds'\nbecause at least with Nazis, they're so universally hated you can get\naway with irreverence and humor...here, Tarantino was out of bounds...\n"
"\nI love Tarantino, but this one was so far over the top, you couldn't\neven see the top from where I was. Although there were a couple of good\nTarantino-esque scenes of dialog, there wasn't enough to sink my teeth\ninto. Jamie Foxx was solid. Christoph Waltz was excellent as usual. Leo\nD. had his moments. Samuel L. Jackson was terrific as the house slave,\nplaying somewhat against type (although subservient, he was still\nirascible and no pushover, so that was in keeping with his usual\npersona.) The characters' actions were generally uninteresting and the\naction was predictable. The violence was over the top, even for QT. How\nmany times can he show a bullet causing someone's head/chest/leg/arm to\nexplode? It wasn't boring by any means, it just didn't live up to my\nhopes for it. QT is so in love with playing with the filmic conventions\nof his youth, he sometimes forgets to make a good film.\n"
"\nThis film is shameful on several levels. First, it disgustingly\nviolent. Second, it glorifies violence. Third, it shows violence as\nfunny. Fourth, it is outrageously racist- every white (other than a\nGerman) is sinister, and most are stupid. Fifth, this racism is used to\njustify the first three points. Sixth, while some of the plot twists\nare clever, several are just ridiculous, and covered by the typical\ndevice of moving so quickly that you don't have time to consider how\nimprobable they are. Other than the foregoing, it is pretty good-\nfast-paced and sometimes funny. But how can anyone be so desensitized\nthat he/she does not appreciate how offensive and dangerous this is?\nThere is more to life than entertainment.\n"
"\nLast night me and my mates decided to watch a movie. We had a lot to\nchoose from - 'Pulp Fiction', 'The Watch', 'Fight Club', 'Dredd' and\nlast but not least - 'Django Unchained'. After a long discussion about\nwhat should we choose - we decided to go with Django.<br><br>When the movie ended - me and my mates went like - 'Woa! That was\nAMAZING!' And it truly was. 'Django unchained features stunning acting\n(especially DiCaprio and Waltz), a lot of violence, a great soundtrack\nand most importantly - a well made plot.<br><br>In conclusion, if you are looking for something to watch with friends\nor alone, if you want to see a good movie that's well acted, scripted\nand directed then 'Django Unchained' is for you!<br><br>Simply - Tarantino at his best!\n"
"\nWhat happened here? Where is the magic? The unique Tarantino's touch?\nWhere the originality, the fresh dialogs, the smart plot? This movie is\nboring, flat, badly written and worse acted. The story is predictable\nto the point it's annoying. The good guy is so good, the bad guy so\nbad. Why? We don't know, as they are not 3D characters but cardboard\npuppets. In fact, the whole movie feels like a puppet show. And then\nthose cheesy flashbacks showing the sweet couple during their sweet\ndays! What is this, a telenovela? I am sorry Tarantino, because\nobviously the loss of Ms Menkes has affected the quality of his\nproduction terribly. I hope he will recover it soon and give us again\nthe special films that made him one of the greatest artists of\ncinematography. Django, what a disappointment!\n"
"\nFrankly, this was a really boring movie with too much unnecessary\nviolence. But since the director is Tarantino, criticizing this movie\nis some sort of taboo. If you have seen some of Tarantino's work, there\nis nothing new in this one. Blood, violence, boring conversations and a\nstory that has nothing special. Heads explode, bodies tear apart and\npeople dies. That is the one sentence summary. I am not even mentioning\nthe references that would be counted as racist. Moral of the story,\nthis movie is not my cup of tea. Neither the action justifies itself\nfor such a long period of time nor the story is interesting enough to\ncompensate for the violence which was totally unnecessary.\n"
"\nQuentin Tarantino is quite possibly the master of popcorn cinema -\nentertaining films that give an illusion of depth while actually being\nincredibly shallow. This is another fine example of this genre and if\nyou take it for that, you'll be sure to enjoy the film immensely.\nEspecially the first half is incredibly funny and Christoph Waltz\nshines as the incredibly subtly named \"Dr. King\" that frees Django and\nturns him into a bounty hunter. There's good dialogue, decent action\nscenes and just enough of a story to keep you entertained for almost\ntwo hours. Sadly, the film lasts for almost three and would have\ngreatly benefited from some serious editing. At some point, I just\nwanted it to end, especially when Tarantino's usual gore-fest took over\nin the last third of the film. If you are trying to find out whether\nyou'll enjoy the film: that's quite easy. If you like any other\nTarantino film, you'll like this one. If you don't care for his\n\"style\", this one won't change your mind. So really, it's just more of\nthe same, solid albeit uninspired entertainment.\n"
"\nLast week I managed to watch Django Unchained and I have to say that I\nam a little disappointed about what on the screen happened. I expected\nan outstanding movie which presents well done dialogs, awesome\nscreenplay and compelling atmosphere.In my opinion none of the points\nabove were fulfilled. This was Tarantinos worst done movie. Just too\ncheesy and low for being nominated for an academy award. Compared to\nthe previous movies, Django Unchained is a boring nearly 3 hour\ntorture. Everybody in my environment is keen about Django, but I can\nnot understand why. Hopefully Kill Bill 3 will be better than Django\nUnchained! Sorry Django, 4/10\n"
"\nThis film is just another one in which Tarantino resorts to truly\nunnecessary violence and bloodshed in order to draw the attention of a\ncrowd of a dubious taste. It is as if he doesn't care at all about the\nartistic quality of his work. It is all blood and death and\ndestruction. All characters and incidents are extremely exaggerated.\nThis film has certainly not been made to claim a place in the history\nof cinema. I'd rather like to remember Tarantino as the prodigal\ndirector of extremely creative, low-budget films such as \"Pulp Fiction\"\nor \"Reservoir Dogs.\" Artistic genius is NOT measured by how much the\nartist earns; it is measured by how much his art is valued how long his\nworks are remembered.\n"
"\nOK. Let me tell you this, I am not a hater of Tarantino. I just wasn't\nall that impressed about this movie. I like half of the film, that's\nwhy I gave it a 5 out of 10. Now let me tell you why the other half\nwasn't that good in my opinion.<br><br>First of all, haven't we seen this before? Tarantino uses the same\nstructure in scenes over and over again. I like his movies, but this\nwas too much of the same. We have seen this before. I thought it would\nbe different this time around, and he would surprise me again. <br><br>Secondly, too much scenes just for the shock. Black dildo + predictable\nover the top blood scene ending. <br><br>Thirdly, a dirty south hip hop track halfway in the movie? Come on.\nHave more style Tarantino.<br><br>(In the voice of Christoph Waltz) \"DjangO is not a BINGO for\nTarantino!\"\n"
"\nLooks like Tarantino is getting old and jaded. He generally has a small\nacting role in his movies, in this one he looked like Elvis in the\nlatter part of his career and so does the movie. Going through the\nmotions with little emotional involvement or imagination. I am actually\nquite a fan of Tarantino and had hoped to see his equivalent of Clint\nEastwood's Unforgiven but left the theater disappointed. The movie was\nfar too long for what was on offer (not that much) and the ending\nseemed to be a 20 minute add on to meet blood and gore quotas and\nnothing more. As regards acting, this movie should leave a few of the\nfamous thinking like Silvester Stallone after he made Rhinestone. I\nunderstand he basically paid to have that movie taken out of\ncirculation. Samuel Jackson, in particular, may soon be doing the same.\nHis role was far from sympathetic, but made worse by overacting. Don't\ngive up the day job Quentin.\n"
"\nQuentin Tarantino made a few excellent movies in his carrier, but in a\nlast few years, i guess he is lacking out of inspiration. He is\nstarting (like most of directors and actors in last few years) to make\nrandom movies about random things that pop his mind, and he gets credit\nfor it, on account of his previous fame. This movie i can compare to a\nInglorious Bastards. I contains lot of unnecessary scenes (too many),\ndoesn't have a point, and it isn't even that funny. Blood is everywhere\nin this film and its suppose to be funny?! Its not. Director put in\nthis movie every random thought that crosses his mind. Dialogues are\nsupposed to be witty and clever, but they are really not, like they are\nfor example in Reservoir Dogs, Pulp fiction. I can describe this movie\nlike \"wannabe Puplp Fiction\", and it failed hard. Even various\nsoundtrack themes are not fitting in picture, and they are out of place\n(i mean Rap music?! wtf). Watch this movie if u don't have anything\nbetter to watch (and u always do have). 5/10\n"
"\nHighly entertaining movie! It's Quentin, so expect some flying blood\nand language. The basic story was endearing, but of course I didn't\ncome away feeling all gushy and stuff - which is good cause I probably\nwould be rating this movie lower if I had. <br><br>There were some very funny moments in the film. I laughed out loud\nnumerous times. Also, there are some classic Tarantino shots - like all\nthe gunman coming into the house at one time. Stuff blew up and people\nwere in shoot outs - right up my ally!!!<br><br>I wish I had a better memory cause there are some awesome lines in\nthis. Samuel L. Jackson threw out some fabulous one liners. They\nprobably wouldn't be as funny out of context though. Still, he I think\nhad the best funny lines. <br><br>Obviously, I recommend the movie. It's Oscar nominated for a reason. I\ndo recommend you NOT let children see this though. It's Tarantino. <br><br>Favorite Scene: The Klan discussing the bags. Don Johnson was great!\n"
"\nI am surprised to see such high ratings. I for one did not like this\nmovie. There are some positives to it: a great performance for the\nsecondary actor, a powerful social picture of all the bad things humans\nare capable of doing to one another. But a part from that i found the\nmovie unsatisfying<br><br>1. It is too long for the story that is depicted, the action is slowly\nrevealing, and there is no substance, no subtle meat to fill in the\nvoid. It's just a movie made by a director who played cowboys when he\nwas a kid and got a bit twisted to his head as an adult. <br><br>This movie is not about the pain of slaves in the 18 hundreds - it\ncould have been, but in stead it turned out to be simply a movie about\ncowboys that shoot each other in very unrealistic forms.\n"
"\nOK OK How good is Django really? I am a real Quinton fan. this movie is\ngood to watch if you if you know his style. It has a message of\nredemption and empowerment. I like seeing Jamie Fox and other ethnic\nactors getting top roles. As far as original, this effort is dull. He\nborrowed the success of Hans Lander from Inglorious. Samuel Jackson's\nrole is just another movie for him to be in. As far as using slavery as\na plot i would rather see more serious depictions in movies that\nenlighten us and drive us to improve our outlook toward a better\nfuture. The difference between Inglorious Basterds and this movie is\nthat we do not have a race of people that we still have a derogatory\nword that is harming us as people. The N word is old in Quinton's\nmovies and why do we still use it to make millions at the box office.\nNot really a great movie. Lets see if Quinton has it in him to do a\nmovie without needing two hours of the N word.\n"
"\nIf you have nothing better to do with two and a half hours of your\ntime, and ten dollars to blow, then watching this movie might suit your\npurposes.<br><br>Witty dialog doth not a movie make. The piece just seemed to drag on\nand on an on. At the end, I walked out of the cinema not really knowing\nwhat the movie had been about. It was like being at a fairground and\ndrinking a huge raspberry milkshake that was very tasty, and then\ndiscarding the container and moving on to the next thing.<br><br>Anyways, the dialog was amusing, which is probably where the good\nratings come from. But I can hardly remember having watched it.\n"
"\nThis movie was absolutely amazing ,I knew that I was going to love it\nbecause Jamie Foxx is one of my favorite actors. The message behind the\nmovie was powerful and deep.The details in the scenes were right own\npoint.The actors and actresses they played those roles to the core.I\nhave watched this movie over 10 times literally.\n"
"\nThe whole movie is so exciting and surrounding. The whole crew is acted\nWonderfully!! Oddly, the rather blank, stoic Django is the least\ninteresting character in this violent, somewhat uneven film. In his\nprevious film, Inglourious Basterds, Quentin Tarantino told a\nmasterfully sprawling story of WWII, bending history willy-nilly to\nfind a more truthful center. DJANGO UNCHAINED is even longer and more\nsprawling but with a much simpler story and themes. It doesn't quite\nfit. The movie has long, flabby stretches that scream for the\ncutting-room floor, while the bursts of violence often feel outsized\nand misplaced.\n"
"\nI enjoyed the movie for the first hour and a half - the cinematography\nwas excellent, the acting was superb, but the story dragged and became\nvery predictable. I especially liked how Tarantino used actors you\nhaven't seen in a while in small to medium roles, like Don Johnson, Tom\nWopat (Dukes of Hazzard fame), Bruce Dern, Jonah Hill, all nicely done.\nIf you just love Tarantino, then you will love this film. Plenty of\ncursing, blood, gruesome violence - all the things that make his films\nmemorable. In the second half of the film, I got the feeling he was\ntrying to break a world's record for how many times he can squeeze the\n\"n\" word into the script. Dialog was good, but not as entertaining as\nhis previous scripts - the one notable exception was the banter between\nDon Johnson's band of riders. The gem of the movie was Christoph\nWaltz's performance - outstanding.<br><br>I give the film a 5/10 because of the last hour or so - the violence\nwas Tarantino's style, but it was just too much and would have been\nmore effective with just a little less.\n"
"\nI was engaged in this movie from minute one....just the soundtrack\nmixed with the images makes you want to see where the story goes. Jamie\nFoxx does all that it's required from him in the main role with a\ngreat, Oscar winning, performance from Christoph Waltz who can be\ncharming, funny, and charismatic all in a role that you don't\nnecessarily root for in the beginning. Their chemistry is what drives\nthis movie and it does it rather well. The cinematography here is top\nnotch and Tarantino proves he's probably the director that most wisely\nchooses songs for his movies... What takes this movie in my opinion to\nepic status is Leo's surprising role as a villain who most couldn't see\nDicaprio do...but he excels in this role. Overall is a movie that\ndoesn't bore you for one minute and it's part of my personal\nfavorites!!\n"
"\nBehind awesome action , dialogue and bit of comedy lies story of only\nblack western hero. I personally don't like creating gay/black/trans\netc. characters just to gain likes from those groups but this time\nTarantino give black people hero they deserve. It doesn't feel forced\nand it goes nice with plot. <br><br>My favorite scene is when Django shoots John Brittle. The music , the\nacting , camera-work are just perfect. That scene was just powerful.\nBlack man comes to plantation riding horse , dressing how he wants ,\nspeaking openly and shoots white plantation overseer and then whips\nanother. Reactions from black folk who work at plantation are just\npriceless and you can see that justice has been done in their eyes.\nRuthless overseers get what they deserve from hands of black man. It\ngave them hope and strength to endure everything that was coming to\nthem.<br><br>Bottom line , its another Tarantino classic with outstanding writing,\ncharacters and directing.Maybe Tarantino's best movie because behind\nall signature violence and cursing and fun hides a powerful message.\n"
"\nI just recently chose to watch this movie. I avoided it for the longest\ntime as I consider the subjugation of a people based on elements of\ntheir birth to be heart breaking and morally wrong. I must say that\n'Jamie Foxx's' promotion of the movie by saying 'I killed all the white\nfolk', did not encourage my interest in the movie. That being said...\nafter watching the movie, it is truly a WELL directed and tasteful\nmovie. While demonstrating the vulgarity of slavery, the story so\nelegantly intertwines a story of both redemption and righteousness. I\ntip my hat 'Good Sir'... a truly well written, directed and performed\nmovie.\n"
"\nThis is a very fun Tarantino flick that's at the same time one of his\nbest ones. This movie is very good at entertaining the viewers and at\nthe same time showing them the cruelty of slavery that makes you doubt\nhumanity. Watching the perfect portrayal of Django, Von Schaft, Candie,\nStephen,And especially Dr.Schulz who is so awesome you can't believe\nit. And like in every Tarantino movie one of the main characters dies\nto soon in this case it's sadly Dr. Schulz and also in this movie is\nthe quirky Tarantino humor that we all love. I can only recommend this\nmovie to Tarantino, Western or only casual movie lovers, OK, who am I\nkidding? Everybody should watch this movie.\n"
"\nI ignored the hype around this movie for a long time, mostly because\nmany years ago I had seen Reservoir Dogs and did not enjoy it. This\nmovie made me a Tarantino fan, after watching this film I went back and\nwatched all of Tarantino's films and loved them all, including\nReservoir Dogs. The incredible acting performance by Christoph Waltz is\none of the highlights of this film. I believe Waltz might be one of the\nbest currently active actors out there right now and whether or not you\ndislike or like Quentin Tarantino films, I would urge anyone to watch\nthis film solely to see what great acting is. Furthermore, the story is\ncaptivating and the way this film handles slavery and American history\nat this point in time is handled in a way that I have yet to see in\nanother film. Of course, this movie is 100% Tarantino and is incredibly\nviolent but if you're a fan of Tarantino, never seen a Tarantino movie,\nor enjoy great movies, watch this now.\n"
"\nTarantino's creativity unleashes in a western that has the fun of every\nsuperhero movie and the sheer class of every Oscar winner. Admitelly\nNot a film for everyone but if you can get past the more \"unpleasant\"\nparts than you're in for a ride <br><br>The acting is off the charts and as good as DiCaprio and Jamie fox are.\nChristoph waltz and Samuel L Jackson steals the show with unique and\nlively performances. As always tarrantinos writing is something to\nbehold. Every scene in this movie is riveting even if it's just people\ntalking in a room about, nothing really. <br><br>The 3 hours running time never feels wasted and you're even left\nwanting more. A real testament to how brilliant Django is.\n"
"\nMan I never enjoyed a \"western\" so so much. I did not know what to\nexpect when I first time went to see Django and I was amazed. Quentin\nis a weird sort of a genius. When he makes something its always funny,\nsad and full of action at the same time. he really hit it with this\nmovie and I would put it in my top 15 movies of all time list, any\ntime! <br><br>Every character (actor) has done a great job and I would not change any\nof them. Well what could you even expect when you have DiCaprio, Waltz\nand Samuel L. Jackson in it. <br><br>If you still didn't see Django then you must! Even if you are not a big\nwestern movies fan you will enjoy it. Soundtrack is perfect. I didn't\nknow any of the songs that played in the movie but every song was there\nlike at the right place at the right time. <br><br>I watched Django 3 or 4 times but I get pumped up every time I do. <br><br>You only need to see the first 10 minutes to be interested in it.\n"
"\nThis is an exceptionally good movie. Some of the scenes of violence\nagainst people are great to watch. I loved watching villainous people\ngetting hurt and killed. That first shooting scene at the Candieland\nplantation was intense and extremely gripping. The treatment of slaves\nin the movie is just about as horrible as black slaves in America were\never treated which makes the revenge violence more pleasing. The music\nis great in it. One of my favorite scenes is where Django is riding a\nhorse and is dressed up in 18th century clothes and is looking\ndignified and the song 'His name was king.' or whatever it's called\nplays. That is a very funny part of the movie.\n"
"\nWhat an interesting film. The soundtrack is to never be forgotten, the\nacting was simply incredible (Christoph Waltz was especially my\nfavorite in this film), and the story is unique and emotionally moving.\nYes, it has the typical plot of one trying to fight back for his girl,\nbut it is SO much more than just that. You witness the reality of the\nbrutality toward the slaves, the compassion of slave- rights activists\n(such as Christoph Waltz's character), and the reality of needing to\nalways fight for what you want. <br><br>If Django Unchained taught me anything, it's that there are more forces\nout there stopping and discouraging me from achieving my goals in life\nthan there is support; the only option I have is to literally live for\nand die for success in life. In fact, I don't have any other option\nthan to live like that, unless I am OK going through life with people\nstepping all over me and my family. What a great film that will leave\nthe viewer with quite a bit more adrenaline to get rid of the real\nbullies of their lives and finally be happy with who they are.\n"
"\nA few of the characters in this film can clearly be seen calling the\nslave portrayed by Kerry Washington (Brunhilde) \"Broom Hilda\". <br><br>That's just freaking annoying. Broom Hilda is from a American comic\nstrip in modern days. NO ONE from back then would ever accidentally\ncall Kerry Washington's character \"Broom Hilda\".<br><br>Other than that HUGE irritation... I thought this film was well worth\nwatching. I've never seen Jamie Foxx do such a great job (nor Don\nJohnson, for that matter). <br><br>I was emotionally affected (meaning, I sobbed) by scenes depicting the\ncruelty dealt toward slaves in this era (and make no mistake, there are\nSTILL people being treated like this throughout the world). <br><br>Emotionally moving film. Made me cry, as mentioned. Just wish they\nwould have gotten that ONE thing right with respect to the woman's name\nand I wouldn't have then thought, \"I'm watching a movie where actors\nscrew things up!\"\n"
"\nMuch to my surprise, I liked it very much. I think that it is QT's best\nsince Reservoir Dogs. Having seen it, I am baffled by the misguided\ncommentary about the film that greeted its release. No one seemed to\nrealize that it is first and foremost a black (in both senses of the\nword) comedy. I found it extremely clever and funny throughout. Indeed,\nit seems to be as much an homage to Blazing Saddles and Skin Game as to\nthe original Django. I had my usual language objections (mild by\nTarantino standards), but not the one that seemed to bother everyone\nelse. Of course, if this were the old days, it would have benefited\nfrom an intermission that separated the first section from the Candie\nLand section. (I gave it a B.)\n"
"\nI did not enjoy this movie as much as I thought I would. Since\nChristopher waltz was in it. Which he totally earned that Oscar win for\nhis performance. But Jamie Fox's performance was not that impressive\nand the movie seemed to drag on for me. I do not think it should have\nbe nominated for best picture but it would have been better than Argo.\nLeonardo DiCaprio did a fairly good job in his role and I enjoyed him.\nI also liked Samuel Jackson who in my opinion was very funny. So\noverall I give it a 5 and I encourage you to watch it, you might like\nit better than I did. Oh and one more thing Kerry Washington was not\nthat bad and I am not a big fan of her acting.\n"
"\nNobody cares, all right, but I have to confess a thing before starting\nthis review: the 'Dlame thing' isn't mine, it's a friend of mine that\nsaid so, a genius short analysis if I might say. I would stop this\nwriting right there, with that word but IMDb needs ten lines at least,\nso let's get a bit deeper into the subject. The movie is watchable, and\nthat is a good news because Tarantino is still far above the average,\nactors are pretty good but only Mr. Jackson and Mr. Waltz reach a high\nlevel and the plot stick you to the chair: vengeance on racist. What is\nmissing? Editing! What happened when the camera got back to the rental\nhouse and the computer got turned on? Nobody knows but I believe it\nmessed things up. The editor changed and the work isn't good. Who's\nfault is it? No clue, because in movie making 2+2 is equal to whatever.\n"
"\nThe first scenes of this film are very promising. It is intelligently\nfunny and the the effects of alienation in setting, costumes and also\nhow the actors play their roles are really aesthetic. Even the killings\nare that way. Therefor one doesn't take them too seriously and they\ndon't spoil the fun watching at first. After a while though I began to\nwait for more fun and more smartness. Instead there came unnecessary\nbrutality and killing. The fun was mixed in and a bitter taste came to\nit all. I waited for the next scene and told my children that now it\nwill be smart again but it never happened, instead it became even more\ncruel. Like that not smartness, speed and humor win but becoming as bad\nas the enemies. Still Django is the hero! The characters are very well\nchosen and the roles are acted out very well. Only Django himself is\nnot totally convincing.\n"
"\nI am not a Quentin Tarantino fan. I regard many of his films as relying\non the materialism of ultra-violence, sex, drugs - without any essence\nof an engaging storyline or intriguing plot.<br><br>Throughout the two thirds of this movie, I really thought it would be\ndifferent. It was a great story, action-packed, funny, edgy. It kept\ntrue to all that is Tarantino, whilst (in my opinion) offering an\nenjoyable storyline that kept me wholeheartedly interested.<br><br>Then came the scene where Waltz shoots Di Caprio (if you've seen it\nyou'll know the scene) and the ridiculous gun battle breaks out with\neveryone in the house getting killed (except Django, of course). I just\nfound this part of the story, for lack of a better word, stupid. And\nfrom then on it was just a downward spiral from what really was a great\nstart, into a disappointing and senseless explosion of violence -\nkilling off any hope of a conclusion that could do justice for the very\nenjoyable first two thirds of this movie.\n"
"\nThe day this film came out I immediately ordered it on amazon. I was\nlooking forward to watching it, being a big Tarantino fan and having\nenjoyed inglorious basterds, I saw no reason why I wouldn't enjoy it.\nAfter watching it I came to the conclusion it was better than\ninglorious basterds, by some distance too. It's a blast from beginning\nto end. The plot was entertaining to watch, and it kept me guessing.\nThe dialog is hilarious in places yet serious in others which did work\nvery well. The acting is terrific, Leonardo Di Caprio did a great job\nplaying Calvin Candie, the main antagonist in the film. But the\nstandout performance has to be that of Chistopher Waltz. He was\nbrilliant to watch as 'Doctor' King schulz. He made every scene his own\n(not to say the other cast members were poor) and he really was\nbrilliant. Jamie Foxx also puts in a solid performance as Django.\nOverall I highly recommend this film, especially if you are a fan of\nTarantino.\n"
"\nFun dialog and great action. I like Christoph Waltz way more in this\nthan Inglorious Basterds. There were many scenes in this movie that I\nwent back and watched numerous times. I think some of the lines Samuel\nL. Jackson gets to deliver in this movie even top the most memorable\nones from Pulp Fiction. I wasn't into Jamie Foxx as the lead character\nmost of the time--I think I would have liked someone else better. I\nliked Leonardo in this better than anything else I've seen him in. He\nfits the role well. Some favorite parts are the exchange with Don\nJohnson when they first arrive at his plantation, the first few minutes\nwe see Sameul L. Jackson's character, and the brief conversation\nbetween Django and Betina. Not the most flowing narrative, but it kept\nme glued to the end.\n"
"\nAS much as I love Tarantino, his style is getting a little old. Django\nUnchained would be the perfect film if Tarantino's previous films\nhadn't been made. It is sharp and clever at the same time with\nexcellent packaging. The performances are outstanding, and it is\nhilarious. It is a great film. Now that I've said that, I'm going to\ngive a little warning about Tarantino's next films. This movie has no\nbackground or message to it. It can barely support itself. If It wasn't\nmade by Tarantino, it would be terrible. Let me explain. Why can he\nthrow all of these racial slurs and offensive materials at us? It isn't\nlike he's trying to prove anything. I get that he's trying to make\nsomething for the sake of it being cool, but a little heart to the film\nwould have been good. It gets by on this film, but in the future, he's\ngonna change something, or it will get tiring. I get I'm saying\nnegative things but as I said its still a great film. You've heard all\nthe positive things about it, I don't need to repeat it. GRADE: A-\n"
"\nThe Best movie ever! 10 stars! When I die I will miss my son, who I\nlove most, and movies, in movies I Will miss Quentin Tarantino. A\nexceptional, fantastic and Bombastic movie! Quentin Tarantino deserves\nall the Golden Statues. Many thanks to all the cast, especially,\nforgive me Jamie Foxx did an brilliant interpretation, but Christoph\nWaltz, for me, is radiant, superb, spices up perfectly all movies he\nenters. Christoph Waltz when enters the character he's like a big star,\nglows and we glow with him. Awesome! Thanks to all cast and crew for\nthe magic you give me and making my days more amazing. From Portugal\nall the best.\n"
"\nIn a Quentin Tarantino movie, you expect action, humor, acting and a\nhuge load of blood. In Django Unchained, he does it the right way.\nDjango Unchained is one of the most sleek and the most westernized\nmovie I have seen. Its packed with an amazing story wrapped with\nbrilliant acting. The Screenplay is Original and it is amazing. The\ndialogues are smart and witty. Django Unchained has Great performance\npacked actors. Jamie Foxx who plays Django is truly nice in this movie\nas he is playing a hard role. Leonardo DiCaprio as Calvin Candie is\namazing and delivers a hard- hitting performance. Kerry Washington is\ngood too but the stand out performance goes to Christoph Waltz who is\nthe most funniest and historic one out of all. He delivers a Oscar\nworthy supporting actor performance.<br><br>On the whole, DJANGO UNCHAINED, is a delightful movie which will make\nyou surprised and not disappointed. Watch the movie for the\nperformances and you will enjoy the movie throughout\n"
"\nIt's great to report that Tarantino is back to making the sort of\nmovies that you expected early in his career. A lot of his recent\nmovies have always felt somewhat indulgent, but Django Unchained is a\nreturn to basics. At times the script is mesmerising and you are\ntotally engrossed in many of the dialogues throughout the film. The\nfilm is very much a tribute to the spaghetti western.<br><br>The film tells the story of Django (Jamie Fox) a slave who is\nbefriended by a bounty hunter Dr Shultz (Christoph Waltz). The main\nreason for this is because Django can identify the people he is looking\nfor. He soon realises that Django has a skill for bounty hunting and\ndecides he would like to hire him as a deputy bounty hunter who takes\n1/3 of the bounty.<br><br>In addition to the direction being excellent most of the acting\nperformances are also great with Waltz being the standout performer.\nThere's a lot of blood and gore in the film, but it very much of the\ncomic book style.\n"
"\n'Django' is quite possibly the best film I have ever seen.<br><br>It offers everything one could want in a film.<br><br>Humour - some of the one-liners are priceless and at times you will be\nin hysterics at the hilarious antics of the whole cast.<br><br>Suspense - At times, you will be on the edge of your seat. Quentin\nTarantino offers once again some dramatic scenes with nail biting\nconclusions.<br><br>Action - Jaw-dropping action and fantastic gun fights added to the mix\nspice this one up, it is at times very blood thirsty but fantastic to\nwatch.<br><br>'Django' is pure genius, an absolute must see - a cinematic triumph!\n"
"\n11/2/13 <br><br>All Schultz ever requires in this movie is to adjust his own bow tie\nwith both forefingers and say, \"Fiddle-de-dee?!\" Then dudes armed and\nready to let them both have it, fall back in chaos! Dressing the hero\nin blue silk and the frill collar was a new idea on me, by the way.\nD'Jango's obedience to Schultz did not entirely surprise, although as a\nway for Mr Tarantino to demand the death penalty on himself, we are his\nhumble and obedient servants in that. Watch out for heaped blessings\nand especially good wishes for longevity!<br><br>K\n"
"\nwhat a movie, what a performance delivered from Christoph Waltz wow\nwow. True master piece from Quentin Tarantino :). He has proved himself\nagain that he is the king of making movies :). I strongly suggest this\nmovie is not for light hearted people. few scenes are from this movie\nvery violent and gory. This is the one of the best movie ever taken in\nwestern trend so far. Hats off to Quentin, what a talented guy he is.\nwe except lot of master piece like this from you in future. I feel\nChristoph Waltz may win Oscar for this movie, my instinct says the\nsame, obviously he deserves for Oscar, no second thought about it.All\nwestern style comic lover must watch this movie :)\n"
"\nDjango unchained...another masterpiece from Quinton Tarantino this\nmovie had a powerful lead from Jamie Fox and a very strong supporting\ncast of some big name actors, The story line following Django being\nfreed of slavery on a mission to find and save his wife was easy to\nunderstand and follow, the Characters were interesting and kept you\npulled in, non stop action and blood shed kept true to Tarantino\nstyle..and it made this film a thrill ride from the start..a very high\nrecommendation,,This was one of foxes best films next to ray well put\ntogether, not a dull moment in this movie,great story line top notch\nacting non stop action with some comedic parts make this film a\ndefinite #10\n"
"\nMy husband hated it but I LOVED it! Tarantino gives it that \"Spaghetti\nWestern\" flavor with all the copious amounts of airborne blood and\nspatter that you expect from a Tarantino film! Jamie Foxx comes through\nwith a strong, hardcore performance that has you rooting for him all\nthe way! Chris Waltz gives a superb performance with the majority of\nthe dialog and DeCaprio nails it as a charming, albeit sadistic\nplantation owner. Samuel L. Jackson made you wanna slap the crap out of\nhim! Excellent! Look for a few older actors in cameo roles (including\nTarantino)! So much fun with so much revenge! Can't wait to own it when\nit comes out on DVD!\n"
"\nIt is with great pleasure to tell everyone that this is one brilliant\nfilm. I've seen an uncounted amount of films, but nothing quite like\nthis. It's intelligent, funny, terrifying, and directed with such\ncreativity that it could wrap even hardest to please viewers in awe.\nLeonardo DiCaprio shows us once again why he is the greatest actor of\nour time. Jamie Fox played it well, and Christoph Waltz performance was\nbeyond spectacular. DJango's soundtrack may be a little unfitting for\nsome particular scenes, but stunning visuals, a shrewd script, and\nmonumental performances from a well rounded cast, does more than make\nup for it. Admirably giving Quentin Tarantino's already impressive\ndirectorial history - helming such timeless classics as: Pulp Fiction,\nJackie Brown, and Reservoir Dogs - I genuinely believe DJango Unchained\nis his best work yet.\n"
