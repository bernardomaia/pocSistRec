went to an advance screening expecting your usual shy kid in high school learns to stick up for himself sort of feelgood drama
this movie is so much more than that  i was truly blown away by the mature themes and moving characters
mental illness sexual abuse drugs and alcohol
i think the writerscreenwriterdirector said it best in the qa after when he said it was a film that looked at the emotional aspects of that point in life without being sentimental
i really cared about these three teens  charlie sam and patrick  and their story never felt cheesy
just real and moving and touching
go see this movie
i saw the preview of this film and thought it was intriguing
i went to a screening last week and was totally blown away
this film has everything
i grew up in this era were the internet highway was just about to expload and i felt this film had everything great beginning  grabbed your attention then acceptance then the complex happened and you just didnt know where this film was going to go and then the film closure or was it
this has to be the best dramalove story
coming of age i have seen
i would recommend this film to anyone
loved it
please go see this film
i feel due to lack of advertisement that it will be overlooked with other big blockbuster films but i totally related to this film and loved it
i havent even heard about this film until i was invited to a screening
saw the trailer and really wanted to see it but the trailer does not do it justice
if you are looking for something to do on a weekend
get out of the heat
please see this film
mostly a trite and clichad high school picture
logan lerman is miscast as a moody high school freshman who looks like he at least 16 who befriends a group of seniors ezra miller emma watson and mae whitman chief amongst them who help him come out of his shell
thats not too unbelievable but it becomes increasingly silly when whitman becomes romantically involved with him and stone on whom lerman is crushing would probably be game if she werent already involved
this plays out like a fantasy not reality
if youve ever been in a high school as an adult the maturity difference between freshmen and seniors  hell freshmen and sophomores  is hugely pronounced
even among alternakids no 18 year old girl is going to even think about dating a 1415 year old
i couldnt quite get over that but thats hardly the only flaw
ezra miller is definitely the standout
his homosexual character is a bit clicha but i was happy that they actually werent afraid to give him a sex life though not graphic im surprised it didnt land an rrating because of it
im not sure
i wanted to like this film but i felt like id seen it all before elsewhere and better
the narrative is a little too crowded for its own good  and no one gets full attention though all deserve it
unlike some i think the script might have benefited from being set in a specific time and place it is 1990s pittsburgh  but it is never stated
like so much of this mtv book of the month selection it tries to be universal instead of specific  even in its characters
joan cussack is billed but her role amounts to two scenes at the very end of the film so although shes no star attraction you spend most of the time thinking i thought joan cussack was in this
but i guess this film is meant for a generation who doesnt know joan cussack is texting during the credits and doesnt know pittsburgh and wasnt alive in 1990
movies like this are a disservice to real life kids in actual high school today
no manic pixie dream girl and her inclusive sidekick really exist certainly not in high school and no unsuspecting nerd is going to be swept up into a whirlwind of acceptance and parties and love affairs
if this movie werent about something people everywhere throughout all time ever didnt experience for themselves maybe it would be entertaining
but they do
so its just insultingly saccharine
this movie should be categorized under fantasy its certainly not relatable for kids i think it only really serves as a guidebook for the mpdg wannabes
ie its tripe
thank goodness i didnt see this while i was actually in high school and actually struggling or this would have made me feel worse
nirvana had it right
this film set in the grunge heyday was full of the teenage angst that sells films and albums but that leaves a empty space when life moves on
sure it is an interesting coming of age story but i am bored with its redundancies
not much has changed from then to now so there is not so much a kudos on it being a period piece as many reviews had suggested and in the places where it should have shown a difference in that age and this it was not so accurate
also as much as i love emma watson she seemed timid and her american accent was flimsy
the best part of this film was the character of patrick which is a given
the book seemed so much more profound when i read it in my teens but i cant say if it is the story that had changed for the film or just me changing with age
the perks of being a wallflower is a movie adapted from the epistolary novel written by stephen chbosky about charlie played by logan lerman a teenager who lives his freshman year of high school
he has to cope with struggles such as the suicide of his best friend his difference compared to the others teenagers problems with his family
during the year charlie will get closer to sam and her stepbrother patrick played by emma watson and ezra miller
during the movie you learn more about charlies life and that he has to cope with more than high school problems
this story shows many teenagers issues
i think that many teenagers could relate to it
i really recommend this movie or even the book because it is a very moving story
actually i dont think there was a single shark attack
i kept thinking throughout the film maybe this is where the shark will come and attack
but i dont even recall a scene where any characters were even near the ocean
the whole story takes place around pittsburgh which is in western pennsylvania
this is an area world renowned for having no sharks
the cast was great ezra miller being the standout but i feel like they shouldnt sell a movie on a marketing campaign around shark attacks and then have no gosh darn shark attacks
the movie felt as if it were leading up to a trip to the ocean where logan lermans character would be attacked by a shark
this motion picture was almost all build up with no payoff the payoff here being that there were no sharks and no shark attacks
jaws was a good movie because it promised shark attacks was suspenseful and had shark attacks
that is how you make quality cinema
this is my first review and its brief
i do not understand the need for lengthy reviews
after watching this four times in six days i felt compelled to give my own ten pence worth
ive never seen a film like this where i have loved all the characters
the cast are brilliant and story moves along at a nice pace
the soundtrack is amazing
i love movies and its very rare that one comes along like this that works on so many levels
i am not usually one for this sort of genre and came close to taking this back before actually watching it
i am so glad i did not
its going to be a very long time before something tops this
this is a feel good movie with some disturbing undertones
if you love movies and want something that moves you emotionally then this is for you
every once in awhile a movie comes along that completely surprises you
after sifting through all the major blockbusters that come out every year there is always a movie like perks of being a wallflower written and directed by pittsburghs own stephen chbosky that surpasses everyones expectations and ends up being one of the best films of the year despite being an independent film
perks does so many things right
chbosky assembled a cast and then knocked this thing out of the park
he does something big blockbuster so often dont do he makes you characters that genuinely care about which makes the film as powerful as any other you will see this year
i highly recommend perks if for no other reason than that its by far one of the most heartfelt and original films you will see this year
bad acting and a script that lacks any credibility
a high school freshman mixing to this degree with a group of seniors
an outwardly gay student not getting any abuse especially in the era the film depicts
charlie wearing a tie so often
wine always available to these kids at their parties
charlie the only one eating the hash brownie and taking the hit of acid
how could the fight scene go on so long in the school cafeteria without any teachermonitor ever present
even with the builtup rage charlie had inside how could this scrawny kid stop the gang beating underway
these are a few of my many questions for the film makers and those who wrote all the positive reviews of this very weak film
yet another movie that i am baffled by the rating and positive response
the acting is very awkward and forced
logan does a pretty good job
he didnt talk a whole lot
he would just say his one line and looks would be exchanged and then end scene
emmas accent was horrendous
i swear there were moments of actually pauses and silence in her scenes because the three actors must not have spent enough time together because their friendship didnt seem real at all
i hate when movies have to cram all these scenes from the book into a short movie it hardly ever works out for the fans
i just wanted more from it
i didnt get that deep emotional feeling i got from reading the book
firstlyi want to say i love actors in this movie
i know emma watson from harry potter movies
she was a hardworking and pretty girl in harry potter
but nowshe is a reckless girl
alreadyezra miller and logan lerman are successful of their job
absolutelytheyre talented people
other than thisthey are together in harmony
alsothe plot is very absorbing
i think its best one type of teenage movies
its so dramatic for me
i cried but i was a little bit happy after watch it
were watching to the story of a teenager boy finding himself
its reminds me when you found yourselfyou will catch the real happiness
maybesomeone makes you feel better in highschool
soyou should watch this film and go find yourself
i think it is one of the bests
i saw this movie because i like logan lerman a lot
but i dont know why all his films should have a bad end and i should cry every time
if i want to recommend a movie to a girl actually i recommend this
bur if i want recommend to a boy i will show him fury
it is as nice as this of course
emma watson was good too but better than mr
lerman but there is some mistakes
in theater we can see some ideas that advertises sexual promiscuity
or having freedom in everything
it cant be true and i disagree
but i learned a lot of lessons of this movie
being happy
showing my feeling without fear or anything else
thank you to read
directed by stephen chbosky based on his own bestseller the perks of being a wallflower tells the story of a group of young wallflowers a term for people extremely introvert shy that avoids being part of or rather exclude themselves from most common social circles and therefore feel a hard time making friends
in this film in particular the origin of these disorders is often of sexual nature although this is not the central aspect of the story
in the same line of dead poets society 1989  this film reminds the adolescence and the unforgettable friends who pass through our lives and make us feel infinite
almost like remys cooks in ratatouille 2007  this film arouses feelings and memories that are not always present but are deeply rooted in the depths of our souls
a love story a story of fears and insecurities but most of all a selfdiscovery therapy
this movie accurately can describe to teens how they can be both happy and sad
it will help them understand their feelings and mentality much easier than any counselor
they will no longer feel alone
they will learn the struggles of their peers
also it will teach kids that being gay is not easy so why pick on those who are
it will help them understand why they may have bad relationships
you accept the love you think you deserve
and you can only start being happy when you learn to accept your past for what it is
so if you are a high school student that has gone through a lot this movie might be for you
if you are both happy and sad then this movie is definitely for you
this is my all time favorite movie
the plot is so relatable and i respect that
i have watched this so many times and every time i watch it i get the same enjoyable experience as the first time i watched it  i cannot rave about how much i love this enough
it is an emotional roller coaster and it is like you are going through it along with charlie
i always recommend it to my friends if they have not seen it and make them watch it with me so i can experience it with them
it is very similar to the book and i enjoy that because a lot of movies in the past have ruined the books
this movie kept me captivated and interested the entire time
best 102 minutes of my life and for that i give it a 1010
i got this movie recommended by a girl in my media class and after seeing that it got a pretty good rating i decided to give it a chance
the movie takes on some pretty big issuesthemes as sexual abuse drug and how tough it is to be a teenager but i feel like we dont get to reach through the surface and are only briefly introduced to these things which makes it kinda meh and i love me and earl and the dying girl but this movie just didnt get the same emotions through it had great potential to be one of my all time favorites but it kinda slips several times
610 because i liked the theme and it was slightly above average
this should be a drama about young people lost in loneliness their roles as outsiders amp how they handle their difficult situation
but it turns out that the movie is actually about some spoiled kids born into wealth feeling absolutely confident amp comfortable in their dandyrole doing cool stuff all the time partying hard amp even win the hearts of the ones they want to
i expected a little bit more than a 90min story without any problems amp aggravated circumstances
the story has no climax amp no turning point at all which makes it absolutely redundant telling it in movielength
you might get bored after 30min expecting a sweeping change in their lives amp relationships but you are definitely disappointed after 90min when nothing of that happened
i have to ask where is the drama amp why these kids have no problems to speak about
american drama
american irrelevance
an internal look at the life of teenagers in high school in the 80s united states a special world of intolerance humiliation pain drugs and love
the lovely performance from the young actors create a true empathy towards them and especially to the main character whose behavior is hard to understand
710
not a regular teen movie where all is about getting a girlguy sex  or drugs have more than that emma  and logan lerman have done well and they carry the movie
the film have a good mood in itself  i would recommend to watch this movie alone and to enjoy the theme of film  at some points movie have some regular annoying spots but they were required and they were not stretched out  at all its a good movie to watch  its my first review let me know hows it
the movie perks of being a wallflower is a movie about a 15 years old teenager named charlie
he is an introverted person and has mental issues
he was molested during his childhood by his aunt
he blames himself for his aunts death
as he struggles through his freshman year in high school two seniors sam and patrick help him
they introduce charlie to the real world
charlie falls in love with sam in their first meeting
he tries to be restraint to his feelings but that leads to much bigger conflicts
he had a disorder called dissociative disorder
the movie doesnt mention it
finally he manages to learn how to cope with his mental illness
i highly recommend this movie for passive teenagers
fantastic role play by all the actors in the movie
the best thing about the movie is that the story line
in the story it is shown that charlie was very silent and because of the some past events he was always depressed
when he joined the high school it was very difficult for a fresher in the first year without friends
but he got support from his english teacher and some days later he met few friends patrick and sam and fell in love with sam but couldnt express his love as he thought she loves craig
but at the end sam and charlie fell in love with each other few days later sam left for her college so again charlie became depressed and gone to do suicide
but his family took him to doctor and after few months of treatment he decided to live
in the end of the movie sam and patrick came to charlies house and then they left for a night out
at that time charlie feels like infinite
the perks of being a wallflower is a great screen adaptation by an incredibly gifted author screenwriter and director stephen chbosky
he has masterfully brought enjoyment and a feeble attempt of depth to a story of a teenager coming to terms with himself
played by logan lerman the main story driver the audience is exposed to a wild ride of emotions and vulnerable situations
emma watson the star capture of the movie brings little to the plate and seems replaceable
regardless it tries very hard to make sense of lifes hard lessons and is willing to breach the taboo lines
the perks of being a wallflower is a dramatically cute story
there were times when i thought it would be a little cringy and clichad
this fear was almost entirely unwarranted
the lead actors delivered a convincing performance of some very interesting and multi dimensional characters
i engaged well with the story even though american high school movies arent usually my cup of tea
special credit to emma watson for shaking of hemionie as she will probably always be remembered for harry potter
even the coldest heart will feel a tear forming in some places although you have to watch the whole film to understand what i mean
it is no good watching it in small parts as it is very much a film which provokes a strong emotional response in the audience since everyone can identify with someonesomething in the film over a slowly moving but none the less compelling plot
this is a beautiful movie and was so very candid
there are movies made around the high school theme which give you a feeling that its just another grind of a teen flick formula
but then something like this comes and blows out your mind  imagine characters as fleshed out as the one in archies comics coming together in the 80s and you have actors like ema watson  perks of being a wallflower is of this kind
the movie was so captivating that the audience will become those teenagers from the 80s90s and if you have lived long back during those years the movie is very relatable and plaudible
it brings back your high school romances or would have beens   friendships
everything with minute glimpses but still keeping an underlying story element till the end
must watch for fans of this genre and kind
cheers
i absolutely loved this movie and its characters but some aspects of it were odd
such as the dead friend of charlie sure he writes to him sometimes in the movie and he mentions him when he is high
other than that we only get flashbacks of his aunt helen which i get must be tragic
but if one of your best friends shoots himself and your left alone in high school wouldnt we see some sort of flashbacks or other mentions of it other than when hes high on pot and when hes writing to him
we never get to know the friend
besides that its a really touching movie and i would definitely recommend watching it if youre in high school
it also shows the many types of people you will meet in high school along with appealing to romance lovers such as myself
very good watch
ive got this movie for a long time and ive never watched it and at the same time i couldnt get rid of it cause my friends kept telling me that its a great movie
i thought the movies a boring and childish high school themed sort of movie that does not worth my time
two weeks ago out of nowhere i decided to watch it
i had no idea what sort of treasure ive been keeping in my archive
the novels story is beautifully pictured the actors are incredibly talented bravo to the actor choice  the whole movie is unbelievably beautiful
god knows im searching for the best words to describe this masterpiece  but once you watch it youre gonna be wordless like me
ive watched the movie 3 times so far and i believe everyone should watch it at least twice
p
s logan lerman is brilliant and ezra millers act in this movie made him one of my favorites
charlie starts high school after going through some mental health issues and he ends up being the wallflower
i havent read the book so my opinion is only based on what i have watched only
as a logan lerman fan i wanted to see him pull off a character more complex than his previous ones and he manages to get charlie through without overdoing it
the rest of the cast were excellent as well
the soundtrack was a reason of its own to make someone watch the film as well as the story
the only problem was the story line
for me i would rather had charlies character being unfolded earlier in the film than just in the end and even that it wasnt explained very well
the flash backs were tiring at some points too
so 7 out of 10
this move will excel all preexpectations you have of it whether they be good or bad
it is a film which speaks to people on all different levels and blends so many different deep and emotional aspects together drugs mental illness sexual abuse
in perfect fashion
the acting from the entire cast is flawless from start to finish and like films of this nature and calibre should you genuinely grow attached too and feel for the main characters
i have watched this picture several times and am still blown away by the superiority of everything from the cinematography to the soundtrack
i would strongly advise everyone to watch this film it is real it is poignant and it is truly heartwarming
1010
greatest movie i have ever seen
could relate to charlie on so many levels
also i would recommend chboskys book as well
the acting was terrific
i particularly enjoyed the love story between emma and logans characters
i like the issues that it touched on
one of the only movies i am willing to rewatch
the movie makes you rethink the people around you
this is the only movie i have ever given a 1010 out of over half a thousand as even its flaws can be viewed as purposeful and necessary to the work as a whole
the movie will pull on your emotions in every which way from the very onset until the figurative curtains are drawn
this movie is beyond amazing and relates to most of all teenagers
see im a loner and a wallflower and this movie explained everything
its almost as if logan lerman was reading out my diary as charlie
i recommend this movie to anybody that feels like a loner wallflower or shy
i also recommend this title to any teenagers
this movie amazed me it portrays the different types of best friends and basic teenage problems
this title is heartfelt while also being funny
ezra miller logan lerman and emma watson made an amazing performance
some might find this movie dramatic or maybe cheesy but its not at all
ever since i watched this movie i began to understand that its okay
wow
this movie is so great
it suits for anyone all the actors and actresses were great
i cannot stop thinking about this movie like i am blown away by how great this movie was
in fact no exact words can explain how amazing this movie is
i know its already late but this is well recommended to watch for those who havent watched it yet because you dont have any idea what you are missing for
ive already watched a lot of movies close to its genre and some of them are also good but this one is different in a way that everyone can relate with it and will inspire a lot of people which makes it exceptional
you cant actually compare it to others its just really great
the movie is worth watching
although it seems a teenage movie it can also be watched from more variety of people
the soundtracks are really qualified
also the movie gives great stories from lives of the characters with bunch of many different emotions sadness happiness craziness
these emotions can be easily followed from the characters behaviour and sayings
the movie is converted from a book
i did not read but there are also positive comments about the book
spoiler  we accept the love we think we deserve  can we make them know they deserve more
we can try
spoiler you cant be yourself until you be yourself with someone else together
i am watching this movie again as i write
it really is a story of love acceptance and friendship
it is about overcoming bad things that happen to you and finding out who you are
a great message
we can all relate to charlies attempt at trying to fit in
there are a lot of poignant scenes in this movie and a lot of funny little things like making us older people remember about how important it was to make a mix tape to show your love for someone
ezra miller is a great young actor and im sure well be seeing a lot of emma watson as she becomes one of the few child actors that succeeds as an adult
looking forward to seeing her and logan lerman in noah
the perks of being a wallflower came recommended to me by a friend after i revelled in the watching of the spectacular now
my limited knowledge of the book led me to believe it would be the standard introvert kid turned popular high school socialite like many a title before it
however the film presented me with a tortured protagonist who finds his place amongst another bunch of misfits
it is the relationship of this band of friends which is so expertly interwoven with the main storyline that captured my imagination
these relationships coupled with an excellent soundtrack helped me to reach a profound examination of society a realisation that despite our own selfdoubts that we are part of a society where everyone has their own issues
it is in no way a life changing film but it is one that will leave you contemplating your own social decisions
drugs alcohol depression this movie expresses the pros and cons of being a teenager a shy kid a wallflower
i was very surprised with logan lermans performance he showed a lot of passion and sincerity in his performance
this film also showcases that emma watson isnt that little sorcerer from harry potter
ezra miller is an excellent actor whom definitely fills the role of patrick
i have read the book and while i the movie isnt as good as the book it is pretty dang good
it shows teenagers have many secrets many hardships but all together stick together while they find themselves in their high school journey
this movie is one of my favorites and deserves to be given a 10
it made me feel different after watching more calm in a way
watch it and you wont be disappointed
i absolutely loved this film  specifically the acting music and even at times the cinematography
steven chbosky captured the spirit of the book and the characters magnificently  ezra and logan give exceptional performances that deserve major credit
emma gives a strong performance as sam  you can tell that she really understands the character however she does struggle a bit with the american accent
not to worry ezra is hilarious but not gimmicky and can flip to a somber tone at a moments notice and have everyone spellbound
also great performances from mae whitman nina dobrev and johnny simmons
the young cast is truly the heart of the film and are all really great
there is a lot of humour emotion honesty everything it needed and also an excellent soundtrack to back it up
a movie that at first seemed like it might be just another movie about a group of high school kids and their drama
as soon as i started it that thought was quickly proved false
you learn of the feeling of solitude of charlie
when i started this i was a little distracted not paying to much attention
but as the movie went on my interest in the movie grow drastically
during the intense scene that was the fight in the lunchroom the dvd started to skip and pause
i found myself yelling no
as i quickly took the disc out and cleaned it
luckily it no longer skipped
they did a very good job with the character building and i found myself really caring about charlie
why is he having these blackouts
what do people mean when they say that charlie hasnt seen things lately or that he has been doing really well since he met his new friends
i highly recommend this movie
having read the novel the perks of being a wallflower by stephen chbosky and loved every sentence i was quite sceptical about watching the film
i worried it would not live up to my expectations after the novel but i am glad to say i was pleasantly surprised
the film succeeded to not only meet but exceed my expectations
first of all the soundtrack was perfectly selected
it displayed charlies confused emotions throughout
being a music student and aiming to be a music soundtrack supervisor or work in the film music industry i admired the choice of songs and felt it truly reflected charlies character
secondly i enjoyed how well the script was acted by all of the actors
they portrayed an honest awkwardness as young adults often have and yet their relationships and friendships were relatable and realistic
thirdly i feel obligated to mention my respect for logan lerman as an actor and must mention how greatly he played charlie
his characterization of such a troubled teenager was spot on and he deserves great praise for portraying charlie fantastically
the perks of being a wallflower is an excellent coming of age film that deals with many of the situations teenagers face during the time of life while in high school
the young talented actors make the film a real treat to watch
the entire cast does a fantastic job of making their characters real
emma watson is unbelievably good at playing her role
ezra miller shines as the older brother to emma watsons character
logan lerman plants himself in the role as the wallflower and truly blooms as an actor
this ensemble cast should have been nominated for the screen actors guild acting awards
as a member of the screen actors guild i would have voted for this cast to win the best ensemble award
usually i prefer books to their movie adaptations but this time i was blown away by this masterpiece
when i first saw the trailer for this film i suspected another generic comingofage movie with too little plot and too much cheese
this is something else entirely charlie is a very diverse character and logan lerman brings him to life superbly
emma watson is a brilliant sam and the pairs on screen relationship is so much more believable than in the novel
all of the cast have great character development and logans story is particularly harrowing
the accuracy with which the world of high school is presented is staggering and the tension of the film gradually increases right up to the heart pounding climax
this is sure to become a cult classic a vibrant story of friendship and i highly recommend it to anyone who remembers the trials of childhood
the perks of being a wallflower is one of my all time favorite movies
i read the book before i watched the movie and absolutely loved it
when i read the book i felt a connection with charlie the main character
but the first time i watched the movie it was like meeting an old friend
much of the characters personalities were the same which helped me feel more connected
i love the way this film was shot and the way the book was written using letters to an anonymous person
i have heard many people say that this movie deals with serious topics in an insensitive way
i do not think that is the case
i see charlie and other characters react to situations the same way i think i would
with that said i highly recommend this movie to anyone and everyone
well the movie is pretty good but for me personally the book was better they took out some important things
spoilerrrrr
for example i believe in the book his sister get pregnant the boyfriend leaves her she tells him it was a false alarm and he wants to get back together
in the movies that never happens which for me was a point in the book where charlie and his sister really got along which was important to me
same for everything with his family it wasnt in the movie and just little things just like that
if you havent read the book have fun but if you have then its probably just like a regular book to movie adaptation
pure genius the way that the story is told is absolutely fantastic
the angles time and script truly impressed me
you have absolutely no idea of several facts that are massive important to the history
the director chose to tell you something out of context with a raw and shocking style and that makes the story amazing
im really happy that ive watched this even more after i thought it was a cheesy movie with no concept
i was really really wrong
thank you stephen chbosky
another beautiful surprise that made the movie even better is the amazing soundtrack
im a big the smiths fan
its like the movie actually tells many stories that morrissey tried to tell us all these years asleep was a perfect choice for this
i absolutely adore this movie
it contains the best message be yourself and never be ashamed of that
you are you so dont ever let anybody change that
the perks of being a wallflower made me think about life in a whole other perspective
i may not have the most amazing life but i do have at least of few people around me that love me
they care for me and comfort me and thats all i can ask for
think about the perks of being a wallflower if you ever feel like no one understands and you will find hope again
perks is about how hard life truly is but also how life can be so incredible in that littlest moment
remember those little moments and life will be that much more amazing
the perks of being a wallflower is great movie for emotional young teens especially those who are going through teenage drama
i was in year 8 when a first watched this film which was recommended by my teenaged friend
when i got home from school i viewed it on this site and the rating was well so yes i decided to watch it
during the film their were a lot of connections between me and the characters in the film
it seemed like we were going through the same teenaged drama faise
the ending also was great it reminded me of the ending of the classic 1985 the breakfast club but even better there were so many quotes such as we are infinite which was the last words of the main character in this film
teenagers or not i recommend this film because it really connects with the viewer
i just watched this movie because of emma watson who was a beloved character in harry potter
after i seen this movie i was moved and i do think this is a great movie
in the real life outgoing people are very selfconfident and at the same time they pay little attention to wallflower or someone who is very introversive
but patrick and sam were not like this
they met charlie and invited charlie to get into their world
at the very end i was very impressed by the idea delivered in this movie  being an outsider is no good only participation can really make you feel more and experience more get love from others as well as make others feel your love
ive been wanting to see this movie for a while and i just had the chance to see it today
afterwards i felt compelled to write a review for a first time ever i think is a beautiful and powerful movie with great acting great script great story telling
for those of us who were raised in the 90s will be like traveling back in time it will bring you so many feelings back
having said that i believe this movie can be appreciate it by anyone
once again great acting i loved them all and i would be looking forward to see more work in the future from emma watson
if is of any help i would recommend this movie for everyone even buy it if you have the chance im sure i will
greatings from spain
wow
i dont know what to say
there are not many films out there that can move you but this is one of them
im gonna make it short not just because i have trouble in describing things in english that im feeling inside but just because sometimes things dont need to be cleared
just go and see this film and experience something inside
this film captures the whole spectra of emotions and the actors were all terrific
one of the best films ive ever seen and i came over it just by accident so i can imagine that not many people have heard of it
and im giving an extra credit to logan lerman whom i thought gave a stunning performance of a teenager who is out of place in this world
just see it and be amazed by the power of the performance
i quite liked this film it was very interesting however i found it did go on a bit too long
i really liked the twist at the end though and made it worth watching the whole way through
after watching the trailer i was expecting more of a light hearted film about a bunch of teenagers and there storys
however it actually contained mental illness sexual abuse drugs and alcohol which was a surprise it did make the film a lot more interesting
if it didnt have these interesting parts in the film i probably would have not watched it until the end
even though i enjoyed this film my parents fell asleep whilst watching it so maybe it is not as interesting to the older viewer and is better for younger people as they can relate to things that go on in their life to parts in the film
i loved nearly everything about this movie emma played an american in this movie or canadian idk and she did e great job at loosing her usual accent
the casting was not only perfect but the plot was great as well
though i personally havent read the book my cousin who has said it followed the book as far as she can recall she read it quite a while back my only real issue with it is that as it gets closer to the end he has flashbacks of some sort which makes it hard to follow and in the end there doesnt really seem to be a close like there is less of a plot at the end
outside that i loved it and was trilled to have finally watched it great job to the director and actors and even more so to the author of the book
i just watched this movie for the first time
at first i thought it looked like some clicha high school movie
of course twenty and nearly30yrolds play teens which is rather unrealistic
im still in high school and no one has that nice of a complexion
i continued to watch as charlie played by logan lerman struggles to find friends
i also thought that was silly because this guy is very handsome and he definitely would have friends even if theyd only use him for his looks
so far it seems like i hated it
well emma watson and some other dude befriend charlie and from then on the story bursts with passion confusion secrets lust and a wonderfully brilliant message about misfit teens
i cried at least 3 times throughout this granted i was very exhausted todaybut it contained honest humor and emotional connections
i would have given this a 1010 but white chicks takes first place
either way this movie is incredible and i recommend to everyone
just seen this very good movie and i know its very late
couldnt get it out of my head
imo a well scripted drama inspired from novel
the movie features three main teen characters but it isnt an ordinary teen movie
charlie character reminds me of the young man from ordinary people 1980 which also features three main characters but not teens
the songs osts from the movie are cool too
a special mention to come on eileen omg they are playing good music
living room routine and heroes make the viewers to enjoy the movie better
sad thing that this movie didnt fall upon the eyes of the academy
still it is infinite
this is one of the best movies i have ever watched in my life
the acting in this movie is sublime
one of my favorite parts of a movie is the music
this movie has by far one of the best soundtracks of any movie ever made
i have always thought that logan lerman was an exquisite actor but he has reached a whole new level of genius with this movie
emma watson is one of those actresses that unfortunately has been type cast by her portrayal of hermione granger but her acting is so new and refreshing in this film that you completely forget about her even being affiliated with the harry potter franchise
i have watched this film several times looking for a flaw and im happy to say one does not exist
everything from the writing cinematography production and acting in this movie is one of a kind
i was hesitant to watch this film for the first time but this will go down in history as one of my favorite films of all time
kudos to the entire crew
this movie has an excellent plot
after watching this i read the book and could really feel the characters
for me it was like stepping back into the early 90s
this movie really needs to get above a 5
i do not recommend letting 8 year old kids watch this it is to big for them
but read the book and youll cherish this movie a lot more
watch it it will bring you to tears and trust me you will have a lot of new favorite songs
but i recommend watching the movie first so you can compare the movie to the book while reading it
this is certainly a must watch
but keep in mind do not do any of the stuff they do in the movie if youre 20 and under
i first wanted to see this movie because logan lerman played the main character but then i realized that this is an amazing movie
all of the actors did a great job playing in this movie
i think this is logan lermans best movie ever
emma watson did really good as well this character fitted her
this is an interesting movie for teenagers coping with hard life
love sex cheating it has almost everything in it that interests a teenage nowadays
the end was really moving it made me cry
all in all its not the best movie ive ever seen and it isnt the movie with the most cliffhangers and action in it but its definitely worth seeing
from start to ending the perks of being a wallflower is truly captivating and endlessly realistic
this film instantly became one of my favourites and will always remain so
as i have also read the book in which the film is based around i can honestly say that the entire cast play their parts fluently all the way through
a great thing about this film is that it also manages to appeal to an impossibly wide audience as anyone can relate to at least one area of the film
i truly class this film as a classic for its ability to have such a simplistic and realistic plot but yet create such a emotional and memorable response from the viewer
this is one of my ultimate favorite films i love the main characters development and this movie as a whole
i never get enough of it
although the movie doesnt completely cover the book but it was arranged amazingly the cast direction and everything
i must admit the first time ive watched this i was in tears throughout the entire film not sure why but after rewatching it several times it turned into my go to feel good movie
it doesnt have the clicha everyone gets what they want ending nor does it have the everyone is miserable in the end thing either the ending is one of my favorite parts of the movie and i recommend this movie to anyone interested in the whole not okay teenagers cause it takes the matter somewhat realistically
im only fourteen still in high school
but i really wanted to see this movie
i finally got around to doing so and i have to say it is one of my new favorites
i struggle with friendships and fall in and out of depression like charlie
i just feel that this movie just relates to me
i cried the rest of the night because it just hit me
the story is about a freshman who has problems and doesnt have any friends
he finally finds himself among upperclassmen
him finally fitting in and feeling alive really brings charlie to life
and i just felt a connection to that
it might just be me but i absolutely loved this movie
this will be one to go down in the history books for all the misfit toys including myself
i strongly recommend this movie
i just
cant really put it in words i guess
everythings perfection
it is how life is for some
real life reality
im happy a movie finally shows that
i cannot overstate how great this movie is
im truly sick of many of these users that think they are some high class film critic
4 out of 10
really
its rare that a film encompasses so much of what it is like growing up with the social and moral dilemmas that nearly every one of us face at some point in our lives
this is literally a feel good movie that will leave you with an emotional high
it has a wonderful cast and an even better soundtrack
stephen chbosky director did a phenomenal job bringing this wonderful book to the big screen amp i look forward to more of his movies in this future
go out and rent this movie now you wont be disappointed
i am a male and usually watch movies like the dark knight or pineapple express  but i watched this today and i almost cried at the end when charlie was about to kill him self and i m not one of those guys that usually does that
just this movie just spoke to me so much and i really was hoping charlie would die so i would know what happens with him till the end of his life
i really want to know what happens after this movie so much that i made a imdb account just to rate this movie
i just want people out there to know how touching this movie ends it deals with watching someone you love love someone else and it shows what people go through when family isnt good as charlie s aunt molested him and his best friend committed suicide
then for him to find someone so perfectly fit for him and everything is going great until she has to go away and it tore me apart a few years dropped from my eyes
logan lerman really shows you he s a great actor as everyone else
watch this movie especially if you are in high school
