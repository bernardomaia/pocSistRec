"\nAbsolutely ludicrous Liam Neeson thriller (which is a genre now), but,\nfrankly, it's just a lot of fun. I found myself smiling and giggling at\nthe silliness of it all, but damned if I wasn't enjoying myself the\nwhole time. Neeson plays an air marshal who receives a text shortly\nafter his flight commences that, if a load of money isn't deposited\ninto an untraceable bank account, a passenger will be killed every 20\nminutes. The film is clever enough to make it impossible to guess - or,\nalternatively, you pretty much suspect everyone and hope like Hell they\ndon't pull out the old\nLiam-Neeson-has-multiple-personalities-and-is-doing-it-himself twist.\nThe film is hilariously convoluted with plenty of plot holes. When the\nvillain is revealed, they say \"You'd never believe how easy it all\nwas!\" They are correct. I would never believe it. I still quite enjoyed\nwatching it.\n"
"\nThis surprised me. A thriller on a plane that has you thinking you know\nall the answers (because we're such expert movie watches), then flips\nit. Yes, it's a contrived subplot. And the reasoning behind this\nterrorist act is goofy, BUT...it is a lot of fun. It interweaves a\nreally elaborate set-up that you have to focus on to understand.<br><br>Also, for people who think they're sophisticated in camera motion.\nThink about that space. The camera moves in (perceived) 360 degrees\nwithout a) seeing camera shadow b) camera angle is near impossible with\nthe movements they had. This is visually sophistication that most won't\nsee or care. But it adds a ton to the claustrophobia.<br><br>Julianne Moore is great, as always. Neeson is perfect for this role,\nbut one has to wonder how this behemoth of a guy fits in a airplane\nbathroom.\n"
"\nI saw an advanced screening of this movie yesterday, and I was\nabsolutely blown away. I had hoped it would be a fun thrill-ride, but I\ndid not expect it to be as exciting and involved as it was.<br><br>My favorite part of this movie, was the fact that it takes a plot that\nis implausible, and makes it as plausible as possible. You can\ndefinitely tell that the writers did their research on air marshals,\nairplane mechanics, etc. There was not one moment in this film that I\nwas bored, and it was filled to the brim with twists, and turns.<br><br>There definitely is a lot that went into this movie, and even though\nit'll have you thinking more deeply about the security of airlines,\nmost of all it's just a really, really fun ride.\n"
"\nI never was a huge fan of Liam Neeson's action flicks, but I went to\nsee this because of the good reviews. This movie is a very suspenseful\nand a great \"Whodunnit\" movie. It it's share of action scenes, but it\nnever went too over the top. Even if you don't like Liam Neeson, this\nmovie is worth seeing and is a guaranteed good time. Lot's of twists\nand suspicious characters leave you guessing and most likely wrong.\nLot's of on the edge-of- your-seat scenes because of how well it was\nmade and has a silent and lonely feel to it which helps you understand\neverything going on. Overall, this movie is a great thriller without\nbeing packed full of action.\n"
"\nJust watched this with my movie theatre-working friend. We both were\nwatching this for the first time and we both were thrilled by it. Liam\nNeeson plays someone taking a flight from London. The only other player\nwe recognized was Julianne Moore and not much is learned about her\nduring most of the narrative except she takes a lot of flights and was\ncoming from a trying day. Oh, and she observes most of the action when\nLiam talks to the crew on board when the crises happens. Plenty of\ntwists happen when trying to guess which passenger is responsible for\nsome threatening comments on Neeson's tablet so that was a plus. In\nother words, it was riveting throughout! Really, all I'll say now is I\nand my friend highly recommend Non-Stop!\n"
"\nThis film is not like the other Liam Neeson films of \"Taken\" but still\nin the rank of it up there.<br><br>He plays a former disgrace NYPD cop turned Air Marshal. Who has a\ndrinking problem to cope with the death of his daughter from leukemia.\nAs he does not like flying despite the position he is in.<br><br>Julianne Moore stars as a friend and also frequent flier that is pretty\nscared of flying who will later understand Bill than anybody else.<br><br>But then a breach in his federal phone warns Bill that every twenty\nminutes, someone will be killed if $150M is not delivered to that\nperson or persons. As he becomes the prime suspect in the hijacking.<br><br>He must clear his name along with saving the passengers and crew in the\nmovie. Lupita Nyong√≥ the recent Oscar winner for \"12 Years As A Slave\"\nis really wasted in the film as a attendant. More lines are given to\nher UK co-star, Downtown Abbey's Michelle Dockery.<br><br>Still a great movie. Not like \"Taken\" but still great!\n"
"\nGeez this movie is suspenseful. Who would have thought that a movie set\nsolely on a plane could be so entertaining. It keeps you guessing the\nwhole way as to who dunnit. Honestly the one person who is behaving\nstrangely is Liam Neeson's character. He is a seriously angry man and\nshould not be allowed to have a gun or a badge. The whole time you\ncannot help but think how unrealistic it all is. Normal people would\nnever get into this situation.<br><br>Aside from the ridiculousness of the whole concept I'm not sure the\nending needed to be so deep and political. I wish it stayed totally\naction and didn't try to be all deep and intellectual. Luckily that was\na very small part of the movie. Overall though pretty good.\n"
"\nI watched this film in the cinema today; expecting it to just be an\naverage action film with average people and an average storyline. Wow,\nI was definitely wrong. It held me in constant suspense, and i really\nWAS on the edge of my seat for most of the film. There was so much\ntension and suspense, it was unreal!! The film was really good\nthroughout- no slow and boring bits! It was really exciting and i was\nincredibly curious to know who the villain was who sent the messages\nthreatening to kill 1 passenger every 20 minutes. I was very surprised\nto find out who the hijacker/person sending messages was, it was the\nlast person/people i'd expect it to be! And it was a happy ending,\nwhich is always a great element to a film. And the good thing about it\nwas no sloppy romance spoiling the film, which is always a bonus! The\ncast was good, and played by some talented and well-known\nactors/actresses, and the characters were all interesting people with\ndifferent stories and lives. Very impressed with this one, one of\nNeeson's best.\n"
"\nLiam Neeson is an air marshal who gets framed for a hijacking while the\nplane is over the Atlantic. Should be a nice little actioneer,\nespecially what with Liam coming off the two \"Taken\" movies. In\nreality, we're treated to a slow-poke \"whodunit\" that never really gets\nanywhere. Julianne Moore is a snooze, and the assorted collection of\nactors never get a chance to develop (for a fantastic example of how to\ndevelop a character in a flash, see Denzel Washington's \"Flight\").<br><br>Worst of all, the movie never sticks to any one genre. It's an action\nflick, no, it's a mystery, no, it's a feel-good movie, no, it's a\npolitical thriller (main character's Irish heritage is mentioned\n(why???) and many a time the lonely token Muslim is presented as the\npotential thorn in everyone's side).<br><br>Don't waste your money on this. And, Neeson needs to find better\nscripts.\n"
"\nIt's easy to keep people guessing about who-done-it if the premise is\ncompletely freaking stupid and this premise was completely freaking\nstupid. Everything about it was really stupid from the very start.\nPlanting red herrings right and left is no excuse for a script.<br><br>The plot is absurd. That's a bad place to begin.<br><br>Why? Why? Why in the hell would he trust a woman he had only just met?\nBecause she is one of the red herrings. And, of course, there is the\ngood Muslim to be mistrusted by all.<br><br>Just when he wants to see who is texting they hit turbulence. Darn!<br><br>He roughs up an innocent passenger for no decent reason. The plane goes\nballistic and he hits the ceiling? Because the pilot croaked? Since\nwhen do pilots even fly the damn plane? And all of this happens before\nit goes completely overboard on intelligence-insulting crazy stupidity.\n"
"\nI thoroughly enjoyed this film. The small scope not only made the\nadventure more exciting, but allowed for a more intimate experience\nwhich allowed a personal connection to almost every character\ndisplayed.<br><br>The acting was all spot on and it was personally satisfying to see the\nmagnificent Julianne Moore perform extremely well in her role. The\nscript was done in a way that you could realistically believe a number\nof characters could have been the antagonist.<br><br>If you enjoy a great edge of your seat thriller, this is a movie you\nwill definitely enjoy.<br><br>True Score: 9.5\n"
"\nThis has got to be a really great mystery thriller. There are so many\nmysteries, as well as many unpredictable events. You'll really feel the\nsuspense going. Liam Neeson plays the role well, and the suspense\nreally builds up.<br><br>However, here's what doesn't make sense: *Minor spoiler* After the\npeople are booted from the business class to the economy class, no one\nhas to sit on the ground. Everyone has a seat.<br><br>Pros:<br><br>- Very suspenseful<br><br>- Very unpredictable and exciting<br><br>There are no major cons that I can think of.<br><br>Score: 9\n"
"\nNon-Stop is a very pleasurable action thriller.<br><br>Another one of those movies that I just liked immediately after it\nbegan. Some movies are like that, some, very few movies.<br><br>As long as you don't expect another Taken, (this is thriller-material)\nyou will probably have a very good time. Sure, there are some plot\nholes, I did not notice any during the movie, but have had them pointed\nout, but we (well you) should all stop focusing so damn much on plot\nholes. As long and they are not right in your face, and/or really\npoorly explained away, they don't matter.<br><br>Liam Neeson is good, as he always is. the movie is kind of tense, and\npretty exciting. I love plane-movies, planes look so nice and cozy in\nmovies. Relaxed me.<br><br>So there you have it! I don't need to say more. Non-Stop is a well\nmade, entertaining, action-thriller.\n"
"\nI hardly ever write film reviews, however I had to for this one. It's\nhard to imagine how people can put up with this pile of rubbish - utter\nnonsense from start to finish. Even people who have never flown on an\naeroplane before can realise how unrealistic the entire plot is.<br><br>Add to that every action clich√© you can think of: Neeson running around\nlike a headless chicken, threatening everyone as his way of identifying\nthe rogue passenger but always being a step behind; TSA relying solely\non a passenger uploaded video to turn against Neeson; critical\ndecisions being based on knee-jerk reactions. Another Hollywood\ndisappointment.\n"
"\nit was those two guys. one of them did a trick thing to make you think\nit wasn't him, but he was just being smart.<br><br>when you get to the end, and the two guys are standing there\nspeechifying their implausible garbage about why this was all\nnecessary, you will have your fingers in your ears going leh- leh-leh.\nwatch out Liam, that point blank shot right to the chest didn't keep\nhim down!<br><br>cheap misdirects, lots of people intentionally made to look suspicious\nand then revealed to be benign. Like that bulbous-nosed Slavic cop\nnamed¬Öof course¬ÖRiley. and then you get to the end and you realize all\nthe stupid loose ends were just there to make you go woo-woo, and then\nyou start to feel pretty cheap and used. Hmm, how do you spend 50\nmillion and almost never leave the room?<br><br>Also, Julianne Moore plays Julianne Moore, like she pretty much always\ndoes, her waxen corpse so luminous, her expertly coiffed mane flowing\njust so, her tortoise dentition just so¬Ö literate.\n"
"\nspoiler alert does not really cover this crappy plot. <br><br>Man who lost someone in 9/11 is the villain along with a military vet.\nHe is crazy and the vet is greedy--typical Americans?<br><br>The doctor in full Muslim garb who we are all expecting to be the bad\nguy (we are all so hateful remember) is a red herring. He is heroic as\nyou would expect a doctor to be. Why not make a movie about a real life\nMuslim doctor who is a hero? Dr. Shakil Afridi for a start.<br><br>There is no excuse for this plot and I do not understand why Liam is in\nthis. Re-watch the A Team or Taken or The Grey or Schindler's List or\neven A Woman of Substance. I love Liam in almost anything.\n"
"\nWhy a man like this Bill (that hates flying) would hold on to such a\njob is silly, likewise that he abuses alcohol while on the job.<br><br>But it is retarded that the film does not get into how the criminals\nbehind did it (not only getting into the network, but also being able\nto hide it, and hiding going to the bathroom), that is retarded.\n"
"\nProbably not the best plot, or not even a perfect crew of actors\nbesides Liam Neeson, but the good point of the movie is none of those,\nbut the thrill it gives you on certain moments. It leaves you to keep\ntrying to think and guess who is the responsible behind the scenes, but\nit keeps you around, with no clue at all, and that is what will make\nyou with your eyes fixed to the screen, because you want to know who is\nbehind all this. What also got my attention was that in certain\nmoments, everything change, and all my guesses were wrong and it backs\nto 0. A very interesting movie, but if you are looking for an action\nmovie or a movie with a shooting scene, that is not your movie, this is\nthe kind of movie, the involves terrorism and stays with the thriller\ntype.\n"
"\nThis movie was a fun and thrilling action movie that was filled with\none plot twist after another. It keeps you guessing right until the\nend. Just when you think you know \"who done it\" the story throws\nanother curve at you. The final reveal comes at you unexpectedly, but\nthe heart pounding action doesn't stop there.<br><br>Liam Neeson was awesome as always. The supporting characters give the\nstory line just what it needs to keep you on the edge of suspense\nthrough the entire film.<br><br>I can't say if the story line is plausible but everything seemed to be\nwithin the realm of possibility, making this movie even edgier and more\nfrightening. One of the best action flicks I've seen in a long time!\n"
"\nThis was one of those films where i thought, oh here we go again, it's\nLiam Neeson punching and shooting people from the Middle East. <br><br>It wasn't just your typical hijack film, however. It was really well\npaced and directed, and it was thrilling enough to really suck you in\nand keep you transfixed all the way. You never actually knew who the\nhijackers were until the end, and it kept you intrigued.<br><br>I also liked the fact that the Muslim guy in it was a good guy who\nwanted to help people rather than a stereotypical nutcase you see in a\nlot of other films.<br><br>It's the first film iv'e watched for a while where i didn't want to get\nout my seat to do other stuff! It didn't have any really boring parts\nin it.<br><br>Out of the three tough guy films he's done around the same time that\niv'e seen (Walking Amongst Tombstones, Run All Night and this), I rated\nthis the best of the three.\n"
"\nI went into the movie expecting the same generic action film that might\nas well be straight to DVD. i was intrigued by the premise so i gave it\na go and Im glad i did. I will admit the first 10 minutes or so gave me\nsome bad vibes, it was quite slow and boring but once we were on the\nplane all was good. I felt the suspense throughout the film and found\nmyself trying to guess who the bad guy was which led to me second\nguessing myself quite a bit. what i liked about it is it wasn't a paint\nby numbers story, there were a couple of twists and turns i wasn't\nexpecting at all. Is it an award winner...No but if your sat at home\norder in a pizza have a few beers and you can just sit back, relax and\nenjoy the film for what it is.\n"
"\nFirst of all, this is the only movie I think I have ever watched that\nalmost made my cry. When the little girl Becca is in great danger, I\ngot the feels and almost lost it.<br><br>This movie is brilliant, the story, actors, score, its just amazing.\nthe story of non- stop is quick to kick in, once the texts start\ncoming, tension starts to build, and I have never felt this way about\nany movie I have watched so far. You just can NOT STOP WATCHING. The\nplot is really creative in the way that the camera shot and story makes\nyou think that it is this guy, but its not, then you think is is her,\nbut then its not. The story does get a bit complex, so much so that you\nhave to watch it a couple more times, and even though you know who it\nis, you are still enjoying the movie and in on the action.<br><br>The acting in this is on point, having the main character being\npossibly one of my all-time favorite actors (Liam Neeson). There was\nsome other familiar faces throughout. The casting was well done having\na variety of people, many of them stereotypically being the one(s)\nbehind the plot.\n"
"\nA good thriller movie that takes no time getting you inside the plane\nwhere this story's setting takes place and letting the fun begin. Liam\nNeeson did an excellent job of making his character and this movie\ncaptivating and fun even when most of the supporting cast lacked any\nsense of presence or personality. For the exception of Julianne Moore\nwho I found to be OK in this movie. Some of the action scenes here I\nfound annoying to watch when the camera zooms so close in, but I hardly\nlet it bother me. The last 20 minutes or so is where I started to lose\na little interest (my opinion), but overall a good thriller/suspense\nmovie that'll keep you guessing and on the edge of your seat.\n"
"\nEnjoyed this one quite a bit, it managed to be more than just your\nstraight action film and I liked trying to figure out whodunit from a\nwhole plane load of potential suspects, for a while I even thought Liam\nNeeson was guilty. Plenty of red herrings throughout to misled you and\nan exciting (if implausible) closing scene.<br><br>Liam Neeson plays a familiar role, his stock action hero guy. This\ncould easily be his 'Taken' character actually, just as an air marshal\npursuing a hijacker on a non-stop flight from New York to London. It\ndoesn't matter though he does a good job with a decent amount of action\nconsidering the limited space, including a hand-to-hand fight in the\ntiny airplane bathroom.<br><br>Great secondary cast here too including Michelle Dockery &amp; Lupita\nNyong'o as flight attendants, Julianne Moore as mysterious woman and\nAnson Mount as suspect #15. 1/20/16\n"
"\nWe learn right off that the Air Marshall played by Liam Neeson has\nmajor outside issues, that he is not dealing with very well. This takes\nhim on the plane with a not so perfect frame of mind. This makes our\nAir Marshall perfect for framing. The action takes off from there ...\nNon-Stop! There are deaths on board, two being the second Air Marshall,\nand the Pilot. Everything looks bad for our Air Marshall, and because\nof his actions the passengers don't trust him. It also doesn't help\nthat those on the ground believe the evidence that he is guilty of the\ncrimes he is accused of. Everything comes out in the end with bumps and\nbruises galore. Just sit back and enjoy. I like this movie, and I a\nvery glad to include this movie as part of my movie collection!\n"
"\nAs confirmed Liam Neeson fans, I settled down to watch this film as an\noff-chance discovery whilst channel surfing and with only the very\nshort television synopsis to guide me.<br><br>There are so many aeroplane disaster films out there, that coming up\nwith a unique and interesting storyline was always going to be\ndifficult.<br><br>Having said that, I was uncertain about the identity of the 'baddie',\nuntil the big reveal close to the end of the film, which was all to the\ngood and which raised the points rating.<br><br>The main thing in which I was a little disappointed, was that when the\nmotive for the crime was eventually revealed, it just didn't seem very\nplausible, which meant that what started out as a good solid plot, with\nstrong characters, turned into a rather weakened affair, with no\nobvious sense of purpose.<br><br>'Non-Stop' still offered good entertainment value and I didn't need to\nthink too hard about it!\n"
"\nThe first time I saw Non-Stop, I was very entertained because of the\nhuge suspense in it. Very thrilling though. I walked out of the\ntheaters and I was satisfied for the day. Months later, I bought a DVD\ncopy of Non-Stop and watched it again for the second time. What I\nrealized is that the suspense is absent because I am already aware who\nthe threat in the movie is. That's what I found disappointing. It's not\nthat kind of movie that is re-watchable.<br><br>Other than that, Liam Neeson did another great performance as a bad-ass\ncharacter. What I find ridiculous is, is the bad guy's plan. Framing an\nair marshal from hijacking because of 9/11? Really ridiculous or maybe\nthe bad guy is that just crazy. Anyway I still liked the movie.<br><br>In conclusion, Non-Stop is great but not re-watchable. The movie is\nonly good for people who saw it first time.\n"
"\nWell I've never been in airplane and I hope such commotion will never\nhappen to me.<br><br>One of my favorite genre of movie is thriller particularly when the\nsettings is all about airline or commercial flights.And NON STOP is\nreally great well yeah its flawed but still amazing. suspense and\nacting overshadow imperfection.<br><br>The success of NON STOP means Im still looking for a such brilliant\nkind of movie-shot inside on flying airplane 30K above our heads. <br><br>I think it would be better if they change a little bit the plot line,\nlike for example one of the crew is also a hijacker and the side of the\nplane will not going to rip apart in landing.Well just saying hehe.\n"
"\nReally, is there anything better than a tear jerking Liam Neeson action\nfilm? Maybe one starring Jason Statham? This is the legacy of Jerry\nBruckheimer, who gifted to us all the unforgettable Armageddon (and we\nlove him for it), and another reminder Hollywood has just gotten better\nat packaging celluloid sentimentalism with heroic atonement. So good\nthat, even though we pick them apart with relentless critical abandon\nand expose them for the unrepentant saccharine clich√©s they are, in the\nend, deep down, we find ourselves rooting for Liam and suspending\ndisbelief as he embodies the protective father, alcoholic failure and\nterrorist ass kicker all at once. Only Taken is better (perhaps the\nbest of the genre) and I for one am looking forward to Non-Stop Too,\nbitches. Curious side-note: tonight I watched Non-Stop for the second\ntime, and it only took 3 Scotch Ales to thoroughly enjoy it as much as\nI did the first time.\n"
"\nI love this Irish bloke and his career into action films, this is just\nlike all the rest, but that is what is cool about it, he is an \"old\"\nbad-ass and he really delivers confidence, action, fighting and\nawesomeness :)<br><br>This film is kind of a thriller, but more action packed, it did have me\nguessing all the way to the end and even after the reveal you still had\na lot of things going on.<br><br>It is actually a good plot, there are some twist to the story most of\nthe way and it really has you guessing back and forth, the setup is\ngood and everything happens inside an airplane, the only contact is one\nthe phone. Good and bad characters, but all well played and fitting in\nto the story and off course a lot of action packed high speed scenes\nthat works.\n"
"\nOff-the-wall but great action flick may best describe this film.\nInteresting to see Julianne Moore, Lupita N'yongo and Liam Neeson at\nlast night's Oscar telecast and then seeing them the following night in\nthis harrowing movie.<br><br>As is the case with all high-jacking films, the culprits always have a\npolitical statement to make and this one is no different when they show\ntheir disgust at the lack of what they feel was a poor response\nfollowing 9/11 regarding airline safety and they play it to the hilt by\ntrying to shift the blame on an air marshal played to the hilt by\nNeeson.<br><br>What a great premise to this non-stop action thriller in transferring\nthe requested ransom to the marshal's personal bank account so that he\nloses total credibility to those on the ground.<br><br>With an assortment of varied passengers, this picture is exciting to\nthe very end with the emergency landing and all.\n"
"\nIs that movie which inspires terrorism? If this movie which learn us\nhow to be protected or how we can be fought by terrorism? However...i\ndon't like that idea and how this director treated that scenario.It\nstarted well. It looks that director was full of ideas and so\nenergetic...but at the middle of movie that fantasy and imagination\nwanes. That hijacked airplane look kidnapped by technology and not by\namateur people and at the end we see that these bad guys were so weak\nphysically and they planned everything so perfectly but they couldn't\nmanage even a weapon in their hands. The end was a bullshit. How the\ndirector closed that scenario was so poor and bad idea. Not smart at\nall! Good luck in next movie!\n"
"\nLiam Neeson, Julianne Moore, Michelle Dockery and Linus Roache star in\nthis 2014 action thriller. Neeson (Taken) plays U.S. Air Marshal, Bill\nMarks who gets text calls from a mysterious passenger threatening to\nkill others every 20 minutes unless he gets 150 million dollars. Bill\nis trapped in a nightmare and stops at nothing to find him while the\npassengers panic. Moore (Hannibal) plays Jen Summers, a passenger who\nBill befriends, Dockery plays flight attendant, Nancy who is a friend\nof Bill's and Roache (Batman Begins) plays pilot, David McMillan. This\nis a good action thriller, Neeson is great as usual as well as John\nOttman's score. I recommend this.\n"
"\nThis seemed like a good movie to begin with, but sadly, this entire\nmovie, when summed up by the villain, is just a low jab at the people\nwho failed to do their job during 9/11.<br><br>Another movie in a series of movies recently, that likes to play the\nmystery game, to just pick out a random villain at the end, whom no one\ncould have predicted due to the stunning lack of information given\nduring the feature.<br><br>In the end, this is just another overrated movie, with enough action\nscenes to provide mild entertainment, and enough mystery to keep you\nguessing, but the end is a complete and utter let down.<br><br>A bitter writer, taking a low shot, at already dead men.\n"
"\nWell, that was forgettable fun. Liam Neeson as a sort of\nGaelic-accented Bruce Willis, forced to hunt down a hijacker on a\ntrans-Atlantic flight.<br><br>I don't quite buy Neeson as an action hero. He's too a bit too portly\nthese days, looking much more like he rather solve any problems by\nsitting down and having a good natter over a pint of Guinness, rather\nthan go gallivanting around like a mad thing.<br><br>He does put on a good show in this movie though. After boarding a\nplane, he starts getting text message threatening the lives of various\npassengers and crew, and has to gradually eliminate various suspects,\noften in a rather gung-ho fashion. He's not helped by everyone who\nshould be helping thinking he's off his rocker.<br><br>The movie switches from psychological drama to much more of an action\nfilm as it nears the end, and the final scenes are well handled and\nwind up events well.<br><br>It a reasonably good action flick. Not a lot of depth to it, but then\nthere's not supposed to be.\n"
"\nI have to say, I was expecting this movie to be an all out Action\nmovie. I don't usually enjoy Thrillers but this was absolutely amazing.\nI loved every second of it. Liam Neeson is a very convincing character\nand his characters background adds to the story. It was a brilliant\nmovie, however it wasn't the absolute best. The storyline in the movie\nis pretty good and very gripping. I'd say this is a Thriller/Mystery\nfilm with some Action, which overall makes this a pretty interesting\nmovie. I have to say it wasn't the most realistic movie ever made but\nit was pretty close. I've never seen any Liam Neeson movies before\nthis, but this movie makes me want to watch more of his movies.\n"
"\nThe movie did well on delivering what it aimed to give the audience. It\ngave thrills, suspense, and mystery. The acting was done well though\nsome of the characters lacked chemistry and line delivery struggled at\npoints. The writing was good and the story had some originality to it.\nThe real problem is with the ending which, like an airplane crashing,\ndive bombs from a high level of action and suspense to an\nunsatisfactory and empty ending. A good movie with a bumpy landing for\nan ending is an enjoyable movie that the whole family can enjoy! I am\nrating Non-Stop a 6 because the story and characters are engaging and\nit definitely adds suspense for the viewer! Yet it lacks re-watch\nability due to lack of chemistry between actors, some bad line\ndelivery, and crash landing of an ending.\n"
"\nLiam neeson plays bill marks an air Marshall who lost his daughter\nOlivia to cancer and alcoholic who is a passenger aboard the airplane\nwhen he receives a text message from an unknown person that unless 150\nmillion is deposited into an account, passengers will be killed every\n20 minutes, during the film, bill tried to find out who is the one\nsending him the threatening text messages and gets help from Jen played\nby Julianne Moore and flight attendant Nancy. Even though the role\nfeels somewhat similar to the Brian mills Role in taken but Liam neeson\nproves that he is quite believable as an action star. Overall I would\nhave to say that the film is rather enjoyable and good escape,\n"
"\nWhich kinda would be difficult since this plays in midair. Liam Neeson\nwould obviously never have guessed he'd become an action hero this late\nin his career, but Taken did push him into things like this. There was\nalso The Grey which felt a bit like The Thing from Carpenter but with\ndifferent kinds of beasts. The question this raises is: Is Liam Neeson\na beast himself (well the character he's playing)? Depending on your\nview on things, this may be interesting.<br><br>We get a few clich√©s, though I have to admit, I did not see one of the\nthings coming. The guessing game is not a bad one, even though it does\nstretch the logic bit a little. But the movie is fast paced and has a\nthrilling edge to it, so it won't bore you. A nice thriller that does\neverything it is expected to do. More than good entertainment value.\nNothing less, nothing (much) more\n"
"\nWhen an action film offers an interesting premise along with Liam\nNeeson as the leading man, one expects nothing short of an exciting and\nenjoyable experience, and Non-Stop does prove satisfying, even if\nsomewhat nonsensical. In large part, the audience is exposed to great\nlevels of unpredictability and very mysterious circumstances, as an air\nmarshal attempts to save his fellow passengers on a trans-Atlantic\nflight from a terrorist attack. The film is gripping and thrilling\nthroughout, with plenty of tense moments maintaining the feeling of\nsuspense, however it certainly deserved a much more clever final act,\nrather than concluding as a conventional action film. Although Liam\nNeeson does again perform well in a leading action role, one cannot\nhelp but argue that the rest of the cast, which included such notable\nnames as Julianne Moore, should have been utilized far better. Overall,\nNon-Stop comes across as an enthralling action film with a rather\nludicrous storyline, which is initially well-developed but\nunfortunately seems to lack a fitting end.\n"
"\nThis is one of those ridiculous thriller/action flick that gets even\nmore ridiculous as it progresses. However it has Liam Neeson kicking\nass and taking names. So I was in, and Neeson basically carries this\nmovie. However this was one of those movies that seemed to just make\nstuff up as it goes when it comes to the plot. It's a serious toned\nmovie that gets wacky with it's ridiculousness one too many times. Not\nonce did I go \"wow that was actually quite clever\". However it's still\na decent entertaining flick. Not really all that good, but still quite\nwatchable thanks to Neeson. Oh and the climax was really dumb.<br><br>5.9/10\n"
"\nLiam Neeson is one of my favorites. I like almost any picture he is in.\nHe's believable and has an expressive face that makes you root for him\nno matter what the circumstance. But \"Non-Stop\" must be his weakest and\nmost preposterous feature and it makes you wonder what was he thinking\nto accept a part in this crappy movie. <br><br>The premise is extremely far-fetched and as the picture progresses so\ndo the ridiculous plot devices, until the lame and surreal ending - but\nthat was just the icing on the cake for me. Not for one second could\nany movie fan who had finished third grade swallow any of this drivel.\nI think this comprises enough lines to stop typing, as this wretched\nfilm has already wasted too much of my time.\n"
"\ni am a fan of Liam neeson so i was excited to see this movie. while it\nwas entertaining and filled with twists and turns, both my husband and\ni were disappointed in this movie. it doesn't compare to so many of his\nothers and it seemed like they were more interested in plot twists than\nentertainment. there were so many things that didn't get answered. for\nexample, what was the purpose of the other content in the briefcase?\nhow did the person or persons behind this get access to the plane? why\nwas Liam neeson in such a hurry to get home that he wanted to do a\nturnaround? i gave it a 6 rating, and i think that was very generous.\nif it wasn't for the always great acting of Liam neeson, this movie\nwould be somewhat boring! it did keep you guessing, though so that was\nin it's favor. (i really hope none of these are considered spoilers. i\ntried to put the questions as generically as possible).\n"
"\nIn similar style to taken 1 and 2 this movie is a non stop action\nfeaturing Liam Neeson as the films hero. Overall it was very exciting\nand kept you guessing right up to the end. Most of the acting was on\npar with this style of movie, Liam Neeson gave the strongest\nperformance. The story itself was very clich√© (e.g plane, terrorists,\nbomb, hero saves the day) but as far as typical action/thrillers go\nthis one holds your attention throughout. It was a relief/refreshing to\nsee that for once the terrorist in the film wasn't Arabic or eastern\nEuropean. The main downside to the film was the ending which was very\npoorly acted and extremely cheesy. Still if you are looking for a film\nwith intense action, a minimal story line and Liam Neeson kicking ass,\nthen this is the movie for you.\n"
"\nDespite being almost totally set inside an airliner, the plot with many\ntwists and turns, keeps every scene intense and interesting. Air\nMarshall Bill Marks is the hero we all imagine we would be in times of\ngreat group and personal danger. <br><br>Worse yet, the baddies are bent upon casting Marshall Marks as the real\nbad guy, perish the thought, we cannot let this happen! For anyone who\never had a moment of flying trepidation to those of us with white\nknuckles, the movie confirms our worst fears and then some. Guaranteed\nto keep you guessing to the very end, while you hang desperately to the\nedge of your seat.<br><br>Neeson is a worthy heir to the Harrison Ford good guy genre. Maybe it\nwas the real life tragic loss of his beautiful wife, maybe we just see\nLiam as the underdog refusing to lose. Whatever it is, the magic is\nworking for him right now. A big thumbs up^ for \"Non-Stop\" (2014)!\n"
"\nSPOILER FREE. <br><br>I'm a fan of Liam Neeson, but I won't let my opinion interfere with\nthis review. I would give this film an 8/10. I like films that have\naction and a unique plot. In this case, Non Stop had both. It was a\nthriller, and it delivered a good thriller. The plot was constantly\nunravelling, throwing us new information. Since the plot was so\n\"mysterious\" I was constantly on the edge of my seat - trying to guess\nwho the criminals were. It was definitely worth seeing because of its\nchilling music, atmosphere and insane plot (it really had a great\nplot). The film also had a very thriller feel, with jump scares and\nconstant suspense. The plot was always surprising you, in a good way. I\ngive it an 8/10. Not a 9 because there wasn't constant action, but at\nthe same time, action isn't what a thriller is about. I didn't give it\na 10 because no film - nothing is perfect. Since I'm used to films with\nlots of action, I removed a point, but I'm sure most people would give\nit a 9. Overall, a great film that kept me on the edge of my seat.\n"
"\nThe acting was well done and the set was realistic. Much more to the\nplot than advertisement for the film would make you think. Very\ncreative plot and lots of good suspense. Majority of the film is set on\nthe inside of a large jet. That was very well done. Special effects for\naircraft in flight and plot related trauma was very well done. The use\nof technical working of smart phones, text messages and aircraft\nnetworks was well conceived including the editors method of letting us\nfollow along. Julianne Moore and Michelle Dockery were very beautiful\nand Lian Neeson, Scoot McNairy and Nate Parker did an excellent job\nacting.\n"
"\nBill Marks (Liam Neeson) is a sky marshall with problems - he drinks\ntoo much, there are family issues, and he doesn't much like flying. So\nwhen he starts getting text messages in flight to the effect that\nsomeone is going to start killing people aboard the plane every 20\nminutes, his day couldn't get much worse. Except it could. And does.<br><br>This on-board paranoia thriller is not bad - it keeps the tension\nracked up well throughout its fairly modest running length, and it's\nnot easy to guess the outcome.<br><br>Then it comes to the climax and it all falls apart somewhat. I won't\nexplain why, but I will say that much of what has taken place in the\nprevious 90 minutes won't stand up to close examination in the cold\nlight of day. It's not as bad as aliens beaming in and being\nresponsible for what has gone on, but it really isn't a great deal more\ncredible than that.<br><br>And it was all going so well, too. Not for Bill, though.<br><br>Oh, and Non-Stop is a pretty rubbish title as I believe it applies to\nmost plane journeys.\n"
"\nIf you are looking for a movie that purely entertains or you just want\nto check you brain at the door, then Non-Stop is it. Once again, Liam\nNeeson summons his typical grumpy, old action-pack character. If you've\nseen TAKEN, UNKNOWN, or THE GREY then you know what I'm talking about.\nAnd you know it does this character well. <br><br>This time, he is on a plane and trying to figure out the devious mind\nthat is behind the hijacking. He is up in the air with only a few hours\nleft before the plane starts plummeting towards the water. Is it the\nNYC cop? The gruff business man? The two lovers sitting behind him?<br><br>To some extent, you feel like you are watching another version of the\nboard game CLUE. But Liam Neeson and the writers know how to keep the\naction and thrills moving along. Don't expect the movie TAKEN, but\nyou'll have fun either way.<br><br>To check out more of my reviews go to www.filmigos.com\n"
"\nYeah, folks. You've heard that right. First, his daughter gets taken.\nThen, he gets taken and now his plane gets TAKEN!<br><br>It has the elements you liked in Taken. You have some fist fights here\nand there, a bathroom intense fight scene. Damn, Neeson is so intense\nand stylish that even the gun literally flies to his direction, so he\ncan use it against his enemy. XD<br><br>I also liked the comic book feeling regarding the text messages.\nInstead of showing them on the cell, they show them inside of white\nboxes, just like in comics.<br><br>Give it a chance and you'll be hooked from the beginning to the end.\nThere are some cool twists and the movie doesn't drag. Don't watch the\ntrailer, though. You'll be even more surprised!<br><br>Most of the cast was OK, Juliane Moore was fine enough and she has\nchemistry with Nesson.\n"
"\nI believe this is THE movie or the beginning of this year. Liam Neeson\ncontinues to impress and amaze on the big screen. His initial\nblockbuster it was Taken, and this surpasses it. Taken 2 was fairly\nweak and this made it look terrible. Non Stop, lone Sutvivor, Cpt\nPhillips, and Amercian Hustle are the best movies to come out recently.\nOverall I give this movie a solid 9.0. I would recommend it to ages\n12+. It is superb and exhibits acts of heroism, yet suspense. Tis movie\nis mind twisting, action packed, and requires thoughtfulness and wits\nto figure out who did it. Was it the Marshall, or was it his\npassengers?\n"
"\nThe movie begins with an average paced build up. The keen eyes of an\nair marshal looking for potential threats. Eventually, a threat reveals\nitself and one thing leads to another. I do not want to include any\nspoilers therefore I will sum up to say that the movie does not include\nany clich√© moments that have recently started to appear on a regular\nbasis in recent action thrillers. <br><br>All the events condense beautifully into a final stand off as expected,\nand though it seemed very obvious from the beginning that Liam Neeson\nwould save the day, you walk away glad that he did manage to do it.<br><br>You will not see who the real villain is until who he/she is. Any\nperson who mildly enjoys action thrillers will not regret watching this\nmovie. Just go in with an open mind and not expect the movie of the\ncentury. <br><br>No outstanding acting noticed by either by Lupita, Liam or Julianne\nMoore. However, It still qualifies as a good movie in my opinion.\n"
"\nLiam Neeson, single handedly carries this one off... the movie begins\nin a classic way reminding me of 'The Grey'! there is enough action to\nkeep you riveted throughout the movie length, even though the entire\nstory takes place on an airplane.. Go and watch this one without a\nsecond thought for a high octane rush!! the supporting cast with\nJulianne Moore do a good role to keep the entire story well gelled\ntogether..the story also carries hidden messages that touch personal\nnotes with the viewer, reminding you of your own sufferings at certain\ntimes. The small length of the film ensures that there are not too many\nloose ends for the director to tie up overall the film enthralls the\naudience with its action, suspense and drama.\n"
"\nI became a Liam Neeson fan when he started his new turn as an action\nhero in the excellent thriller, Taken. But I think this newest entry in\nhis recent action roles is more routine and by the numbers than what\nsome of the enthusiastic response is giving it credit for. It is a \"bog\nstandard\" action thriller aboard an airplane, and to me, it seemed a\nbit too goofy in places and overly contrived. It's not terrible by any\nmeans, but nothing special. I hope to see more interesting movies in\nthis genre from Neeson in the future, because I still haven't seen any\nof his other action movies rise to the level of \"Taken\" yet.<br><br>As far as special effects and set design, the movie is strong in those\ndepartments. I think the movie is actually best in its first 3rd, there\nis a nice style and atmosphere built up, and the movie seems quite\npromising at that point. Then it slowly goes downhill at an increasing\nrate from there. By the time the ending rolled around I found it to\nhave become very silly and a disappointment.\n"
"\nI gave this a chance and regretted it - what a pity Liam Neeson is\nputting box office $ before content and has settled into making\nvariations on a theme - I look forward (not) to \"Taken 9\" and \"Non-Stop\n4\" in 2018...<br><br>And Julianne Moore, a talented actress who starred in \"The Hours\" and\nother quality films - what was she thinking??? Apart from the obvious\npile of plot holes, Liam Neeson phoned this in, political correctness\noverruled common sense and the characters were beyond shallow in their\ndepiction. <br><br>OK it's an action movie - I understand that. The plot has to be\nsimplistic, characters are crudely defined and subtlety goes out the\nwindow. There are quite a few movies in this genre managing to\ntranscend that limited brief though - \"Bourne\" springs to mind.<br><br>Not recommended.\n"
"\nHow is this getting such high ratings? I am quite happy to suspend\ndisbelief and enjoy a standard silly thriller but this one just went\nway beyond the point of no return. The actions of the character played\nby Liam are just too stupid for words and although I'm happy to allow\ncharacters to make dumb decisions it gets tedious and ridiculous when\nthey keep making the same errors over and over and the only discernible\nreason for this to happen is to drive a ludicrous plot that would\notherwise fall apart completely. Liam was irritating as the overly\naggressive marshal and the majority of the cast working with him were\nsuperfluous. There were numerous plot holes, lots of subplots that went\nnowhere, shallow stereotypes, an annoying over-use of red-herrings and\nwhole scenes directly stolen from other - better - movies with similar\nthemes. I struggled to watch it all the way through. Watch Flight Plan\nor Red Eye instead.\n"
"\nI can't believe this film has so many high reviews. Complete and utter\ncheese....<br><br>Not only are there SO many plot holes, I notice no-one seems to have\nnoticed at the beginning of the film the little girl with a perfect\nEnglish accent, is going to meet her dad in England. However it's the\n1st time she's ever got on a plane... From USA to UK<br><br>How did she get to USA originally... by boat?????<br><br>Or maybe there are schools in America that give perfect elocution\nlessons in English. (Dick Van Dyke must have wished he'd gone there)<br><br>Oh, yes, you can get a gin and tonic before the airplane takes off??<br><br>Spoiler:-<br><br>Other than that it sets up a \"murder mystery situation\" which descends\ninto total stupidity, but at least you can set a bomb off in a plane at\n8000 feet and still survive according to Liam Neeson's calculations.\n"
"\nBill Marks(Liam Neeson) a down on his luck Air Marshall, while on a\nflight receives a text message from an unknown assailant, that says\nthey will kill someone on the plane in 20 minutes, if Bill transfers\n150 million dollars to an undisclosed account. Bill struggles to find\nout who it is before it's too late, while the passengers don't if Bill\nis the good guy or the bad guy?<br><br>Pretty good thriller, which becomes a who dun it, and it will keep you\nguessing till the end. Liam Neeson is great, really giving a good\nperformance, and not just playing it has a typical action hero.\nJulianne Moore is also good, making a miner character watchable. The\nactors playing the passengers are also great, they bring a sense of\nreality to it. Made me forget about Taken 2.\n"
"\nLiam Neeson stars as troubled air marshal Bill Marks, who is enroute to\nLondon. He starts receiving text messages saying someone on board will\nbe killed every 20 minutes unless $150M is sent to a secret bank\naccount. And then people start dying.<br><br>In this movie, every character, except for Bill, is set up as a likely\nsuspect; they all look very shifty and fully capable of murder. It's\nfun to watch everyone look guilty and my mind was racing to figure out\nthe culprit (I couldn't.). Neeson is outstanding as the air marshal,\nrunning the gamut of emotions from grief to confusion to terror; he's\ninstantly sympathetic and likable. Julianne Moore is good as Bill's\nseat mate and it's great to see Michelle Dockery (\"Downton Abbey\") as a\nflight attendant.<br><br>From the opening moments, I felt uneasy; that quickly turned to\nparanoia and then fear. The story kept me on the edge of my seat the\nwhole time and I really enjoyed the mystery of it. Recommended.\n"
"\nLiam Neeson what a turnaround who would have thought at 60 he would be\ndoing great action films well this film is nothing like taken this has\na whole plane full of people as he is a the law on the plane the story\nis great the people on board he finds out are going to die if he\ndoesn't do what he is been told he has to help and find who are what is\nthe trying to do on board this plane the trailers doesn't do this film\njustice its a thrilling story and superb who don't it film its 1hr\n4omins long it doesn't feel like that its not like snakes an a plane so\nor JODIE foster films it more like can Liam character save the day\nagain but its fun to watch this film makes you think you will be asking\nyourself is it this person or that person it will keep you thinking\nright to nearly the end is great way to make a film my rating 8/10 keep\nit up Liam\n"
"\nI loved flying. Before. Now I hate it. It is more dangerous then first\nthought. It is not the planes, they are safer now then before. It is\nthe people. Flying public has changed. And I do not like it, plus I do\nnot like some of the pilots. Some of them I do not trust.<br><br>Do you think it was a coincidence that LH 370 was lost on the same day\nwhen this film opened in Vietnam? At the right point of crossing from\nMalayisan into Vietnamise airspace? I do not think it was a\ncoincidence. Unfortenatelly, in this case Hollywood*s power showed\nitself to be fatal to some 200 plus passengers of a doomed flight. Such\na pity! Planes were designed to connect people and make them love each\nother. Over the years they became deadly weapons.<br><br>As far as the film goes, it is a very entertaining airplane film,\nacting is excellent, Liam Neeson has become a great star. I love\nwatching films where he has a role like this.<br><br>This is a perfect opportunity to ask airplane manufacturers to make\nflying even safer.\n"
"\nI recently saw \"Non-Stop\" a couple of days ago and I personally enjoyed\nit. It's not just a copy and paste of \"Taken\" like some people seem to\nbelieve. It was unique, creative, and a good deal of fun. But is it as\ngood as other movie thrillers? No, but that's not really a bad thing.\nIt may not be as suspenseful as other great thrillers like \"Perfect\nBlue\" or \"Rear Window\" but it is just as entertaining. \"Non-Stop\" had a\nfew pretty silly moments and it did drag on a little longer than it\nreally needed to, but it still did its best to keep from losing focus\nand keep the audience entertained. Is it an absolutely amazing movie?\nNo. Is it a well done movie? Yes. Is it Oscar worthy? No and I don't\nthink it's really meant to be. It's a decent thriller film that does\nprove to be a great time at the movies. The story is good, the action\nis good, most of the characters are forgettable but likable, and Liam\nNeeson is, well, Liam Neeson. It's just a fun movie to watch and I\nthink it's worth at least one viewing.\n"
"\nIf you're looking for a movie that manages to keep the tension and the\nsuspense the whole time, this is a great choice! This is not the\ntypical \"I saw it coming\" type of movie since everyone becomes a\nsuspect. Everyone is suspicious to the main character and to the\nspectator.<br><br>This is a perfect thriller, with a pretty good story line, unlike most\naction movies.<br><br>*** Not a spoiler but : It looked like they were looking for a way to\nend this movie quickly which made the ending a little bit rubbish.\nSince the ending was quick, the movie is still great in general and I\nwould recommend it as a great suspense.\n"
"\nI went to watch this film with high hopes. As an avid fan of Liam\nNeeson's acting I felt this was going to be something to remember.\nWhilst it was a very strong, exciting film it could have been better.\nIt has lots of twists and turns and some decent bits of action.The\naction was good but not amazing and I didn't feel it was on the level\nof some of Liam Neesons other films such as Unknown and Taken. I felt\nthe director could have made the film and characters more tense to keep\nyou on the edge of your seat a little more and perhaps the parameters\nweren't fully explored on what could have been an amazing film.<br><br>However, in saying all that it is definitely worth watching and\ndefinitely not a waste of your money or time. 8/10\n"
"\nThe point of 99.99% of all (primarily) action movies is to keep the\nviewer entertained, at the edge of his/her seat and keep them guessing.\nThis movie achieved all of those goals perfectly. Liam Neeson was, once\nagain, amazing as the role of Bill Marks. The acting was generally\nfantastic. My friends and I had no complaints with the script, except\nfor literally two lines, which came off as a tad cheesy, but that's\nnothing. A definite must see movie, especially if you love action\nthemed movies. Without a doubt, this movie lands in my top 3 favorite\naction movies of all time...until now, of course. If you watch/have\nwatched this movie and (have) liked it, a similar movie which I would\nalso recommend is Source Code. Pretty much the same style, but I would\nsay Non- Stop is better, because the tension is always high, the acting\nis better, and it's completely unpredictable, even though you keep\nthinking you've figured it all out.\n"
"\nThis movie was bad and went badder...just like my grammar! There is no\nway to justify this movie being made. Yet, it was still slightly\nentertaining. I love plane thriller movies. Airport blew my mind as a\nkid and scared the crap out of me. This is just a horrible movie. Call\nit a paycheck movie for name actors on the downward slope of their\ncareers. How was this green lighted by studio execs? If this was made\nfor TV movie it might be acceptable for a 2am showing, but as a major\nmotion picture? There is a reason I never heard of this movie even\nthough Liam Neeson starred and is a hot ticket since Taken. IMDb did\nnot do me a favor with an average vote of 7 rating. Please.\n"
"\n7.2? The fix is in, folks. This stinker deserves a 5.9 and no higher. <br><br>'Non-Stop' sort of sucked. It completely missed the mark on almost\nevery level. The characters were poorly developed, especially Liam's,\nthe story was dumb and recycled from four different 'Die Hard' movies\nand, worst of all, the villain was so clich√©d and ambiguous that he\nmight as well not have been in the film at all. To be honest, at this\npoint, I can't even remember who the real villain was. In fact, that's\nthe best way I can think of to sum up 'Non-Stop' with one word. The\nentire thing is utterly FORGETTABLE. The most intelligent decision you\ncan make right now is to simply forget this film even exists. Move on,\nand better luck with your next inclination.\n"
"\nThis is truly the biggest piece of turd I've ever seen. Truly one of\nthe worst movies to come out in recent years. <br><br>Liam Neeson has out done himself this time. I don't know how anybody\ninvolved in this would release this onto the world with their name in\nthe credits. If I had anything to do with this movie, anything at all,\neven as a cleaner, mopping the toilet floors I would refuse to be in\nthe credits.<br><br>This movie is not worth the time it stole from my life. It is not even\nworth this horribly amateurish review from some nobody in South Africa\nbut I warn everybody who is reading this: Do not let them steal your\nlife, avoid it. Go for a walk, read a book, watch something else. <br><br>I hope I at least help one person make an informed choice to not watch\nthis crap.\n"
"\nI WILL NOT POST ANY SPOILERS IN THIS REVIEW Non-Stop was very good. Was\nit the best movie I've ever seen, no. But it was a very good movie and\nI would recommend it to anyone that is looking for a movie that will\nkeep you guessing until the end and will make you second guess every\ncharacter, every move, and every action. Non-Stop being the name, it\nmay lead you to believe it's a non-stop action thriller that will blow\nyour face off. If you're looking for that type of movie, this is not\ngoing to suffice; it's not Die Hard or Independence Day. But it's an\naction thriller movie that will leave you trying to figure things out\nuntil the very end...will some of you pick out who it was in the\nbeginning? Yeah, I'm sure. But I'm usually very good at knowing and I\nhad absolutely NO clue until it was actually revealed. Also, if you\ndon't like planes, this isn't for you since 95% of it happens on a\nplane. Bottom line, it's worth seeing if you like action thrillers,\nLiam Neeson, or \"pretty good\" movies.\n"
"\nGimme a break!<br><br>This is getting totally out of control. A good Muslin in a plane\nhijacked by a victim of 9/11? So the Muslim is a good doctor who help\nvictims in the plane while the hijacker who seems to be a combat\nveteran is fed up with the American-way-of-life and decides to take\nrevenge on the system...<br><br>Those geniuses of Hollywood are getting better by the day. <br><br>This is stupid beyond belief... What next? A movie where Jesus is a\npedophile? A transvestite action hero who kills white people while\nwearing stilettos?\n"
"\nI love really good action movies and Liam Neeson has truly become\nsomeone to watch. This movie was intense and kept you guessing\nthrough-out. It's not an Oscar winner rather an audience pleaser so if\nyou go in remembering that you'll enjoy. As a female it was great to\nhave Julianne Moore and Michelle Dockery represent with fairly\nsubstantial parts and not have to behave like some action-movie bimbos\n- very satisfying. Oh and the cameo from Anson Mount was appreciated as\nwell! The best recommendation I can give is that my husband woke up\nthis morning and said \"I really enjoyed that movie last night and I'm\nquite surprised!\"\n"
"\nThis is not a spoiler review. Sure it's an action flick. Yes, Liam\nNeeson is the lead role. I really like Liam Neeson movies! I was\nlooking forward to seeing this movie. The movie had potential but has\none major terrible unjustified flaw. I'm not going to tell you what it\nis but you'll remember what I said here. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY on this\nmovie. You will thank me later after more reviews surface about this\npathetic movie! Please, please don't take what I say here as, \"Now I\nhave to go see it!\" Again, wait until you see more reviews surface and\nyou will thank me that you didn't go. Wait until you get peer reviews\nand the truth will be told! I have said nothing to reveal the plot. All\nI'm saying is \"Step away and turn your back on this film!\"\n"
"\nThe biggest let down was the films direction and cutting. If your\nplanning to confine the stage to a single cockpit you need to get even\nmore creative than this. The story and plot was full of holes too.\nMaybe a low budget was the main problem here, yet could have added a\nlot more color to the cutting; to other scenes and the build up on the\nmedia or got to know a little more about the people you don't want to\ndie before boarding etc. I can not think of one good scene in the\nentire film and do not recommend this film to anyone. I can not give\nexamples of just how bad the plot is, because I hate writing spoilers.\nHow did they get Liam Neeson and Julianne Moore to be in this, must\nhave been were half the budget went, oh well.\n"
"\nThis movie started out like it was gonna be awesome. My wife and I\nfinally thought we found a true sleeper. The story was intense and\nbelievable and then it happened. Jumped the shark like Arthur\nFonzarelli. It went downhill as fast as the airplane dropped from\n30,000ft to 8,000ft.<br><br>A prior review said it best \"Silly as Hell, but quite Entertaining\",\nwhich really describes the movie very well.<br><br>The setup premise was one of the better starts to a plot line, then it\nbegan unraveling at a rapid pace. At one point Neeson was beat on by 8\npassengers, he whipped all their butts and his hair didn't even move.<br><br>It went from a great story to almost a cartoon in very short order.<br><br>But like a true train wreck, it was very tough to look away so we\ndidn't. Even crazier we're still talking about it now.<br><br>Proceed with caution.\n"
"\nIn similar style to taken 1 and 2 this movie is a non stop action\nfeaturing Liam Neeson as the films hero. Overall it was very exciting\nand kept you guessing right up to the end. Most of the acting was on\npar with this style of movie, Liam Neeson gave the strongest\nperformance. The story itself was very clich√© (e.g plane, terrorists,\nbomb, hero saves the day) but as far as typical action/thrillers go\nthis one holds your attention throughout. It was a relief/refreshing to\nsee that for once the terrorist in the film wasn't Arabic or eastern\nEuropean. The main downside to the film was the ending which was very\npoorly acted and extremely cheesy. Still if you are looking for a film\nwith intense action, a minimal story line and Liam Neeson kicking ass,\nthen this is the movie for you.\n"
"\nI really enjoyed this movie. This is definitely one of my favorite Liam\nNesson movies. Like most Liam Nesson movies it was very action packed\nand there were a lot of fighting scenes in this movie. The setting of\nthis movie is a transatlantic jetliner bound for London. And this movie\ntakes advantage of the setting because of the small setting we get to\nlearn a lot of information about all of the passengers on the plane and\nwe get to watch them develop as characters the movie makes you identify\ncharacters. It will make you figure out who the good guys and the bad\nguys are. Liam Nesson did a great job portraying a Air Marshal. And\nthroughout the movie you are on the edge of your seat trying to guess\nwhat will happen this whole movie will keep you guessing. And overall\nit is one of my favorite action movies I did not see much wrong with it\nexcept for some scenes that lacked realism. This movie was definitely\none of the most epic movies I have ever seen.\n"
"\nOK i am watching the movie now and wanted to stop it and start writing\nsome things that just don't make any sense to me.<br><br>like for example, 1 what is the point of the guy having and using his\ncell phone if he cant even message or contact his supervises on it to\nlet them know what is going on, don't he know how to copy and paste,\nand also don't they would have access to his cell phone text history\nfrom the network. anyways, let me write more as i watch<br><br>2, why the captain of the plain did not want to talk or see the 2nd air\nmarshal when he got the gun and badge from the first one<br><br>OK the movie finish now, it was an interesting story, but so crazy to\nbe real, anyways, it was a fun watch\n"
"\nLook ill keep this simple and straight to the point. Its 2014 and only\nlike 5 movies have \"thrilled\" me or put me on the \"edge\" of my seat (i\nwas in my bed so i cant relate but you get the point). <br><br>Now this movie yes this freaking movie, man where do i start. Its one\nof those movies that keep you glued to it the whole time because you\nsit there so eagerly wanting to see what happens next. Liam Neeson is\nphenomenal in this film and everything he does in this movie is going\nto keep you biting your nails. Id say its slightly predictable but not\ntoo predictable to the point you know whats going to happen in every\nscene.<br><br>Bottom line is sit your ass down, grab popcorn or pods (pods go off),\nget comfy and enjoy this oh and clip your nails before watching cause\nthis because you'll probably bite them. 8/10\n"
"\nThis movie really wasn't that good. It's not much of an action movie\nand stars Liam Neeson, an actor turned action star once he reached 60.\nSocial media, aka texting, is basically the star of the show. Neeson\nplays troubled air marshall, Bill Marks, whom is on a plane to London.\nOn the plane, he starts receiving text messages from someone\nthreatening to kill passengers if he doesn't get a lot of money\ntransferred to a bank account. Marks uses cameras to come up with\nsuspects whom may be using a phone. Sure enough, a few die, but at\nwhose hands. Then a bomb comes into play.<br><br>Can Marks find the hijackers, whom by the way, has become the main\nsuspect with authorities on the ground, save everyone left on the plane\nand keep the bomb from destroying the plane? FINAL VERDICT: It's OK,\nbut having the text messages appear on the screen just made it seem so\ncheap, like a TV movie. Not Neeson's best action movie.\n"
"\n(60%) An intense thrill ride that hooks you in and doesn't let go until\nthe very final reel. It must be said that this accomplishes all that it\nset out to do, and is very entertaining without being overblown or too\ndumb. Neeson has adapted into this fine popcorn entertainer and here\nhe's playing a role not far off \"Into the grey\". The way that it\nsuggests that almost anyone could be the killer is its biggest strength\nas paranoia looms over everyone until almost the very end, and that in\nitself is a decent trick to pull off. It's very much a movie that's\nwell worth a look, and is a rock-solid rental or a matin√©e cinema\nticket, but maybe not a full price as it's good, but not brilliant.\n"
"\nI you like I are a fan of Liam Neeson and his brand of anti-hero acting\nthen this is for you. This is a Taken but not quite sort of movie. I\nreally enjoyed the feel and the way this movie was presented. <br><br>Liam is also really on form in this movie and the addition of Julianne\nMoore makes for an interesting counterpoint in terms of acting. <br><br>However even with the two great people in this movie the film feels too\nformulaic. It plods from one action scene to the next with not much\nelse happening to keep the suspense. I am not sure if this movie is\ntrying to be a suspense movie or an action movie. <br><br>The way that everything seems to be setup just right, he always has the\nright amount of information, the right amount of this or that, does the\nright thing etc for the movie to be able to move to the next scene. It\nfeels a little clumped together and not smooth running. Shame, could\nhave been a brilliant movie.<br><br>Worth a watch if you are a fan of action flicks or Liam but really only\nworth a once over.\n"
"\nMovie was Quite Good But Still Somethings was missing..like some\nmystery still remains locked like..who shot that Captain in his\ncabin..Cuz both The villain was found no sign of going there in air\ntoilet so it was quite difficult to understand..except that movie was\nquite amazing. Though everything that in movie was so clear.. and\nlanguage bases and explanation i would like to give 8 out of 10 starts.\nbut due to some locked mystery things it decrease it point it self.\nAnything else was quite perfect.. But ending can be little bit\ninteresting.. its ending like 90's movie.. it can be little bit good.<br><br>Thats It Guyz....\n"
"\nMore interesting movie that I originally thought it would be. The plot\ngrows as it advances, and you really get into the whodunit of it.<br><br>But, why change Neeson's hands on several close-ups during the movie?\nDoes he doesn't like his hands? Is it a decision the Director makes?\nBased on what? <br><br>Such decision brakes continuity and brings down quality of movie. <br><br>It's like \"photoshopping\" a photograph, or maybe it's worse than that.\nIt might be very common to make such changes during production or\nedition (enhancing body parts, or bringing body models on certain\nclose-ups), but when it's made cheaply brings the whole picture down.<br><br>Just saying\n"
"\nLiam Neeson does a decent job in this action thriller of a man who\ntakes a plane ride and receives threatening texts from an anonymous\nperson demanding for $150 million or one of the passengers will die. He\nspends most of the film trying to find out who's the mysterious person\nis as much as we do. Throughout the movie, you keep trying to guess who\nthe mysterious person is and it leaves you biting your nails.<br><br>This movie is filled with constant suspense and keeps you at the edge\nof your seat. Liam Neeson as well as the other actors and actress show\noff such good performances that you can almost literally feel their\nemotions and the intensity. In my opinion, Neeson deserves an Oscar for\nhis role or at least some type of award.<br><br>One of the best action films of the year so far. 9/10\n"
"\nNon-Stop has Liam Neeson ('Taken') in a tailor-made role for him.\nNeeson has starred in a number of action films of late and has a steady\npopular following. His appeal is what I call the Neeson effect:\npresence, a crumbling resonant voice, and more than a capable action\nhero. <br><br>In Non-Stop he plays a world weary U.S. Air Marshall. The plane he is\non, to London, has someone perpetuating text messages attempting to nab\nmillions of dollars. The threatening messages are sent to the air\nMarshall's mobile phone. He springs to action in an Agatha Christie\nstyle plot. <br><br>There is a build-up of suspense and suspicion and there is Julianne\nMoore as a feisty and friendly passenger, but is she trustworthy.<br><br>This movie hinges on paranoia, suspicion and intensity, and it doesn't\nquite come together. Unhinging camera work signifies something's amiss,\nbut we still doubt the story's credibility.\n"
"\nMany airliner hijack stories have been put on film, some good, some not\nworth the bother. Non-stop is a good hijack movie because it keeps you\nguessing like a mystery while it shakes the crap out of you. I liked\nLiam Neeson in Schindler's List (1993), Taken (2008), Star Wars:\nEpisode I - The Phantom Menace (1999) and Batman Begins (2005). He\ndelivers another very credible lead role in Non-stop and makes it work.\nIt might seem he's getting on in age for these roles but he's the\nconsummate actor and well toned for the action. He can certainly hold\nhis own in an intellectual parry as well, as his 60 Minutes Interview\nshowed. This movie doesn't pretend to be anything other than what it\nis, a murder every 20 minutes on the Auqa Atlantic not unlike A Murder\nOn The Orient Express. Non-stop is a movie well worth the price to see.\nYou will not be wasting your money.\n"
"\nI was actually tired after watching \"Non-Stop\". My heart rate made me\ntired. This movie keeps you at the edge of your seat the whole time! It\nstarts with drama really fast and there is no time to catch your\nbreath! No time for boredom! Liam Neeson and Julianne Moore are the\nbest team you can imagine. Their acting is convincing and natural.<br><br>The plot is very intelligent and you have more questions than answers\nuntil the last minutes. Who's the hero, who's the bad guy? <br><br>I didn't notice any deeper meaning of the movie, so yes, it's just to\nentertain you for two hours, but it does the job so well that you will\nwant to watch it again!\n"
"\nNot too bad a film, although I couldn't help shouting at the screen\nquite a few times. Things like, 'really?' or 'why on earth would you do\nthat?'<br><br>Liam seems to either do brilliant films or rubbish. 'Taken' is a\nbrilliant film, but 'Taken2' is rubbish. 'Unknown' was a great film but\n'The Grey' was just awful. <br><br>However this film falls into the OK category. To many plot holes for my\nliking, but having said that I never guessed who the terrorists\nactually were.<br><br>What is sad is that this was a good story and it could have been so\nmuch better. I echo many of the criticisms and plot holes that others\nhave already put on here.\n"
"\nFinally a real action movie! Liam is currently turned into the first\naction hero of Hollywood. (Sry Statham). After Takena which is to me\ngreat action movie, took a slightly inferior sequel, and, in my\nopinion, this is a full Non-stop hit. Introduction to the story about\nten minutes and then an hour and a half of tension, fear, paranoia,\nreversals and, most importantly, totally unpredictable. The film may\nhave some little mistakes, but it is action, and this is easily\nignored. Interestingly, filmed because the action happens 95% of the\ntime on the plane. I put him in rankings Rambo and Die Hard. Thank you,\nLiam, for showing people and other filmmaking teams who to make a\nproper action movie!\n"
"\nOK, I guess I am a little shocked that I have read a couple reviews\nthat said this is \"so ridiculous\" or \"silly\" \"it could never happen\"\nLOL that is exactly the arrogantcy that the rest of the world marvels\nat in the USA!!! Has anyone watched the news??? How does a boy get\nthrough an airport on a plane?!?? Anyway, the MOVIE was GREAT!! My\nheart was racing after the movie was over! I was panting. I really kept\ngoing back and forth with who it was, on or off the plane and the\nmotive! I love brain teasers and I thought he (Liam) did a fabulous\njob! What a great actor! He had me going and the twist with Julienne! I\nwould watch this again! I am only sad I didn't go to the movies to see\nit and at home on TV. I believe movies like this are good because not\nonly entertaining but they make you think! A great movie and thriller\nride!\n"
"\nLiam Neeson and Julianne Moore are going \"Non-Stop\" in this 2014 film.<br><br>Neeson plays an alcoholic air marshall who is texted that one person\nevery 20 minutes is going to die unless the terrorist gets $150 million\ntransferred to his account. He begins a frantic search for the texter,\nand then it is learned that the bank account to receive the money is in\nhis name.<br><br>In order to emphasize what a total mess Liam Neeson's character is, 9\nyears were knocked off of his age so that he would look pretty bad for\n53 instead of okay for 62.<br><br>Oscar winner Lupita Nyong'o has nothing to do.<br><br>For me, this wasn't an edge-of-my-seat adventure film, so the plot\nholes I would normally forgive, I can't. And this one was so full of\nplot holes, a Swiss cheese would look solid.<br><br>It's one thing to leave certain questions about the plot up to the\naudience, but sadly, I don't think that's why the film is confusing and\nhas open questions. I think it was just sloppily written.\n"
"\nBill Marks (Liam Neeson) is an Air Marshall on an international flight.\nHe receives a text message saying one person will die every 20-minutes\nunless $150-million is deposited into an offshore account. Marks needs\nto find the person on board who would do that killing. <br><br>This is a good opportunity to play detective along with Bill Marks. How\ngood do you think you are? I had no clue. Bummer. <br><br>Yes, Marks has baggage, but he's dealing with it. The focus is on\ntrying to find the bad guy who is sending all these text messages. Stay\nfocused. Chalk this baggage up to every story has a back-story and this\nis what we have. Stay focused. <br><br>All the cast turned in good performances and there are some twists\nalong the way that you may not see coming. There is some CGI and it's\nvery well done although kind of unusual. You'll see. <br><br>There is suspense and tension all the way through and I was riveted to\nmy seat. This is really good and very entertaining. (7/10)<br><br>Violence: Yes. Sex: No. Nudity: No. Language: Only one F-bomb late in\nthe movie by the Co-pilot.\n"
"\nThe acting , the plot and the special effects are all very average. I\nwas expecting a lot more from this film and was expecting more depth in\nthe story line but it was all a bit silly in the end. There isn't any\ncliff hanger moments or big twists in the movie.<br><br>Some of the parts are just not well though out, like the fact he kills\nthe first guy and they said someone would die in 20 mins. How did they\nknow the other agent would react that way and pull his gun out ? Then\nthe fact they use a Muslim as a possible target but it turns out he is\na nice guy, even better a doctor that tries saving people, amazing\nhaha. <br><br>I do love cheesy action films and am big into the 80s films but you\ncan't make 80s films now, when I watch an 80s film with no substance it\ndoesn't matter because other factors in the film made up for them, but\nthis film didn't really have a saving grace and there's no excuse for\npoor special effects in this day and age. <br><br>It's probably worth a watch but if you're into plane hijacking films\nthen passenger 57 or executive decision are much better.\n"
"\nRecent years have seen dozens of popular movies where events take place\nin a limited space and time. Non-Stop is another is this row, and\ndefinitely above average. Well, the script is not fresh, with several\nmoments seen in other so-called plane action/disaster movies, and\nunreal scenes, but thanks to various awards nominees Liam Neeson and\nJulianne Moore and director Jaume Collet-Serra, the intensity is\nmaintained and the course of events is not annoying or yawning to\nfollow. Pity only that talented character actors Lupita Nyong'o and\nCorey Stoll had unimportant roles to play. The ending could have been\nmore interesting (= less predictable), but as I did not guess the\nperson of the offender and his motives, I can't complain :)<br><br>Do not seek profundity, sit and enjoy the pace and performances!\n"
"\nNon-Stop features Liam Neeson as Bill Marks, a Federal Air Marshal, who\nis alone-some and disturbed. Marks boards a plane traveling from New\nYork to London and mid-way through, he receives a message that says\n'Going to kill in every 20 minutes unless $150 million are not\ntransferred in to his account'. <br><br>Turns out, the account is in Marks name and this is a big setup to\ncrash the plane and stand mark, the US Air Marshall responsible. From\nthere on, the suspense starts to unravel. The ending about the motives\nof the hijackers isn't that intriguing as much as the other half of the\nmovie. <br><br>The movie is shot quite wonderfully and the acting is very good. You\nget gripped by the suspense from early on. if you are a fan of Suspense\naction thrillers, or if you are fan of Liam Neeson, just give this a\ngo. You would love it.\n"
"\nIt's a vaguely entertaining movie. It shows a little bit of character\ndevelopment and self-realization of Neeson's character, but it's very\nminor. It did keep me guessing about the antagonist, but I find this\nfar from an excellent film. I fell asleep on it several times, and\nafter I finally finished it, I deleted it immediately. I have no desire\n(at ALL) to watch it again, and it is hard for me to recommend it to\npeople. It wasn't horrible, but it was far from great.<br><br>Apparently this review was too short, but I really don't have much else\nto say about this movie. The plot was unique, but the plot holes and\ngoofs were noticeable. The floating gun really bothered me, but that\nwas near the end of the film, and by that time, I just really wanted it\nto hurry up and end.\n"
"\nNon-Stop<br><br>The easiest way to tell if there is an air marshal on your flight is to\nyell out: Bomb!<br><br>A better way, as the air-terrorist in this thriller finds, is to start\nkilling crewmembers.<br><br>An alcoholic air marshal (Liam Neeson) aboard a non-stop flight across\nthe Atlantic receives a text from a passenger stating that he will kill\nsomeone every 20 minutes until he gets $150M.<br><br>Determined to neutralize the mysterious threat, the marshal starts\ntargeting suspicious passengers and interrogating them.<br><br>But when evidence comes to light that the marshal may be the terrorist,\npassengers (Julianne Moore, Jason Butler Harner) and crew (Michelle\nDockery, Lupita Nyong'o) panic.<br><br>An intriguing concept with a tragic lead and tons of close-combat\nsequences, Non-Stop seems poised to please.<br><br>Unfortunately, the game's perpetrator isn't as earth shattering as\nhoped and the acting can be flighty.<br><br>By the way, more dead passengers, means more elbow room. <br><br>Yellow Light<br><br>vidiotreviews.blogspot.ca\n"
"\nEntertaining but requires a strong suspension of disbelief. Liam Neeson\nis great but isn't he always? They do a pretty good job with the red\nherrings, even if I guessed it a little earlier than I was probably\nsupposed to. Well, I figured this person had something to do with it,\nwhether they were THE bad guy or just an accomplice. But they did keep\nme guessing at least about whether they were in it alone or not. The\nmotive behind all of it seemed a little forced, as well. I got the\nfeeling the writers wanted to get far more political with it than they\nwere allowed to. I'm willing to bet there was an earlier draft that was\nmuch whinier and soapboxier. What's in the finished product is nothing\nto get worked up over, though. It's a decent time-killer. For those\nwondering, the poster shot of Neeson leaping through the air firing his\ngun on the plane actually does occur in the movie. It's the timing of\nwhen it occurs that is the most priceless part. Oh, and since when are\nflattops back in style? Nate Parker looked like Theo Huxtable in this.\n"
"\nWith a title like Non-Stop you expect non stop action but this is more\na thriller with periodical action scenes to keep the beats going. After\nall Liam Neeson is in his 60s and cannot keep on fighting all through\nthe film.<br><br>Neeson is an air marshal with personal problems and a fondness for\ndrink. As the flight takes off he receives a series of text messages\nasking for millions of dollars to be deposited in a bank account or\nsomeone will die every 20 minutes.<br><br>The texts are popped on screen in the style of the TV series 'Sherlock'\nwhich is a blessing for the viewer.<br><br>Neeson now has to find the person making the threats, suspect all\npassengers and even the fight crew. On the other hand his warnings are\nnot taken seriously and 20 minutes into the first threat the first\nperson dies.<br><br>The movie is far fetched and convoluted. The reveal is difficult to\nfathom but it is an enjoyable film as Neeson desperately tries to find\nthe villain while he increasingly looks like he is losing it and\nattracts suspicion himself.\n"
"\nThis is not a a very believable movie. There are a thousand things that\nyou can nitpick about the plot, but at the end of the movie I had to\nlook back and say, I really enjoyed that. It's almost non-stop\nsuspense, and I will give the writers this nod, I had no idea who the\nbad guy was until he's revealed at the very end.<br><br>The only reason I watched this movie was that I have become such a fan\nof the Liam Neeson thriller, I like millions of others became hooked\nwith Taken. When you look at other action stars, say Jason Statham, for\ninstance, he looks like a bad ass. Liam Neeson looks, and has the\nmannerisms of an everyman, so when he goes into full bad ass mode it's\nsuch a wonderful surprise, even when you know it's coming.<br><br>This long and the short of it is, this movie is worth your time and I\nthink you'll enjoy it. If you liked Taken, there is an even better\nchance that you will like it, make no mistake, this is not as good a\nmovie as taken, but it is worth a watch, IMHO\n"
"\nIt's Awesome!!<br><br>it's not a regular movie about hijacking a plane.<br><br>it's the best thrilling screenplay that can be written about planes.<br><br>the way this movie was written keeps you guessing all that time. <br><br>who is the terrorist, how can he do it, is it just one terrorist ,is\nthe terrorist even on the plane, is it Liam Neeson himself ???? <br><br>Julianne Moore is impressive as usual. <br><br>that young girl Quinn Mccolgan has a very beautiful role.<br><br>i'm not gonna spoil it .. just watch it .. don't hesitate.<br><br>hold on to your seat .. this movie will take you on an amazing\nadventure.\n"
"\nGreat film and even grater plot fail! <br><br>After all this action you start thinking why the hell did not the cop\ncheck hes weapon?<br><br>Good, thank you for that after taste :)<br><br>Film has all the elements of success, so it is definitely not waste of\ntime.<br><br>As casual action film consumer you will be pleased .<br><br>You look and will not get pored.<br><br>There is no hint who is the suspect and in the same time it not overly\nparanoid (as often do this kind of plots).\n"
"\nIf you think you have seen enough airplane thrillers after Red Eye,\nFlight Plan etc, think again. This one is actually entertaining well\npaced, well written, not too outlandish, and it has a good cast. The\nstory keeps you guessing long enough and there is a nice sense of who\nis who among the characters on board.<br><br>Liam Neeson the action hero who doesn't have to move too much does a\nconvincing job as the air marshal dealing with a threat coming from\nsomeone texting. Julianne Moore works well with him as a passenger.\nMichelle Dockery shows her versatility - she can play the aristocrat\nand the flight attendant equally well.<br><br>It's exciting till the end and well done.\n"
"\nNon-Stop was a great movie that kept me on the edge of my seat. It\nrevolves around a sort of washed up air marshal who ends up being the\ntarget of a sick game being played by a terrorist on a plane that often\nleaves Nieson limited with options but nevertheless, determined. The\nplot is pretty creative and unique enough to give it a shot at\nwatching, and it proves worth it. It's hard to make an action movie\nstand out nowadays but this one does so with the fear, suspense, and\nmost of all...desperately wanting to know who is up to what. The movie\nkeeps you guessing. I'll admit a bad movie when I see one, or one that\nmaybe isn't worth a theater trip. I wish I had seen this one in\ntheaters, instead of Unknown. Don't let that movie stop you from seeing\nthis one. Liam's still got it and proves it in this movie.\n"
