"\n~NO SPOILERS~<br><br>How to Train your Dragon 2 is a shining example of what both family\nmovies and animated films are capable of. This is not the same story\nrehashed over again. From the characters, to the drama, to the action,\nto the comedy, this film does what any sequel should do by stepping up\nits predecessor in every way possible, and respects its audience enough\nnot to shy away from its darker and more dramatic content, but still\nremain viewable and entertaining for all audiences. We are talking\nabout a PG rated Dreamworks film after all. <br><br>From the moment the music began playing during the beginning to when\nthe end credits began roiling, I was completely immersed in this\nphenomenal movie that is more than worthy to stand along side the likes\nof any great live-action fantasy film or the past decade. Possibly one\nthe the best animated movies I have ever seen, this is the Empire\nStrikes Back of animated films. <br><br>9/10 (Very possibly will increase to 10/10 upon my second viewing.)\n"
"\nThis movie hits it out of the park regarding all the important factors\n. Storytelling, voice cast and animation is top class. The kids will\nget entertained and the parents even more so, because the movie is\nintelligent as well as fun. <br><br>The dragon's depictions are very amazing, you find yourself smitten by\nthese creatures and also caring for the human characters.<br><br>Is it better than the first film? Yes, with improvements in the areas\nof emotion and magnitude. This one is also very different than the\nfirst one.<br><br>So, verdict.<br><br>YOU BETTER GO SEE THIS AS SOON AS YOU CAN!\n"
"\nThis movie touch me. The story line is amazing and at the same time\nlovely as u guys know already that basically that the plot of How To\nTrain Your Dragon 2 is about Hiccup reunited with his mother, Valka.\nWhile Stoick The Vast will continue his love to Valka as he thought\nValka was dead. The voice actor for Valka, Cate Blanchett. Her voice is\njust perfect for Valka character. The drama for this movie is really\ntouching as the family go up against the enemy,Drago BloodVist. The\ngraphics for this movie is incredibly stunning. For those people asking\nwhether to watch in 3D, My answer is yes it is definitely worth your\nmoney. I think this movie is suitable for people in the world as it is\none of a kind movie. So just relax enjoy your sit and your popcorn and\nenjoy watching the movie.\n"
"\nI LOVE the first movie. My favourite animated film, outside of Disney,\nof all time and I was worried that this might not hold up to the\noriginal.<br><br>I was wrong.<br><br>I'm still in two minds if it is better than the original though.<br><br>One thing that astounds me is the detail. The effects are absolutely\nmind-blowing and very thorough. There are some shots of Toothless where\nyou can see the detail in his scales, including sometimes dirt and\nscars.<br><br>The original voice cast is back and still awesome, the story is\namazing, the effects are jaw dropping and the score fits with the film\nperfectly.<br><br>This movie has everything in just over 100 minutes; action, adventure,\nlaughs, tears for every one of all ages.<br><br>I just have one complaint<br><br> I DON'T WANNA WAIT JUST OVER THREE YEARS FOR THE NEXT FILM!!!\n"
"\nI liked the first movie enough to re-watch it, but the sequel is too\nlong, too simplistic, and is yet another Hollywood epic that preaches\npacifism and negotiation only to create a final solution out of\nviolence. <br><br>The politically correct messages are overbearing, the catering to every\nconceivable demographic obvious, and the characterizations disturbingly\none-note. The whiny mannerisms of the hero really began to bug me only\na short way into the movie. And they kill off an important character\nwho happened to be my favorite. Does anyone else find it odd that the\nother characters seem blissfully happy only a few minutes later?<br><br>How this movie has garnered a rating over 8 is beyond me. It's\ncontrived and a real disappointment in my book.\n"
"\nThe reason I put 3 stars at first place it is because it had nice\ngraphics. Other than that the movie was terrible. Spoiler alert!!\nHiccup's mother left them and never came back because she was looking\nafter dragons?? Stupid His father and mother find each other after so\nmany years and they want to start over (WHY? she abandoned them) anw\nand then he dies?? He dies because of toothless who was under mind\ncontrol? Sad The good alpha dragon just died?? Toothless and Hiccups\nremain best friends even after toothless killed Hiccups' dad? All these\ndo not make sense The movie had no plot It was terrible Plus the person\nwho makes Hiccups' voice has a deeply annoying voice. It is not a\ncartoon movie for kids. It is very dark. And the first one was dark but\nthis one is worse. I think it should be a pg13 movie. The feeling after\nwatching the film was sadness and disappointment. I like cartoons, I\nliked the first one too. But this it was a big failure\n"
"\nI really loved the first movie, but i never though the second part\nwould be even better. Since the movie started i knew i would love it;\nit's really one of the best animated movies i've ever seen.<br><br>One of the most stunning things of the movie (and it's equal in the\nfirst one) is the animation. All the characters, dragons and lands are\nhighly detailed, the movements are perfect and all of it is brightly\ndesigned. Besides that, the history of this one is very touching and\nyou will feel it throughout the entire film.<br><br>Concluding, you will enjoy it if you are a child or you are 50. If you\nenjoyed the first part, you can't miss this one!\n"
"\nI love this movie but each time I see HTYD2 it cuts me deep and I keep\nwondering what has happened to animation industry? These movies are\nsupposed to be for kids! Why more and more directors feel obliged to\nadd cruel reality to cartoons? Having a family reuniting after 20 years\nto see them torn apart again by killing one of our favorite characters\nis really disturbing and it feels so unfair!Cartoons are supposed to\ngive us hope... Half of this movie was for us to feel happy for Hiccup\nand Stoick having found his mother and wife..They tested our empathy\nand compassion just to be devastated when Stoick dies just minutes\nafter dancing with his long-lost love!I mean come on you have to be\nheartless not to feel sick by that! I mean did the directors hoped for\na cinema full of children crying? Anyway, prepare yourselves to share\nsome tears..\n"
"\nI just can say damn you Dean DeBlois for killing \"Stoick\" or should I\neven say that??! How could you kill him??! They JUST MET. Everybody\ncare about Hiccup and Astrid, Yes I did care about them in the first\nmovie but not this one.The \"Love Part\" in this movie belongs to Stoick\nand Valka. It was so beautiful how they pair up and dance I loved\nHiccup's look,It's full of happiness to see his parents together. They\njust found each other after 20 years they both deserve more than that\none hour. As Stoick died I just couldn't enjoy the movie anymore, I\njust watched. It was not fair to Valka Stoick and Hiccup. Damn You Dean\nDeBlois damn you. I HOPE you pay for this.\n"
"\nAs a huge fan of the first movie I didn't believe the second could be\nbetter, I've never been so happy to be wrong! This movie was\nbreathtaking, heart-wrenching, astounding, beautiful, and funny!\nWithout doubt the best movie I have ever seen. <br><br>I convinced my mother to come see it with me, she was skeptical but\nhumored me and she was just as blown away as I was. We had to go back\nto the theater to see it again. <br><br>One of my favorite things about the first one was the music and I was\nthrilled that John Powell managed to top the original score. Like the\nmovie itself, the music is more mature and absolutely sweeps you away.\nI listen to the soundtrack every day and I still marvel at its power\nand the emotion it evokes. <br><br>Don't be put off because it's(beautifully)animated, you won't find a\nbetter movie! <br><br>Now we just have to endure the long wait till the final movie. How can\nthey top this? I don't know, but I have faith that they will!\n"
"\nI can sympathize with all the great reviews, I love the dragons, I love\nHiccup and I share his love for the bad-ass Astrid. And there is plenty\nof great breathtaking scenes in this new movie.<br><br>Yet the scenario is really lacking in almost every dimension. It is\ncompletely unclear why the villain (who, by the way, lacks any depth\nbeyond I'm-angry-because-the-dragons-burned-my-village) is able to\ncontrol such a huge dragon as the alpha. The introduction of the alpha\nas a race, after seeing the dragon villain in the first movie, is also\nvery debatable. The telepathic control that the human villain gains\nalmost for himself is such a stretch that it's bordering inconsistency.\nThe list could go on and on and on.\n"
"\nImmensely disappointing. First animated movie I've been to that I felt\nhad bad acting! I loved the first film, but this one was wooden beyond\nbelief with what seemed like a thrown together story line. <br><br>Hiccups so called dragon loving mum almost drowns his dragon within\nmoments of meeting him? She disappears for 20 years and doesn't think\nto mention to anyone she's OK? She starts off as this uber dragon queen\nperson and then as the story goes dissolves into a bit of a nobody -\nexcept Hiccups mum. What happened to the use of her weird dragon blade\nweapon? Why was her Alpha so lame?<br><br>Hiccup ends up as chief even though clearly he has no interest in that\nkind of thing?<br><br>Why did the Alpha follow this nasty guy Drago?<br><br>The whole intelligence level of this movie just seemed quite a few\nnotches down on the first one.\n"
"\nContinued great How to Train Your Dragon , How to Train Your Dragon 2\ntries to be higher than its predecessor, and almost can , but I still\nprefer the first , but it's still a very good animation, the characters\nare older, we are introduced to new characters, the film is a bit sad\nand dramatic than the previous, some legal others uninteresting , the\nNight Fury is more docile, cute and funny in this movie , the\nsoundtrack remains excellent , the voice work is at the same level of\nthe first , great , the plot is good, and the battles are good yet, How\nto Train Your Dragon 2 is a bit lower than the first , more is very\nfunny and has some sad moments . note 8.3\n"
"\nThis is the first movie I've felt the need to review in a long,long\ntime. I had high expectations from this movie, based on the\npreviews-and my love for the first one. And I was not let down. I've\nlost count on how many times I've watched the first movie. This movie\nwas way more emotional than that one. They went places that are pretty\ndark to go to for a cartoon. And it made me cry more than any other\nfilm this year. Even more than The Fault In Our Stars. And can I just\nmention the character development? Hiccup's journey from the young,\nrather careless boy in the first movie to a young man-a young leader-\nin the second one is INCREDIBLE to watch. And the father has a lot of\ndevelopment, also. And so does Astrid, but it's mostly Hiccup. And even\nToothless gets his moment to shine, in one of the coolest scenes in the\nmovie. I don't want to give anything away, so I won't say much more\nabout it.<br><br>Just, be prepared to bring tissues. And be prepared to be amazed.\nReally amazed. <br><br>This is an instant family classic.\n"
"\nHiccup tries to stop a war with a bad guy named Drago who wants to\ncontrol all dragons. Hiccup also finds out his mom isn't dead, she's\njust terrible. The first half is light and enjoyable. Second half\ndescends into darkness with the senseless killing of Stoick. What,\nbecause Hiccup's deadbeat mom is back it's okay to kill off his dad?\nHow depressing! For me, the movie never recovers from this huge downer.\nThe animation is pretty and even better than the first movie. The\nreturning characters are all likable, although Hiccup grates on my\nnerves at times. But I felt that way about him in the first one, as\nwell. I didn't care for the mom at all. Less said about that the\nbetter. Also the whole preachy peace message is undermined by all the\nviolence and the fact that peace is only achieved at the end by having\nsuperior firepower. Mixed messages much? If you liked How to Train Your\nDragon you'll probably like this. But be ready for it to have some\nflaws that might bother some more than others.\n"
"\nGreetings from Lithuania.<br><br>\"How to Train Your Dragon 2\" (2014) is a colorful, big, amazing looking\nfollow up to the one of the best animated movies in a long time. It's\nvisually amazing, and although it doesn't feature anything\ngroundbreaking in visual department, it looks fabulous. The story here\nis probably were this movie felt a bit for me. It's good, but not\nengaging as the first one was. \"How to Train Your Dragon 2\" expands the\nuniverse of the first picture and gives some new characters, but only\none of them was interesting - voiced wonderfully by Cate Blanchett. <br><br>Overall, \"How to Train Your Dragon 2\" is a true big screen experience\nfor almost all ages. It's looks and sound wonderfully, and although the\nstory isn't anything new or special, it's definitely worth seeing.\nThere were moments were i felt this movie dragged a bit in the middle\nsection, but it has one interesting turn of events near the end of the\nmovie that i didn't see coming.\n"
"\nNicely entertaining.<br><br>Very colorful and action-oriented. I especially liked the background\ndesign and the music. The appearance of a certain character in the\nclouds was breathtaking. And the scale of the behemoth fight, wow! It\ndid take me a while to get past Jay \"I always look like I have a\nmigraine\" Baruchel's voice for the main character. It's one of my\nproblems with having celebrities do voices for animated characters.\nMany times it is hard to separate the human providing the voice from\nthe character on the screen. Producers could save a bundle by just\nhiring decent voice actors -- kids wouldn't care who is providing the\nvoice, and I can't imagine that adults are going to an animated movie\nbecause a celebrity is doing the voice.<br><br>I have to wonder if they used Tommy Wiseau (The Room) as an inspiration\nfor the design of the bad guy. And the dragon still looks like Stitch.\n"
"\nFast-paced, action packed and a fun ride over all! I loved How to Train\nyour Dragon 2! It's a very interesting take on the original story, and\nwas surprisingly quite good as a sequel. Since the 5 years that have\npassed in the story since the last movie, Hiccup has matured into a\nyoung man (most likely in his early 20's?) He is going on adventures\nwith Toothless trying to discover the world, and in his own way, trying\nto find himself. This is something that many people of all ages can\nrelate to - and especially me since I'm also in my 20's. <br><br>The movie is a joy-ride through spectacular animation, an adventurous\nbut not overbearing plot, and of course our favourite beautiful\ndragons!\n"
"\nThis movie is set five years after the events from the first one. This\nmovie is possibly the best animated movie of 2014 and one of my\nfavorites of all time. The film has fantastic voice acting. The VFX is\nSTUNNING. The storyline is gripping, trilling and exciting. There's a\nbig TWIST in the movie that I did not expect at all. This movie is a\nMUST SEE for kids, teens, adults and the elderly.<br><br>REPEAT - This movie is set five years after the events from the first\none.

"\nI have been a fan of the How to Train Your Dragon franchise since the\nfirst movie, and when I saw this movie for the first time... it was\nnothing I had ever seen before! Every component of the first movie was\nexpanded and branched out upon. Their world has gotten bigger in every\nway possible. The colors, the characters, the conflict, the dragons...\neven the score has been expanded and improved to bring about a whole\nother dimension of their world! How to Train Your Dragon 2 is truly an\nanimated juggernaut, and is something that nobody else will be able to\nupstage. It is possibly the most unique storyline of any animated film\nout there, and is a movie that the entire family can enjoy, from ages 8\nto 98. Here's to you, Hiccup and Toothless!\n"
"\nHow often do we see a sequel that is better than the original? Almost\nnever right? Well, your wrong. HTTYD 2 far surprises the original. <br><br>While I thought the first part was interesting and invigorating the\nsecond killed it. It was dark, dense and yet brought warmth to.your\nheart. Plus the highlight for me was the fact that it was close to\nimpossible to predict. Right from the appearance of the dragon thief to\nwhom it was to what happens to Hiccup's father, everything was just\nwhen it shouldn't be (if you get my drift). <br><br>The only negative was perhaps the fact that the ending was a little too\nsimilar to the first part. <br><br>However, I can't wait for part 3. It will be really hard to top the\nwork done in 2010 and 2014.\n"
"\nThis movie is just as good as the first one, it's so good. I loved it.\nI loved seeing Toothless and Hiccup again and I cried when Hiccup gets\nmad at Toothless for things he couldn't help doing. <br><br>In this movie, Hiccup and Toothless discover an ice cave that is home\nto hundreds of wild dragons and the home to mysterious Dragon Ride, who\nturns out to be Hiccup's long-lost Mother. But when an evil steals\ndragons and his dragon can control every dragon, things get tough.\nToothless is even controlled to kill Hiccup's father, which is very\nsad. But as you hope, everything works out in the end.<br><br>Overall, I give this movie a 10 out of 10, which in my ratings book is:\nFreaking Ridonkulous.\n"
"\nHow To Train Your Dragon 2, which is directed by Dean DeBlois, is the\nstory of Hiccup, now at the age of 20, and the growing bond between him\nand his dragon Toothless. I think this is a great film for many\nreasons. First, this is probably the best cinematography I've seen in\nan animated film. The action is great, and aesthetically speaking, this\nmovie would definitely get a 10/10. This movie really illustrates the\ngrowing bond developing between Toothless and Hiccup, and how they\ncan't take each other for granted. This movie also portrays Hiccup's\nmaturity, as opposed to 5 years ago. Hiccup is starting to realize that\nhe can't be the chief his father wanted him to be, and that he'll never\nreplace someone so selfless, caring, and brave. This movie really has a\nlot of heart. It delves into themes like responsibility, dealing with\nloss, loyalty, and peace. How To Train Your Dragon 2 builds upon its\npredecessor, and exceeds it by encompassing the virtues of a true\nchief. How To Train Your Dragon 2 is definitely worth 5 watches, and\nI'd highly recommend checking it out.\n"
"\nAbout: 1) The 3D too was very good. 2) It has some great action\nsequences. 3) I love the main cast. 4) Finally the great battle with an\nequally terrific Villain. 5) The art and background of the story was\npretty spectacular. 6) The second film, after the critical success of\nthe first, is what you would expect - bigger, louder, faster and with\nexcellent attention to detail. 7) Great adventure action with a bit of\nmild rude humor. 8) Filled with great, sly humor and breathtaking\nvisuals. 9) Thenand one of my absolute favorite aspects of the filmwe\nhave the amazingly beautiful score by John Powell that honestly sends\nme back to the days of classical, elegant Disney tales. I read review\nin https://toprater.com/en/movies/objects/2367941-\nhow-to-train-your-dragon-2-2014/criteria/3d-effects\n"
"\nWell, I looked at my review of the previous How to Train Your Dragon in\nwhich I gave it nine stars. I haven't seen it since then but reading it\ndid bring some good memories of watching it. This sequel was also quite\nenjoyable though part of me admits that I didn't find myself laughing\nheartily until the near-climax involving some of those sheep. But there\nwas quite a lot to be inspired by like the finding of a character\nthought to be dead or someone who may end up as such. I saw this on\nIMAX 3-D with my movie theatre-working friend and his nephew and we all\nenjoyed this immensely. I mean, the characterizations were believable\nenough which brought great emotions when some of the more dramatic\nscenes were done. And, yes, the action was awesome as well. So on that\nnote, I highly recommend How to Train Your Dragon 2.\n"
"\nI just saw this movie, and WOW! I was so amazed! The animation was\nbeautiful, the story line was excellent, and it was the best sequel\never!<br><br>We all know how 'Frozen' is an amazing film and everyone keeps talking\nabout it, but I am starting to think 'How To Train Your Dragon 2' is\nactually better then 'Frozen'! And the animation was better then\n'Frozen'!<br><br>When I saw How To Train Your Dragon 2, I loved the characters,\nvillains, Dragons (of course!) And just EVERYTHING about this film! <br><br>So, I recommend this film for everyone, because it's probably the best\nanimated film out their, it's probably even better then the first 'How\nTo Train Your Dragon'!\n"
"\nA lot of stuff happens in this movie. I won't spoil it, but since 5\nyears has passed in the universe of HTTYD, the film is undeniably more\nmature.<br><br>I think the reason that there's a 5 year gap is to make room for the\ntelevision show that's currently in production. I guess it will fill\nthe gaps in between, which is fair enough.<br><br>Probably the most surprising thing about this movie is the director.\nThe original film was written and directed by 3 people (the guys who\nmade Lilo and Stitch, another great film), but only one of them stayed\nbehind to direct the sequel. I'll assume without evidence the other two\nmoved either to the TV series or to some other project. But since it's\nmore of a solo project than a threesome project, it's a lot less\nclichéd and a lot more focused on a single story.<br><br>Yes, there is a lot of things that don't make sense, and a lot of\nthings that could be changed, but lets ignore that for now and enjoy\nwhat is undeniably a spectacular film.\n"
"\nI had toddlers to grandmas watching this movie. I must say it connected\nwith all ages. This movie is by far the best sequel I've seen in a long\nlong time. I highly recommend this movie to all my friends and family\nto watch over and over again. The voice cast fit the characters very\nwell. The story was touching and fresh. The animation was exciting to\nwatch.<br><br>I went in there thinking it was going to be like the television version\nonly extended to to fit the theater. However, I was very surprised with\nthe twists and the way it really touches everyone in my family. the\ndifferent age groups. <br><br>Overall, an amazing movie you wont regret watching.\n"
"\nI saw this movie yesterday. Believe me it is really amazing! This is\none of the movies that let your mindset change that a sequel can be\nreally nice as mostly they don't live up to the mark! But this one\ndoes.. it really does keeping the dignity of it's previous part.\nDreamworks has proved that four years of wait was finally worth waiting\nfor. The grownups teens are more convincing than the previous ones!\nThey seem like they have grown so naturally. Special effort has been\ndone to Hiccup &amp; Astrid to make them look handsome &amp; beautiful\nrespectively. The movie is much more fun,darker,complicated than the\nprevious one! Soundtracks are really amazing. It's really a 'must\nwatch' flick!!!\n"
"\nLoved the first one. My favorite animated movie in the last 10 years -\nhigh anticipation for the sequel.<br><br>Went with my 3 kids on the opening day. 30 minutes into the movie and I\nsee my kids yawning and slouching in their seats. Two older ones\nwhisper to me, \"dad, this is really boring.\" There is no way around it\n- it is very boring until the last 10 minutes of the movie. <br><br>I do realize that this is an animated film, one that revolves around\nvikings riding a flying dragon. But you still have to have a strong\nplot, one that follows what happened in the original movie. There are\nmoments in the movie that make you think, \"Huh? Where was that in the\nfirst movie? Where did this (sub-plot) come from?\" A case in example:\nHiccup's mother is alive? And she never bothered to try to come back to\nher family for all those years? (And this is one of the more believable\nparts of the story.)<br><br>Weak storyline from beginning to end, not engaging at all, left the\ntheater very disappointed.\n"
"\nI hardly have any words to describe this piece of art.I fell in love\nfrom the very first time i have watched it.The story is very amazing\nand satisfying and the animation art is so beautiful.The characters are\nvery well chosen for this type of story.The film gives an introduction\nto the people and especially the young generation that the only beings\nthat do harm and evil to anyone, even to themselves were the people and\nteaches us to be more kind to others and to respect the surrounding\naround us world that for me was quite enlightening to today's harsh\nworld. Hardly recommend this to people who are dragon fans and not\nonly.All i can say is great job Dream Works. Once again you bring\nhappiness to the people around the world with your wonderful movies.My\npersonal score 10/10 ! Can't wait for the next movie ! &lt;3\n"
"\nWhen Hiccup and Toothless discover an ice cave that is home to hundreds\nof new wild dragons and the mysterious Dragon Rider, the two friends\nfind themselves at the center of a battle to protect the peace. Darker\nand more mature than the previous film but also more heavily action\npacked and with some really beautiful places and new characters coming\nin How to Train your Dragon 2 is for me at least better than the first\none and it also has something that i didn't expect to happen a sudden\ndeath occurred and it was painful to watch it it puts a friendship on\nthe line but also the fate of dragons and it just made the movie even\nbetter not only as a sequel but also as a film on it's own.\n"
"\nI had watched this MASTERPIECE last night in my phone and what can I\nsay about it?!!! It was such as awesome as the first one was!!!<br><br>The graphics and VFX are now too much strong as compared to the first\none and the story emotions are also well added in this movie.<br><br>The film has followed the story of the first one but has a little minus\npoint a spoiler:- Hiccup's dad is dead and this is the one point I\ndidn't liked in the movie otherwise it was good.<br><br>Overall the film was entertaining and a must watch in the theatres as\nit has a very good visual and VFX and also a better in story emotions\nand all.\n"
"\nHow to Train Your Dragon 2 is now one of my favourite\nmovie.Storytelling, voice cast and animation is top class.<br><br>The plot sure does heightened into an epic installment.The film also\nspends its time exploring more places around and beyond the Isle of\nBerk.This is a rich universe that makes the whole journey even bigger.<br><br>This evil character really seems to have stepped out of the Disney\nPirates of the Caribbean franchise.Cate Blanchett and Kit Harington\njoined the cast for the second film as Hiccup's long lost mother Valka\nand the lovable rogue Eret.<br><br>Possibly one the the best animated movies i have ever watched.A must\nwatch Movie.\n"
"\nThis movie is amazing. Sad that all the Lego fans are being rude abut\nthis movie! But this movie will make you very emotional. I watched it 3\ntimes and it made me cry every time. and for the characters, they\nactually make them develop, unlike a lot of movies. The animation is\ngorgeous, and I will say its the best animation I've ever seen. They\nmade everything so detailed. You can see the scars and freckles on\neveryone's faces. And they didn't make the characters perfect\nlooking.They made them have flaws. Like valka with her wrinkles and her\ngrey hair, same with stoick. The villain was a little cliché, but it\nmakes up for it at the end! scene are AMAZING.If you haven't seen this\nmovie yet. GO SEE IT.\n"
"\nAlthough Stoick is not handsome to me, I was moved by what he said to\nValka in the reunion scene.<br><br>There's nothing could be more nervous when facing a reunion after 20\nyears. Especially Valka, she abandoned her family to protect dragons.\nWe can see her fear by her endless explanation when she saw Stock. She\nexpected Stoick's anger maybe that's what she felt guilty for 20 years. <br><br>However what Stoick said was not blame, the words are \"You are as\nbeautiful as the day I lost you\" which contained all the missing. For\nhim, she must be the most beautiful woman in the world, in his heart.<br><br>We can always blame someones, but we can also be generous to them.<br><br>After so many years, what i remembered is just how kind, beautiful you\nare, I will never blame you because I love you.\n"
"\nLiked this animated feature film very much. It had all features of a\nnormal or non-animated movie. It had action, drama, emotion and best of\nall had a very good ending. <br><br>The deaths in animation are rarity and given not much importance and\nusually of a villainous character. But in this movie not one but two\ndeaths have given importance and has very good impact on the ending of\nthe story.<br><br>Initially I had disregard about watching the movie as I was of opinion\nthat the prequel was perfectly done and story had perfectly ended in it\nand this sequel was just commercials. But after watching it my opinion\nwas changed.\n"
"\nThis is one of the very few times that I don't agree with Jeremy Jahns.\nHe was crazy about this, but I did not get blown away at all.<br><br>I really liked the first HTTYD, I had some gripes with it, I thought it\nwas different than it actually was, and thus was very pleasantly\nsurprised when I found out I was wrong, and that I liked it. But there\nis just something missing from the sequel. Actually, I don't really\nremember that much, it is very forgettable.<br><br>I can't really say what I didn't like, there was just something\nmissing. It didn't pull me in, and I was almost kind of bored at times.\nIt is not a bad movie, but it is really not a great one either. It is\nmediocre, and that is a movie sin!<br><br>Of course the animation is spotless, and the action is alright, the\ndragon is cute, and so on and on, but there is something missing.\n"
"\nThis movie is a great movie, and a worthy sequel. This movie is better\nthan the first movie. I loved the use of a coming of age story and\nliked how Hiccup came to except his role as the new Chief of Berk. I\nalso liked the way Hiccup and Astrid's relationship was portrayed in\nthis movie. Hiccup and Astrid having been in a relationship for a long\ntime at the time the second movie took place really acted a way couple\nshould act around each other. My favorite moment between Hiccup and\nAstrid is when Hiccup pulls Astrid in for a kiss near the end of the\nmovie. What was also great to see was how Hiccup helped Astrid win the\ngame at the end when he grabbed the black sheep and threw it into\nAstrid's basket. One other great thing about the movie was the music\nand how it was as good as the first and again specific themes were used\nto represent certain things. I loved how John Powell worked in music\nfrom the first one into the second one. <br><br>Overall a great movie and worth watching again and again.<br><br>My grade for the movie is an A+.\n"
"\nWell i was wondering which movie should i look in order to relax and\nenjoy my spare time which i got after like months, then i looked over\nthe movies that i had and ended up with \"HOW TO TRAIN YOUR DRAGON 2\", i\nhave seen its first part and thought to look over the sequel in order\nto know what part 2 has for me and i find the movie really gripping due\nto its plot and characterization.<br><br>I was completely taken by this animated movie , for so long i waited\nfor a good animated movie to come and after watching this i really can\nsay that the plot was too good.<br><br>The friendship,loyalty and trust of hiccup and toothless was worth\nappreciating and there are some twists and turns in the movie for which\nyou have to see the movie.<br><br>The best part which i liked was its ending , all in all the movie is\nworth watching and you will not regret after watching it..\n"
"\nThe movie is far the best from the sequel of \"How to train your\ndragon\". It shows excellent emotions with amazing animated graphics,\nmixed cartoon with realism. It has unexpected moments, it has funny,\nromantic, sad and EPIC moments. You will never regret from watching\nthis movie,it really sticks to your heart. I'm 21 and watched these\nmovies since Toy Story, DreamWorks makes an amazing job to please not\njust the kids,but also adults. The main characters become even greater\nand it will make you wish they existed in your life. I recommend this\nmovie for everybody of any age who enjoys animated movies. But be sure\nto watch the 1st movie! Because this one is even better.\n"
"\nAn incredible second installment to a mature teenage franchise.\nDreamWorks is daring in the way it challenges its characters, and it\npulls no punches for drama or stakes. Action and scope are increased in\nthis one, but more importantly, a significant emphasis on Hiccup's\njourney to find his identity and face up to responsibility. His belief\nthat all people can change for the better is challenged, and a high\nprice is paid in testing that conviction. The major relationships in\nHiccup's life, his dragon and parents and girlfriend, are developed\nfrom the first movie with depth and maturity, with characters bouncing\noff one another vividly. Emotions run high -- the thrill of flying\nsequences, the humor of sarcastic comedic relief, and the gut-wrenching\nsadness of climactic narrative sequences.\n"
"\nSomething for Disney to learn here. This sequel is amazing. And true\nworld-building. Not just a question of earning extra money.<br><br>Dreamworks don't have the animation stars like Disney. But they are\nslowly building up a great collection. If Disney don't watch out...they\nare going to be overtaken by Dreamworks. To be honest..I don't\nunderstand why Disney is making such bad sequels. All they have to to\nis make a new storyline and some hard work making animation and they\nhave a new movie. No need thinking up new characters or worlds.<br><br>Strategy is simple...world-building and great sequels. After Shrek, it\ndidn't comes as a big surprise with Dragon 2. But what didn't surprise\nme was the depth of the world and all the different dragons. To be\nhonest cant wait for the next sequel.\n"
"\nFrom a Full on Cynic, that would give the new X-men movie a Zero if I\ncould, and a 4/10 to the conclusion to the batman trilogy, the Dark\nKnight, I will say this is a must watch for both adults and children\nalike. It had a lot of Adult story lines to it and was thoroughly\nentertaining for adults and children will be able to understand the\npassionate storyline as well as the heartwarming story.<br><br>It had heart jerking moments, action, and a rather unpredictable\nstoryline, which makes for one amazing movie. Please watch this !! Side\nnote: the 3D was one the best in recent history. Put this on the list\nof movies to watch in 3D. I will probably never watch a unanimated\nflick in gimmicky 3D anymore.<br><br>Please Watch this ! 10/10\n"
"\nI never thought that after the success of part I, How to train your\ndragon 2 would live up to its predecessor. I've never been happier to\nbe completely and so utterly wrong about anything.<br><br>The movie picks up 5 years from the last one. Our protagonist and his\nfriends are in their late teens now. The original characters have the\nsame quintessential essence but the new characters introduced are\nequally interesting and awesome.<br><br>The story, oh the story ! Dreamworks, thou art mine favorite animation\nstudio. The story escalated gradually into an epic appreciated by\neveryone who saw it. It will bring out every emotion one possesses into\nlight and will tear out your heart from your chest. Of course if that\ndoesn't melt you, John Powell's symphony &amp; music will. There is\nsomething for everyone, including teenage girls as hiccup looks a\nlittle dreamy. The story also expands on various fronts.<br><br>A well deserved end to such a great movie.\n"
"\nWhat movie can have an adult and kids laugh, cry and bring out all\nthose emotions. Beautiful movie. Love love how they develop Tothless\nand Hiccup relationship of friendship. My favorite was that last scene\nwith them and the blindfold. Not spoiling Just mentioning for those who\nhave already seen the movie :) My nieces said it was better than Frozen\nand they love Frozen, I love it more than the first How to Train Your\nDragon and I thought no other movie could top that. Beautiful Movie,\nbetter than Frozen. In fact I am going to see it again and I never go\nto the movies to see a movie twice in a Theater. LOVE IT. Please bring\nanother How To Train Your Dragon 3......... Please go watch it and the\n3D is awesome!!!!!!!\n"
"\nWow I had to write a review for this movie...What a delight.As I\nentered into the theater with high hopes, I expected it to be very\ngood, turns out be even better. Seriously this movie shows how\ndreamworks animation is knocking on the door to be the best animation\nstudio in the world.The visuals are highly detailed and\nextraordinary..Dragons are dark but more colorful than Godzilla.I am an\nanimation fan but even if you are not you should not miss this one.It\nis going to be the biggest animation hit of this year.I even thought\nthis was better than frozen because it was surprising how the climax\nturned out to be<br><br>It has action,laughs and emotional moments that makes you hold on to\nyour seat till the end. If you want family time or even alone time,\nthis is the movie you should catch because this is better than the best\nanimation in recent years.\n"
"\nAfter the huge success of How To Train your Dragon its sequel was much\nawaited but in my view the sequel was not up to the level and\nperfection of the first part. No doubt the cinematography and graphics\neffect was up-to the modern era's perfection but story was bit weak and\nwas not as powerful and catchy as it was supposed to be. The dragon\n\"Toothless\" along with his rider \"Hiccup\" are again main leads of the\nmovie which pretty much is same thing for viewers and the ancient charm\nand terror of dragons are seemed to be carried away from the movies\nwhich i think is giving a new perception towards the dragons. this may\neffect the original and ancient terrorizing and horrific image of\ndragons and a new conceptual idea of dragon being a pet makes place in\nthe viewers mind. The twists and turns of the movie are pretty expected\nand the end of the movie can be guessed at the mid of it. with its\nperfect animation and beautiful cinematography and catchy creatures in\nit and bearable language, this movie is watchable for children of all\nage groups.\n"
"\nWatched How To Train Your Dragon Yesterday and think might have found\nmy favorite Animation film of the year already. I never watched the\nfirst one so I don't really have an idea what the story's about but I\nwas really glued to my seat throughout the entire film<br><br>The movie was really good and I enjoyed it verymuch. I think that this\nDreamworks best animation feature yet when compared to their Madagascar\nand Despicable Me. The main character Hiccup was a really cool\ncharacter and I loved watching him in action and flying off his dragon\nToothless. The other characters were fun to watch as well and I really\ncouldn't believe <br><br>The story was really interesting to watch and I really like movies that\ntouches on the mother and son relationship. I will not go spoiling into\nthe movie but I really recommend you guys to check it out. You will not\nbe disappointed\n"
"\nThankfully, DreamWorks hasn't settled primarily on mediocre fare like\nMR. SHERMAN AND PEABODY, and they can still produce quality family\nentertainment. HOW TO TRAIN YOUR DRAGON 2 it's exhibit A. It doesn't\nquite measure up to the heart and soul of the first movie, even when\ndealing with unification and loss. But it's got plenty of the good\nstuff: action, adventure, family, fierce loyalty, heroism. I was hoping\nfor more of the sweet flaming sword, but that's not a gripe. And those\nflying scenes have more *whoosh!* than ever. And let's face it: Hiccup\nand Toothless are an awesome pair, and they are the backbone of the\nseries. No matter how big the spectacle gets or how many dragons they\nwant to throw up on the screen, as long as the series features those\ntwo characters, I'm in.<br><br>7/10\n"
"\nThis heart touching film was delightful from the beginning to the end.\nFirst the resolution from the previous movie, allowing the dragons stay\non the island with Hiccup was a nice touch. Seeing Hiccup and Toothless\nwith all of the other dragons playing was a good way to start the film.\nThen the unexpected surprise that Hiccup's mom was still alive was a\ntwist no body could have seen coming. Her love for dragons was just as\ngreat as the reunion of Hiccup'c father and mother. Then the tear-\njerking death of Hiccup's father, who died protecting their family was\na good ending even though it was hard to overcome.I hope this family\nfriendly film has a third movie coming along.\n"
"\nThe first 'How to Train Your Dragon' was really the first time that a\nDreamWorks animated film stepped up to Pixar's legendary level. Filled\nwith humor, heart and a surprisingly mature tone at times, it seemed to\nsignal that DeramWorks was finally ready to abandon the focus-group\nbanality of the 'Shrek' films and compete with the big boys. Sadly that\nstill hasn't happened, but at least they have the 'How to Train Your\nDragon' series.<br><br>The sequel isn't quite as funny as the original--and intentionally so I\nbelieve--and its lacks the thrill of discovery that naturally comes\nwith a coming-of-age tale like 'HTTYD', but what it lacks in laughs it\nmakes up for with thrilling action action and some genuine pathos.<br><br>Though the second act drags a little and it tries to keep a few too\nmany dramatic balls in the air at times, 'How to Train Your Dragon 2'\nis that rare worthy sequel.\n"
"\nHow to Train Your Dragon 2 builds upon the successes of the last film\nand turns out a visual and aural feast. The music by John Powell and\nthe songs by Jonsi amount to the best soundtrack of the year so far.\nVisual wise, there are some really impressive scenes with giant\n\"overlord dragons\" as well massive dragon battles and beautiful new\narctic scenery. Like the first film, HtTYD2 has that rare gift that the\nbest animated films have of appealing to all ages. The voice acting is\ngreat again with the addition of the always incredible Cate Blanchett,\nwho adds a nice touch to the film. However, I wouldn't say the story\nand writing were quite as good as the first.\n"
"\nI was not sure how I was going to feel about the first installment of\nthis series. It seemed like maybe it was going to be a bit thin of a\npremise, and/or predictable. <br><br>However, upon seeing How to Train Your Dragon 1, I completely changed\nmy tune. The movie was well structured, well animated, well voiced, and\njust completely charming and wonderful!<br><br>So, being the skeptic that I am, I naturally imagined a sequel would be\nrotten. I mean how often can they follow up a good 1 with an even\ndecent 2? Thankfully again, I was completely wrong. This one lives up\nto the first, and even possibly surpasses it in some places. I was\nentertained the whole way through, and would go to it again in the\ntheater if given the chance.\n"
"\nHow to Train Your Dragon 2 is the sequel to the original film, How to\nTrain Your Dragon.<br><br>The Good: 1. The movie has wonderful animation, with intricate\nsceneries and looks like something I want to explore. 2. Lovable\ncharacters including Hiccup, Astrid, Stoick, Gobber, Fishlegs,\nSnoutlout and the twins Tuffnut and Ruffnut. Welcome additions to this\ncharacter roster include Valka, Drago and Eret. 3. Excellent voice\nacting consisting of Jay Beruchel, Gerard Butler, Craig Ferguson,\nAmerica Ferrera, Christopher Mintz-Plasse, Jonah Hill, T.J. Miller and\nKristen Wiig. Three stars making their voice acting debut include Cate\nBlanchett, Djimon Hounsou and Kit Harrington, and they all do a\nwonderful job with their performances. 4. An enthralling story. 5. A\ngreat score by John Powell.<br><br>The Bad: Nothing<br><br>If you are a fan of How to Train Your Dragon, the original film, I\nhighly recommend that you watch this film.\n"
"\nWhen I watched the first How to Train Your Dragon, it was a pleasant\nsurprise that blew me away. The expectations were high this time\naround, and the movie did not disappoint. The animation is top notch,\nwith scenes that transport you to flying amongst the clouds. The\nexcellent soundtrack is also back, with \"Where No One Goes\" by Jonsi\nbeing a standout track. Fortunately it is used many times in the film.\nThere are some emotional punches that I won't spoil. Also, I like how\nthe film further uses characters that have been maimed. Something that\nyou was a surprise Hiccup's peg leg in the first movie, and continues\nin this one. I definitely will be looking to the next part of this\nfranchise that appeals to all age ranges.\n"
"\n\"How to Train your Dragon\" was a surprise hit for me, the kind of movie\nthat apparently comes out of nowhere yet manages to keep you interested\nand invested throughout. Even despite it's rather silly title. It was\nemotional, well paced, well animated and had a ton of character\ndevelopment to boot. Plus, the voice acting was excellent.<br><br>With that being said, i think it's sequel delivers on everything the\nfirst one did and at the same time manages to surpass it on every\nlevel. The characters get more developed, the CGI is improved, the\naction is more present throughout. Literally, every single criticism i\nmight have had from the first film is now gone in the second one.<br><br>Do see this movie, it's one of the better animated pictures to come out\nin quite some time and it is as enjoyable for grown ups as it is for\nkids.\n"
"\nWithout degrading the first movie, I will say that I love this one\nbetter! It has SURPRISES here and there and coolness and other WOW-\ners! Some scenes brought me to tears, some brought a big cheek to cheek\nsmile, some to grimace... so it's like a complete, fast and hysterical\ndance, yet you don't get exhausted, instead you want more!<br><br>It's just lovely, it's just so wonderful! <br><br>I love how well put this movie is, the conflict is so relateable with\nour real life and the characters are strikingly able to leave an awful\nlot of impressions. I can say each one of them because... well, how\nrare that we can like almost all the characters in the movie? But, it\ndoes... in this one. I love the main character (which is also rare in\nmy case) but the supporting characters are ALL exciting too, I even\nwish there're more scenes for them. It feels as if everyone is the main\ncharacter!<br><br>So, if you haven't watched this movie. Bring your friends, lovers,\nfamily, neighbors, pets! And do it a.s.a.p, you'll fly~\n"
"\nI am so much agree with the other reviewers.. from the beginning to the\nvery end the movie takes you to an incredible journey in a \"viking way\"\nwith lots of adorable, brave and amazing dragons. The most beautiful\nabout this movie is its content, I wonder what emotion is left to\nreflect here. Every emotion that makes a human who he is reflects here\nand drawn so beautifully, elegantly. Words are less to narrate the\nstunning movie\ncreation.love,friendship,joy,laughter,sorrow,fear,bravery and vice\nversa.Last but not the list it has a hidden message unlike other\nanimated movies it tries to tell something.. I love,love and love this\nmovie . I think it takes animated movies to an another level,do\nwatch,have fun and fasten your seat belts for an amazing adventure with\ndragons..!!!!\n"
"\nI went to go see this with my friend from my film class, and we both\nwere fans of the first one and we went in thinking it couldn't be\nbetter then the first one... but we were totally wrong. This movie is\nso amazingly made with a darker story, but it still has humor like the\nfirst one. The music fits the movie perfect, it really doesn't even\nmake me feel like i am watching an animated movie. Some of the scenes\nwere so real looking it blew me away. Jonsi who does the theme song for\nthe movie did a amazing job at making a song that fits the movie so\nwell. My friend and I were kinda surprised that it was a PG movie\nbecause it has a much darker story and very surprising deaths. It could\nhave been PG-13. Little kids that were in the theater had to leave\nbecause there are some scary scenes. But I am looking forward to the\nnext movie in the series. I highly recommend this movie to any that\nloves movies that let you escape the real world. If you haven't seen\nthe first movie yet i suggest that you watch it and then watch the\nsequel. This is a 10 out of 10 movie for me.\n"
"\nEpic sequel! Epic movie! This is one of those sequels that by far\nexceeds the original film. How to train your dragon 2 is spectacular.<br><br>What I like most about the movie is the animation. The character\ndesigns are great. I especially like Hiccup whose new look help to show\nhow much he has matured since the last picture. The backgrounds and\nlayouts were very lively showing the full scale of the whole thing.\nThis was great for the flying parts. Some of the new dragons in the\nmovie were really cool to look at. My Favorite was the Alpha male\nDragon, one of the best giant monsters I've seen on the big screen.<br><br>The animation only complements the strong story. It feels like the\nFranchise has grown up with the audience since the last picture about 4\nor 5 years ago. Definitely something that the whole family can root\nfor.<br><br>This is a must see for IMAX 3D\n"
"\nHICCUP &amp; TOOTHLESS on a Roll-a-Costa Ride the 2nd time.<br><br>The best movie ever made Globally. With lots of twists and turns\nthroughout the movie I bet you will definitely enjoy every bit of it.<br><br>From the new addition of cute small Dragons to the Huge ones, this area\nis worth experience.<br><br>Instead of taking time to go through reviews posted here, utilize your\ntime and go for it.<br><br>This one doesn't need any recommendations since DRAGON time is back!!!\nVery colorful, emotional, hilarious and encouraging movie of recent\ntimes.<br><br>Thanks to Dean DeBlois to gift me this one..... Waiting for 17th Jun\n2016 :-)\n"
"\nFor a legendary creature lover like me, it's pretty easy to love How To\nTrain Your Dragon 2 (2014) because there are all sorts of cuddly,\nplayful dragons in this film. There are also plenty of distinctive\ncharacters, mostly adorable and hilarious in their own ways so the film\nis generally fun to watch! <br><br>The animation is stunning, the plot is admirable but sad to say that\nthere is not much authentic dragon actions (the dragons are being\ncontrolled most of the time) and it is not emotional enough. Perhaps\nthey did not intend to make people to get emotional and tear but I\nreally feel that deaths should, at least be given more elements or\nscreen time to it ... I don't enjoy the fact one of the dragons that I\nam fond of just die (quite easily too) and be gone forever. &lt;/3 <br><br>Nonetheless, it is a great 3D animated film and for a second I thought\nI started to develop acrophobia by watching this film! This film also\nmake me want a companion dragon, so bad :&lt;\n"
"\nhow to train your dragon 2 is a worthy to watch,,,the expectations you\nkept on it are surely carried through the entire film,,,this film is a\npack of every feeling...happiness,excitement,emotion,fun.though they\nare unexpected turns of emotion but it made to felt that feeling to the\nnext higher level. visuals &amp; flight sequences are pretty impressive,,,\neven director foretold about that they are going to use new lights-core\ntechnology,,, we can surely well observe that on screen,,,toothless\nfunny gestures worked very well. background score is very bold &amp; well\ntuned by Powell,,,this movie is really going to do magic at the\nbox-office,,,even may be definitely at Oscars too !!!!!\n"
"\nDreamworks has definitely outdone itself with this film. The best film\nI've seen in a long time. Yes, it beats X-men DOFP. <br><br>Where to begin?! I loved the first one, it was a sweet children's film\nfilled with adventure and love, had excellent humorous moments and a\nbrilliant story with brilliant morals. How to Train Your Dragon 2 has\nall that, but is much more mature for older audiences and much more\nintense in the adventure department for young ones. Equally as\nenjoyable for children but a new journey for older viewers. Filled with\nemotion and thrills it had me literally on the edge of my seat. <br><br>A definite must watch for anyone who liked the first one.\n"
"\nUsually, I have a bad opinion on sequels. I feel they are made just to\nmake money once again out the original.<br><br>HTTYD 2 is surprisingly good. Though it had some stereotype moments,\nthe emotions the \"people responsible\" chose to induct into the movie\ndeserve to be mentioned. The music is equally good. It is as good as it\nis in the first part.<br><br>This movie made me emotional towards the end.It has been too long since\nI felt that way. Thanks to all the people who are involved in this\nfilm.<br><br>You made my day.\n"
"\nI like the original. We went to the live action rendition, so I\ndefinitely like the original.<br><br>This sequel is far more complicated, and has several very well-tended\nstory lines going on. Humor, sadness, anger, love. All of these\nemotions are woven together quite well. I'm personally not a huge\nDreamworks fan - Pixar is my animation studio of choice, but honestly\nthey knocked this one our of the park. I thought that maybe the trailer\nwould have been the better part of the film - it only scratches the\nsurface. Saw this with my 7 year old, best father's day outing with the\nson so far!\n"
"\nHats off to the team of how to train your dragon . this second part is\nvery nice and super . first 15 Min's i was stunned by 3d effects . i\nwas felt i m riding the dragons . i never seen this much amazing 3d\neffects before hero dad passed away scene was heart melting scene .\neven at theater all people felt very sad including me the face\nexpressions of dragons is cute and loved by all people . each scenes\nall people applauded and laughing by seeing dragons activity . the\nanimation work awesome i felt like traveling in adventure and\nscreenplay good . i didn't find any boring scenes . the introduction of\nnew character \"hero mother\" is nice and touchable . the film traveled\nwith humor too . over all i loved the movie very much than part 1 and\nwaiting eagerly for third part .\n"
"\nBeautifully animated. Ingeniously crafted storyline. A little corny,\nbut if this isn't the movie of the summer, then I don't know what will\nbe. It had the spirit of Brave and the heart of Frozen, not the frozen\nheart, but you know what I mean. It really gave it a more lifelike feel\nand mood. Great job maintaining the charm of the characters we love.\nFinally, Toothless gets his moment to shine and Hiccup gets out of his\nawkward stage. They are definitely not kids anymore and their maturity\ncreates a great loop hole to get out of those gaps in the plot. Also,\nthe element of surprise is back which was the reason we all loved the\nfirst one. Can't wait for the final installment of the series soon to\ncome. Hope you love it as much as I did!\n"
"\nI am not saying that HTTYD2 is better that its predecessor. I am not\nsaying that HTTYD2 is better than Godfather 2 (Bad comparison...I will\nadmit!). But I can definitely say this - if you take a poll of the best\nof sequels to any film, HTTYD2 is a must on that! With a touching\nstory, amazing animation, deft direction and spot-on voice casting, you\ncertainly cannot go wrong with this one. With the welcome additions of\nthe talents of Cate Blanchett (who provides us with one of the poignant\nscenes to be witnessed in recent movies, with Gerard Butler's Stoick ),\nDjimon Hounsou and Kit Harrington (Game of Thrones' Jon Snow), the\ndragons take this movie to heights, the likes of 'Cars' can only watch\nin envy.<br><br>Here is my word for it - This one is a near master-piece, OK, change of\nstance, a real masterpiece. Waiting whole-heartedly for the threequel\nnow!!!!\n"
"\nI didn't go into this movie expecting much. I'd seen the first movie,\nand thought it was cute, but no very memorable.<br><br>This movie was much more fun and exciting. I enjoyed the added elements\nand felt elated at all the right moments. It was funny, and I got at\nleast one good laugh out loud moment.<br><br>That being said, the film felt a bit rushed at points. Maybe if Hiccup\nlearned to GET TO THE POINT they would have had time to get some more\nscenes in. Which brings me to another problem I had. Hiccup's voice.\nWow did it get annoying. Thankfully I was able to, mostly, overlook it.<br><br>All in all, a very good movie. Hopefully the third will be as good or\nbetter.\n"
"\nThis is not an origin story, but it does mix a couple of things nicely\nin here about the past and about family and many other things. So while\nit also does what (good) sequels do best (questioning existing\nrelationships and expanding on the universe that was created), it also\ntakes a step back, which isn't easy to pull off.<br><br>The voice talent from the first is back again and if you don't have an\nissue with their voices (or the actor/comedian) in general, you will be\nglad they did. The story once unfolded is very straightforward and is\npredictable. But that does not take away any of the fun or the action\nthat is really nicely \"drawn\" here. The pacing is good and it is a good\nfollow-up (makes sense to watch the first one, though I haven't seen\nthe TV show yet, so I can't comment on how that connects with the\nmovies).\n"
"\n6 July 2014 Film of Choice at The Plaza Dorchester This Afternoon - How\nTo Train Your Dragon 2. Hiccup, Toothless and all the gang return for\nthis most excellent sequel. Now living in harmony with the dragons, the\ncitizens of Berk face extinction from an unknown foe, it's up to\nHiccup, his friends and the dragons to save their way of life. Four\nyears on from the original, the animation in this sequel seems to be\nmore seamless and slick and I find myself immersed into the world on\nthe screen as if it is live actors in real scenery. Reunited with old\nfriends and introduced to new ones, we are immediately sucked back into\nthe world of the animated Viking and their unusual way of life. Once\nagain I'm in awe of the animators who can put so much personality into\ncharacters that don't speak. Children and adults in the audience seemed\nto enjoy this and it's definitely a good way to spend a couple of\nhours.\n"
"\nHow to Train Your Dragon 2 is a terrific film--visually spectacular,\nemotional, and thrilling. That animated characters can be so engaging,\nnot least of a which a small dragon who has no dialog, is a tremendous\ncredit to the writers and filmmakers. If you're a fan of animation,\nthis is a must see. If you're a fan of fantasy, it's a must see. If\nyou're a fan of great action films, it's a must see. The first film was\nalso great, but this is the rare sequel that surpasses the original in\nalmost every way. The story is far more emotional and involved, delving\ninto back story that was never even hinted at in the first film. And\nsome of the flight sequences are simply stunning. Then there are just\nthe fascinating visuals beyond the flight scenes. Costumes, interiors,\nnew dragons, even just some of the perspectives that scenes are shot\nfrom.<br><br>Just go see it. If you're disappointed, then I can't imagine what you\nwere looking for.\n"
"\nThis is one of those rare movies which is so good on so many levels\nthat the whole family can enjoy it over and over again. The villains\nare villainous, the heroes are believable and heroic and endearing, and\nthe fun is non-stop. I would put this film in the same class as Matilda\nand It's a Wonderful Life, i.e. thrilling and uplifting entertainment\nfor everyone, with a generous dose of humor to keep everything from\ngetting too serious. The animation is truly remarkable and fast-paced,\nincluding the many flying sequences on the dragons. The creativity is\nalso astounding - there is one sequence in which one animated character\nimitates the persona of another. Do not miss this movie!\n"
"\nThis movie in general was AMAZING!! It has a lot of action scenes,\ngreat graphics and nice humor. But personally, I think it could have\nbeen a lot better. The ending just seemed so rushed out and lazy. It's\nlike the people who wrote the script ran out of stuff to write. I was\nexpecting a lot more from the sequel of one of my favorite films but I\ndidn't quite get it. The rushed ending left me quite disappointed. But\nin general it was a great movie for adults, teens and kids alike. I\nwould recommend it for everyone who is a fan of How To Train Your\nDragon 1 and who knows, maybe it will work out for them better than it\ndid for me. Well, for anyone who is going to watch the movie after my\nreview, good luck and have a great time!\n"
"\nI am a huge fan of animated films and loved How to Train Your Dragon\nwhen it came out in 2010. I had the pleasure of seeing How to Train\nYour Dragon 2 in 3D and oh my god was it amazing!! I always enjoy going\ninto a movie that truly captures the audience with the characters,\nstory, setting, music, and action scenes and this movie had all that\nand much more. The characters as always are enjoyable to watch and\ntheir relationships are powerful and emotional. Seeing Hiccup try to\nfind who he is now that he's a young man was powerful and then what\nhappens around all that, wow! I loved the music and the story as well\nas Toothless and the other dragons. The franchise has never ceased to\namaze me and I definitely look forward to a How to Train Your Dragon 3\nwhen that's released.<br><br>10/10!!\n"
"\nThis movie is now one if my all time favorites! I've only gone back to\nthe theater and paid their prices to watch a movie more than once only\na few times. This is one if those movies. I want to go again tomorrow!\nIt has a fantastic storyline! You will not be disappointed. It's an\nadult like storyline that is appropriate for kids as well... so\neveryone watching is happy and entertained. The action and graphics are\nsuperb! Great wow scenes. Love the emotional connections between the\ncharacters. They've really evolved. Also, from a few lines said in the\nmovie... And how it ended... I think there will be a 3rd movie. I can't\nwait!\n"
"\nThe movie was good and full of action but it kind of dropped down in\nthe middle. The beginning and the end were excellent. I did not expect\nHiccup to find his mother in the movie at all. The movie showed people\nin distress and proved that any situation can be overcome. It shows\ntrue friendship when Hiccup frees Toothless from the control of the\nAlpha dragon. It is unlike any movie that I have seen before with a\ngreat storyline to prove it. Drago Bludvist is the main villain who is\ntrying to assemble a army of dragons. Well, tell me how you liked it!\nit is definitely a must watch movie! The part where toothless is taken\naway by Drago Bludvist was a good touch to the movie. Definitely\ndeserves a 9/10!\n"
"\nI just watched the movie today. This is awesome movie. First of all\ngive thanks to \"Dean DeBlois\" for making this wonderful movie for all\nof us. The movie start with dragon race.But our guy \"Hiccup\" is not\npresent in it.He is doing his discoveries.The race will won by Valka.\nAnd she will returned to her lover Hiccup.Suddenly they find out some\nsmoke arising from a mountain. Then they together go to that mountain\nto find it out.Then the main story begins..<br><br>Very good 3D effect. Good depth in 3D effect. In this i like most is\nthat movie Hiccup mom is returned. But the sad part is that his father\nwill die.<br><br>Must watch this title.\n"
"\nThis was by far one of the best children's movies that has been\nreleased in a long while. While it seems many found Frozen to be the\nbest title of the year, I doubt that will stand for long once word of\nthe brilliance this movie has to offer gets out. This movie expands\nsignificantly on the first title, as How to Train your Dragon gave you\nan intriguing emotional ride where the viewer was able to experience a\nbroad set of emotions, this sequel expands on that and strengthens each\nemotion on the table. Happy moments are happier, but Pixar was not\nafraid to take a risk. Most movies of this sort are somewhat tame, and\nwhile not expressly violent or obscene, How to Train Your Dragon 2 made\nsure to give the viewers an element of realism as things don't always\nturn out the way you might hope. . I would 10/10 recommend viewing this\nmovie to audiences of all ages. It is entertaining, intriguing, fun,\ncheerful, and full. It's just a full film. It lacks in no area, and I\ntruly regard it as one of the best children targeted films in the last,\nperhaps 5 years minimally.\n"
"\nJust watched this movie yesterday, and was not let down. I've read the\nreviews on this movie that I could which made me nervous about watching\nit, but to my amazement it lived up to it. The animation keeps getting\nbetter, I'm always surprised about that but this movie is jaw dropping\nfor that. And 3D, I'm not a fan, but this movie, needs to be watched\nonce in 3D. Better than the first in so many ways. Voice acting and the\nscript, top it, but those were short little blurps so not big. Watching\nit, you walk out of the theatre wishing it was 2 years later so you can\nwatch the third. Movie of the year, and this movie puts a real high bar\non great sequels and technology. What are you waiting for, go out and\nsee this movie this weekend. I promise you won't be disappointed.\n"
"\nDream works trump card How to train your dragon was one of my favorite\nanimated movies of all time. That one was a charming and heartfelt\nstory. This installment was beautiful (thanks to Roger Deakins), funny\nat the start, tragic in the middle and heroic at the end. <br><br>It just delivered what we want.<br><br>Toothless was great and he stole the show in the climax. Not a great\nstory but it has enough elements to keep the viewers intrigued till the\nclimax which all of a sudden delivers a power packed punch and then you\ncan't help but to cheer for Hiccup and Toothless. <br><br>The treatment was little predictable but the 'chief has come home'. <br><br>Music score, Animation and 3D were great too.<br><br>Best film of the year so far. Cheers !\n"
"\nThis movie i think is better then the first one because the story and\nthe characters are great.I did't actually wanna see this movie because\ni liked the first one and i thought that this is going to be bad but it\nwas fantastic.The only thing is that hiccups's dad died.Whitch didn't\nfeel good because it's a fairytale so was sad.But the dragons are\nlooking great toothless looked incredible and the giant dragons(can't\nremember they name)were pretty fantastic.Also Drago the villain was\nawesome too.How he controlled the dragons and how you felt so\npowerful.Hicups's mother fantastic the surroundings were pretty\nepic.Gigant battle epic.This movie is totally worth seeing 9/10.\n"
"\nThis movie is really inspiring and fun to watch through... Watch it\nalone or with your family, you can not resist the pull of this movie...\nThe first one was good, the 2nd one is even better... I am sure this\nmovie is going to win the best animated movie title in the Oscars... I\nam eagerly waiting for the 3rd part and i am hopeful the next one will\nsurpass our expectations. Kudos to the Director, music director and all\nother who have managed to make an astounding movie like this... I have\nwatched this movie alone on my computer and will again want to watch it\nwith my friends and family members. It will be great. I really enjoyed\nthe movie and at the end my heart is left with full of emotions and\nthrill.\n"
"\nHow to Train Your Dragon 2 Director: Dean DeBlois Genre: Animation<br><br>One of the biggest film-tips in 2014 is How to Train Your Dragon 2. I\nbought the BluRay of the first film immediately, because it's one of\nthe best animation-film-series and almost more breathtaking then every\nPixar-film. The films have a consequence that Pixar would never use,\nsince they don't want to scare the family audience. The second part of\nHow to Train Your Dragon is equally beautiful then the first one. I\njust saw him twice and it's technically very good just as the content.\nSome people say that there are too much effects and the emotional part\nisn't represented as in the first one. I can't agree with that. This\nfilm got a few scenes where my hearth was going. <br><br>Conclusion: This film is a perfect film for every kid and even adults\nwill have a good time because the emotional part is awesome.\n"
"\nThe Animations getting better and better with every year passing-by.\nCouldn't expect anything better than what we have got. This has to be\none of the best films I've seen with my family. The characters came to\nlife and was instantly hooked. The animations were virtually magnetic\nand magical. A definite must see for all the family, and the 3d version\nbought it to life, totally!! The cute puppy like expressions of\nToothless getting much and much cuter with every scenes rolling. And\nteaching every watching child and adult to be strong willed as a\nmoral....<br><br>With lots of surprising twists and turns in the story, I got to admit\nit the sequel gets better.\n"
"\nHTTYD 2 must win the Oscar for best animated picture this year and\nshould be nominated for best picture just like UP back in 2010. This\nmovie has brought animated movies to a whole new level. The story is\ntouching where we can see and related with the bond between Hiccup and\nToothless. The cinematography and the visual effects are fantastic and\neasily the best in animated movies.The voice work is good. And the\nstory............I can't emphasize enough but I don't wanna give away\nspoilers.This movie is truly remarkable right from it's very core.To\nall those who haven't seen the movie all i have to say is: \"You will\nnot be disappointed\". There is only one downside to this movie- it ends\nand trust me.......you don't want it to end.This was one helluva summer\nand I believe we have a chance of beating 1994 movie-wise thanks to\nsuch a strong start in the year.\n"
"\nI gave it 9/10 because of the problems this movie has with being an\nunintended sequel otherwise it would be a 10/10. It's definitively not\nmeant to just cash-in on it - it has a very good plot, the animation\nimproved quite a bit and they were able to make it just as much fun as\nthe first one. And in some areas they even surpassed it by adding more\ndramatic elements, moments which reminded me of the old animated movies\nfrom my childhood like Lion King or the Land before Time. So all in all\nit's a polished and well executed production. The only 2 things that\nbothered me a bit were that the plot doesn't fit as smooth as you'd\nlike to see it in a sequel and Baruchel's voice, which was a perfect\nfit for the first one, is too close to the awkward teenager and doesn't\nreally help to make the transition to the young adolescent Hiccup is\nsupposed to be in this one.\n"
"\nI loved this one even more than the first How to Train your Dragon.\nThis story line was so much more better in my opinion and it was really\nemotional. It has a lot of things that only adults would get, but it is\na good movie none the less for your kids to see. The only thing that I\nwould have against this movie, if i was being picky is that I do not\nlike hiccups's character's voice. The actor behind that voice really\nirritates me. But that's just because I am not a fan of that actor. But\nthe movie is wonderful and I have already pre-ordered my blu-ray.\neveryone should watch this!<br><br>I did not feel like there was much drag time in the movie, some scene\ncould have been taken out but it all served to the story and did not\nfeel like a waste of time to me. This is definitely one of the top 3\nanimated films that have been release so far. And probably in my top 5\nmovies of 2014. That is how good this movie is. Story is strong.\nCharacters are strong. Dragons are awesome and Animation is superb.\n"
"\nThe first How to Train a Dragon movie absolutely blew me away. It is\nstill one of my top four animated films (Incredibles, Kung Fu Panda and\nSpirited Away are the others.)It was the first film that managed to\nmake 3D work so well that it took my breath away. I watched it at the\ncinema with my four year old daughter and we both spent most of the\nfilm on the edge of our seats. I am happy to report that the sequel is\njust as bright, colourful, funny and exciting as the first. But, most\nimportantly, just like the first film, it doesn't seem to know that it\nis a cartoon. The voice work and the animation combine to give us a\nreal acting experience from a fantastic cast, and it transitions neatly\nbetween teenage angst and non- stop action. If I have any criticisms\nthey are all about the story; the film does suffer a little from the\nsequel-disease of unnecessary happenings in desperate bid to ensure old\nground is not tread. This film doesn't benefit from the sheer\nunexpected charisma of the first film but it does tick all the boxes,\nand is very enjoyable for it.\n"
"\nThis terrific movie includes some of the most popular dragons like\nToothless with his rider Hiccup. Dreamworks has stepped up -not one but\ntwo levels- and created the most fascinating movie you have ever seen!<br><br>HTTYD 2 is a movie with new problems. 5 years later, when the other\nvikings found out Hiccup could train dragons, they thought they could\ntrain them too. So they go everywhere searching for dragons and taking\nthem from their natural habitats just to train them. But is it fine to\ndo that? What will Hiccup do? Find out yourself by watching this\nbreathtaking movie.<br><br>This is a suitable movie for all ages. I rate this 9.5/10. Quickly\nbefore it won't show up anymore!\n"
"\nI went to an early showing of this film with my younger siblings, and I\nwent in open-minded because I wasn't sure what to expect. I was\nexcited, but there was still a hint of concern because there have been\nmultiple times I've been let down by a poor sequel.<br><br>This wasn't one of those times.<br><br>No, this isn't like the first one. It's a little darker (though there\nare humorous moments scattered throughout it), and if you're looking\nfor the goofiness from the first movie then you might be disappointed.\nPersonally, I really enjoyed this one. Possibly even more than the\nfirst. The dynamics between Hiccup and Toothless are priceless, and I\nwould definitely suggest for everyone who was a fan of the first movie\nto give this one an honest chance.\n"
"\nThe movies are good, but the cartoon needs to be watched in between.\nMore will be explained because things that are in this movie are not in\nthe first one. I saw it with hubby and daughter. Hubby and I were\nlaughing our a's off because we know more about the story through the\ncartoons and the blanks get filled in. We laughed really hard and the\nothers were staying quiet except for the kids. I watch the show more\nthan hubby does and stilled enjoyed the movie because it was a new\nadventure for hiccup. I know some movies/TV shows do not follow the\nother and the time line gets eschewed, but this does the job. The show\non cartoon network is not separate entity from the movies and hope they\ncontinue to make more of both. It is a good series all together and\nworth the money.\n"
"\nIt was nice movie. The 1st time I watched to Howto train your dragon I\nI was so impressive with relationship between dragon and human. there\nwere amazing. But this episode we have not known about the king of\ndragon. They can control every dragons including to Toothless. How\ncomes , the power can not control the relationship between Hiccup and\ntoothless. So I really truly love this movie! you guys should go to\nsee. And not only the relationship between dragon and human but also\nthe love in family. How much dad's love , mom's love. it's good movie\nfor family and everybody. even I am in Thailand I really love this\nmovie . Thanks to this movie that produced very nice movie to me.\n"
"\nSince Toy story 3, I've never watch any animated film that's really\ntouching and amazing ... until now.<br><br>I saw the prequel when it came out and suddenly fell in love with it.\nHiccup and Toothless made the strong charismatic characters to the film\nand the storyline was also brilliant.<br><br>After i knew that the sequel is coming this June, I've asked myself a\nquestion: Will it succeeds like its predecessor? or it just came out to\nmake money like some sequel nowadays? After I've watched it, I found it\nsurprisingly amazing!.In this film, it's quite different from the\noriginal. It's darker and more mature but I think it's really\nentertaining!. The storyline was good and the characters, both new and\nold ones, made me fell in love with them over again and again.<br><br>It has been so long since the last animated film I saw made me feel so\nemotional. I wish that the final installment of this series will be\ngreat as well.<br><br>Thanks to Dreamworks for making such an epic series. Hope you love this\nfilm as much as I did.\n"
"\nHow to Train Your Dragon 2. Being a sequel of a much loved movie,\nDragon 2 walks on the tight rope of maintaining the fun quotient of\nDragon 1 and providing some new fresh ideas which can make Dragon 2\nmemorable. Movie improves in the stunning imagery and usage of 3D\neffects considerably. Dragons' flight scenes would be hard to forget\nespecially by new kids in the audience. Characterization of humans and\ndragons both is done with much care. But it is hard to ignore the fact\nthat fun quotient has been lowered and movie takes a darker way in\nsecond half in providing few key twists and turns. Burdened by high\nexpectations, Dragon 2 falls short of being a milestone movie but dares\nto take new chances. The chemistry of our hero Hiccup and his dragon\nToothless remains the strength of the story. I am going with generous 8\nout of 10 for How to Train Your Dragon 2. It has its flaws but is very\nwell saved by excelling in visuals and characters department. Watch it\nin 3D for full impact.\n"
"\nThose who know me know that my favorite movie of all time is How to\nTrain Your Dragon (the first one). Well, I must say, HTTYD2 may very\nwell replace it! Like many, I was concerned when i heard they were\nmaking a sequel to HTTYD. However, I was not disappointed, and if you\nliked the first movie, you won't be disappointed either.<br><br>HTTYD2 was expertly crafted. The animation is impeccable, and the\nsoundtrack matches the movie perfectly. The story was crafted in such a\nway as to be full of action and drama, while still maintaining that\nendearing touch that made me love the first movie.<br><br>HTTYD2 is more emotionally charged than the first movie. The story line\nis somewhat darker, though not oppressively so. The movie has matured\nalong with the characters, it seems. In addition, the action scenes are\nmore intense and may not be suitable for younger children.<br><br>That being said, I think that Dreamworks really outdid themselves with\nthis movie! I will be watching it again in IMAX, and I definitely plan\non owning this film! You won't regret seeing this movie.\n"
"\nI saw the first one when it came out and fell in love, when I went in\nto watch this movie I was scared it may disappoint me. By the end I was\nclapping and even though I was the only one it was worth being the only\none. It is very different from the original, much more mature, which I\nwas not expecting, but I am so happy I went to see it and I can't wait\nto see the third and final installment, the biggest surprise was the\ndeath of huge character in the series. As I was watching the movie it\nfelt like it was so much longer than and hour and thirty minutes, but\nin a good way it made me lose track of time and was just beautiful, the\nanimation was flawless and the story amazing, I would recommend this\nmovie to literally anyone, just note is is darker and more mature...\n"
"\nI don't really like watching sequels as they are most often\ndisappointments. However, this is definitely not one of those.<br><br>It is a compelling adventure and a rocky emotional roller coaster\ntelling the tale of true friendship. I have enjoyed it to the last\nminute and while the inner child in me might have hoped for a slightly\ndifferent ending, the harsh truth remains harsh as ever: there's always\na winning and a losing side. <br><br>Overall, however, the movie is outrageously funny and uplifting, yet, a\nbit heart wrenching in all the right places. Definitely one of the\nmotion pictures I'll be showing to my kids in the future.\n"
"\nIt is 5 years since Hiccup became friends with dragon Toothless and\nchanged the way the village of Berk lived. And now he happens upon a\ncommunity of dragons who live hidden away: there is a long-hidden\nsecret and a menace to be faced.<br><br>The first film was an unexpected gem, and its sequel is just as good\n(albeit no longer unexpected). The real-time passage of time is\ninteresting, the story works, there is some real emotion, and the\nvisuals are terrific (and, again, the film is worth catching in 3D).<br><br>The voice work is very good, although Cate Blanchett affects an accent\nwhich hovers somewhere unidentifiable. I think she was going for Scots\nbut, if so, she didn't quite make it.<br><br>But I will cut this film any breaks it needs, because it did something\nwhich few films do: it made the hairs on the back of my neck stand up.\nThere is a moment when a character who has been something of a victim\nin this film finally turns, and it completely blew me away - I loved\nit.<br><br>Highly recommended, and catch its predecessor first if you haven't\nalready done so.\n"
