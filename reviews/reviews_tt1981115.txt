"\nThe acting was solid. The production value was superb. Everything else\nwas really poor.<br><br>The back story and character motivations are laughably sparse. Most of\nthe characters are completely one-dimensional, with the possible\nexception of Loki. The plot is the most boring and typical of all\naction plots - some \"bad dudes who happen to be really ugly\" decide to\n\"destroy the world for no reason other than being evil\" and \"only our\nhero can save us all\", etc. Moreover, it was lazy writing - whenever an\nabsolute miracle needed to happen, it conveniently did, every time. <br><br>Of course this is a mindless blockbuster Marvel movie so we shouldn't\nexpect much. But the thing is that these kinds of films CAN be made\nwith a reasonable plot, pacing, and character development. The writers\nwere obviously just going through the motions to cash in on the\nsurefire moneymaker sequel, and from a business perspective it is hard\nto fault them. But it says a lot about the sad state of Hollywood in\n2013 that this film currently has a 7.7 on IMDb.\n"
"\nThe plot barely exists for this film. Generic evil people try to take\nover universe, Thor stops them, the end. Which might have been alright\nbut there was very little action in this mindless action film. What\nlittle fighting we got was poorly orchestrated and repetitive.<br><br>The dialogue is wooden and adds nothing. The characters with the\nexception of Loki have no depth and only exist as an assortment of\nclich√©s. Hiddleston makes for a great Loki but that is literally the\nonly good or interesting thing in the entire film.<br><br>Thor continues to be the worst Marvel movie franchise and Hemsworth is\npossibly the worst actor to ever star in multiple major movies.\n"
"\nJust got back from seeing this and thought I'd put in my thoughts.<br><br>This is by far the most intricate and thoughtful of the Marvel films to\ndate, with a great story and some superb performances, particularly\nHiddleston's as Loki. The characters from previous Asgard related\noutings are there, but thanks to some good writing, are more 3\ndimensional and therefore, interesting. This is one of the few films\nthat would have benefited from an extra 15 minutes or so to explore\nfurther the motivations of the key protagonists. <br><br>There is plenty of large scale action, as well as some laugh out loud\nhumorous moments that help to keep this kicking along.<br><br>I am both surprised and delighted that this is not only the best\nsuperhero movie to date, (even eclipsing Spider-Man 2), but currently\nthe best movie I've seen this year.<br><br>Don't miss this!\n"
"\nI don't know how some of the reviews here are so positive! Bad. bad\nmovie. All the happenings seem so constructed, that I couldn't stop\nthinking why the figures in the movie act so stupidly. Very bad\nwriting. The scenery can be good from time to time. But the events in\nthe movie just seem like none of the characters could make A SINGLE\nlogic and useful decision. 2 stars because it had some good pictures in\nit. Otherwise more than horrible movie that made me think \"What? Oh,\ncome on!\" about a hundred times. it almost seems like a spoof of a good\nvs. bad plot. And on the way we have a bunch of bad jokes to mess up\nthis movie even more.\n"
"\nDisney have produced some fantastic marvel films throughout there\ntakeover. Ironman 1 and 3, Thor, and the avengers were awesome. They\ndon't try to be the dark brooding DC films, they cant be, they're of a\nlarger scope, more comprehensive in appeal. They're packed with humour,\naction, and riveting twists, and as a whole capture the characters spot\non ie Downey jnr. This however, does not. This film is saturated beyond\nhumour with joke after joke after joke. Thor has his lighter tales, but\nmalekeith is a darker adversary, brooding and malicious. Thus the plot\nshould reflect this. Yet this film kept joking and joking, so much, I\ndidn't care about Malekeith, he didn't seem that menacing at all. He\nbutchers millions...yet the humour detracted from that beyond belief.\nThe twist in plot from Loki is its saving grace, as is Hiddlestone's\nacting, hopefully Thor 3 can recapture that which was Thor.\n"
"\nI have seen Thor 1 and I thought that it was a nice introduction to\nsomething good they will come up with in future. I didn't like the\ncharacter of Thor, the way it was portrayed later in the avengers and\nwas disappointed with it. Then comes Thor: The dark world and i have\nbeen reading pretty descent comments about it everywhere and decided to\ngive it one last chance and boy i was wrong. This movie has thoroughly\nand utterly disappointed me, there wasn't a single WOW moment in this\nmovie, special effects had nothing special in them, story: over\ncomplicated along with astro physicists and their weird instruments and\nwhat not. It was humorous at time but seldom the timing was\nappropriate. My verdict: I will personally not suggest my friends to\nwatch this movie or any future Thor movie.\n"
"\nI look at the rating here, went on to see it even if I knew it would be\nnot be my kind of movie as i'm into Scandinavian mythology and the\nprevious one was just hilarious.<br><br>Well, it was half an hour only before I left the theatre and I have\nnever done this before. Question circulating in my head was what kind\nof people did give this rating different than 1. It is a disaster I\ncannot even explain, horrific play and scenario, won't even talk about\nthe interpretation of the Scandic mythology as whoever has seen the\nfirst one knows its done by people with no sense of it at all. Indeed,\nthis thing is a serious offense against the culture of the\nScandinavians.<br><br>In a few words, it reminds me of a cheap Hercules style series, looks\nlike the budget has been $14, 189.67 in total, is made by people with\nno sense of mythology and is totally disastrous. Worst 8 euro I have\never spent in my life, worst by far. Movie deserves a parody. Cries for\none.\n"
"\nIf you like fantastical characters and fantastical worlds that make as\nmuch sense as going to the local crack house for vitamins, then this\nfilm is for you. <br><br>Its a cruel world were you spend your hard earned cash on such an over\nall bad film experience. <br><br>Sorry I could not find anything constructive to say about this film. I\nstruggled all the way through until finally (three quarters through) I\ngive up and left the cinema.<br><br>As this is my very first review I even ran out of words to fulfill the\nunnecessary 10 lines of containment text to leave a comment. :(\n"
"\nI was never a really big fan of Thor to begin with and this movie just\nproves it to me again. This movie was so slow and boring. The first\nhour I almost fell asleep a few times. The special effects were really\nwell done but other then that I really do not think this was a great\nmovie. I gave this movie a generous 6 out of a possible 10. Normally\nthese types of movies at least earn a 7 from me but this one at best\nwas a 6 only.<br><br>You can tell that this sequel was made for the sack of making some more\nmoney off the very boring Thor. I for one will not waste my money on a\nthird that is for sure. They really need to stop wasting everyone's\ntime with Thor. He is boring and other then his looks has very little\ngoing for him. Good day!\n"
"\nOf course it's worth more than 2 out of 10. But it's 2 as in\nfrustration. Frustration that the cinematographic school sucks this\ndays. Talent is wasted. <br><br>Producers are more careless than ever. Only money it's important,\nquality and achievement have become similar to blue tomatoes.<br><br>Great decors, good CGI effects, good action scenes.<br><br>The story line is like a cheap toilet paper that gets stuck you know\nwhere, no matter what you do.<br><br>Take the same movie, chop off completely the story line, put together\nthe action scenes, and there you are, same stuff, enjoyable, and\ncheaper.\n"
"\nI studied the convergence for 25 minutes. This movie gets high ratings\nfor the same reason that The Hobbit does: people love to see great\neffects that are neato, and rumbling sounds. One more sign of crumbling\nintelligence in a crumbling society. Most of the great movies have no\nspecial effects whatsoever. Few of them come from modern day Hollywood.\nSave your time and pick your nose in the bathroom at home. Crap, I\ndon't have enough lines. I can't figure out how to write a long review\nabout something as vapid as this movie. If you liked \"Android Cop, \"I,\nFrankenstein\" or \"After Earth,\" then you will love this one. I took my\nson to this and 25 minutes in I told him I would buy him a toy at\nWalmart if we could leave. The total price for the evening was $15 for\nthe movie + $45 for the LEGO set = $60. However, he got a new toy and I\ndidn't have to watch that crap movie.\n"
"\nWalking out of Thor: The Dark World I felt I just watched Transformers:\nDark of the Moon again. It has the spit out formula that blockbuster\nmovies like Iron Man 2 have. It feels like TV has another spin off cop\nshow. The CGI is big-budget, but the story here has hardly any suspense\nand is boring. The movie reuses the short action, talking, villain\ncreates problem, talking, and conclusion plot line. The movie starts\nwith a small-scale fight with irrelevant enemies to introduce Thor.\nThen Jane messes with a portal while an ancient vengeful antagonist who\nlost long ago shows up, all the way to the mid-point when Marvel\nrecreates the Star Wars The Phantom Menace battle with the energy\nshield dome and two armies run at each other, and it ends shortly, to\nrestart in the ending. Thor has no weaknesses and he needs Loki for\ndistraction. Describing the ending in one sentence sounds like the\npremise of The Avengers ending. Save your money for the next Marvel\nmovie. I wrote this review this morning and six hours have passed and I\nhave forgotten most of the movie.\n"
"\nTERRIBLE MOVIE!!! <br><br>We just saw the movie today and we wished we hadn't wasted the money.\nThe movie was way too fast paced, we could not absorb what was going on\nat times and we could not grab hold of the characters., with the\nexception of Loki. Plus the last hour or so of the movie became\nterribly predictable and simply boring. The first two Iron Man movies\nwere fantastic, the first Thor and Captain America movies were great,\nbut not with the disappointment of Iron Man 3 and not Thor 2 I feel\nthat the Avengers franchise has lost its steam.... I have a feeling\nthat too many hands are in the pot now in these movies and it is\nruining the quality. I only hope that it doesn't carry over to the Star\nWars franchise.\n"
"\nMarvel has finally lost anything it had going for it. It is now\ncompletely aimed at kids. One joke after another! sure it's funny! but\nI was not expecting a comedy. I loved all the previous marvel until\niron man 3, I then gave up on the iron mans and thought that Thor 2\nlooked a bit darker. <br><br>boy was I wrong. Really disappointed. The whole thing is a joke. i know\ni sound like a bit of a moody Michael but i was really looking forward\nto this. I have now given up on marvel and will not be going to see any\nmore of them. It's a good watch for kids or if you want a laugh. They\nshould really get some tips from the batman movies.\n"
"\nOK so I am going to get straight to the point.This movie is one I was\nreally looking forward to watching.The first Thor movie was one of my\nfavorite super hero movies of all time.This was NOT. For a big budget\nmovie with a big budget cast it left me feeling like I had wasted my\ntime watching it.I can't single out anything in particular that was bad\nas the whole thing just felt like filler material. The baddies are\nlacking any real threat and this time round I just found that both thor\nand Loki did nothing worth remembering.<br><br>I am not expecting much from the next Captain America either but it\ncant be worse than this.For me this is up there with Catwoman and both\nFantastic Four movies\n"
"\nWe very seldom walk out of a movie, but to us our time is worth more\nthan the cost of any movies. This move was bland one dimensional, and\nwith no character that you could care for. The girl that was suppose to\nbe Portmans assistance was utterly pointless and annoying. To top this\nthere was an assistant to her, this man was even dumber than her. I\nthink it has become an sport to make male characters with no spine and\nbrain in Hollywood movies, it makes the feminist happy. Back to the\nmovie, 30 minutes through we were literally falling sleep, so looked at\neach other and just left. There is no plot that can have anything\nremotely to do with any possible laws of physics, anything goes. No\ncharacters to relate to, and special effects well, there are explosions\nthat is all. Don't waste your time.\n"
"\nThis movie is utter utter garbage. If it wasn't for Tom Hiddleston I\nwould have drop kicked the TV out the window. The 1 star out of 10 is\nreserved for Loki.<br><br>God it's so terrible I don't even know where to start. The dialogue was\nappallingly bad, toe-curling cringey jokes, the plot is all over the\ngaf with no rhyme or reason at all. The baddie wasn't bad enough, the\ngoody was too good, I couldn't have cared less who lived or died by the\nend of the movie, I just wanted it to end.<br><br>A horrible waste of a Saturday evening. It is beyond me how people find\nit entertaining, cop on lads, its complete pooh.\n"
"\nThis movie's only saving grace was every scene with Loki, who sadly\nisn't going to be in Avengers 2 according to Joss Whedon. This film\nspent way too much time with Natalie Portman and her throw-away friend\ncharacters trying to dish out quirky comedic relief, which resulted in\npainfully unfunny scenes that dragged and dragged and dragged... I'm\nnot sure what it is about Natalie Portman's acting but for me it was\nexcruciatingly reminiscent of her Queen Amidala performance. Her acting\ntends to be pretty hit or miss for me but these Thor movies just\nhaven't been doing her any favors. The relationship she has with Thor\nis so unconvincing and bland that the movie can't even be bothered to\ntack on a little farewell scene for the both of them when Chris\nHemsworth goes back to Asgard at the end. It cares that little. <br><br>Also, generic evil bad guy is more undefined than any other super\nvillain the Marvel movie universe has come up with so far. Why is it so\ndifficult to write a memorable antagonist in these movies?\n"
"\nOut of all the Marvel movies I have seen, Thor has been my favorite, so\nwhen I heard that Thor: The Dark World was going to be released, I was\npsyched. Of all the films that where in the movies at the time, (Hunger\nGames: Catching Fire, Captain Phillips etc.) I chose to see this one,\nand I was not disappointed.<br><br>If you did not watch the first Thor movie, you may not understand this\none in it's entirety. If you did not like the first Thor movie, then\nthis is not for you.<br><br>But if you watched and liked the first film, you will love this film.\nThe visual effects are amazing, and the ending will leave you baffled,\nand expecting the next Marvel movie.\n"
"\nFor starters, I loved this film! I was a fan of the first but this one\nis superior in every way. The actions scenes are better, the plot is\nbetter and there is great banter throughout the film. Due to these\nfactors it is entertaining and has more than enough in it to keep you\ninterested. The acting is fantastic, especial by Chris Hemsworth and\nTom Hiddleston, as they work great together and appear to have a great\nunderstanding of each others roles. I just can't understand why people\ndon't like this film unless they are not a fan of superheroes. After\nseeing this film last night I read through a few of the reviews\nafterwards and was shocked as some people were giving it lower than 7.\nThese people are clearly boring and have no idea about an entertaining\nfilm and enjoy watching films that just depress you and have no idea\nabout what a fantastic superhero film this is. I recommend you watch\nthis immediately as you won't be disappointed.\n"
"\nMaybe a \"3\" is too high a grade for this film, but I guess the special\neffects has to be weighed in, although they are completely wasted since\nthe overall content is totally crap. Firstly we have Thor: A completely\nuninteresting character played by someone without any skills\nwhatsoever. Secondly it is a world with space ships, where all soldiers\nhas clubs, axes and swords. Duh? Thirdly? well, the story is completely\nuninteresting and hard to follow. Probably because they try and pack a\nlot of viking stuff into some kind of modern package and while doing\nthis they have not only lost the audience but themselves as well.<br><br>I dunno.\n"
"\nThis movie is from the schoolgirls by the schoolgirls for the\nschoolgirls and, when I say schoolgirls I mean really juvenile\nschoolgirls, immature at best. This is an exercise in cheer-leading.\nThis movie is for those that believe the moon is made of cheese,\ncandies grow on trees and in running streams of chocolate milk. Not\nthat there's anything wrong with it but I thought the premise was the\ndamnation of the universe.<br><br>Yes, the end of light in the universe by crazy testosterone infused\nelves nonetheless, one of who is African by the way. The only thing\nstanding in their way is Arseguard. Pertinent to its name everyone at\narseguard is involved with, you guessed it, saving their own bottoms\nwhile their prince thor is involved with baby sitting his honeypot.<br><br>There are some decent graphics but you'll be hard pressed to watch an\nexplosion here, a spaceship there and whops you need new glasses.\n"
"\nI was expecting to be impressed with this movie. Instead, along comes\nthis endless battle royal that goes on and on and on with sword fights\nand battle scenes. Not to mention the all too typical these days - cars\ngetting tossed around like swatted flies scenes that made me wonder if\nthis was supposed to be a Transformers remake or a Tolkien version of a\nRambo movie or something. I was expecting a SUPER-HERO movie, not a war\nmovie. At the start the movie seems promising but as it goes on it\nbecomes painfully obvious that little was invested towards writing an\ninteresting plot line and script for this stinker. Evil elves versus\nAzgardians? Give me a break! Maybe if they make a third movie they can\npit Thor against an evil villain here on Earth and the earthlings can\nbe more than minor window dressing in the plot line. Give me the comic\nbooks over this movie any time.\n"
"\nAWFUL GARBAGE MOVIE!!! Saw this garbage on Starz the other night and\nwished I could get those hours of my life back. The movie was way too\nunderdeveloped and zoomed through the plot, me and my son could not\nunderstand what was going on at times and we could not keep hold of the\ncharacters., with the exception of Loki. In addition the last hour or\nso of the movie became terribly predictable and extremely boring. But\nregardless...this movie was terrible and awful. The characters were\njust so superficial and very one dimensional that I did not give a\nhoots to what happened to any of them. Apparently the universe was in\ntrouble, and this film managed to make that concept completely boring\nand uninspired. Leave end of world stuff to X-men movies. They do it\nbetter. There were also a few pitiful..attempts at humor thrown into\nthe movie. Which were all extremely kiddie...and..childish...they fell\nflat...and in fact were so \"unfunny\" they made me cringe. I had to\nwatch X-men movies after this to remind myself why I look comic book\nfilms.\n"
"\nGotta say, digital eye candy can be pretty astonishing. Wish I could\nlook at the worlds they created all day. Screensaver maybe?<br><br>But as for what's going on in front of all this stunning art direction,\nit's all pretty ridiculous and confusing. Honestly, by the end I just\ngot tired of things smashing and breaking for no real reason, and found\nmyself desperately hoping the thing would just end already. The scenes\nwith Loki were the film's saving grace; while he was around, I found\nmyself interested. But trying to make sense out of all the rest of this\nslop just made me tired and frustrated. I'd gladly watch about half of\nit again with the sound off, and I recommend the film highly to the\ndeaf community.<br><br>Surprised to see it's so highly rated here. Well, I guess that's what\npasses for entertainment today.\n"
"\nCome on guys!! This was blooming awful!Bad acting, clich√©d story-line,\niffy effects and just a lazy, cheap,gap-filler between the really big,\nwell financed Marvel epics such as the Avengers series.<br><br>I was bored pretty much from the beginning. A hotch-potch of ideas\nwoven into an overly complex story-line that fails to deliver on ones\nexpectations. Token big names give the film some kudos, but again the\nperformances are disappointing, let down by a poor script that falls\ninto the world of geek like an Acme boulder.<br><br>And why are British actors still being stereotyped by Hollywood as\nvillains, toffs, and idiots. <br><br>11 lines of review in order to qualify to have your message uploaded.\nSo much for freedom of speech, minimalism of thought, sparsity of\nspeech. I therefore have to waffle on and on cuz I've said all I'm\ngoing to say about this film, as I type i'm watching it, cringing when\nHopkins struggles to act.\n"
"\nI watched part one some years ago and I didn't remember a thing until I\nwas reminded in this movie. I forgot the characters and the story, I\nonly remember that there was some kind of battle with some ancient\nenemy. Just like in Thor: TDW. We also have some ancient ¬Ñpowerful\"\nenemy which has been defeated aeons ago, when he tried to take over\ncontrol of the universe, or something like that. Now this enemy is back\nalong with some kind of super-weapon. And our heroes evil brother Loki\nis also present and continues with his schemes and tricks. Our hero is\n- as before - invincible and in the end we have big battle on Earth and\non the plant of Who-cares-heim. The powerful (read boring and\nforgettable) enemy is defeated and in the end of the movie we some some\nhints for things to come in planned sequels. Nothing new. But, I must\nconfess that Thor is a likable hero so there are some laughs in this\ninstallment. See it if you must.\n"
"\nThe Marvel factory rolls on, and the next widget down the assembly line\nis 'Thor: The Dark World'. Devoid of much of the wit, heart and\ncharacter development that made the first 'Thor' a surprisingly solid\nstand-alone film, 'The Dark World' tries to skate along on its\nbreathtaking visuals and the good will created by 'The Avengers'. It\ndoesn't succeed. From its info-dump opening to its dull, drawn out\nfinale, I never gave two Sifs about anything or anyone in this film.<br><br>After this past Summer's dreadfully dull and lifeless 'Iron Man 3',\nMarvel's post-'Avengers' slate is now a big 0-2. Sadly, they can't hear\nmy complaints over the sound of ringing cash registers.\n"
"\nNot much of expectation. But. The movie was so boring and unreal. No\nstory and felt like it's trying to imitate role playing game themes.\nNot much of a real story. The second quarter felt intriguing. But after\nthat it plunged to the sewers :D. There was no story. And it's a shame\nof what they did with the potential of good graphics. Spoiler alert in\nnext few lines. Trying to pose Loki as changed person as a twist? Too\nPredictable. What was more annoying was getting rid of him instantly.\nIf you dig in a twist in story, you let it sink, not flush it away.\nThey should try to make a low selling game instead. Hope the mistakes\nare learnt and the pathetic twist and prequel to possible 5 to go are\nmade better. watchable :p. Adios\n"
"\nI liked the first Thor but this one was a total failure.<br><br>The plot to this movie is as thin as an 80 Yr Old Pair of Underwear\nthat has been worn by a homeless dude for the past quarter century.<br><br>I mean thin. The beginning was difficult to understand. I even\nattempted to use closed captioning to get the drift of the beginning.<br><br>The only redeeming features of the movie were Loki and the two\nsub-characters who worked for Jane Foster.<br><br>It sounded like Chris Hemsworth just graduated from Woolloomooloo\nGrammar given his thick Aussie accent (which was not as pronounced in\nthe first movie).\n"
"\nThor the dark world is the second installment to the Thor sequel when i\nwent to go see it i had high expectations for this movie this did not\nmeet my expectations at all, now i am a big action fan and i did not\nlike this movie they had so much plot holes to count the characters did\nnot have very good development this is a warning for readers that there\nare spoilers up ahead! i did give some credit about Loki death but then\neventually faked his death and marvel has done a great job at doing\nthings like that the pacing of the movie did have some slowdowns but\nthe pacing went along with the action of the movie spoilers ahead for\nreaders, malikieth who is the villain of this movie was not very\ninteresting in fact he was the worst villain i have ever experienced\nseeing by my waste of time i give this a 4/10 did not like it.\n"
"\nWell I was so looking forward to seeing this movie when I went last\nnight, and although it was reasonably good it was not at all what I\nexpected.<br><br>Watch the official movie trailer and you see what looks like quite a\ndark fantasy, so you can imagine my surprise when throughout the movie\nthe audience was laughing out loud at the stupid one liners. Yes I know\nthis is entertainment, and this movie was moderately entertaining, but\nonce again the makers have tried to please everyone by adding a bit of\neverything; action, special effects, romance and humour, just far too\nmuch of the latter for my taste in a genre that does not require\nhilarity to succeed.<br><br>Although it has a lower IMDb score I much preferred the 2011 Thor, a\nstronger storyline, darker and no laughing matter!\n"
"\nThe rating on this is justifiably declining now that the \"honeymoon\"\nperiod is over. From a plot point of view, there are no surprises with\neverything that happens pretty well announced before it happens,\nresulting in very little suspense. So I am not ticking the spoiler box\nbecause the film spoils itself.<br><br>The most annoying thing for me was the long drawn-out aftermath of\nFriga's death being accompanied by music which is a repetitive rip-off\nfrom the Lord of the Rings score, and is even more boring than the\noriginal. I just don't understand why more effort isn't put into film\nscores these days.\n"
"\nWatching this movie represents an all-time LOW in my life as a consumer\nof mass entertainment products. This movie clearly is one big\npredictable run for profit for the movie company, director, and actors:\nnothing but clich√©s in every aspect and detail, cheesy dialog, silly\nsound effects, pretty faces, buff bodies, over-dramatization,\nstupidity, and the list goes on and on and on. This movie is a\ntravesty, a cartoonist's public rape of Nordic mythology for money.\nThis movie is sucking up to a well-mapped audience which has no care\nfor quality, as long as they get their 10 minutes of something cool to\ntell their friends about. By being in this movie, Natalie Portman,\nAnthony Hopkins, Rene Russo, and Stellan Skarsg√•rd have tripped and\nfallen from any and all artistic grace that they have earned over the\nyears. Shame, shame, shame.\n"
"\nWhen we left our friends in Asgard, all was right in the 9 realms after\nLoki was thrown into an abyss for his selfish ways and almost destroyed\neverything the Asgardians hold most dear. But it has been 2 years since\nJane Foster and Thor parted ways and now they are reunited because of a\ndarkness that shrouds over Jane's inner body as she infects a most\npowerful and deadly weapon that could not only destroy her but the\nentire 9 realms ¬ñ it takes a vicious monster Malekith (played\nwonderfully by Christopher Eccleston) to destroy all of the races in\nthe universe to converge it all in darkness.<br><br>But it takes Thor (Hemsworth) along with Foster (Portman) and Loki\n(Hiddleston) to save the day. But what we don't know may surprise us ¬ñ\nthat the Tesseract, the Aether, so close together creates something\nmore deadly than what they could ever even think that could happen to\nthe fate of the entire universe.<br><br>This movie was excellent and I am looking forward to seeing what is\nnext for our mighty god of thunder.\n"
"\nI was really excited to watch this when it first came out and I was one\nof the first at the cinema, and the film didn't disappoint. With a\nfantastic contrast of scenes and emotions this film kept me entertained\nand hooked until the very end. It made me laugh, made me scared and\nmade me cry (especially the scenes surrounding Loki). Kat Dennings and\nStellan Skarsgard made some hilarious jokes and made me and all of my\nfamily laugh. Chris Hemsworth and Natalie Portman conveyed the\nrelationship excellently, Christopher Eccleston was captivating and Tom\nHiddleston made me smile and cry, what more can I say( he is an amazing\nactor and my idol).The plot twist at the end was fantastic and totally\nunexpected, the whole plot was well planned and written. I cannot wait\nfor the next installment of this franchise! Fantastic writing and\nacting!!!!!\n"
"\nThor 2 \"The Dark World\" gives great entertainment movie. Both the parts\nof the series of Thor gives full entertainment, and full of enjoyment.\nIt is one of the best sequel I watched. The theme and concept of the\nmovie is very perfect and is best suitable. Thanks to the Marvel gives\nmuch entertainer movie.<br><br>All the characters played in this movie is so perfect. Specially i like\nthe character of Loki played by Tom Hiddleston.<br><br>Overall This movie is great entertainer movie with lots of actions with\nexcellent graphics.<br><br>I give it 10/10.\n"
"\n**SPOILER ALERT**<br><br>Full of action, humorous, and an overall fun film with one major flaw;\n\"Thor\" is nowhere to be found, replaced by an entity that amounts to\nlittle more than a big guy with a hammer.<br><br>The Thor faithful, especially those that followed Walt Simonson's\nadaptation of Snorri Sturlusen's stories in the prose and poetic Edda,\nwill more than likely be disappointed in what Marvel has done to their\nhero. Gone is the super-being that travels faster than the speed of\nlight, gone is the mightiest entity in the nine realms, replaced by\nsomething that is \"Thor\" in name alone. The \"Thor\" we find in \"Dark\nWorld\" suffers from many of the same weaknesses and limitations that\nhumans do, leaving us wondering, and asking ourselves; just what is so\nspecial about this character? In the eyes of this ancient fan that did,\nindeed, follow the saga described above, not much - not much at all.\n"
"\nthis is most likely the best film i've seen all year. its jam packed\nwith action, comedy (which was a nice shock), plot twists and well\neverything we loved about the first thor film.<br><br>the writers have obviously spent a very long time getting the story\namazing cause i thought it was gonna turn out like iron man 3, have a\namazing trailer then a film that doesn't live up to that trailer but i\nwas very wrong. i found myself upset over a 'death' of a character that\ni hated! <br><br>i recommend that any who loves marvel see's this film but only if\nyou've seen thor 1 an the avengers otherwise at points in the film you\nfilm be confused what the characters are talking about\n"
"\nI vote 1/10.Because it's awful to compare other MARVEL movies:<br><br>Hulk is good ;<br><br>Iron Man 1/2/3 are great; <br><br>Captain America 1/2 and Avengers are awesome;<br><br>Thor 1/2 are BAD at Logic unreasonable (FOR ADULT).<br><br>IF this movie is for 0-12 kids,and not MARVEL presents. I will not say\nanything ,and won't recommend any friends to see it. In my\nimpressionÔºåMARVEL is a VERY GOOD Movie Maker and always surprised me.\nBut THIS,There are very serious logical problems to Make you feel\nvulgar.<br><br>There are tons of good movie on IMDb top list. IF you think this is\nMARVEL presents. Watch this just waste your time and money. I am very\ndoubt it how to get 8.0+ point on IMDb.\n"
"\nHalfway through this debacle and struggling to keep my attention from\nwandering. Oh wait I'm writing this so attention well and truly on a\nholiday.The only thing good about it is Tom Hiddlestone. He says his\nlines as though he means them and understands them.The film is\nunengaging and I find the actors unconvincing. I saw the first movie\nand it was just OK. In this one however I find Idris Elba wasted and\nunbelievable as a character. Even Anthony Hopkins seemed to have just\nturned up for the cash. Loads of special effects and CGI especially in\nthe Asgard scenes but if the story is not involving then they count for\nnothing. The female friend of Jane - can't remember her name- seems to\nhave wandered in from some teen movie and is as irritating as hell! I\njust do not care about anyone in this movie at all. As someone else\npointed out it looks as if it were put together by a committee!\n"
"\nThor: The Dark World is an awesome movie. It has great music. Some of\nthe best action scenes. Effects are mind blowing. A scene Loki and Thor\nthat takes your breath away. Loki is what makes the film.Tom Hiddleston\nplays the role as if born to. He brings something to the screen that no\none else could've. There is a good bit of comedy and emotion bouncing\nback and forth between Thor and Loki. Jane and Thor get back together\n(obviously from the picture) and Thor has been watching over her.Chris\nHemsworth has been bringing peace to the 9 realms after the great\nBattle of New York. An old power thought to be extinct threatens Jane\nand the world. watch and see the twists and turns and pain they have to\ngo to just save the world yet again.\n"
"\nI think it was an excellent and enjoyable movie, even considering the\nparts that seemed unnecessary. I say this despite not being able to\nleave a critical review but an opinion is an opinion whether or not it\nis an informed one so they all count, both the good and the bad. I\nthink the movie got a raw deal with all the other big movies that came\nout afterwards or maybe it just did not fit peoples tastes even it was\na good movie . I don't understand why people are hyping Loki, yes the\nactor that played the part did an excellent job but the actor that play\nThor also did an excellent job in how he portrayed the title character\n. I can't honestly see anyone else as Thor. I liked nearly the entire\nstory the movie told and I did not find the villain to be as lacking as\nhas been claimed by some, I just accepted him for who he was. The\nvillain make have had a different personality to differentiate him from\nhis counter part in the marvel comics.\n"
"\nEpic. Fantasy. Entertainment.<br><br>acting - 8 or 9 / 10 <br><br>visual effects, costumes, battle scenes - 10/10<br><br>story - 8 / 10 <br><br>epicness - 10/10 <br><br>creating its own fantasy world - 10/10<br><br>this is a pure entertainment film. It won't teach you about the wisdom\nof life and it won't show how difficult life can be. But what this film\ndoes good is to provide epic high-level entertainment, if you are the\ntype of person who could relate to such kind of a fantasy movie. <br><br>Chris Hemsworth is great. Natalie Portman makes a solid performance as\nusual.<br><br>Only thing I did not like was the voice effects they used on Chris who\nsounds a bit like a robot. Not necessary.\n"
"\nThe movie offers a great fictional realm (Asgard) it is so rich and\nunique, but the improper cast of the movie often remind us that it is\nfake. I'm not talking about Chris Hemsworth, Tom Hiddelson or God\nforbid Anthony Hopkins those guys are well casted and did their jobs\nwell. The story of Thor is based of the scandinavic myths and songs and\nin the movie Thor more or less acts as a viking and looks like one too\neverything in Asgard is made to mimic the Scandinavian culture or\nperception of Asgard after all thats where the sourse is from and it is\nsuch a bummer when you see that Heimdall is cast as black nothing\nagainst Idris Elba great actor but thats not how Scandinavians describe\nit in their songs thats not how it is even in the comic book sourse and\nwhat about Thour's gang one of them fights with rapier the other one is\nAsian thanks god he does not fight with nunchaku although that would\nmake more sense. But the real deal comes with the elves shooting\nbazukas and guns and some of them are black again.When last you saw an\nafro-American elf.\n"
"\nThor the Dark World had the responsibility to make a decent Thor movie\nunfortunately failed even more but is better than the first , this\nsequel back Chris Hemsworth , Natalie Portman , Tom Hiddlestom ,\nAnthony Hopkins and etc , the romance of Thor and Jane still surface\nand bland , and again a good villain was badly used , the final scene\nof the film is a little confusing , something that is not explained is\nhow Thor came to earth without the bridge that connects Asgard to other\nworlds and does not explain Thor Ragnarok will be a tremendous error\nscript, Thor the dark world has good special effects and a cool\nsoundtrack, the beginning of the film as well as the first Thor makes\nne believe that the film will be great unfortunately it is just a movie\nOK. Note 6.8\n"
"\nI think my one major issue with Thor is that he is so vapid. I'm also\nnot entirely sure that a second movie was required to tell a\nnonexistent story. If Thor had something to say or even more substance\nthen I could see the benefit in this movie. The whole thing is filled\nwith arrogant one-liners and pointless statements. There are some\nbrilliant action sequences but overall it's lacking in emotion. Even\nthe actors seem a little lacklustre and not fully committed to their\nroles. It should be better as there is so much talent in this cast but\na bad script will always hurt a movie.<br><br>I know I'm going to cope flack for this but Thor is certainly the worst\nmarvel superhero that has been turned into a movie. He's\none-dimensional and barely deserves his hero title. Watch it if you\nenjoy an action movie with no storyline cause that is exactly what\nyou'll get.\n"
"\nThor: The Dark World. Had to watch it over three days, since I kept\ngetting distracted by other things. E-mail, Facebook, coffee, BOREDOM.<br><br>Any relation between this and Norse mythology is merely in the names.\nThor could not fly; he rode a chariot. His hammer only returned to him\nif he wore magic gloves. Frigga was not Thor's mother, J√∂r√∞ was Odin's\nlove and Thor's mother. Loki was not evil, merely a particularly\nannoying practical joker and mischief maker. Odin was not a peace\nkeeper, he was a pure warmonger always willing to start a fight. Sif\nwas not a warrior, she was goddess of the harvest and grain--and blond.\nOf all the characters depicted in this movie, only Heimdall was fairly\naccurate. Natalie Portman is always pleasant to see, but her limited\nrole in this film was not enough to salvage this pathetic excuse for a\nmovie.<br><br>IMDb viewers gave this movie a 7.2, obviously because they have more\nfamiliarity with Marvel comics than Norse mythology. Very sad.\n"
"\nI was a big fan of Marvel comics when I was a kid. The stories were\nalways more sophisticated than these modern movies, so I usually feel\ndisappointed. The first \"Thor\" was probably the best of the lot, but\nsadly the sequel fails short.<br><br>This movie doesn't take itself as seriously as its predecessor. There\nare a constant stream of cheesy one-liners and occasionally one manages\nto be funny.<br><br>Thor and Loki are well played as usual, but Portman's character is just\nannoying and uneven. Her romance with Thor is about as bad as 'Star\nWars Attack of the Clones'. I don't think this is Portman's fault; I\njust don't think the producers of this movie were very ambitious.\n"
"\nI thoroughly enjoyed the first Thor. It was better than expected and\nwas not an entirely by the numbers hero movie. This one, on the other\nhand, is not only a clich√© soap opera movie, but confused as what it\nwants to be. <br><br>Half the beginning forces rom-com background music on us &amp; the other\nhalf is full of ironic quips &amp; other shenanigans that belong in a Jim\nCarrey film. <br><br>The story, villain, and connectivity to The Avengers is laughable and\nthe clich√© humanoid 60's Star Trek aliens take you out of the movie. <br><br>This should have been a home run but it's quite disappointing if\nlooking at it objectively and not as a drooling Avengers fanboy. <br><br>I admit some plot twist had me excited for moments and the acting was\nsolid. <br><br>Too much Whiny sidekick girl &amp; black swan chick but 4/10 is being\ngenerous either way.\n"
"\nHaving seen the first Thor film I knew not to expect too much - lots of\naction, plenty of nonsense, Anthony Hopkins looking a little worn,\nmoderately thin plot. All of these were delivered. Surprisingly the\nacting was not too bad at all in places, although the Darcy Lewis\ncharacter is one of the most irritating that I have had the misfortune\nto experience on screen.<br><br>There was some confusion early on as there were references made to\nevents that weren't in the first film, so I must have missed another\nThor film at some point, but I can only find one other on IMDb. This\nalso detracted from my enjoyment.<br><br>In a nutshell, after a promising start, the film nose-dived\nconsiderably, but then managed to claw its way back up from being\n\"awful\" to simply being \"mediocre\". As brainless sequels go this was a\nreasonable effort, but I won't bother watching it when it is eventually\non the telly.\n"
"\nCompared to the previous Thor, this one was just average.<br><br>Compared to any other recent avengers movies this one was not good at\nall.<br><br>If you're looking for Stiff acting, Failed joke attempts and plot holes\nthen this is the movie for you.<br><br>Special affects are OK but below par compared to other Marvell movies. <br><br>Its was nice to learn a little more of the back story of Asgard but it\nwas the Asgardian acting that made the film particularly bad.<br><br>Lots of people are talking about how the anti-hero of the story, Loki,\nis this total rebel bad-ass and compare him to other beloved villains\nlike Heath Ledge's Joker but not so. Loki's participation in the film\nis minimal.<br><br>Overall, just average, but I wish I would have picked a different\nmovies to see at the cinema.\n"
"\nIm still trying to find out which movie did everyone see. Acting is\nwell done, directing any everything is pretty good... the plot, oh the\nplot !!<br><br>1.- Predictable. 2.- Villains that nobody cares about. 3.- Love and\nkisses in the middle of catastrophes. 4.- you will forget everything\nabout this movie in less than 2 hours. 5.- Overrated<br><br>This is why movies are crap, cause they only want to see a character\n(loki) in action instead of getting a good story.<br><br>I don't know why the writers think if they put some science to movies\nits going to be a good movie.<br><br>Is not as good as they say, not as bad as you think. Watch it? yes,\njust wait till its free on TV. Meanwhile go and watch something else.\n"
"\nYes, It's unintentionally funny, stupid and overly long. Both \"Superman\nReturns\" and \"Man of Steel\" have more merit, and that's stretching\nthings! Watch it for the two hot girls and pumped up Chris. Watch it\nfor the over-the-top computer graphics. Check your brain at the door. I\ndidn't even enjoy \"Guardians of the Universe\" that much. I guess I am\nhaving SFX overload. Think of how much better even Superman III-IV\ncould have been with all these mindless explosions! I was tired after\nwatching the first hour of this mess. Everything in the last half was\ntotally predictable. Where did \"Papa Thor\" go? Back to the Smurfs? I\nthought I was watching \"Independence Day 2\" for a while. You must watch\nthe \"Easter Eggs\" between the 10 minute credits. Mind-numbing and\nstupid but great for adolescent boys who like \"manly\" women, \"WWE\" and\nall that stuff. Very redundant to the first Thor. Verdict: Thor 2 made\nmy head sore!\n"
"\nThe rating on IMDb is misleading. The movie is average 5/10 at best.\nThe plot of the movie is that Thor must fight the dark elves who use\nether as some sort of weapon. The acting is okay. Chris Hemsworth,\nNatalie Portman, Anthony Hopkins were competent in their roles. The\nstandout was Tom Hiddleston who played Loki. Kat Dennings of Two Broke\nGirls fame plays the intern is there for the comic relief. However as\nother users have mentioned, the humour is not funny but rather\nirritating. She too has an intern and he comes off as an idiot and not\nin a funny way. This movie has some amazing special effects and\nscenery, however unless the plot is of good standard, special effects\ncan only carry it so far. The action scenes with Thor are bloodless\nthanks to a pg13 rating and are not that great. This movie is worth a\nhire or wait for it to come on free to air TV.<br><br>Jackal75\n"
"\nThe Initial parts were not that interesting. But the story progressed\nin a very good way towards the end. The mega-franchise sequels is\ngetting interesting with each of the movies. Hope for more superb\nsequels for this one as this as a cliff-hanger on the mid-credit bonus\nscene at the end which will keep the audience intrigued to watch the\nnext sequel very eagerly.<br><br>The first Thor movie was not that good according to me as it looked\nlike, along with Captain America, was done in preparation for the The\nAvengers Assemble movie. But this movie story moves independently\ncontinuing from that movie with only references to it.<br><br>On the whole a great movie to watch to the fans of Mega-Marvel\nfranchise. (And also its comic book readers I guess since I would not\nknow whether they would like it as I don't read those comics myself.)\n"
"\nThe film overall has it's fair share of holy s**t moments that defy all\nlevels of credibility, even for a comic book/sci-fi/fantasy movie. That\nwhole business about the Aether winding up in Natalie Portman's body\nwas just a little too much to wrap my head around, especially after it\nwas assured that the heroes of Asgard buried it so deeply to avoid\ndetection by the Dark Elves.<br><br>Probably the best way to approach this film is to just sit back and get\ntransported between the realms of Earth and Asgard without thinking too\nmuch about it. As an actioner there's plenty of it. As a story, there's\njust too much going on with events seemingly occurring because they\nwere written that way instead of there being a rationale for them. I\nmean, one minute Thor's hand is cut off and then it's back again - wait\na minute, what!? And with the emphasis on the Dark Elves I found a lot\nof Asgard suspiciously resembling places seen before in Rivendell. If\nthere's going to be a Thor III, maybe a little more thought needs to go\ninto it.\n"
"\nWhile it still mostly on par with the first THOR, this sequel feels\nbigger while also losing a lot of the human connection which made the\nprevious one enjoyable. There are some fleeting moments of humor, but\nthere's also a lot of gloom and doom. In THOR: THE DARK WORLD, Thor has\nto save the universe (Avengers anyone?) from Malekith and the Aether.\nSure, there's some half-baked scientific explanation for all of it but\nthe end result is a little disappointing. Malekith was a cool-looking\nvillain, but not very engaging or charismatic. There were also a few\ntoo many narrative conveniences, a couple involving Loki's ability to\nimpersonate other people. Nevertheless, it was entertaining and kind of\nwhat I've come to expect from Marvel. The acting is very good, as is\nthe action and visual effects. I still don't buy Natalie Portman as a\nscientist, but oh well. This isn't Marvel's best, but Phase 2 is going\npretty good so far. If you've liked Marvel's previous entries, you\nshould like this one too.\n"
"\nHaving watched it a second time and checking out the reviews here, I'm\namazed how many people didn't like it. I thought it the strongest in\nthe Marvel Universe series after Avengers and Captain America: The\nWinter Soldier. Yes, better than Iron Man (all of them).<br><br>Casting is solid, with a great bad guy, the storyline is appropriately\nover the top, without too much attention to character development, and\nthe whole feel of the move is that of an epic myth, in a comic context.\nThose are traits of many comics, and not necessarily bad ones.<br><br>Maybe it's my interest in Nordic mythology which gives Thor the edge,\nor the astonishingly great, epic scenes in the movie. Or Loki, who is\nmostly great, as before.<br><br>Highly recommended - don't pay too much attention to reviews!\n"
"\nMarvel has made a terrible machine for earning money, and it is still\ntoday a priority at the movies. I'm not saying that they recorded a\nvery bad films, but to me they are just average (except for Iron Man\nand The Avengers). So record a movie and give a teaser to another,\nrecording another, giving a teaser for the third, and so on ... What\nconcerns the film itself, I was somewhat impressed. They're great cast\nassembled for this movie, but we know who will spend most of their time\non the big screen. Fight scenes and CGI are superb as expected, but I\nstill want something a little more than a movie. I liked Loki, who\nconfirmed his class. The effects are excellent, although I felt a\nlittle robbed Star Wars, but alright. Of course, there is a scene after\nthe credits, and then patience for a minute, if a little track you will\nsee they announced another film in the world of Marvel. The new machine\nfor printing money. DC what are you waiting for?!?!\n"
"\nThe first film was excellent; it was a great mix of humour, action and\ninteresting characters with a strong storyline in the beautiful world\nof asgard (especially in 3D) I was really looking forward to the sequel\nbut was bitterly disappointed. <br><br>Asgard and Thor's supporting characters made a very cameo appearances\nand much of the film was based on earth with Kat (Darcy Lewis), Jane\n(Natalie Portman), and Kat's love interest (who wasn't in the first\nfilm). I appreciate the inclusion of Thor's love, Jane, but the other\ntwo had too much time and I don't think are interesting enough\ncharacters.<br><br>The action scenes were short and none come anywhere near matching the\nopening fight scene with the frost giants in the first film.<br><br>Chris Hemsworth (Thor) and Tom Hiddleston (Loki) played their roles\nwell but with a weak script it wasn't enough to save it.\n"
"\nMarvel's \"Thor: The Dark World\" continues the big-screen adventures of\nThor, the Mighty Avenger, as he battles to save Earth and all the Nine\nRealms from a shadowy enemy that predates the universe itself. In the\naftermath of Marvel's \"Thor\" and \"Marvel's The Avengers,\" Thor fights\nto restore order across the cosmos...but an ancient race led by the\nvengeful Malekith returns to plunge the universe back into darkness.\nFaced with an enemy that even Odin and Asgard cannot withstand, Thor\nmust embark on his most perilous and personal journey yet, one that\nwill reunite him with Jane Foster and force him to sacrifice everything\nto save us all..\n"
"\nThis film takes place after the Avengers movie, where Dark Elves are\nreturning to our universe to destroy it. Thor and Loki must work\ntogether to stop them.<br><br>Chris Hemsworth is pretty good again as Thor. Tom Hiddelston once again\nsteals the scenes he is in as Loki. Most of the cast from the original\nmovie has returned, and put in solid performances.<br><br>The most disappointing aspect is that Christopher Eccelston plays a\nvillain that is completely forgettable. Seriously, I barely recognized\nthe guy and frankly, they could have done him as CGI and no one would\nhave noticed the difference. (Of course, his turn as Doctor Who was\nequally forgettable.) And, yes, you had a twist ending everyone should\nhave seen coming. No doubt, setting up Thor III.\n"
"\nI first like to say that I enjoyed the movie and it's a very good\nsequel to the 1st one and the Avengers. I think it's also better than\nthe first because I like the story better and there are more twists to\nthe story, the first one was pretty straight forward. This one's got\naction, drama, comedy which is all used very well and everyone that is\nsomeone have their good moments. Thing is that the alien worlds and\nspace battles made me think of the Star Wars battles, I really like\nStar Wars and I didn't really wanted to see it in this movie, that is\nwhat made me dislike it a little. And of course the use of \"epicness\"\nas in all avenger-like movies is just a little much, but I accept it\nand still enjoyed it. In the end, I will recommend it to everyone who\nenjoys a good superhero movie and I'll most likely see it again soon\nbecause I like watching movies that I like a few times.\n"
"\nThis movie improves on the last Thor film. It's nicely paced and has\nsome excellent action scenes. In its eagerness to make clear to the\naudience that this is going to be a big action movie, the early part\nhas a lot of chaotic noise to it, which is perhaps why the first scene\nI really liked was a peaceful one in an abandoned building. <br><br>Once the movie caught me interest I stayed caught. The story is\ncoherent without any instantly noticeable plot holes, which is about as\nmuch as you can hope for from the typical superhero movie, and there\nare some nice surprises and some good WOAH moments. Performances were\ngood.<br><br>It's certainly formulaic, but it uses that formula well.\n"
"\nIt is good to see the Norse mythology come to life via Marvel comics. I\nstill love the imagery of Asgard and Jotunheim and the other -heims and\n-gards. I really liked the look and feel of Heimdall, Loki, Thor, Odin\nand Frigga, even though I always imagined it as just a big wooden hall,\nnot a high tech palace.<br><br>The acting is mostly fine. The action is relentless. I still don't\nunderstand what actually happened - some ancient enemies were defeated\nbut they came back and wielded phenomenal cosmic power and had some\nawesome space ships and shot lasers at the Norse Gods who fired their\nlasers back. Why do they even have swords? Oh well.<br><br>It was fun. Just don't think too hard.\n"
"\nAlthough Thor, the namesake of the movie series, is masculinity\nincarnate; there is little doubt that the audience is not really\nimpressed by the hammer brandishing deity - likely because Thor pales\nin comparison whenever the arch villain Loki makes an appearance.\nPerhaps one should congratulate Marvel on the success of creating this\ncharismatic evil character who even dominates The Avengers, not to\nmention the spawning of countless fanfiction and secondary creation.\nMarvel needs to work on the storyline as it is stretching thin, what is\nthe remote probability of all this new dark energy targeting Thor's\nladylove as a host, out of zillions of beings to choose from the vast\nuniverse with the nine realms? The plot feels flimsy to begin with, and\nthough the brilliant coup and contracoup actions by the brothers near\nthe end are exciting, the actual final scene is an inevitable\nanticlimax and seems like child's play. The only solace being the hint\nof yet another sequel - with our favorite villain it, of course.\n"
"\nIt is a good movie,lots of cool action and great special effects. I\nfind the story slightly weak but that may be just me. This movie is\nfilled with talented actors but the dialog and script aren't exactly\nthe best. I felt it was a bit cheesy at times, especially with the\nconvergence mumbo jumbo, but again that is just my opinion. I think\neveryone just watched this movie for Loki but he seemed like a big plot\nhole in the end. If you have some time to kill this movie will do it\nfor you, it's not bad but I don't think it's that great either, if you\nreally want to see a good movie,find another Marvel movie like Avengers\nor the new Xmen to watch it will be much better!\n"
"\nI really enjoyed this movie, although it was a bit over the top. But\nthat's what sold the film for me. The effects and lighting set the\nperfect back drop and mood. Some of the best parts were worked into the\neffects as well.....like Thor flying to the scene and holding his arm\nup waiting for the hammer......some of the space scenes .....I also\nthought the fight scenes were realistic for this film and done well.\nThe anger that turns to rage seem logical and acted well. The costumes\nfit the characters and were done very well. Loki and Thor really sold\nthe action for me. Driving in the space mobile through\npeople.....trees.....buildings......great stuff. I wasn't too sure\nabout this movie before watching it, but I thought it was exciting and\naction packed and a wonderful use of effects/CGI. I'd recommend this to\nfans of this genre and almost anyone else. They may be as surprised and\nhappy you did.\n"
"\nThe plot isn't anything mind blowing, and like most superhero movies,\nthe dialogue was incredibly cheesy and it made me cringe at times. I\ndon't know if it was just Natalie Portman's acting or Jane's character,\nbut her vulnerability annoyed the heck out of me. She was just a really\nflat character. <br><br>I give it a 5 because of Loki. First of all, Tom Hiddleston IS an\namazing actor. Second, Loki himself is three-dimensional,\nunpredictable, and advanced character, and I am so intrigued because he\nis so DIFFERENT from other Marvel villains. I feel like the movie\nreally revolves around him rather than Thor. <br><br>Overall, it did exceed my expectations because I thought Thor, the\nfirst movie, was terrible and The Dark World was a little better.\n"
"\nGood action fodder, I enjoyed it. I was perturbed that there was no\ntranslation available on my disk for the Black Elves speech. We had to\nguess what they were saying. I was wondering if this was only the\nrental disk I was using, if so, that's a mean way to treat your\naudience for renting and not buying. I am hoping the future movies have\na lil more plot, maybe some deeper character builds. This movie seemed\na bit rushed, like a lot was left on the cutting room floor. (Directors\ncut probably). The Black Elves were interesting, but there was no\nsubstance to them, they could have been any bad guy. Their costumes\nwere cool, but again, they never got interesting, and no subtitles\nforcing the audience to guess their words made it worse.\n"
"\nThey have 3 long scenes that are 85%-100% copied from other films and I\nam surprised not many people aware of this: 1. Natalie Portman found an\nabandoned building where some kids playing with mystical portals &gt;&gt;&gt;\nCopy from \"Beyond\", the mini story in The Animatrix (2003 Animated\nbackstory of Martix). It has a highly similar scene and concept.<br><br>2. Dark Elves' s spaceship clashes into the palace of Ascard to assault\n&gt;&gt;&gt; 99% similar animated scenes you can find on the trailer of star\nWars videos game, The Old Republic(2011), which Siths' s spaceship\nclashes into Jedi's Temple to assault.<br><br>3. The ending battle scene which Thor and Malekith fighting in\ndifferent spaces thru portals &gt;&gt;&gt; Apparently copied from the fighting\nscene of Jumper(2008).\n"
"\n'Thor -The Dark World'- here comes Thor again with his banging thunder\nhammer to bash the evil forces, but this time its Jane Foster who have\nsome extra role to do in this plot rather just being Thor's lady love,\nits fight between Asgard and Svartalfheim(The Dark World) which\ngradually extend to Earth and ends up in Greenwich, but this flick\nprovides you many hilarious and wow moments like Erik Selvig running\nnude around Stonehenge, Darcy's insane act, Loki turning to be the\ncaptain America with help of his illusion etc. this time you find Loki\nbeing a good guy helping his bro, but at last you surely be confused to\njudge what actually he is, overall this is a fine flick that has good\nstoryline revolving around Aether, you see Thor fighting back to save\nthe universe but this time against Malekith, overall it's a good\nmaking.\n"
"\nThor: The Dark World was superfluous movie. I watched it merely to\ncontinue advancing the plots of all of the Marvel films, so that I will\nnot be behind for the highly anticipated Avengers 2. Once again, Jane\nFoster (Natalie Portman), an ordinary denizen finds herself in the\nmidst of an intergalactic crisis. The improbabilities continue as she\nmiraculous seems to have all answers to all of the perilous situations\nthat she winds up in.<br><br>The biggest highlight of the film was Tom Hiddleston's portrayal of the\never-charismatic Loki. Time and time again, I asked myself where were\nall of the other avengers and superheroes that exist in that universe.\nAs with all Marvel films, there were two \"secret\" endings during the\ncredits, which was a delight and an enigma together.\n"
"\nOkay, so another Marvel comic flick. The sequel of 2011 Thor movie and\nthe avengers. Would serve as a prequel to next Avengers movie. A\nsuper-hero movie about the demi-god, his brother Loki, his father Odin\nand the Asgardians. And yes, the audience get to see Jane (played by\nPortman), doctor Selvig and friends from London. The movie contains lot\nof special effects that are good esp. the fight scene at the climax.\nLoki was better among the main characters in this movie, while others\nhere are bad. The villain Kurse was cool. All the other characters are\nso much under-developed and superficial. The script could've been way\nbetter. The teleport scene was a disappointment. Except for CGI, I\ndisliked the entire movie. Still watchable just once, if you are a\ndie-hard marvel comic fan.\n"
"\nI just want to echo the sentiments of many here... this movie is not\ngood. I loved the first Thor, it was methodical, developed the\ncharacters and dosed out the power of Thor and his foes in small and\nvery impressive bites. This leaves you with a healthy understanding of\njust how powerful and dangerous this fictitious world is.<br><br>This film dispenses with any sort of sense and throws a ton of visual\neffects at you hoping you'll be blinded enough to overlook the shoddy\nscript. It didn't work :/. The story gives no depth to any characters,\nand the only saving grace is it didn't really weaken any established\ncharacters from the first film. I don't require much in the way of\nthought provoking content, but give me something. Action for action's\nsake is played... and so is the Thor title if they don't turn it\naround.\n"
"\nI begin by saying in a simple line, this sequel was just okay for me. I\ndid not find any awesomeness in it or any mind blowing scenes. The\nfirst movie was quite interested me because of a new actor, new\nsuperhero character and the birth of the new franchise from Marvel\nstudio. All together with a mythical Greek character in a modern world,\nit was something that hit me. Just a few months back, I praised\nHemsworth for his best ever performance in the biographical picture\n'Rush'. Here he has fallen back to okay kinda performance. The movie\nwas nothing special, but a decent entertainment. Technically, it was\nrich in visuals with good graphics, no one must dare to doubt it. My\nproblem was the story which followed the usual fantasy movie protocol.\nOne of the disappointment from 2013, completely a commercial purpose\nbehind its creation and production. Yeah, all the movie are but this\none is very much visible. So in my opinion, it is one time watch movie.<br><br>6.5/10\n"
"\nYes, there are loopholes, like why don't the Asgardians fight with\nbetter technology than swords, since they have other fantastical\ntechnology, but other than that and one out-there moment when the\nportal throws a cell phone into the most unlikely of moments, this was\nso much fun. It even managed to keep too much silliness from happening\nin the romance department, which was a bonus.<br><br>Great special effects, loved the new angel of old mythology meets\ntechnology, meets other worlds, meets star wars, meets flaky human\nexistence. Great movie! If you love loads of action, the fantastic\nLoki, a great cast and good storytelling, I would totally recommend\nthis.\n"
"\nWhen Thor's love interest gets cursed with a powerful object, Thor must\nprotect her before an army and its ruthless leader try to get their\nhands on it to take over the remains of Earth.<br><br>The strong points of this film are the continuing development of Loki\nas a villain (and perhaps a hero), Stellan Skarsgard, and Kat Dennings.\nThe weak points are the over use of CGI, the use of Natalie Portman and\nthe general way that Thor does not seem to fit in with the rest of the\nMarvel universe (even with the vague connection to \"Guardians of the\nGalaxy\").<br><br>Not that this was a bad film, but it was probably the weakest in the\nseries thus far, and there should be no surprise if we never see a\n\"Thor III\".\n"
"\nWhile this is a continuation and some people might eventually get fed\nup with all the superhero movies, this really is a nice follow up, not\nonly to the Avengers, but especially to the first Thor. Whereas you had\nThor as fish out of water in that one, this time around someone else\ntakes over that department.<br><br>It's also very nice to see Natalie Portman back again, her missing out\non the Avengers. There is always some reason why the other Avengers are\nnot present and I guess you could question that, but you would take a\nlot from your own movie watching experience if you did. Plus you have\nenough on your plate here (or on your screen to be exact), that holds\nyour attention. The mood and the fine line this walks (fantasy and\ncomedy) continues, even though the reigns were handed from Branagh to a\nGame of Thrones director. Good choice it seems ...\n"
"\nThor The Dark World was a thrilling sequel that takes you into space\nand all nine realms.<br><br>This movie is intense, and makes you have all different emotions.<br><br>Chirs Hemsworth who played \"Thor\" is such an awesome character that is\nvery wise and very strong. I thought that Natalie Portman who played\n\"Jane Foster\" did better in this movie than the first one because she\nwas cooler and tougher. Tom Hiddleston who played \"Loki\" he can be\ndramatic, funny, and mean. He has some great personalities. Christopher\nEccleston who played \"Malekith\" was one of the toughest super villains\nin the \"Marvel Cinematic Universe Phase 2\" so far. He was unstoppable\ncompared to Loki.<br><br>I thought that Brian Tyler did a great job of making \"Thor The Dark\nWorld\" soundtrack and it's themes, it sounded beautiful.<br><br>This movie should've been the beginning of the \"Marvel Cinematic\nUniverse Phase 2\", because \"Iron Man 3\" SUCKED, big time!!\n"
"\nThor: The Dark World<br><br>The upside to being the God of Thunder is that you have a solid excuse\nevery time you fart.<br><br>Thankfully, the fair-haired deity in this action movie isn't passing\ngas.<br><br>When a cosmic event creates porticos between realms, Thor's (Chris\nHemsworth) girlfriend Jane (Natalie Portman) travels through one portal\nand ends up being contaminated by an ancient weapon.<br><br>Jane's contagion awakenings a Dark Elf (Christopher Eccleston) who\nwants to use her ailment to bring about the elves evil empire.<br><br>To prevent this, Thor must collaborate with his greatest enemy - his\nincarcerated half- brother Loki (Tom Hiddleston).<br><br>And it's solely that brotherly interplay that makes this sequel\nacceptable.<br><br>While all the exciting elements of the original are present, Dark World\nlacks a villain with enough oomph to save a simplistic script that\nfails to venture beyond its comic book derivation.<br><br>Incidentally, the Mighty Thor is the ideal Halloween costume for Jesus. <br><br>Yellow Light<br><br>vidiotreviews.blogspot.ca\n"
"\nDoesn't disappoint this film. Enjoyed the first film and this sequel\nwas a good progression on the first. The lead actors fit well into\ntheir roles, and we are on another adventure that crosses the fantasy\nworld with ours.<br><br>Park your disbelief at home, and sit back as our intrepid hero tries to\nhelp his earthly girlfriend who happens to be possessed by some force\nwhilst some fantasy elves fight to steal it.<br><br>The returning Loki steals the film with the best lines and acting, but\nthe others are more than capable in their roles. Action scenes are bold\nand fun without being over-long, and the settings are wonderful to\nview.<br><br>Give it a try you'll much enjoy this second slice of Thor.\n"
"\nDisney might think this film made more money than Thor 1 because of\nit's synergy with the other Marvel superhero films and while that might\nbe true to a certain extent I think it's probably because Thor 2 is\nsimply a much better film than Thor 1. What it does have in common with\nthe Avengers e.g. is an excellent balance of humor, action, effects and\ndrama. We have arrived at a point where VFX can't hardly improve\nanymore but in The Dark World they pulled out all the stops: we get\ngorgeous vistas, battles and large scale destruction effects and not a\nsingle shot looks fake. Chris Hemsworth also seems to be getting more\nfamiliar with his character as his performance has certainly improved.\nI was getting pretty sick of superhero movies but I'm glad to say this\none has restored my faith (partially). For me The Dark World is\ncertainly better than any of the Iron Man films. Recommended!\n"
"\nThor : The Dark World is a must see movie. It gave me hope in Marvel\nStudios after the disappointment I have seen in The Wolverine and Iron\nMan 3. Amazing movie , excellent story , great action and good slight\nof Comedy. The cast was amazing. Chris Hemsworth is THOR , no one could\nhave done it better and he is actually much better than in Part One.\nTom Hiddleston ( Loki ) was simply amazing and without him the movie\nwouldn't make it. He makes the villain someone you want to be which is\nrare. Heimdall ( Idris Elba ) was more involved than he was in part one\nwhich I liked it. If you haven't seen it yet then wait till the end or\ntill they sent you out of the cinema cause there is too more scenes ,\none of them is worth seeing.<br><br>Again LOKI was amazing with him expect the unexpected :) , you gonna\nlove him.\n"
"\nNot directed by Kenneth Branagh, \"Thor: The Dark World\", seems to\nsuffer for it. The problem which really made the movie turgid was awful\nover- usage of of sitcom 1-liner humor trying to play off as wit.\nRather there at least a dozen \"joke\" lines that are feeble,\nunimaginative, and make you wonder if you're watching a super-hero\nmovie or a Thursday night made-for- TV outing. I don't understand how\nthis kind of script gets green-lit, devoid of intelligence or editing.\nThe other issue for me is the dull yacking of characters for about the\nfirst 30 min of the movie - GET ON WITH IT filmmakers - stop trying to\ndescribe a movie through dialog - show it happening! Looking past\nthese, the movie starts to take off finally for the 2nd 2/3 of runtime.\nIt does not have the focus, soundtrack, wit, and direction of it's\npredecessor. Give it about a 6.5/10 closer to a 6 maybe. Could've been\nmuch better.\n"
"\nThe Dark Elves have blasters and space ships? Asgard is ringed by\nanti-aircraft guns?<br><br>what?<br><br>Marvel jumped the shark on this one. Oh &amp; the story is uninteresting,\nuninspired, and lame. I used to be a big fan of Natalie Portman, but\nshe's just crapping thru another role that could have gone to any\nactress.<br><br>the only bright spot is Kat Denning. she makes a better Jane Foster &amp;\ncan at least emote. Natalie apparently left all her acting talent on\nLeon The Professional.<br><br>try harder Marvel to make a good movie. This one stinks.<br><br>wait until this POS is on free TV &amp; refuse to spend money on crummy\nmovies.\n"
"\nI overall enjoyed the movie.<br><br>I loved when they showed Loki broken down due to the death that went\nalong with it. The scene with the funeral was beautifully done, as\nwell. I also was really caught off guard when they cut off Thor's hand,\nit was such a good surprise, even though it was a bad thing. There was\nstill a good flow to the movie.<br><br>But, there were a few things I didn't care for too much in the movie.\nFor Example, the beginning of the movie and middle of the movie was a\nbit slow. The action of the movie didn't really start till then end. It\ntook a while to pick up, which wasn't what I was expecting. There also\nwere some scenes that I felt weren't necessary that were in the movie.\nThe last thing I was disappointed with was my favorite line in the\ntrailers was not in the movie.<br><br>I still loved the movie and would recommend it to anyone who is curious\nabout Thor.\n"
"\nthe movie was OK and i wish i did not pay $13:50 to see it but i needed\nto kill time and since i liked Thor since it aired back in the 70's at\n3pm weekdays after school along with iron man, the hulk, and spider\nman. but i was let down i don't understand who gave this over 7 it is a\n6.5 maybe 6.7 at best. i guess i just expect more from a superhero\nmovie especially after seeing the dark knight, iron man, man of steel,\netc. i would wait for it to come out on DVD, and i wouldn't spend the\nextra cash for blue-ray. but don't get me wrong its not bad, but it's\nalso not good enough, and the extra endings after the credits is\ngetting real tired, real quick. i guess it'll piece itself altogether\none the infinity gauntlet is together and probably a nice set up for\navengers 2.\n"
"\nI was hoping that the second installment of Thor might be memorable,\nwell it wasn't. This movie(and all of the rest of the Marvel trailers I\nsaw) suffers from superhero saturation. Let's just face it how many\ntimes can an alien being destroy a city, put the hero and his friends\nin jeopardy before you just get tired. This is the problem with Thor,\nyou just get tired while watching it. Thor just isn't drawn in this\ninstallment interesting enough. He was a great fish out of water in the\nfirst movie, a egoist brought down by kindness and guilt. In this movie\nhe's just sad and mopey. It doesn't help that his lady love is silly\nand not very supportive. Jane Foster is window dressing instead of\npartner. Yes Loki steals the scenes, but in the end it's all for\nnothing but another chance to do it all again.\n"
"\nDon't really know what to say. I went in with great expectations and\naround half way in, the movie exceeded all of them. But at the end I\nfelt like something big was missing. <br><br>The movie starts of quite dull and boring. And around half way out\nreally picks up but the end again wasn't as good as I wanted. The\nvillain is also rubbish. <br><br>I am a massive superhero fan. But Thor 2 wasn't that great. Loki was\nthe only character that was actually interesting and hilarious. There\nwas some good action sequences but I wont ruin anything. <br><br>So go and watch the movie but don't expect something amazing it was\nlike the amazing Spider-Man all over again (but not as bad)\n"
"\nThese Marvel movies just keep getting better. The one, and only thing I\nnoticed though is the lack of cross over tie in product placement that\nwe have been seeing from the other movies in the franchise. Sure there\nare a couple of mentions, and a few guest cameos, but there were no\nlogos, not a bad thing actually, I am bringing this up because I think\nit is a good factor that makes this a better movie. You are not given a\nmovie that is just a walking toy ad like Transformers movies are, or\nthat last The WolverineÔªø movie(which was good, but the cross-branding\nwas just too much I think). I really Enjoyed this movie even though\nthree stops in the tube would have taken more then the 6 or so minutes\nthat Thor was expected to be keeping Malekith busy. Or the fact that\nthey all have to walk, or run across the Rainbow bridge, which should\ntake a week the thing is so long. However you don't need me to\nrecommend this movie, you will see it, and you will get a great ride\nout of it, that you can count on.\n"
"\nI watched it in premiere in Belgium. As they only showed it in 3d I can\nsay. Don't go to the 3d version. The quality is bad. Some frames are\nnot sharp at all. And you miss a part of the story. As the plot and\nmovie itself I am not saying it is bad. But some solutions are just\nstupid. I like Marvel a lot but in this movie I am missing the feeling\nof the Marvel universe. Just to say 1 thing. If you have an army as\nstrong like in the Avengers , why is Thor fighting them alone. Why is\niron man not helping, Captain America or even the hulk. The army was\nthere to shoot at the spaceship. So there are gaps in the story and the\n3d version sucked to make a final opinion on the movie.\n"
"\nThor: the dark world, is a film that, when I walked into the cinema, I\nhad very high expectations of because the first one was very good, I\nwas not disappointed and the viewer won't be either. The film has a\nvery good beginning as within only ten minutes of the film starting the\ncharacter of Thor, played by Chris Hemsworth, is introduced to the\naudience just after (spoiler) a circular storm occurs, pouring over\nJane Foster (Natalie Portman), Ian Boothby (Jonathon Howard) and Darcy\nLewis (Kat Dennings), this is then followed by some mild violence and\nthe action gets better from then onwards. It is extremely gripping and\nfast paced throughout the whole film, there is never a quite moment.\n(spoiler) There is even a small appearance from the much loved Marvel\ncharacter, Captain America, only small but it is a cool moment that\nreminds you that this isn't just any old film, this is a Marvel film. I\nreally enjoyed this film and I would definitely recommend it to anyone.\nThe ending of this film makes you very excited for the next instalment\nof the Thor films.\n"
"\nThor has to stop the evil dark elves from getting the energy that Jane\nhas accidentally hosted in her body in order to prevent them from\nturning the world into darkness. The second Thor movie isn't like the\nfirst one, but it is entertaining. Two things that bothered me: -you\nhave to have watched the avengers before you watch the movie.\nFortunatelly I did, but for someone who hasn't, it will be annoying as\nthey are brought up frequently and some of parts of the story are\nconnected to the avengers movie, like Loki's imprisonment. -the first\npart of the movie is a little shaky, as the plot tries to get to the\npoint. So we have Jane in London, waiting for Thor to come and Thor\ntrying to find a way to go back to her. In other ways the movie is\nquite entertaining and enjoyable. I even started to like Loki, but the\nend kind of spoiled that. That said the plot was a little complicated\nbut I guess it wasn't that bad. So I give Thor a 6 out of 10.\n"
"\nAction &amp; Effects, those two things are really what there is most of in\nthis film, there are some great scenes and fun moments, but it is best\nwhen everything is being hammered or shot to smithereens.<br><br>When the story was only on earth and a bit in Asgard it worked better,\nall these worlds that collide and align, I don't know I think the story\nin this is a bit vague, there are some good parts with the scientist\nand their discoveries in London, but other then that it is all about\nthe action and effects.<br><br>I was entertained, but it was missing some story, see it for the\naction, the effects and for the women maybe the body of Thor :)\n"
"\nHaving been estranged from Thor for two years,Jane goes in search of\nhim and gets a dark matter Ether into her body.Thor takes her to Asgard\nand Odin realizes what a threat she could pose to the safety of all his\nrealms should the ether ever fall into wrong hands.So he decides to\noffer her a safe haven in Asgard--due to the lack of an expedient cure\nto extricate the ether from her.Thor's mother dies trying to protect\nJane from Malekith who is after Ether--yearning for vengeance,Loki\njoins forces with Thor.They cart her away to a secret mountainous\nhideout to where they are followed by Malekith and his troops.Ether is\ntaken and Loki dies in the ensuing battle. Jane and Thor make their way\nto protect the realms from Malekith grown powerful from the Ether. Once\nevery 5000years, all the nine realms align and Malekith aspires to\nseize the fiefdom from Odin.Jane and Thor frustrate his endeavors in\ntime--killing Malekith. Thor refuses his father's offer of kingship and\ngoes back to Jane. Miraculously, Odin turns to Loki--leaving a lot of\nthe imagination of the viewer.\n"
"\nThor The Dark World is good. Definitely an improvement to the first\none. It had more action, its storyline was more interesting and the\nspecial effects were great. Marvel did a good job again on making\nmovies. The storyline was interesting because of the new characters and\nthe new worlds.<br><br>It also gave us some new characters that are likable in a way. Another\nthing I liked in this movie is that it'll make you hyped from its\ncoolness. Yes, there may be boring parts but those only takes a while.<br><br>In conclusion, Thor The Dark World is good. It was such a satisfying\nmovie. Now, I really can't wait its next sequel Thor Ragnarok.\n"
"\nso in Thor the dark world the dark elves lead by malekith want to take\nover the 9 realms with an infinity stone known as the ether. the\nlocation on earth primarily england provides a different view on the\nworld and that the world knows about Thor and most likely the other\navengers. tom hiddleston and Chris hemesworth do a awesome job as\nbrother-brother. Loki's mind tricks are also seen a lot more. hemdal is\njust amazing taking down that INVISIBLE plane. Odin is helpful in\nexplaining what are the infinity stones and who are the dark elves. but\nhold on a second what happened to Odin. Loki's now on the thrown of\nAsgard and lucky for him hemdal hasn't alerted Thor who is now living\non earth with Jane. the collector also makes a post credit appearance\nand so does Adam warlock in his cocoon. the collector wants the\ninfinity stones so that thanos wont destroy the universe and all the\ninteresting life. it confused me until i saw it the second time and saw\nhow great this movie is.\n"
"\nFew months ago.. the President of America was kidnapped.. and now\nLondon is destroyed.. I wonder..where the h#ll is Captain America and\nthe Strategic Homeland Intervention Enforcement and Logistics\nDepartment.? I believe Thor is protecting all the nine realms..i wish\nS.H.I.E.L.D would 'guard' at least one.. Saw Thor -The dark world..\ngood work Alan Taylor..successfully continued the time-line after\nKenneth Branagh and Joss Whedon.. Thor was really desperate to take\nLoki with him..and in Svartalfheim the most iconic villain in MCU meets\nhis redemption.. excellent job by Chris Hemsworth and Tom Hiddleston..\nI do believe before the universe there was darkness and it has\nSurvived. I hope it survives till the next Convergence. its a Marvel\nmovie, at-least one important characters have to be sacrificed of\ncourse.. For now the nine realms are safe and In Thor We Trust!\n"
"\nThis is again like the previous chapter too downrated. Want to remind\nthat more than a superhero movie, The dark world seems a space-fantasy\nmovie. This movie has much action, though I somehow managed to get\nbored at the end. The fact is that, just as Guardians of the galaxy,\nmarvel space sci-fi overuses energy flares, beams and such... and that\nat the very end gets kinda annoying to me. Still, Thor: the dark world\nhas enough humor, story, and good plot/action to overlook at this\nslight problem... I want to note down that toward the beginning we have\na series of events that reminds deeply of the phenomenas described in\nthe novel 'Roadside picnic' of the strugackij brothers, the original\nstory that inspired Tarkovskij's eternal sci-fi classic, Stalker;\ntherefore I really appreciated that maybe unwanted reference. Score is\ndifferent than the first one, and I didn't like it that much. Overall,\nI liked the movie, not so much like other stuff, this is not at all a\ndeep science fiction.\n"
