i was really excited to see this movie when i saw the trailer because i thought it looked hilarious and im a huge fan of jason sudeikis and i absolutely adore jennifer aniston and i can guarantee that it does not disappoint
it was actually better than i was expecting it to be because you dont usually expect much from drug dealing comedies
the plot in this was actually pretty clever and to be honest will poulters character kenny really makes the entire movie
he played it so well and he was perfectly awkward and strange it was hilarious
it was definitely one of the best comedies ive seen in a while
sure it did have some corny moments that are unrealistic but i overall enjoyed the movie
went to hate it left loving it
great funny real movie
starts and ends like everyone movie you know it from the beginning but the laughs and the experiences this gang faces is well don
not over the top  just laughs and a somewhat sentimental story
not sure why all the bad reviews went in with an opened mind and walked out laughing and talking with friends about how much we enjoyed it
i encourage anyone in the edge to go catch this film
good for jen and good for jason more daughter and this would be great
kenny almost stole the show
man has no heart finds family and gains one
worth watching do it
were the millers is going to make you laugh
the movie is more hilarious than you would think
you will be surprise how creative some of those stupid funny and ridiculous scenes are
the girls are doing a great job
emma roberts as an angry teen with a big mouth and jennifer aniston as a sexy stripper with mother instincts
loved the stripper scenes with jennifer who looks as hot as ever
kenny will poulteris just so perfect for the part of virgin sweet teenage guy and of course jason sudeikis as david  the drug dealer  is the one and only who can pull that character as good as he did
the millers are just the perfect family
they picked just the right people for this comedy
you can expect dirty funny sexy ridiculous
just go and see it so you can have a good summer laugh
its supposed to be a funny summer movie and it is
it delivers laugh out loud jokes with lots of sexual undertones and overtones
the story line is set up for an off beat road movie pick up a smidge of mary jane south of the border down mexico way and return it to denver to pay off a debt to the drug dealer
jason sedakis is the drug dealer
he assembles a unlikely cast of characters as an ersatz family and off they go to mexico
jennifer anniston plays a stripper recruited to be the mom and of course she ends up in various situations wearing skimpy costumes and making penis jokes
what more could you possibly want
the other family members are a nerdy boy and a homeless girl
both of them are hilarious for different reasons the nebbish kid is sincere honest and of course a willing dupe for all of the drug dealers schemes
tension is added to the film by the appearance of a drug dealer who has been tricked into allowing his product to be sold to the wrong dealer and a dea agent and family that the millers happen to befriend
normally i stay away from drug related films as i dont understand it all too much
but seeing as the film had jason sudeikis and jennifer aniston in i thought id give it ago
i was surprised to say the least and impressed because it wasnt what i thought
will poulter created a perfect socially awkward kenny miller and jason sudeikis really kicked it up a gear
i found it hilarious from start to finish as the plot unveiled the storyline became clearer
it was honestly a great movie and i found myself laughing 85 of the time with a great cast but simple enough storyline the film delivered on many levels
must see movie even if you just watch jennifer aniston
this movie had a lot of very great actors and actresses who is so funny i almost laughed my as off spoileralert i personally think the funniest moment was in the wan when they listened to waterfalls and kenny will poutler rap along with the music spoilerover
this movie is defiantly one i can watch again and again
take my advice and watch it if you havent already watched it
jennifer aniston showed some really great and funny acting with the whole maybe spoileralert striper thing spoilerover and the whole concept of the movie is just plane genius the way it takes all these different kind off problems and just stack them on top of each other is awesome
this movie is kind of in that category that cant be said or written with words you know hopefully
i think that this movie is something you shouldnt live without havent seen hope im not being to dramatic so see it
have a good time watching this movie says idalt3
definitely a film which belongs under the must watch section
so funny had me in stitches its wittyclever funny excitable
if you love comedy films then this is just the film for you
a well matched  unmatched family forced to do something to keep their heads a float
great name for a great film
seen this so many times now
just cant stop watching it
it has just become one of my favourite films of all time
perfect for any audience over the age of say 15 due to the drug nature in this film
anything with jennifer aniston is worth a watch in my eyes even if it was rubbish which it wasnt
10 out of 10 from me
as previously described so dumb yet so funny i agree completely
you will be surprised about how much you will laugh at this real film
its a bit like real life in so many ways but so funnier
this movie was hilarious
me and my fianca think it is a great family movie especially if you like to smile and giggle a little bit
it has a weird twist to it but it is very funny
i think every one should watch this movie
give it a shot and watch it it will definitely make you cackle
hope you like it as much as we did
me and my boyfriend look for movies on imdb
com that are rated but we both like romantic comedies
so the true love stories are my favorites
this movie is kind of a weird way to say you begin to love someone but it is totally worth the watch or at least that is what i would say
so dont wait a minute longer watch this movie and see what you think of it
for all jennifer aniston fans out there here is an amazing comedy drama movie with a great storyline
the direction is amazing as it character development is at a proper pace
a drug dealer makes a fake family to transfer drugs from mexico all the way to his hometown
it is one of those movies which make you feel delighted
for people who loved friends there is a surprise at the end of movie
but do watch the whole movie before jumping to the end
it is amazing to see that jennifer aniston despite being over 45 is still amazingly gorgeous
it is one of her most popular movies and is one of those movies where she plays a leading role unlike horrible bosses
were the millers was a surprisingly fun and funny movie
small time pot dealer played by jason sudeikis is robbed of the money he owes to his supplier so to pay off the debt the goofy and eccentric supplier sends him on a big time smuggling deal into mexico
as cover sudeikis convinces stripperneighbor rose jennifer aniston to pose as his wife runaway casey emma roberts as their daughter and young neighbor kenny will poulter as their son and together they become the uberamerican family the millers
naturally the situations and people they run into going and returning ensure nothing goes according to plan
there were lots of chuckleoutloud moments not so many full blown belly laughs and it moved along at a pretty fast clip
the performances were all outstanding especially sudeikis
loved watching him
parents some sexually suggestive scenes wont be appropriate for kids or youll have some splainin to do
all in all a real fun film
what can you say about a film that has jennifer aniston doning lingerie and showing off that magnificent body
not only is she amazing her comedic talent is down right raunchy and funny from the get go
the plot of this film is generic as it is drug deals gone wrong but the comedic performances of aniston sudekis poulter and roberts just makes the entire ensemble fascinating
i dont think i laughed that hard in quite awhile
ed helms brings a funny bad guy overture and the storyline of running into other campers is just hilarious as the dialouge moves between them
if you want a comedic relief and a couple hours of non stop laughter then this is the film for you
david burke jason sudeikis is a smalltime pot dealer whose client includes chefs and soccer moms but no kidsafter all he has his scruples
so what could go wrong
plenty
preferring to keep a low profile for obvious reasons he learns the hard way that no good deed goes unpunished when he tries to help out some local teens and winds up getting jumped by a trio of gutter punks
stealing his stash and his cash they leave him in major debt to his supplier brad ed helms
in order to wipe the slate cleanand maintain a clean bill of healthdavid must now become a bigtime drug smuggler by bringing brads latest shipment in from mexico
twisting the arms of his neighbors cynical stripper rose jennifer aniston and wannabe customer kenny will poulter and the tattedandpierced streetwise teen casey emma roberts he devises a foolproof plan
one fake wife two pretend kids and a huge shiny rv later the millers are headed south of the border for a fourth of july weekend that is sure to end with a bang
this is a really good film and it is hilariously funny plus i would like to see a were the millers 2

this movie should win the oscar for best picture
all the actors should win leading and supporting actors and actresses oscars
the director and producers should win their respective oscars
the credits should win some unspecified oscar
nick offermans mustache should win the costume design oscar
the rv should win the set design oscar
matthew willigs one eye and will poulters spiderbitten junk should cowin the makeup oscar
if were the millers was obamacare its website would work and the insurance offered would actually be affordable and everyone would have his or her own personal resident physician who would administer medical marijuana peddled from the millers rv
cant wait for the sequel we are still the millers
did i mention that we liked the movie
i love jen aniston and her work but whats happening to her career lately is a mystery to me
it is like a conspiracy to put her in the worst movies
i have seen bad tv movies that were better than this one
my goodness why did they even bother
the best word to describe it is ridiculous
i dont even know where to start with the list of bad foul language galore which these days some directors i guess think will make their movies better and use it a lot stupid dialog that will not inspire you but make you cringe the characters are the scum of society which again these days directors seem to prefer to normal people and dedicate tons of movies to stupid plot
what happened to the good old normal people movies
theres plenty of drama among them too enough for thousands of movies
hollywood i am about to drop you
you are a continuous disappointment for me as of late
not funny at all
the language was so over the top and the double entendres were not natural
i felt embarrassed for jennifer aniston and the script she had to follow
what ever happened to movies like tootsie and what about bob
movies with great acting and a great comedic script scripts with not all the filth and language
todays scripts are so riddled with bad language you cant even watch them with your children
with people like seth rogen pumping out scripts that are just filthy and not clever is what hollywood has become
im not saying some language can be used but every other sentence just isnt funny to me
it takes no acting skills to mutter filthy language scripts
this was a piece of crap and not funny at all
i enjoyed watching this movie because it was so funny
it kept me laughing from the beginning to the end
in my opinion all of the characters matched great
the plot of the story is crazy to think about and the characters made the plot even better
the characters fed off each other and seemed to make the film even more funny
i couldnt stop laughing
this film was amazing and it was spread out perfectly it made it seem like the jokes never ended
the author made the comedy pop the whole time and did a great job at making the characters match their lines
i would recommend this movie to everyone
i am hoping that they make another movie similar to this one
were the millers is a comedy that is great to pass the time  i wanted to see this movie when it has launched  and i was pleased to see in cinemas worth the ticket fun enough the cast has  jason sudeikis  jennifer aniston  a great actress of comedy  will pouter that is the best thing in the movie  hes very funny had moments he made aame laugh me enough emma roberts  the funny any less more not compromise the film ed helms  nick offerman  kathryn hahn  molly c
quinn  tomer sisley  much of this as well  those who so badly in enough to compromise the film the script is not enough to be good i found the last act too hasty  and some moments are well unnecessary  were the millers is a good comedy  very only watch to unwind a little
note 7
7
jason sudakis from saturday night live plays a pot dealer who adopts a family for smuggling trip to mexico to pay off a debt when his loot is stolen one night
jennifer aniston plays rose his stripper wife fully clothed and tanned throughout
she will do any film as long as the pay is good i guess
kenny the son always has a fixed wrinkle on his forehead nearly to the point of being mongoloid
he has the worst gags of anybody swollen genitals from a tarantula bite only the least of them
violence and profanity are overdone to the point of not being that funny
seriously the cast is too clean goodytwoshoes to resemble any of the millers they are supposed to portray
it feels like an extended episode of saturday night live and any comparison to the similar chevy chase vacation series would be an insult since those films had good characters driven to bad ends instead of the reverse
jens strip tease scene the only positive quality i can locate in the whole movie
lets say you can buy into a nearly fifty year old jennifer aniston as a stripper
maybe you can even buy a forty year old jason sudeikis as the hip drug dealer who dresses like a dave matthews fan
then you can probably buy that when they pretend to be a family their kids are almost thirty
they go from ridiculous parodies of old people trying to be cool to actual old people with very old children
i guess that makes sense in some other dimension
while the premise and plot are very thin there are some good jokes in here
theres a stripper with a tattoo over her box that says boner garage
thats comedy gold
ed helms is hilarious as usual and nick offerman is very disappointing as usual
the worst thing about this movie is the very long and totally unnecessary campground scene
it has nothing to do with the story and turned a good 90 minute comedy into a two hour test of your movie watching ability
i guess what im trying to say is that this movie is very average
if you never see it you have two hours to watch something else
if you do see it you probably wont be angry
funny story
i went to a free preview for this movie when it first came out and watched something like 30 or 40 minutes of it before walking out
the movie was boring but i gave it a real chance because it was setting up the pieces and plot and etc
then tomer sisley came on the screen as the main bad guy and he was so dull and so flat
he looked almost bored to be there in other words it was awful acting
so based mainly on the main bad guys performance i walked out
anyway fast forward to just 2 hours ago
this movie was on tv and there was literally nothing else to watch so i put it on and started watching it around the time i walk out on it 3 years earlier
the movie did get funnier and wasnt as bad as i thought it was going to be
it wasnt any good but not totally bad
im just tripping on how one awful performance can kill a movie for you
the idea behind the movie is funny enough and im sure if they do make a sequel to it theyll have a different villain
this movie is one of my favorite movies
i like it because it is really funny
my favorite part of the movie is when at the end when they buy a house and he is in the backyard watering the plants
i give this movie a 9 out of 10 because the main idea and everything is hilarious
my favorite actor is kenny he is the odd one out of the group and he does a lot of funny things
like he would be the one to get his balls bit by a big spider
also when they get stopped by the cop and they tell kenny to be the one to give what the guy wants and the cop is gay
so this movie was just a movie they if you want to laugh then you should watch it
one of my most favorite movies

was really excited to see this movie when i saw the trailer because i thought it looked hilarious and im a huge fan of jason sudeikis and i absolutely adore jennifer aniston and i can guarantee that it does not disappoint
it was actually better than i was expecting it to be because you dont usually expect much from drug dealing comedies
the plot in this was actually pretty clever and to be honest will poulters character kenny really makes the entire movie
he played it so well and he was perfectly awkward and strange it was hilarious
it was definitely one of the best comedies ive seen in a while
sure it did have some corny moments that are unrealistic but i overall enjoyed the movie
were the millers blends forms of comedy into one as the film works for several reasons
although predictable it is entertaining and some of the comedic jokes do work well
the chemistry is there as we see the cast come together as one family towards the end
what works in the movie is its offensive and raunchy comedy a type of comedy that most often just goes horribly wrong
the entire cast is simply fantastic at making the gross out stuff work and even better at delivering the site gags
sudeikis is obviously the core of the group but its poulter who steals the show as the halfwitted fake son with a heart of gold
anniston and roberts are both fine on screen
anniston as well plays her part convincingly to some extent
i was surprised how much the movie affected me
i actually walked away with a good feeling inside
were the millers balances crude humor with a legitimate good story about peoples innate need of socialization
it literally spins rv on its head
the story was actually decent and pretty well written to a certain extent
the only thing was the humor is crude
however keeping in mind who is in the movie i didnt find this surprising
i would recommend watching this with friends and maybe if they are old enough family members
i would also consider watch it on a friday night
overall a generous 6 out respect for the message and the plot
saw it on hbo not the type of movie id go to see
that said despite expectations to the contrary i rather enjoyed the movie
the fake family construct offered a lot of good comedic twists
jason sudeikis is already a comedic force to be reckoned with and has the added plus of being a naturally endearing character just like anniston
sudeikis is going to go beyond adam sandler steve carrell seth rogen
hes got leading man good looks and a brilliant comedic flair and a delivery like vince vaughn bradley cooper ben stiller and paul rudd and given the right material could go very far
and he will be able to crossover into dramatic roles as well
so even with some predictable plot turns the movie was still able to bring some originality without stretching credulity too far
i cringed at the spider scene because it is such a played out routineim surprised they dont have a retirement home for tarantulas
and the fake family dynamics was just smarmy enough to make it work and make it endearing
if i could i would give this movie a 0 out of 10
it was unbelievably stupid and had a stupid plot
a pot dealer who creates a fake family as part of his plan to move a lot of weed across countries
had the stupidest part in the history of movies  a tarantula chomping on an 18yearolds testicles and he drops his pants and shows everyone in his fake family
hardeeharhar
notice the sarcasm
actually it was disturbing to see stuff like that
i mean come on
sean anders can be funnier than this like in daddys home which is one of the funniest movies ive ever seen
actually probably the most
but this piece of crap is the worst movie of all time
do not believe when your friends tell you that this is hilarious because i can almost guarantee you will be totally disappointed with this
this is by far the worst movie i have ever seen
the idiocy and stupidity within essentially every scene of the movie gives comedy a bad name
i cant imagine this appealing to anyone over 18 with at least 1000 brain cells
the content is typical of playing to the lowest common denominator obvious sexual inferences using the f word as many times as possible drugs etc
its just not a funny movie
the content is as if four students from a high school class were assigned the task of writing a script for a movie
if this is what jennifer aniston has stooped to in order to save a career that has essentially sucked since she left friends well theres nowhere to go but up
ironically even though it is written to appeal to teenagers the content of the movie is very adult
i wouldnt let my 12 or 16 yr old daughters anywhere near this film
just watched this movie with my movie theatreworking friend
when the premise is of a drug dealer being assigned to smuggle many pounds of the stuff across mexico with a pretend family of a stripper and two homeless teens no way was this going to get a rating lower than r especially when the siblings are a boy and girl and the boy ends up kissing both his sister and mother
jason sudeikis and jennifer aniston provide plenty of laughs as the parental units along with much of the supporting cast of which includes another couple with a teen daughter of which the father is a law officer
the whole movie was both raunchy and a little heartwarming with likable characters throughout
and yes it was funny enough for me and my friend
so on that note i recommend were the millers
this is one of the funniest movies i have seen in years
initially i went out of curiosity since i live near where most of the film was shot wilmington nc
we walked down town one evening and saw jennifer anniston as she was filming the hotel lobby scene on front street
you will have a great time laughing as the plot comes together
several one liners keep coming back feeding off each other
the writers did a great job keeping us entertained from the beginning to the end
i read the other reviews and they are dead on
its not often that so many people of different ages can agree on what humor really is
dont leave the theater when the credits start remain seated for out takes
i was really looking forward to seeing this after the 7
2 rating on imdb and also being a fan of horrible bosses that had both jason sudeikis and jen anniston
im always keen for a quality mindless comedy to have a laugh and not think for a couple of hours but this just didnt do it
the script was predictable and seemed forced the jokes werent that funny apart from a few and the two lead characters were boring and annoying
js character was just annoying and not funny and ja character was tired weve seen it before many times
these guys just going through the motions
the two younger characters were pretty good but ed helms support character i just didnt buy either miscast in my opinion
i did laugh a couple of times early on in the movie but i then left about 23 through as it became hard work and i prefer to have that time enjoying some fresh air rather than waiting for the movie to end being all too aware that i was not enjoying it
wait for the dvd
we went not expecting an intelligent comedy and it wasnt but it was funny
it was laugh out loud funny
i would recommend it over the heat which felt like they forced the laughs
in this movie the situation is of course bizarre and the whole premise was dumb but who cares if it makes you laugh
they really cast the whole family well especially kenny who does a great job as the virgin dork
i never thought i would see a movie where jennifer aniston looked just right as a 40 something mother but she does in the film
ed helms was probably the only one who looked out of sorts in the movie that was a bit too much of  hey lets place a really unlikely guy in this part
we were really worried how they would have them end up together as a family without making it sappy but it was handled pretty well
and if you go stay for the outtakes especially the very last one when the family serenades one of the cast members that was fun
i cant believe how good this was  i was not expecting it to be so funny
it was kind of a hybrid between halfbaked and little miss sunshine but not exactly  shared some of the same comedic elements
entire cast was stellar and by the end of the movie you truly grow attached to them
i would like to see a sequel because i enjoyed these characters so much
there was never a dull moment in it either  pace keeps flowing with one tableturning event after another
starts off as a fake family as the movie describes but not only do we grow to care about the characters  they grow to care about each other
its not sappy at all though  its very funny and a feelgood movie
jason sudeikis and jennifer aniston play a drug dealer and exotic dancer who pose as suburban parents of teenagers to smuggle in drugs from mexico
the film includes two awkward teenagers
emma roberts and will poulter play casey and kenny
the cast is first rate and the writing is above average
i enjoy watching ed helms as the boss
luis guzman deserved better in his small role
kathryn hahn and will offernan play another couple on vacation
this vacation movie reminds me of the national lampoons vacation more so
despite them playing a family on the road they clicked well together
they take a plane from denver to tuscon and then rent a massive rv to mexico
the direction is pretty good
the film has some slow moments but its worth watching
jennifer aniston can pull off as an exotic dancer than her normal girl next door appearance
the humor in this movie is quite vulgar and simple but again adequate for the situations in which the characters are placed throughout the film
since the main and only goal is to make us laugh loudly this movie succeed ad it
in addition to the funny dialogue the main carriers of the humor in the movie are the characters themselves who are sufficiently well designed and developed to be hilarious
acting in the film is quite good
were the millers has far exceeded my expectations
the movie can be characterized as a very funny comedy that is worth your time and attention
i recommend this movie to everyone who wants a good laugh
i was impressed and happy to see that good comedy movies still exist
were the millers is a funny film with sweet warm hearted moments
it also features great performances by all the actors including jennifer aniston jason sudeikus emma stone and will poulter
the movie has a very funny script with great dialogue between all the characters
the chemistry with the cast works well too awesome casting choices here
this movie was a good surprise i didnt think it was going to be that great going into it but it was in my opinion
its definitely not for the entire family obviously a lot of frequent profanity and sexual humor but it does work well with the script and plot
the content isnt too crude or crass it works well with the movie
jennifer aniston really shined in this movie she gave the most credible and notable performance in my opinion
and the couple that the millers come into contact with had the best and funniest moments in the film
hilarious scenes with them
810 for were the millers
entertaining comedy
builds well and i liked the ending
jason s
seems to be doing an 80s bill murray type of thing and it stands out from the postirony stuff that seems to be the norm
anniston is miscast but there were lots of great cameos and smaller roles
ed helms with his orca was a highlight and scotty p was memorablehis outtakes had me wanting more
im glad there are still some rrated comedies being made that are making money because a lot of the pg ones feel too restrained
i think after this movie and wedding crashers we can consider any fisher and faber projects something to look forward too
heres hoping for more
i like dumb comedies sometime such as bad grandpa and i had high hopes for this one based on the description and some acquaintances recommendations
but unfortunately despite some funny moments early on for me the laughs were few and far between
jennifer aniston was largely wasted in her role and the casual graphic sex talk got old after a while
the highlights as another reviewer noted were the outtakes during the credits and the cute moments with kenny will poulter whose eyebrows are rather unique
too many of the supporting cast were caricatures especially the bad guys be they the killers or the one who gave sudeikis the job of bringing the drugs back to denver from mexico
the humor should come from the situations and the script not from silly overacting and mugging
not awful but it should have been funnier and about 15 minutes shorter
im not really into movies that are based on drug dealing stripping etc but i quite enjoyed this one
if you want to lay back for a little over 100minutes and not have to think too much just have a good little laugh with the family then this is the film for you
i have to admit that i like jennifer aniston in almost anything she does be it funny sometimes dull amp awkward this is one of her more comical moments
i also enjoyed kennys performance anistons adopted son he added a touch of reality teenage awkwardness amp funny bits into the film especially with the teaching him to kiss amp spider scenarios
needless to say my teenage daughters really enjoyed it a lot more than me but it was pretty good for its kind
unbelievable
really nothing works
you hear the grinding brains of the scriptwriters getting their next line out for the sake of the money
only clichas are coming out
everything is over the top criminals the camper the super boss with a orka
etc etc
it is all not funny
and the characters are phony
even when something is a comedy things got to be believable and they are not
what a waste of money and of not such a bad outline spoiled by people who did not have their day or year
it makes me so angry that people can waste my time and money
and yes it is true like other wrote about this movie
their is something sad under all this sitcom full of cynicism a bunch of people who are so failed n life
failed to be happy
to be funny
were the millers attract the interest even from the movie poster
a neighborhood drug dealer david is forced to deliver a huge amount of drugs from mexico across the borders
in order to not attract attention to himself he creates a fake family as to appear that they are on family holiday
clever idea for a movie especially of this type and very creative
its actually very funny with clever lines and great performances
even the supporting roles are very good
the story doesnt get boring all through the end and the twists are many
however sometimes the humor is a little rough but that can easily be overlooked
all in all a great film for a comedy even though the romance is a little bit weak and maybe unnecessary
this film will keep a smile on your face from start to finish
it uses the same techniques as wild hogs and the hangover films
i watched the extended version and there wasnt a scene that was wasted
the storyline flows nicely the characters are believable and all of them are well developed
combining elements of slapstick farce and wit the film never has a slow or dull spot
there is a good balance between the main characters and the acting is well above average
there will undoubtedly be sequels
even the credits contained a nicely done honor to anniston
not for the kiddies due to extensive use of profanity
rent it buy it go see it you will love it
as most people i saw the previews tough it could be funny so i rented it and i was extremely surprise that it was just so damn awesome
the concept itself aint something totally new but the actors play there character just so well you really feel for them care for them and want to see them grow together
the movie is just paced well enough to be a good balance between an adult comedy and a teen comedy sometimes you can laugh at the silly joke other time you can really relate to what those guys are going trough even tough the situation itself is something that is hardly possible
its hard to explain with words really but this movie is really among my top 10 movies of 2013 and probably in my top 3 comedies of 2013 as well
i would highly recommend it
spoilers not the funniest movie i ever saw
this movie is good but not outstanding except that you know the ending all along and are still pretty happy to see it
the ending is a reaffirmation of the love and mark of a real family and it makes this movie worth while
some might say the ending is corny but i still like it
as the movie and the comedy roll on and jennifer aniston gets to play still another woman who is not the main love focus but somehow through the plot becomes the loved one we get the affirmation we wait for
the family begins to bond to care to show they are really a very functional and unstoppable group when united
we know that its coming and we wait for it
we hope for it
it happens
the magic of hollywood takes over and we get the very functional loving family made out of people who could not have cared less about each other in the beginning
of course like other movies that do similar feel good things we get the almost obvious but still a little surprising reason they will remain a loving family at the end
this is a lighthearted and funny roadtrip movie with a fair share of laughs likable characters and strong comic performances
its almost an unique growth story of a man that has grown tired of his miserable life and finds something worth fighting for
you know where the plots going but its still fun getting there
the interaction between the four main leads is great
its a little too raunchy to be a movie for all the family and there are a few grossout moments and some of it is clichad but it does go beyond your average comedy
jennifer aniston gives a great performance but casting her as a stripper is a bit unconvincing but anyway lets face it shes hot
year 2013 had its fair share of comedy movies but a lot of them very boring and not funny at all
were the millers was in my opinion one of the best comedy movies of the year
it was very funny and exciting
i originally wanted to see this movie because of the jennifer aniston scene who wouldnt
but it certainly got my attention with its original story and its funny characters
jason sudeikis does a excellent job in this role with its well known humor from movies like horrible bosses or hall pass and the other characters rise to the challenge
i laughed a lot thats for sure not to mention that the stripping scene didnt let down
so per total i give it a hard 9 and a place in my movies collection
a movie worth seeing
i saw the trailers and knew the story line
but was still very surprised about just how much i enjoyed this movie
the cast all worked so well together when i thought it might seem strained
dont get me wrong the story is simple enough and you dont have each characters background explained too much
but please believe me it all works
now the main thing  its seriously funny
a movie that you can think of certain scenes afterwards with a smile
i wont mention any of these but i am sure you will know these when you watch this film
now my personal favourite jennifer anniston its so nice to see her in not a rom com at last
sorry to be so shallow but i just loved her stripping
they are cute the van and all
jennifer aniston is a star like always what a body eh
in the real life in the usa there are no people like this in the real life they are mostly in jail so it is nice to release them for a movie plot for a change less they are the actors
movie for fun and a laugh my favorite part is when they cheated aniston with a song in the bloopers
what a face she had
sunday afternoon film to take the kids to
i would love to write more about this film but i do not have anything to add
idmb should rethink their minimum 10 line policy since i do not have anything to add how will i fill 10 lines
saw this movie without much expectations
it turned out to be pretty good
the plot is not special but the actors do their parts well
jennifer aniston along with rest of the crew does a good job
dave is a pot dealer who has fallen into trouble because he got robbed
he has to repay his boss
his boss devises a scheme to get his money back and get extra money and drugs
he asks dave to smuggle drugs across the mexican border
dave hires a wife and 2 kids to act as his family rents an rv to smuggle the drugs
the following journey is hilarious and their encounters with another family is also good to watch
this is a kind of movie you would want to watch with friends on a weekend
it is just entertainment and nothing else
i really liked this film normally these sort of comedies are not my sort of thing
i hate the lavatorial humour of some films
jennifer aniston is always watchable and it was nice to see one of our english actors will poulter doing a good job in american film
i loved the other couple in the plot they were just as funny as the main characters
i laughed out loud a lot and i have recommended it to friends
would be good to watch with a crowd
a lot of swearing so make sure there are no young ones around if you watch it at home
silly plot at times and not very accurate but certainly made a couple of hours fly by
at first when seeing the contrast between the press ratings and the public ratings one wonders if the professionals snubbed a bit too much the movie as they did with 21 jump street who has a similar rating distribution
and indeed you realize that were the millers is far much better than the critics tried to convince us
the concept is simple but strong and leads to the immediate adhesion of the viewer
the dialogues are incisive and the gags based on quid pro quos and other situational comedy are for the most part very funny
still one could regret a slight slowdown towards after the family gets the rv back at the garage which is a bit unfortunate since the rest is so dynamic but its minor and ultimately the movie turns out to be a very good surprise
probably one of the funniest movies i have seen in 2013
the premise as jason sudeikis as a drug dealer with not a bad heart is pretty good
jennifer aniston looks and acts and fits the role as the stripper with a good heart the two kids are funny
i have to admit i was very sympathetic with the boy because he came across so sweet in the movie you just cant help feeling for him
the chemistry between jennifer aniston and jason was pretty good i bought it completely
i think that if you are looking for a funny movie to watch not an oscar winning meryl streep performance than this is a movie for you
it has funny acting not overly funny which at times its not funny example jennifer anistons one of her last movies i saw from her i did not like wanderlust suffice to say that i am a fan of hers and paul rudd that movie was def not funny at least in a conventional way this movie on the other hand is different is not so raw and its literally funny it doesnt come across forced in any way at least for me two thumbs up
