absolutely ludicrous liam neeson thriller which is a genre now but frankly its just a lot of fun
i found myself smiling and giggling at the silliness of it all but damned if i wasnt enjoying myself the whole time
neeson plays an air marshal who receives a text shortly after his flight commences that if a load of money isnt deposited into an untraceable bank account a passenger will be killed every 20 minutes
the film is clever enough to make it impossible to guess  or alternatively you pretty much suspect everyone and hope like hell they dont pull out the old liamneesonhasmultiplepersonalitiesandisdoingithimself twist
the film is hilariously convoluted with plenty of plot holes
when the villain is revealed they say youd never believe how easy it all was
they are correct
i would never believe it
i still quite enjoyed watching it
i never was a huge fan of liam neesons action flicks but i went to see this because of the good reviews
this movie is a very suspenseful and a great whodunnit movie
it its share of action scenes but it never went too over the top
even if you dont like liam neeson this movie is worth seeing and is a guaranteed good time
lots of twists and suspicious characters leave you guessing and most likely wrong
lots of on the edgeof yourseat scenes because of how well it was made and has a silent and lonely feel to it which helps you understand everything going on
overall this movie is a great thriller without being packed full of action
just watched this with my movie theatreworking friend
we both were watching this for the first time and we both were thrilled by it
liam neeson plays someone taking a flight from london
the only other player we recognized was julianne moore and not much is learned about her during most of the narrative except she takes a lot of flights and was coming from a trying day
oh and she observes most of the action when liam talks to the crew on board when the crises happens
plenty of twists happen when trying to guess which passenger is responsible for some threatening comments on neesons tablet so that was a plus
in other words it was riveting throughout
really all ill say now is i and my friend highly recommend nonstop
i watched this film in the cinema today expecting it to just be an average action film with average people and an average storyline
wow i was definitely wrong
it held me in constant suspense and i really was on the edge of my seat for most of the film
there was so much tension and suspense it was unreal
the film was really good throughout no slow and boring bits
it was really exciting and i was incredibly curious to know who the villain was who sent the messages threatening to kill 1 passenger every 20 minutes
i was very surprised to find out who the hijackerperson sending messages was it was the last personpeople id expect it to be
and it was a happy ending which is always a great element to a film
and the good thing about it was no sloppy romance spoiling the film which is always a bonus
the cast was good and played by some talented and wellknown actorsactresses and the characters were all interesting people with different stories and lives
very impressed with this one one of neesons best
probably not the best plot or not even a perfect crew of actors besides liam neeson but the good point of the movie is none of those but the thrill it gives you on certain moments
it leaves you to keep trying to think and guess who is the responsible behind the scenes but it keeps you around with no clue at all and that is what will make you with your eyes fixed to the screen because you want to know who is behind all this
what also got my attention was that in certain moments everything change and all my guesses were wrong and it backs to 0
a very interesting movie but if you are looking for an action movie or a movie with a shooting scene that is not your movie this is the kind of movie the involves terrorism and stays with the thriller type
i went into the movie expecting the same generic action film that might as well be straight to dvd
i was intrigued by the premise so i gave it a go and im glad i did
i will admit the first 10 minutes or so gave me some bad vibes it was quite slow and boring but once we were on the plane all was good
i felt the suspense throughout the film and found myself trying to guess who the bad guy was which led to me second guessing myself quite a bit
what i liked about it is it wasnt a paint by numbers story there were a couple of twists and turns i wasnt expecting at all
is it an award winner
no but if your sat at home order in a pizza have a few beers and you can just sit back relax and enjoy the film for what it is
a good thriller movie that takes no time getting you inside the plane where this storys setting takes place and letting the fun begin
liam neeson did an excellent job of making his character and this movie captivating and fun even when most of the supporting cast lacked any sense of presence or personality
for the exception of julianne moore who i found to be ok in this movie
some of the action scenes here i found annoying to watch when the camera zooms so close in but i hardly let it bother me
the last 20 minutes or so is where i started to lose a little interest my opinion but overall a good thrillersuspense movie thatll keep you guessing and on the edge of your seat
we learn right off that the air marshall played by liam neeson has major outside issues that he is not dealing with very well
this takes him on the plane with a not so perfect frame of mind
this makes our air marshall perfect for framing
the action takes off from there
nonstop
there are deaths on board two being the second air marshall and the pilot
everything looks bad for our air marshall and because of his actions the passengers dont trust him
it also doesnt help that those on the ground believe the evidence that he is guilty of the crimes he is accused of
everything comes out in the end with bumps and bruises galore
just sit back and enjoy
i like this movie and i a very glad to include this movie as part of my movie collection
really is there anything better than a tear jerking liam neeson action film
maybe one starring jason statham
this is the legacy of jerry bruckheimer who gifted to us all the unforgettable armageddon and we love him for it and another reminder hollywood has just gotten better at packaging celluloid sentimentalism with heroic atonement
so good that even though we pick them apart with relentless critical abandon and expose them for the unrepentant saccharine clichas they are in the end deep down we find ourselves rooting for liam and suspending disbelief as he embodies the protective father alcoholic failure and terrorist ass kicker all at once
only taken is better perhaps the best of the genre and i for one am looking forward to nonstop too bitches
curious sidenote tonight i watched nonstop for the second time and it only took 3 scotch ales to thoroughly enjoy it as much as i did the first time
is that movie which inspires terrorism
if this movie which learn us how to be protected or how we can be fought by terrorism
however
i dont like that idea and how this director treated that scenario
it started well
it looks that director was full of ideas and so energetic
but at the middle of movie that fantasy and imagination wanes
that hijacked airplane look kidnapped by technology and not by amateur people and at the end we see that these bad guys were so weak physically and they planned everything so perfectly but they couldnt manage even a weapon in their hands
the end was a bullshit
how the director closed that scenario was so poor and bad idea
not smart at all
good luck in next movie
liam neeson julianne moore michelle dockery and linus roache star in this 2014 action thriller
neeson taken plays u
s
air marshal bill marks who gets text calls from a mysterious passenger threatening to kill others every 20 minutes unless he gets 150 million dollars
bill is trapped in a nightmare and stops at nothing to find him while the passengers panic
moore hannibal plays jen summers a passenger who bill befriends dockery plays flight attendant nancy who is a friend of bills and roache batman begins plays pilot david mcmillan
this is a good action thriller neeson is great as usual as well as john ottmans score
i recommend this
i have to say i was expecting this movie to be an all out action movie
i dont usually enjoy thrillers but this was absolutely amazing
i loved every second of it
liam neeson is a very convincing character and his characters background adds to the story
it was a brilliant movie however it wasnt the absolute best
the storyline in the movie is pretty good and very gripping
id say this is a thrillermystery film with some action which overall makes this a pretty interesting movie
i have to say it wasnt the most realistic movie ever made but it was pretty close
ive never seen any liam neeson movies before this but this movie makes me want to watch more of his movies
the movie did well on delivering what it aimed to give the audience
it gave thrills suspense and mystery
the acting was done well though some of the characters lacked chemistry and line delivery struggled at points
the writing was good and the story had some originality to it
the real problem is with the ending which like an airplane crashing dive bombs from a high level of action and suspense to an unsatisfactory and empty ending
a good movie with a bumpy landing for an ending is an enjoyable movie that the whole family can enjoy
i am rating nonstop a 6 because the story and characters are engaging and it definitely adds suspense for the viewer
yet it lacks rewatch ability due to lack of chemistry between actors some bad line delivery and crash landing of an ending
liam neeson plays bill marks an air marshall who lost his daughter olivia to cancer and alcoholic who is a passenger aboard the airplane when he receives a text message from an unknown person that unless 150 million is deposited into an account passengers will be killed every 20 minutes during the film bill tried to find out who is the one sending him the threatening text messages and gets help from jen played by julianne moore and flight attendant nancy
even though the role feels somewhat similar to the brian mills role in taken but liam neeson proves that he is quite believable as an action star
overall i would have to say that the film is rather enjoyable and good escape
when an action film offers an interesting premise along with liam neeson as the leading man one expects nothing short of an exciting and enjoyable experience and nonstop does prove satisfying even if somewhat nonsensical
in large part the audience is exposed to great levels of unpredictability and very mysterious circumstances as an air marshal attempts to save his fellow passengers on a transatlantic flight from a terrorist attack
the film is gripping and thrilling throughout with plenty of tense moments maintaining the feeling of suspense however it certainly deserved a much more clever final act rather than concluding as a conventional action film
although liam neeson does again perform well in a leading action role one cannot help but argue that the rest of the cast which included such notable names as julianne moore should have been utilized far better
overall nonstop comes across as an enthralling action film with a rather ludicrous storyline which is initially welldeveloped but unfortunately seems to lack a fitting end
i am a fan of liam neeson so i was excited to see this movie
while it was entertaining and filled with twists and turns both my husband and i were disappointed in this movie
it doesnt compare to so many of his others and it seemed like they were more interested in plot twists than entertainment
there were so many things that didnt get answered
for example what was the purpose of the other content in the briefcase
how did the person or persons behind this get access to the plane
why was liam neeson in such a hurry to get home that he wanted to do a turnaround
i gave it a 6 rating and i think that was very generous
if it wasnt for the always great acting of liam neeson this movie would be somewhat boring
it did keep you guessing though so that was in its favor
i really hope none of these are considered spoilers
i tried to put the questions as generically as possible
in similar style to taken 1 and 2 this movie is a non stop action featuring liam neeson as the films hero
overall it was very exciting and kept you guessing right up to the end
most of the acting was on par with this style of movie liam neeson gave the strongest performance
the story itself was very clicha e
g plane terrorists bomb hero saves the day but as far as typical actionthrillers go this one holds your attention throughout
it was a reliefrefreshing to see that for once the terrorist in the film wasnt arabic or eastern european
the main downside to the film was the ending which was very poorly acted and extremely cheesy
still if you are looking for a film with intense action a minimal story line and liam neeson kicking ass then this is the movie for you
the acting was well done and the set was realistic
much more to the plot than advertisement for the film would make you think
very creative plot and lots of good suspense
majority of the film is set on the inside of a large jet
that was very well done
special effects for aircraft in flight and plot related trauma was very well done
the use of technical working of smart phones text messages and aircraft networks was well conceived including the editors method of letting us follow along
julianne moore and michelle dockery were very beautiful and lian neeson scoot mcnairy and nate parker did an excellent job acting
i believe this is the movie or the beginning of this year
liam neeson continues to impress and amaze on the big screen
his initial blockbuster it was taken and this surpasses it
taken 2 was fairly weak and this made it look terrible
non stop lone sutvivor cpt phillips and amercian hustle are the best movies to come out recently
overall i give this movie a solid 9
0
i would recommend it to ages 12
it is superb and exhibits acts of heroism yet suspense
tis movie is mind twisting action packed and requires thoughtfulness and wits to figure out who did it
was it the marshall or was it his passengers
liam neeson single handedly carries this one off
the movie begins in a classic way reminding me of the grey
there is enough action to keep you riveted throughout the movie length even though the entire story takes place on an airplane
go and watch this one without a second thought for a high octane rush
the supporting cast with julianne moore do a good role to keep the entire story well gelled together
the story also carries hidden messages that touch personal notes with the viewer reminding you of your own sufferings at certain times
the small length of the film ensures that there are not too many loose ends for the director to tie up overall the film enthralls the audience with its action suspense and drama
how is this getting such high ratings
i am quite happy to suspend disbelief and enjoy a standard silly thriller but this one just went way beyond the point of no return
the actions of the character played by liam are just too stupid for words and although im happy to allow characters to make dumb decisions it gets tedious and ridiculous when they keep making the same errors over and over and the only discernible reason for this to happen is to drive a ludicrous plot that would otherwise fall apart completely
liam was irritating as the overly aggressive marshal and the majority of the cast working with him were superfluous
there were numerous plot holes lots of subplots that went nowhere shallow stereotypes an annoying overuse of redherrings and whole scenes directly stolen from other  better  movies with similar themes
i struggled to watch it all the way through
watch flight plan or red eye instead
liam neeson what a turnaround who would have thought at 60 he would be doing great action films well this film is nothing like taken this has a whole plane full of people as he is a the law on the plane the story is great the people on board he finds out are going to die if he doesnt do what he is been told he has to help and find who are what is the trying to do on board this plane the trailers doesnt do this film justice its a thrilling story and superb who dont it film its 1hr 4omins long it doesnt feel like that its not like snakes an a plane so or jodie foster films it more like can liam character save the day again but its fun to watch this film makes you think you will be asking yourself is it this person or that person it will keep you thinking right to nearly the end is great way to make a film my rating 810 keep it up liam
i recently saw nonstop a couple of days ago and i personally enjoyed it
its not just a copy and paste of taken like some people seem to believe
it was unique creative and a good deal of fun
but is it as good as other movie thrillers
no but thats not really a bad thing
it may not be as suspenseful as other great thrillers like perfect blue or rear window but it is just as entertaining
nonstop had a few pretty silly moments and it did drag on a little longer than it really needed to but it still did its best to keep from losing focus and keep the audience entertained
is it an absolutely amazing movie
no
is it a well done movie
yes
is it oscar worthy
no and i dont think its really meant to be
its a decent thriller film that does prove to be a great time at the movies
the story is good the action is good most of the characters are forgettable but likable and liam neeson is well liam neeson
its just a fun movie to watch and i think its worth at least one viewing
the point of 99
99 of all primarily action movies is to keep the viewer entertained at the edge of hisher seat and keep them guessing
this movie achieved all of those goals perfectly
liam neeson was once again amazing as the role of bill marks
the acting was generally fantastic
my friends and i had no complaints with the script except for literally two lines which came off as a tad cheesy but thats nothing
a definite must see movie especially if you love action themed movies
without a doubt this movie lands in my top 3 favorite action movies of all time
until now of course
if you watchhave watched this movie and have liked it a similar movie which i would also recommend is source code
pretty much the same style but i would say non stop is better because the tension is always high the acting is better and its completely unpredictable even though you keep thinking youve figured it all out
this movie was bad and went badder
just like my grammar
there is no way to justify this movie being made
yet it was still slightly entertaining
i love plane thriller movies
airport blew my mind as a kid and scared the crap out of me
this is just a horrible movie
call it a paycheck movie for name actors on the downward slope of their careers
how was this green lighted by studio execs
if this was made for tv movie it might be acceptable for a 2am showing but as a major motion picture
there is a reason i never heard of this movie even though liam neeson starred and is a hot ticket since taken
imdb did not do me a favor with an average vote of 7 rating
please
i will not post any spoilers in this review nonstop was very good
was it the best movie ive ever seen no
but it was a very good movie and i would recommend it to anyone that is looking for a movie that will keep you guessing until the end and will make you second guess every character every move and every action
nonstop being the name it may lead you to believe its a nonstop action thriller that will blow your face off
if youre looking for that type of movie this is not going to suffice its not die hard or independence day
but its an action thriller movie that will leave you trying to figure things out until the very end
will some of you pick out who it was in the beginning
yeah im sure
but im usually very good at knowing and i had absolutely no clue until it was actually revealed
also if you dont like planes this isnt for you since 95 of it happens on a plane
bottom line its worth seeing if you like action thrillers liam neeson or pretty good movies
i love really good action movies and liam neeson has truly become someone to watch
this movie was intense and kept you guessing throughout
its not an oscar winner rather an audience pleaser so if you go in remembering that youll enjoy
as a female it was great to have julianne moore and michelle dockery represent with fairly substantial parts and not have to behave like some actionmovie bimbos  very satisfying
oh and the cameo from anson mount was appreciated as well
the best recommendation i can give is that my husband woke up this morning and said i really enjoyed that movie last night and im quite surprised
this is not a spoiler review
sure its an action flick
yes liam neeson is the lead role
i really like liam neeson movies
i was looking forward to seeing this movie
the movie had potential but has one major terrible unjustified flaw
im not going to tell you what it is but youll remember what i said here
dont waste your money on this movie
you will thank me later after more reviews surface about this pathetic movie
please please dont take what i say here as now i have to go see it
again wait until you see more reviews surface and you will thank me that you didnt go
wait until you get peer reviews and the truth will be told
i have said nothing to reveal the plot
all im saying is step away and turn your back on this film
the biggest let down was the films direction and cutting
if your planning to confine the stage to a single cockpit you need to get even more creative than this
the story and plot was full of holes too
maybe a low budget was the main problem here yet could have added a lot more color to the cutting to other scenes and the build up on the media or got to know a little more about the people you dont want to die before boarding etc
i can not think of one good scene in the entire film and do not recommend this film to anyone
i can not give examples of just how bad the plot is because i hate writing spoilers
how did they get liam neeson and julianne moore to be in this must have been were half the budget went oh well
in similar style to taken 1 and 2 this movie is a non stop action featuring liam neeson as the films hero
overall it was very exciting and kept you guessing right up to the end
most of the acting was on par with this style of movie liam neeson gave the strongest performance
the story itself was very clicha e
g plane terrorists bomb hero saves the day but as far as typical actionthrillers go this one holds your attention throughout
it was a reliefrefreshing to see that for once the terrorist in the film wasnt arabic or eastern european
the main downside to the film was the ending which was very poorly acted and extremely cheesy
still if you are looking for a film with intense action a minimal story line and liam neeson kicking ass then this is the movie for you
i really enjoyed this movie
this is definitely one of my favorite liam nesson movies
like most liam nesson movies it was very action packed and there were a lot of fighting scenes in this movie
the setting of this movie is a transatlantic jetliner bound for london
and this movie takes advantage of the setting because of the small setting we get to learn a lot of information about all of the passengers on the plane and we get to watch them develop as characters the movie makes you identify characters
it will make you figure out who the good guys and the bad guys are
liam nesson did a great job portraying a air marshal
and throughout the movie you are on the edge of your seat trying to guess what will happen this whole movie will keep you guessing
and overall it is one of my favorite action movies i did not see much wrong with it except for some scenes that lacked realism
this movie was definitely one of the most epic movies i have ever seen
60 an intense thrill ride that hooks you in and doesnt let go until the very final reel
it must be said that this accomplishes all that it set out to do and is very entertaining without being overblown or too dumb
neeson has adapted into this fine popcorn entertainer and here hes playing a role not far off into the grey
the way that it suggests that almost anyone could be the killer is its biggest strength as paranoia looms over everyone until almost the very end and that in itself is a decent trick to pull off
its very much a movie thats well worth a look and is a rocksolid rental or a matinae cinema ticket but maybe not a full price as its good but not brilliant
many airliner hijack stories have been put on film some good some not worth the bother
nonstop is a good hijack movie because it keeps you guessing like a mystery while it shakes the crap out of you
i liked liam neeson in schindlers list 1993 taken 2008 star wars episode i  the phantom menace 1999 and batman begins 2005
he delivers another very credible lead role in nonstop and makes it work
it might seem hes getting on in age for these roles but hes the consummate actor and well toned for the action
he can certainly hold his own in an intellectual parry as well as his 60 minutes interview showed
this movie doesnt pretend to be anything other than what it is a murder every 20 minutes on the auqa atlantic not unlike a murder on the orient express
nonstop is a movie well worth the price to see
you will not be wasting your money
finally a real action movie
liam is currently turned into the first action hero of hollywood
sry statham
after takena which is to me great action movie took a slightly inferior sequel and in my opinion this is a full nonstop hit
introduction to the story about ten minutes and then an hour and a half of tension fear paranoia reversals and most importantly totally unpredictable
the film may have some little mistakes but it is action and this is easily ignored
interestingly filmed because the action happens 95 of the time on the plane
i put him in rankings rambo and die hard
thank you liam for showing people and other filmmaking teams who to make a proper action movie
ok i guess i am a little shocked that i have read a couple reviews that said this is so ridiculous or silly it could never happen lol that is exactly the arrogantcy that the rest of the world marvels at in the usa
has anyone watched the news
how does a boy get through an airport on a plane
anyway the movie was great
my heart was racing after the movie was over
i was panting
i really kept going back and forth with who it was on or off the plane and the motive
i love brain teasers and i thought he liam did a fabulous job
what a great actor
he had me going and the twist with julienne
i would watch this again
i am only sad i didnt go to the movies to see it and at home on tv
i believe movies like this are good because not only entertaining but they make you think
a great movie and thriller ride
entertaining but requires a strong suspension of disbelief
liam neeson is great but isnt he always
they do a pretty good job with the red herrings even if i guessed it a little earlier than i was probably supposed to
well i figured this person had something to do with it whether they were the bad guy or just an accomplice
but they did keep me guessing at least about whether they were in it alone or not
the motive behind all of it seemed a little forced as well
i got the feeling the writers wanted to get far more political with it than they were allowed to
im willing to bet there was an earlier draft that was much whinier and soapboxier
whats in the finished product is nothing to get worked up over though
its a decent timekiller
for those wondering the poster shot of neeson leaping through the air firing his gun on the plane actually does occur in the movie
its the timing of when it occurs that is the most priceless part
oh and since when are flattops back in style
nate parker looked like theo huxtable in this
nonstop was a great movie that kept me on the edge of my seat
it revolves around a sort of washed up air marshal who ends up being the target of a sick game being played by a terrorist on a plane that often leaves nieson limited with options but nevertheless determined
the plot is pretty creative and unique enough to give it a shot at watching and it proves worth it
its hard to make an action movie stand out nowadays but this one does so with the fear suspense and most of all
desperately wanting to know who is up to what
the movie keeps you guessing
ill admit a bad movie when i see one or one that maybe isnt worth a theater trip
i wish i had seen this one in theaters instead of unknown
dont let that movie stop you from seeing this one
liams still got it and proves it in this movie
