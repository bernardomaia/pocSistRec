"\nThis is a really depressing and disturbing film - almost certainly a\nbust at the box office but \"The Grey\" is really really good - an\nexistentialist parable - in wolves clothing.<br><br>Life is nasty - it is a struggle without meaning except for the\nstruggle itself and the nobility in having done that well regardless of\nthe end result. That's what the film was about - not an action picture\n- not a scientifically accurate portrayal of wolves but an allegory - a\nmetaphor about the existential view of life.<br><br>The circling and relentless wolves - the beautiful yet cold and\nuncaring Siberian landscape - the different attitudes of the\nparticipants to the pointless struggle yet heroic effort which no one\nwill ever know about - succinct, powerful and poignant.<br><br>One of the few films that will be remembered in future decades in what\nhas been a especially weak year. \"The Grey\" is not for the faint of\nheart or those looking for cheap thrills - but it is an unusually brave\nand beautiful exposition of an unpopular and depressing philosophical\nview of life...\n"
"\nIt all depends on why you go to the movies. Camera, sound, special\neffects and casting seems to be working fine. (Not excellent though)\nHowever, story line does not have a straight line. It's a circle.\n(Spoiler: Do not read if you want to go and see the movie) Suicidal man\nsits on a plane. The plane crashes into the mountains. A few survive\nand try to find their way out. Some meaningless conversations and then\nthey all die.<br><br>Really! there is absolutely nothing to enjoy about this movie, except\nif you are a critic, looking for something slightly different.<br><br>Go have a nice dinner instead!\n"
"\nThere is no purpose of the movie at all. It's obvious that when a\nflight crashes in such a place everyone will die. The movie doesn't\nshow how exactly the characters feel in that situation, it's just that\nthe wolves keep coming and kill one by one and the characters keep\nrunning away from them.<br><br>Oh also, they could have just collected the metal derbies of the flight\nand could have covered up the opening so that the wolves won't have\nchance to attack them and also they would have been a lot warmer. <br><br>This movie is for those who wants to die, where this movie explains you\nshouldn't die by yourself but you're gonna die eventually anyway. <br><br>And use of the F word is countless. <br><br>I wonder what the director wanted to say through this movie. It was a\ntotal BS where the wolves are the heroes.\n"
"\nThis movie was brutally bad. I found myself cheering for the wolves as\nthey mercifully picked off the plane-wreck survivors one by one.<br><br>The best part of the movie experience happened in the final scene --\nwhen Liam Neeson faced off with the alpha wolf and the movie ended\nabruptly (and compassionately) -- some guy in the back of the theater\nyelled out \"You have GOT to be sh**ing me!!\" The entire audience\nerupted in laughter. Classic.<br><br>This movie is just another one of Liam-making-angry-faces efforts.\nYou'll get more pleasure staying home and doing menial housework than\npaying your hard earned money to watch this thing -- because the movie\nis just that bad.\n"
"\nMy son really wanted to see this move because of the previews. I caved\nin and took him. The movie was very slow at times and kept you waiting\nfor something to happen. There were times I kept thinking it was going\nto turn around but it just never happened. As for the ending...it was\nvery disappointing to sit through two hours and not have one person\nmake it out alive. At the end of the movie in a theater that was\npacked...you could have heard a pin drop. The only noise were comments\nof you've got to be kidding... Not good at all. The preview was pretty\nmuch the movie. Save your money and if you are really into survival\nmovies then get it on video for a buck.\n"
"\nI'm a big fan of Liam Neeson, but come on now... you must admit this\nmovie was horrible. Probably the biggest contributor to the failure of\nthis movie is that they showed the ENDING SCENE IN THE PREVIEWS!!!\nSince when is this OK??? I went to this movie to see a\nGlass-Fist-Wolf-Fight, and it never freakin' happened!!! The wolves\nwere quite fake looking, not even close to realistic, and the whole\nmovie dragged on 'til the end when I thought I would finally see the\nbattle I came to see, and then.. the screen goes black and credits\nstart to roll!! ARE YOU KIDDING ME??!!?? You don't tease people with a\nhand to hand wolf fight in the preview if the movie never actually\nshows the fight. Big disappointment!! This movie was pure crap in my\nopinion.\n"
"\nI would give it 3 stars if every other word in the movie wasn't and F-\nbomb. I'm not a prudish person, but it got very annoying hearing one in\nnearly every sentence.<br><br>They jump over a huge cliff above a river into the tops of 100 ft tall\ntrees and the wolves are waiting for them at the bottom? Did the wolves\njump down the cliff too? Way too many dumb things like that in this\nmovie. <br><br>I was rooting for the wolves, every time someone died it was one less\nguy I had to listen to swear. Wish I wouldn't have wasted my afternoon\nat the theater today.\n"
"\nIf you're like me you saw the trailers with Liam Neeson strapping glass\nbottles to his hands and fighting wolves and thought, \"Holy cow! They\nmade Wolf Taken. Violence and wolves!\" Well, they didn't. There's\nreally not that much action in the film. The trailers really, really\ndid a dis-service to the film. They were selling an action movie when\nthey really made an intensely somber film about a group of desperate\nmen as they try to survive a plane crash. The film is quietly\nbeautiful.<br><br>I saw it in theaters and was hopping mad at how the trailer misled me.\nPeople all over the theater fell asleep (my girlfriend included).\nHowever, I think if you're looking for a non-action flick, you'll\nreally dig this.\n"
"\nliterally half the people shouted out at the end \"are you freaking\nkidding me\"--talk about false advertising! How about gunfight at OK\ncorral and as soon as they face the enemies, roll credits: or just as\nLuke and darth meet up, or indiana jones faces the Nazis, rocky enters\nthe ring or john connor comes face to face with the terminator--roll\ncredits, directed by. and then show the conflict in your lying crap\nadvertising as if that is what you are waiting for! at least they saved\n2 million in not filming the climax of the movie! I hope the next time\nthey film the titanic, as soon as the ice hits the boat, roll credits!\nare you kidding me!!!!!! by the way, i have noting against ambiguous\narty films with no concrete stories--i loved tree of life--but not when\nyou advertise it as a fight to the death action film!!!\n"
"\nPlane crash in Alaska. Eight survivors. Lots of hungry wolves.<br><br>Instead of staying with the downed plane, they decide to cover about\nfive miles of open ground and head towards a forest.<br><br>Most of the survivors are equipped with knives and a human brain,\nmaking them smarter (one would hope) than the wolves. Not one of them\nsharpened along stick for defence purposes. Any fire they built was\ntiny, no thought was given to making a defensive structure.<br><br>Seriously, do they think the watching public are so dumb?<br><br>1/10 for this awful movie - the only reason it gets one point is for\nthe acting of the Wolves - they were excellent.\n"
"\nMost of the people heading to see this would be men looking for a\nsurvival flick. It's not, it's an implausible and absurd waste of time.\nThe story is so artificial it makes the June 1969 issue of the\nInvincible Iron Man (#32 Where Walks the Weirwolf) look like a Pentagon\nbudget report. Some of the more credibility defying stunts include:\nLiam Neeson in a 300 mph plane crash into the ice and emerging from the\nwreckage with a slight scratch on his left hand, Neeson (wilderness\nexpert) convincing his fellow survivors that the best place to avoid\nravenous wild wolves is in a dark forest, jumping off 150 ft sheer\ncliffs, jumping into icy rivers, fighting said wolves with miniature\nairline liquor bottles. Watch instead the same plot done better in \"The\nPurple Plain\" (1954)\n"
"\n\"If they send fifty planes, maybe they'll find us. But they won't send\nfifty planes, because it won't matter, becauseÂ…we won't have time to\nwait for the one or two that they will send.\" That was the flimsy basis\nto explain why a bunch of professionals should decide to wander of into\nthe frozen tundra and certain death rather than build a shelter and\nwait for an imminent rescue attempt. ERGH, wouldn't the plane have\nstuck to a well laid out flightpath since leaving base and had a GPS\nlocater on on-board? Besides, wouldn't wouldn't heading off to the\nforests be like entering the natural hunting ground of wolves anyway?\nThis film left me rooting for the wolves (bigbadmoviereviews)\n"
"\nI went to watch this movie having absolutely no idea what it was about,\nme and my friends were simply bored. I must say that watching this\nmovie was a painful experience. Now the film has multiple impossibly\nstupid flaws: wolves that go over huge cliffs, rivers and into the\nmiddle of nowhere to attack a bunch of people who survived a plane\ncrash; a guy that swims around in freezing water and comes out of it\nlike it was nothing; loads of people getting out of a plane crash\ncompletely unharmed and so on. But honestly I could live with all of\nthat if the movie made up for it with at least anything. I found all of\nthe characters either dull or totally hateable (the funny\noverly-talkative guy was kinda likable, but he died at the very start).\nThe character Liam Neeson was disgusting, with his no emotions,\ndepressive comments, super-high morality that didn't seem relatively\nreal. No worthwhile dialogues, pretty much no plot, even the poem his\ndad wrote sucked! And anyway, what a prick do you have to be to write a\npoem and put it into a frame and on your wall?\n"
"\nOK this contains spoilers!!! Airplane crashes in icy cold land.Seven\nsurvivors, loads of wolves (and lots of plastic wolves). Survivors\nleave safety of plane and wander off into the icy cold land. Yum yum\nsay the wolves \"let's gradually kill off these men\" And so by varying\nmeans the clever wolves gradually kill off the stupid men.<br><br>To get away from the wolves at one point the men jump off a cliff into\ntrees about 30 feet away. Amazingly only one doesn't make it. Oh dear I\nthink the fall will kill him. Luckily he just about survives but , wait\nfor it...Oh yes! here come the wolves to nibble and gnaw at him to\nfinish him off. Talk about unlucky!<br><br>At the end all the men are dead ( you want me to wait until after the\ncredits PERLEASE!)<br><br>I honestly felt it reminded me of th old Hammer film Theatre Of Blood\nwhereby an actor kills off his critics one by one by different means. <br><br>Maybe if it had been played for laughs it would have been good.\n"
"\nFor a video review of 'The Grey' by ThatPunkJoCassidy try the link\nbelow! <br><br>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jW2RXK87gbs<br><br>Alright... Why? How could anyone like this? It's just another 'Liam\nNielson is awesome'flick and it really grinds me that people think\nthere is anything deep about it. I went into watching this hoping it\nwas a psychological/survival thriller, but no, it's a boys club vs.\nwolves... CG wolves, I may add. Sadly the 'Twilight' wolves looked\nbetter. And the worst part, the spoiler? The final fight is cut. Just\nbefore we see Liam cut up the Alpha, it's just the end. A rip-off from\nthe ambiguous end of 'Inception' but done horrible. All we can say is\nthat we missed a great fight but got the already assumed knowledge that\neveryone died. Whoop-De-Doo.\n"
"\nThis review has big-time spoilers. I love Liam and was looking forward\nto his next action movie, but this movie started out grim and never got\noff the ground. I'm limited on space, but for starters, I would have\nliked a little more history on the wolves -- it's a scary movie, make\nsomething up! And I got bored of watching them walk thru snow - again -\nand get eaten by wolves - AGAIN -- but wait! There's always Liam's last\nand only friend dying not by a wolf, but drowning instead. I expected a\nlittle smarter script for Liam than, \"What the hell are you doing?!?\"\nas his friend drowns -- I mean, c'mo-o-on! And then the peek after the\ncredits -- WTHeck was THAT??? It was so up close, you couldn't see\nanything and after seeing everyone die anyway, why ruin a perfectly\nterrible movie to tease you into thinking someone or something actually\nlived??? Okay to rent for a buck, but not to pay for at the theater.\nExpected to like it, but oh-so hated it.\n"
"\nCarnahan is a great director and I first saw his work in the drama\nNarc. Some of his titles are odd in that they went the mainstream route\nand somewhat lowest common denominator but has totally redeemed\nhimself, in my opinion, with The Grey.<br><br>The film is really about death and how we live our lives with it\nlooming over us. When a character perishes, they die somewhat in a\nmanner to how they lived. Think \"No Mas\" (No More) and how he has\nenough and sits there waiting for his fate. I always think of the line\nin a Metallica song which is: \"My lifestyle determines my deathstyle\"\nVisually the film is dark, cold and brooding. Looks amazing. Neeson is\nbroken, then bold and then fierce. The last 5 minutes of the film are\nto me what The Grey is all about.<br><br>Not an easy watch by any means but definitely worth it.\n"
"\nThis was the most depressing movie I have seen since A.I.: Artificial\nIntelligence. The beginning, the middle and the end were all\ndepressing. There was no comic relief. Not one single episode of\ngoodness to hold on to. Absolutely nothing good occurred to help you\nget through the fear, terror, blood and defeat.<br><br>I was flabbergasted and stunned at how awful this movie was. To my\nrelief, other people in the cinema seemed to feel the same way. One\nyounger women in the audience shouted out, \"Did anyone here like this\nmovie?\" No one responded.<br><br>The only thing that could have made this movie better is if I could\nsomehow have received a refund.\n"
"\nSurprised by all the poor ratings given apparently by a bunch of\nwildlife/wolf/survival experts! Guys, this is a Hollywood movie! Let me\nemphasize - a movie. All this analysis on how much a wolf weighs and\nhow their behavior is incorrectly depicted... please stick to NatGeo or\nDiscovery channel programs and stay away from fiction! Going by the\nlogic and reviews, Spielberg's 1975 classic 'Jaws' should be given just\na star or two as it has a highly inaccurate portrayal of sharks. But\nsurprise surprise, it's 8+ on IMDb! Wow how did that happen?! I enjoy a\nmovie for the entertainment value it provides. And if the film can hold\nmy interest for about 90 minutes, I'd say it worked. The Grey\ndefinitely worked!\n"
"\nThe Grey is a film that not only should be rated higher, but is also\nperfect in its gripping storytelling. This film is extremely divisive,\neither you will love this movie or hate it. However, in my opinion this\nis one of the best films in cinematic history. The emotional drama\nbetween Liam Neeson contemplating life and death, as well as his\nability to convey himself without much dialogue is not only moving, but\nalso compelling. The Grey is beyond emotionally draining, which will\nturn some viewers off, but the strong storytelling and message behind\nthis film is something that more films need. The soundtrack is also\nsuperb as it adds emotion to already emotional scenes. This film should\nbe rated higher, and it is a cinematic masterpiece.\n"
"\nI can't think of anyone else that could've carried \"The Grey\" on his\ntrusty shoulders like Liam Neeson. He is perfect for this movie. He\nmakes the mixture of tortured character and menacing undercurrent look\neasy. His ever-capable leadership after a plane crash (not to mention\nhis staring down of a pack of preying wolves) is something I can only\nwish I had. <br><br>But for all of its white-knuckle terror and intensity (that sound\ndesign is a trip), \"The Grey\" is a surprisingly moving affair from an\nemotional standpoint. It's got a knack for killing someone off just\nwhen you've grown attached. Camaderie gets built up and then -boom-\nthey're gone. It's a kickass man vs. nature movie, yes, but I wasn't\nprepared for the hard-hitting third act. That wallet scene, in\nparticular was an unmitigated punch to the sternum. And the final image\nof openly defiant Neeson, fists brought to bear and ready to fight, is\none that I still can't shake, <br><br>And not sure I want to.<br><br>8/10\n"
"\nSurvivors of a violent plane crash trek through a blizzard stricken ice\nland in the middle of nowhere in order to reach a (or any) mainland and\nare initially being hunted then one by one being picked off by a pack\nof angry menacing Alaskan wolves whose alpha has been killed by one of\nthe men (Liam Neeson) who just might be the bravest and most determined\nto survive of the lot. It's just heart breaking to watch people who\nhave already been through the worst, go through even worse off things\nand ultimately meet a terrible end.<br><br>What plays out in 'The Grey' is everybody's nightmare regardless of\nwhether you travel by air or not. Being stranded or trapped in foreign\nterrain where you have to depend on learned skills to survive or\nimmediately have to learn skills to survive as you battle the harsh\nelements and insidious entities against all odds. Liam Neeson gives yet\nanother fine performance of his career, just when you thought he had\ngiven his finest in the last film you saw him in. A masterclass actor,\nhe is.\n"
"\nI really enjoyed this movie. I watched it on cable TV and was expecting\nit to be awful. But, it was well made and kept my interest to the end.<br><br>So many people on here are complaining about it not being realistic and\nthat \"wolves don't act like that!\", 3 words for you guys \"shut up,\nidiots\".<br><br>It isn't a documentary. IT'S A ****ing MOVIE!! Your mouths must be\nreally dry from all that breathing you do through them. Do you critique\nJames Bond movies the same way? \"We don't have invisible cars or\nexploding pens! This movie is dumb! Rah rah rah harrumph harrumph\". Or\nStar Wars movies, \"if it's a long time ago in a galaxy far far away,\nwhy do they speak English!? Star Wars is SO unrealistic! It sucks!\".<br><br>Movies don't have to be realistic. If you want realism, don't watch a\nmovie: go live your boring life.<br><br>Anyway, this was a decent movie. Nothing amazing, but fun.\n"
"\nthis movie was excellent not to much gore not to much dramatized scenes\nevery movie I've seen with Liam Neeson has been a top favorite movie\nthat I've enjoyed the only flaw I saw in this movie \"believe me I'm not\nhonestly great at catching many... but this one stuck out...\" but the\nonly flaw I saw \"I don't know if this is a spoiler wouldn't seem like\none to me but just in case to cover myself... I'll say spoiler: \"isn't\nit ironic how when they searched the bodies for their wallets... they\nall knew exactly where their wallets were like which pocket it was in\nthe first time...? I know if I were in that situation... id be\nsearching 3 or 4 pockets before I found a wallet... not everyone keeps\nit in the same pocket... :spoiler end anyways other then that.. this\nmovie was fantastic :)\n"
"\nLet's start with the good points. Laim Neeson's performance as the game\nhunter who takes control of the survivors is entrancing. Moody, intense\nand as bleak as the snowy wastes this movie is set in. Having him play\na widower gives Ottway sharp edge of realism - for obvious reasons. The\ncinematography gives viewers a real sense of the group's isolation and\ndesperate situation. I thought the plane crash was particularly well\ndirected. Okay, now onto the not so good points. Mixing philosophy with\naction was never going to be easy, but when the roughnecks take\n(frequent) breaks from fighting the wolves for existential heart to\nhearts the film does stumble. This isn't helped by the pedestrian\ndialogue or sketchbook supporting characters. As they die one by one in\nincreasingly depressing ways, the film's central message seems to be\nthat life is painful, pointless and God doesn't exist. Quite a\nrefreshing change from feel good narratives.\n"
"\ni read all the negative reviews and thought oh no, i'm about to watch a\nrubbish film, luckily it was a great film, no hero, no happy ending,\njust harsh reality, apparently wolves don't act like that, so what its\na film, not a documentary, i thought the wolves acted just like a fox,\nkill everything, then store it for leaner times. i was hooked i was\nnever bored, i wondered how they were going to try and get away,the\nscenery is great, Alaskan wilderness, reminded me a bit of 'snow\nwalker' another great snow film .Liam Neeson acts his best, in a\nbelievable role would recommend this film to anybody who wants escapism\nwith a gritty edge to it,all the actors were good, and lots of wolves\nto boot,\n"
"\nI did not expect much of this film, but I was in for a surprise. Really\ngreat film! Plot is really cool, plane crashes somewhere in the middle\nof Alaska nowhere and the survivors are going to be eaten by the\nwolves. What I hate about the plots like these is that they could of\nfor example told us a little bit more why plane crashed. Planes do not\ncrash like that out of the bloo. Otherwise plot is very well thought\nout and imagined.<br><br>Acting is different from actor to the actor. Liam Neeson is fantastic,\nlike usually he is. Father son moment was a nice touch. I loved the\neyes of the little kid.<br><br>Visual effects are great! Wolves really look real, I am sure a lot of\nhard work went into making of this film. It really looks realistic.<br><br>All in all I strongly recommend this film, especially if you like\nlost-in-space-cold-wintry-wolves-eating thrillers.\n"
"\nI will probably remember all my life this horrible night. When I was a\nchild around 5 or 6 years old. My cousin and I we had to reach our\nvillage by walking through the forest (it was somewhere in mountain in\nthe ex Yugoslavia) there was a shortcut path he know well. This night\nwas dark as coal. <br><br>I didn't know there was still free wild wolves, when suddenly a pack of\nwolves were standing in front of us, through the darkness the only\nthink we could see was their yellow eyes fixed on us, and... my god the\nspooky howling and grunts still gives me cold in the back. I've never\nbeen so scared in my life, luckily for me, my cousin had good knowledge\nin this kind of situation. His plan was simple... DO NOT MOVE! if you\nflee before them it will be your last race ever. Finally after a while\nthey vanished into the night.<br><br>Trust me... you will be afraid, finally a beautiful and realistic movie\nabout wolves.\n"
"\nI've read IMDb for years and this is the first time I write a review.\nAnd I'm going to do it, because this movie is the WORST that I watched\nin many, many years. I really don't know where to beging with because\nyou can't imagine how bad this movie is until you suffer the painful\nexperience of watching it. In fact,I laughed hard during a good part of\nthe movie because of the many ridiculous situations the characters got\ninvolved... can you imagine that the only weapons they made during the\naction were sticks tied to cartridges? There are hundreds of no sense\nscenes, one after another. The feeling is of absolute absurdity. At the\nvery end, I sided with the Wolfs, to end as soon as possible the\ntorture. Really, save your money (and time) from this disaster.\n"
"\nWanted to like it but... Wolves are howling with an on/off switch.\nWolves have LEDs in their eyes. Wolves, when the Alpha wolf appears\nleave their pray to him. Long, boring, senseless (in the concept)\ndialogs between the survivors. Everybody has something great to say,\nlike they know we are watching them (damn, that was true...) They left\nthe crash scene (and each chance they had to be found) to start\nwandering around in this extreme cold, because in the remaining of the\naircraft wasn't safe! The final shot, then when i didn't have a chance\nto save some of my time by escaping, was when they decided for one of\nthem to jump off from the cliff, grab a tree on the way and help the\nothers with a clothe-made \"rope\" to cross the abyss! Forbidden for 16+\naudience...\n"
"\nusually Liam Neeson being in a movie is a green flag for me. this movie\nwas so not enjoyed by me and my husband and a lot of people in the\ntheatre. it was clichÃ© and stupid. their use of foreshadowing made it\nso nothing was a surprise. in the end, when it went black i thought\n'gawd, i hope the wolf won or god forbid there might be a sequel! i got\nthe bleakness of the situation from the beginning but all the\n'comaraderie that showed up in the dialogue was so pat. and trite. i\ndisliked the movie intensely and spent half of it updating my fb since\ni felt like it was a couple of hours i would never get back. wish Head\nleft after the first half hour and gotten my money back but i was still\nhopeful it would pick up.\n"
"\nApparently many IMDb reviewers like all their movies straight without\ncream and sugar and no deeper meaning. <br><br>The Grey is fantastic. Period. Yes- the wolves and some of the\ndecisions of the survivors is laughably bad. No doubt. That is really\nonly about 2% of The Grey. It seems that can't be true but if you watch\nthe movie it is.<br><br>Once more unto the fray is a battle cry that harks back to and is\nmodified from Shakespeare's Henry V. The movie presents a singularly\ndark world mixed with pain, death, the cold, hungry predators,\npointlessness, drowning, etc., but all to help the viewer swallow the\ncarefully crafted dystopia of Neeson's character's soul. This movie is\nWAY more like \"The Road\" then \"The Edge\" or \"San Andreas\"<br><br>Go see it and look past the first obvious level. If you can pierce the\nveil, you will see the goodness of this movie.\n"
"\nI'd seen trailers for this movie, and I don't know why but I thought it\nwas going to be some kind of supernatural thriller, I had no idea it\nwas going to be a man vs beast film. I am so surprised by so many of\nthe highly negative comments, I rather enjoyed it, I'll take the point\nthat the behaviour of the wolves was perhaps not totally accurate (I\ndon't profess to be an expert.) There were enough shocks, and plenty of\ntense moments to keep my interest, Wolves are fascinating animals, I\nwouldn't like to be surrounded by them! So it's not Liam Neeson's best\nfilm, credit to him though because he's starred in some awesome movies,\nthis was very different for him. I was surprised by the distinct lack\nof frost bite.\n"
"\nThe emphasis is clearly on Neeson's character. It is revealed that his\nwife died from an unknown illness and that Neeson's character\ncontemplates suicide. He takes a plane ride instead, writing her a love\nnote. The plane crashes in the middle of the tundra, and him and a band\nof survivors traipse through the snow and blizzards whilst being chased\nand gnawed at by some terrifyingly enormous wolves.<br><br>I'm literal kind of guy and there are some obvious connections to\nNeeson's character's past with his father and deceased wife, but The\nGrey is a basic survival story: what do you have to live for, who will\nmiss you if you die, why go on? The fact the Neeson's character goes\ndown fighting shows how much of a grizzled old man'o'war that he is. He\nknows he's going to die. But you know what? Not without wounding or\nkilling some of those wolves.\n"
"\n\"Once more into the fray... Into the last good fight I'll ever know.\nLive and die on this day...

"\nThere seems to be a lot of inverted reviews. Either like the movie or\ndespise it. I liked it. Does the movie leave reality in the dust? Yes,\nfor the most part. But if one looks at this movie as a fantasy, you\nwill come away liking it.<br><br>Maybe I was in the mood for this type of movie. Visceral, gritty and\nnaturalistic. It is what it is. Let the movie take you on a journey and\nyou'll be involved.<br><br>Personally, no way in all hell would I have left the plane. I would\nhave held up but that's not the premise. Hell we can all watch Survive\nif we want to see a movie like that.<br><br>This movie is a fantasy movie into the wild and how 6 grown men live\nand die presented with what they are given. I liked it.\n"
"\nI can accept the fact that so much about this movie was unrealistic, as\nothers have so well and humorously described. It is a movie, after all.\nBut I can't accept that the story just dragged on &amp; became relentlessly\ndepressing. I wasn't asking for a Hollywood ending, but I kept hoping\nthat SOMETHING good would happen. Or at least a final Liam-vs-Wolf\nshowdown. Instead it was \"huh???\" at the end. What was the point? Some\nreviewers mentioned a final clip at the end of the credits, maybe that\nwould've helped, but we'd ejected the DVD by then! Glad we just rented\nthe DVD &amp; not gone out to see it in the theater... but we'll have to\nhave a little chat with the lady who recommended it at Blockbuster. On\nthe plus side, the cinematography was fantastic.\n"
"\nHow I adore Liam Neeson. But why he has to be in this movie?<br><br>The beginning was promising. Good back ground story. But then the plane\ncrashed and so did the whole movie.<br><br>There were lots of wolves, real one, not the over sized or ridiculous\none, and it's extremely cold. That's one good thing about this movie,\nreal villains.<br><br>It is a survival movie, man's effort to stay alive in an extreme\ncircumstances. But then, it's about the endless number of wolves. One,\ntwo, three...I felt sleepy counting.<br><br>It's like watching a certain feature on Animal planet, except you know\nthat the victims are not real, they are actors. The plot is overly\ndramatised. This movie should have ended like on the second attack,\nlogically. <br><br>I managed to finished it tho, but I kept asking when will it be over?<br><br>And when it did, I went straight to bed. Luckily wolves didn't haunt\nme.\n"
"\nI find movies quite dumb often. Reguardless of the cast. This was not\none of those movies. I very much enjoyed it. Would watch it again\nguaranteed. I didn't see it in theaters and i regret that. I think\npeople gave bad reviews because they have unrealistic and unreachable\nstandards. Its worth watching even if 500 people complain it wasn't\ngood enough for them. The only thing i didn't like was how they ends it\nbut it wasn't anywhere near a deal breaker for me. The plot was good,\nthe acting was fantastic, the wolves were slightly unrealistic but\nawful close for not using real wolves to attack actors. I don't think\npeople should not put so much stock in bad reviews. Go to red box and\ndecide for yourself. Its worth the money to at least make your own\ndecision. You may love it.\n"
"\nIt's Liam Neeson. That's all I needed in order for this movie to call\nmy attention. It's gritty. It's dark. It's fantastic. <br><br>Neeson plays Ottway, a loner and self reserved type. He hunts animals\nfor a living, namely Wolves. Fast forward a bit, he and a few dozen\nothers get on a plane leaving to Alaska. Needless to say, the plane\ngoes down (in one of the greatest plane going down scenes ever) and\ncrash lands in a remote area in Alaska. This is where it all starts.\nMan vs Wolf. Life vs Death. <br><br>The events that transpire throughout the whole movie is bone chilling\nand nerve wrecking. I won't say much. But you'll find yourself\nwondering, pondering, and just thinking deep thoughts about life and\nhow to live it. Especially towards the end. This movie really opened my\neyes, and really hit me in many ways. If you accept this movie for what\nit is, you'll more than likely feel the same.\n"
"\nthis movie took its place in my favorite movies ,if you ask why, the\nreason is simple ,from the very fist moment it just grips you and you\nlive ,experience the characters ,the scene with everything in it, after\nthe movie finished,i couldn't get out of my room without looking around\nfirst ,because i still had the fear in me,that is what i believe a\nmovie should make a person feel like, even though some of you believe\nthat this movie was exaggerated and it is illogical,i still believe\nthat this movie is a brilliant top quality and real movie... and for\nthe record you have to watch this movie to see how Liam Neeson acts\n,after i watch this movie, , i just became a fan of him..\n"
"\nI don't normally take the time to review films but believe it is\nnecessary regarding The Grey. I know there has been criticism that\nwolves don't hunt humans and a few other issues that may require the\nsuspension of disbelief. But it is more important to pay attention to\nthe inner conflict than the external conflict. The external conflict is\nlike wood feeding the fire inside. The wolves are merely symbolic. And\nLiam's performance is subtle enough to be nothing short of brilliant.\nThe film was well shot and well acted. The cinematography is effective\nwithout being distracting. One of the best films in a long time. Make\nsure to catch this one.\n"
"\nThe Grey Oh great, another PSA about the impending apocalypse resulting\nfrom aging baby-boomers' strain on healthcare.<br><br>Oh wait this thriller doesn't involve conscripting geriatric nurses;\nbut it does have an old man in it.<br><br>When their plane crashes in the wilderness, a group of Alaskan oil\nriggers (Dermot Mulroney, James Badge Dale, Frank Grillo, Joe Anderson,\nNonso Anozie, Dallas Roberts) must depend on John (Liam Neeson), a\nhunter hired to protect their work camp from wolves, to keep them\nalive.<br><br>Leading them to shelter and tending to the injured, John establishes\nhimself as their leader. But those in his group not only begin\nquestioning John's alpha dog status, but so too does a horde of hungry\nwolves.<br><br>A macho, emotional man vs. nature nail-biter, The Grey is as much a\nstudy of manhood as it is a two-fisted tale of survival.<br><br>Incidentally, it's only natural that wolves would attack rig pigs.\n(Green Light) vidiotreviews.blogspot.com\n"
"\nI read a few reviews of this film and almost didn't watch it, and then\nwhen I did, registered with IMDb just to put this review on for a\nbalanced view! Many people complain about the film on the level that\nthe wolves' behaviour is unrealistic, (as you might in so many other\nfilms with creatures in them) however if you are willing to accept that\nthe predatory behaviour of the wolves has been exaggerated, the film is\nquite compelling and entertaining to watch.<br><br>The interactions between the surviving men were interesting, and I felt\na good exploration of certain personality types put under extreme\npressure. Liam Neeson was particularly good in his role.<br><br>This film is a good evening's entertainment. It will not make you think\ntoo much, but nonetheless keeps you watching and wondering up to the\nend, which I'm glad to say was not too contrived.\n"
"\nLiam Neeson stars in this 2011 thriller based on a short story, \"Ghost\nWalker.\" This film starts with John Ottway (Neeson), a huntsman who's\ndepressed over the loss of his wife taking a flight home with a bunch\nof oil workers. After falling asleep and waking up from a bad dream, he\ndiscovers that the plane has crashed in the middle of Alaska. He\nrealizes he's not the only survivor, but 6 others and they unite\nheading into the snowy wilderness where they become hunted by a pack of\nhungry wolves. John and the others get to know each other while trying\nto survive. I've liked this since first seeing it at the movies and\nLiam is great in it as usual. I recommend this good thriller.\n"
"\nThe Grey Â– CATCH IT (B+) After Taken and Unknown, the Grey is added\ninto another likable Liam Neeson's venture. The Grey can be considered\nvery close to the actual the rugby team Andes survivors. Actually the\nmovie gives very nice reference to that actual event and the movie. In\nthis movie besides the nature it's actually the wolfs, who are ready to\nkill them as they crash into their marked territory. Liam Neeson is\nfantastic as always. The supporting cast Dermot Mulroney, Frank Grillo,\nJeo Anderson and Dallas Roberts was good. Overall, it's an intense\nmovie and will make you jump off your seats in some of the crazy\nsequences. Many people will feel like being cheated in the end but hey\nwatch for 2 seconds after credit, it'll answer your question ;)\n"
"\nThe film is much more than meets the eye. It have an action elements\nand the survival movie taste, but pretty unrealistic situations and\nactions. That's exactly the reason of complaining and pretty low\nrating. Thats exactly, why its so unique..<br><br>In first place, its a well made drama, a simple story, back-rounded\nwith a plain crash and wolves chaise. And that's whats make the movie\nvery special. It takes long time to realize that, I would say, until\nthe last 15 minutes, but its there! End scene reveals the reasons and\nactions of Ottway, his thoughts and feelings. The action part could\ntake place anywhere else, be more or even less realistic, but still\nunimportant.<br><br>Give this a chance, it's far beyond the score, have a deep meaning and\na perfect Neeson acting. 9/10\n"
"\nI wish I could articulate my thoughts as well as Movie Muse Reviews at\nthe top. I can really only add that this is my favorite Liam Neeson\nrole I've ever come across, which is saying quite a bit considering I\nam one of the biggest Batman fan boys and having him play the role of a\nfather figure to Batman is saying quite a bit. I jumped more in this\nfilm than I did throughout the Saw franchise. I felt like I was apart\nof the crew being chased. I truly enjoyed this film and it has\nre-kindled my desire to watch quality cinema. I cannot praise this film\nenough, from the story-telling, the pacing, the tasteful kill scenes,\nand capturing how most people would react in a situation like the one\non screen, more specifically the character of Diaz. Even though they\nwill not see this, I want to thank the whole cast &amp; crew for making one\nof my all time favorite films.\n"
"\nThe Grey is a 2012 American thriller film directed by Joe Carnahan and\nstarring Liam Neeson, Frank Grillo and Dermot Mulroney. The story\nfollows a number of men stranded in Alaska after a plane crash, who are\nforced to survive using little more than their wits, as a pack of\nwolves stalks them. The storyline sound familiar but what makes this\none different is the fact that you can feel the emotions, the fears and\nthe thrills of the cat and mouse game as it unfolds in front of you,\nyou feel the frustrations of the group as they are taunted and haunted\nby the beasts. The graphics are brilliant and are actually the\nhighlight of the movie; you can actually feel the snow on your skin as\nit snows on the set. Liam proved once again acting is in his blood as\nhe takes you in a journey of a man who is lost in Alaska and now is\ngiven a responsibility to make sure the group is safe as he is\npersonally suffer from his demons. Overall the movie is worth a night\nout and is worth your time, you still feel the thrills even after you\nhave finished it.\n"
"\nThis was a first rate film, all those who complain about the lack of\nsurvival skills should remember that not everyone is bear grills and\nits very common for folk to wander off from crash sites or broken down\nvehicles, even though advice says not too.<br><br>As for the wolves, well its a MOVIE don't expect some David\nAttenborough story line...if they had stayed with the plane and the\nwolves were realistic there would have been no film!! Nice plane crash,\ngood story line, exciting and sad at the same time, seems like a decent\nfilm.<br><br>Anyone else notice that the music sounds an awful lot like the\nsoundtrack from Ink....yet no mention of this I can see...\n"
"\nI went to the theater with pretty high expectations based on the\nratings and thinking it'd be a thriller similar to Taken or Unknown. To\nbe fair, it's not categorized as a thriller but nor is listed as horror\nand more than anything else, that's what the film is.<br><br>The whole movie is essentially crazed wolves going after survivors of a\nplane crash in the Alaska wilderness. The explanation we get from\nOttway (Neeson, who plays his role well), who kills wolves for a living\nto protect oilfield workers, is that if they're in the range of their\ndens where the cubs are, they'll attack humans. Even if that's true, I\nfind it highly unlikely they would attack a group of grown men out in\nthe open especially with a fire going.<br><br>There you have it, that's it: one by one, the men are torn to pieces by\nwolves until Ottway is the only one left. I was expecting more\nhuman-human conflict of which there isn't much, despite a promising\nstart: a good riffraff fight in a bar. In retrospect, the ending is a\njust ending to the storyline and even mildly poetic.\n"
"\nMost negative reviews of this film seem to center around the\nunrealistic depiction of wolves or the fact that it was too\nphilosophical and preachy for a survival thriller. I think this\ncompletely misses the point. The Grey was not a film about wolves and a\nplane crash with a philosophical backdrop. It was a philosophical movie\nwith wolves and a plane crash used as a framing device. The themes of\nhope, doubt, tenacity, perseverance, and determination are what make\nthis movie great. The burning question of what to do when all seems\nlost and how to keep going when it feels like you're completely alone\nis very universal and can apply to almost anyone in some form or\nanother. The emotional ride of watching Ottway's and the other\nsurvivors' ups and downs is what keeps this movie interesting long\nafter the unrealistic super-wolves lose their luster. This may not be\nthe film you were expecting, but it's a great one none the less.\n"
"\nNot going to say much. The movie started out promising. The trailers\nsucked me into, what I thought, was going to be a huge battle between\nman and beast. The movie worked it's way up to the climax, then ended.\nI wasted almost two hours with NO pay off at the end. Very\ndisappointed. Huge character study in life's most depressing family\nhistories.<br><br>If you are too happy and want to become depressed and angry, please\nwatch this movie... otherwise, skip it!<br><br>This does not change the way I feel about Liam Neeson as an actor, but\nI will look to avoid other movies directed by Joe Carnahan since it was\nhis decision to end the movie the way he did.\n"
"\nI wasn't expecting much but ended up loving the movie. Gripping and\nhypnotic. I didn't notice the flaws because it's a movie. Great acting,\nvery realistic acting. You have to stay for after the credits to be\nsatisfied and get the end. Here's why this was a great film: every film\nin Hollywood has been done before. There's really no originality\nanymore. That alone makes this a breath of fresh air and soothing. I\nhaven't seen a movie this unique in 10 years. An unforgettable, amazing\nmovie I didn't have any complaints. Neeson is at his best and does a\nsuperb acting job and gives a top performance. The supporting cast is\nalso decent. Surprisingly memorable supporting actors. This will go\ndown as a highly underrated film because people wanted action instead\nof art. Its a really good film. 10 times better than the Perfect Storm,\nwhich I instantly found was the closest film of its kind it resembled.\n"
"\nIt's not very often that I give up on a film half-way through, given\nthat I have already invested an hour or so, but I finally lost patience\nwith this absolute turkey of a movie. <br><br>How Liam Neeson agreed to be in this collection of utter twaddle is\nbeyond me. I don't necessarily expect movies to be completely realistic\nbut this one just doesn't hold together at all. The conduct of the\ncharacters is ludicrous, the animal behaviour of the wolves is\nunnatural, the special effects are poor and the script is ham-fisted\nwith every fourth word being \"strong language\". <br><br>My advice? Don't waste your time - I wish I hadn't.\n"
"\nthe grey is a about a man who is involved in plane crash and has to\nsurvive the cold wilderness whilst being hunted by wolves.<br><br>the starting to this movie is a bit slow but after the plane crash the\nfilm soon picks up. i loved the idea that Liam neeson would play the\nrole as he is one of my favourite actors.<br><br>the film was all about survival and they portrayed that really well.\nthe film in some ways was quite raw and scary as the wolves preyed\namongst everyone <br><br>i thought that the film was absolutely brilliant it will definitely be\none of my most favourite films of all time. i would recommend it if you\nfancy a thriller without loads of violence but still with a bit in.\n"
"\nI suspended disbelief for the hope of a good story, especially since I\nlike Liam Neeson. However, as this story grew less and less\ninteresting, the flaws really added up. I often ignore nonsense in a\nmovie in exchange for entertainment. Once I gave up on this film, I\nbegan to pick it apart. Forget the unrealistic behavior of the wolves,\nthe ending killed everything. Do a little math. Estimate the distance\nthey hiked from the plane and imagine that as a radius. Now create a\ncircle. What are the odds he lands in the den? The odds are not good.\nThrow in the giant cliff separating the den from the plane wreck and it\nbegins to make enjoying the movie very difficult. I saw good reviews of\nthis movie. I was excited to see this movie. However, it fell very\nshort of expectations. I was generous with a six due to Liam Neeson.\n"
"\nI watched this abomination of a movie, saw the cop-out ending, and\nquickly forgot about it. Until yesterday, when I heard that the film\nhad a surprise for me after the credits. So I took another look, and\nnow I have a new take on the movie. <br><br>So, if like me you took off after seeing the credits start rolling, you\nthink the film ends with the alpha wolf closing in on Leam Neeson as he\nstraps a knife and some shards of glass to his hands. But, after the\ncredits...SURPRISE!!! You see a heaving wolf chest with Leam's head\nresting upon it. Are they both dead??? Did one emerge victorious??? Did\nthey make mad passionate love??? <br><br>The movie still sucks.\n"
"\nThat would be better name for the film.<br><br>The script is so stupid and contrived that after a while a I was\nrooting for the wolves. Yes, The sooner they killed that sad lot, the\nbetter.<br><br>For a movie that deals with survival, shows what men have to do to\nsurvive under extreme conditions, \"The Grey\" is one of the most moronic\nmovies that I have ever watched. Not even trying to suspend disbelief,\nthis pile of wolf craps works. Simply put, the people portrayed in the\nstory did everything wrong. It is not a story of survival...<br><br>\"The Grey\" is the best example of what not do in this type of\nsituation.\n"
"\nThis is one of them films,you get emotionally attached to, its full of\naction and thrilling moments and some very sad. The characters are very\nwell known as the film goes on, and there personalities stand out\n(which you don't get in some films) which makes you want them want to\nsurvive,the wolves are very realistic and the graphics, appearance and\nsets of, this film is an over all stunner and would extremely recommend\nthis for anyone! I love this film because connection you get with it,\nbecause you want to watch more because all of the characters have\nstrong personalities and families so you want them to get out of there\nand stay alive, Liam neeson done an excellent performance and is the\nright person for that character, this movie is action packed, thrill\npacked, jumpy scenes and emotional all together makes the all round\nstunner... The Grey!\n"
"\nI'm not sure what is more stupid -- anyone who gives this movie more\nthan 3 stars or Liam Neeson for starring in it.<br><br>A 10 year old might find this movie scary.<br><br>I really hate when an actor makes a movie just for a paycheck. The\nactor sells a piece of their soul and reputation knowing people will\nwatch their new movie only to fail the audience completely, and of\ncourse collect a paycheck.<br><br>Liam Neeson must be burning thru his money at a pretty fast rate to\nlower himself to this all time low level movie.<br><br>My wife and I were embarrassed afterward for even watching it all the\nway thru. But....you pay 5 dollars to watch it on pay per view so we\nend up being pathetic to \"get our moneys worth\" and watch the whole\nthing.<br><br>I will now never \"expect\" a Liam Neeson movie to be good automatically\nafter this letdown of a movie. So sad.\n"
"\nWhat can I say that the other top reviews haven't already stated\nclearly. I totally agree that IMDb ratings are not to judge a film by\nanymore. How can this steaming pile of dog poo or should I say wolf poo\nget such a high rating. As I wrote in the Summary heading, it's boring,\ndepressing and completely unrealistic. The trailers completely scammed\nthe viewers by miss-selling the movie. I enjoy watching Liam Neeson's\nwork but this is abysmal. In future I will be reading the top reviews\nbefore committing to watch a movie and you can bet your bottom dollar\nthat it won't be the IMDb rating system that I'll be going by. If you\nwant to see a real survival action movie then check out Deliverance\nwhich even after 40 years kicks butt.\n"
"\nooh, where do I start? This movie is unrealistic, plain stupid and sooo\nboring. Those superwolves are everywhere, jump off a 30 feet cliff and\nthe first thing they see are some goddamn wolves... Feels like that is\nthe only thing this movie contains, MORE WOLVES!! And that scene where\nhe drowns is just awful, so awful. Getting stuck with his shoe between\nsome rocks so he is 5 cm away from getting air? And suddenly when Liam\nNeeson reaches the tree, all the stream, all the flooding, just\nmagically stops?? and he just chills the for a few minutes.. And then\ncarries on without a jacket or and freaking gloves. COME ON! gaah I\nhate this movie.\n"
"\n2nd worst film I have ever seen. Neeson is great as always, but this\nfilm is so stupid that some of the people in our theatre got enough and\njust left. We live here in the middle of snow, wolves, bears and this\nplot needs a UFO sideline or just about anything to make it ever\nremotely believable. So silly that it's almost a comedy. Luckily my GF\nhas a weird sense of humour and laughed a lot. Even better was that\nthis was her pick, so I got no blame. Mostly she reacted to the\n\"Frankenwolfs\" and the illogical decisions the characters made. I\nmyself am still a bit bitter that we went. Ten lines is much much too\nmuch trouble to fill for a film like this, but here I'm just adding\nwords to fill up the space. What else... Oh yes, the wolves do not\nattack grown up people. There has been some cases ages ago where small\nchildren have been attacked and those wolves have most likely been\npartly dogs (makes them unpredictable). Wolves do kill and eat dogs\neven here, but never people. Final words: really useful stuff for the\nMAD magazine.\n"
"\nThe survivor characterisations were shallow even by the standards of an\n'action film.' The anthropomorphism depicted by the wolves' behaviour\nwas risible,(as were the special effects, particularly the glowing\nwolves' eyes in the dark-----about 30cm apart by the look of 'em). The\ntenets of survival in a hostile environment are Protection (self),\nLocation (try to inform potential rescuers of), Water, Food. IN THAT\nORDER. So, faced with -20c and blowing 40kts, pursued by\nhyper-intelligent enormous wolves, our hero et al leaves the windbreak\nof the wrecked fuselage, (with fuel and possibly location devices), and\nhoofs off in search of? You've guessed it, food. Were it not for the\nclichÃ©s and expletives, there'd be no dialogue at all, (no bad thing\nperhaps). This is the silliest film I've sat through in a long time. I\nonly did so in the hope that: \"it must get better than this?\" It\ndidn't. How Ridley Scott allowed his name to be used on the credits,\nI'll never know. I was going to title this misguided hokum! But it's\nnot that good. Bilge is a better term for it.\n"
"\nThis is a movie to be watched by all adventure/Thriller genre liker's.\nThere are many reasons for that 1.This is a movie that's has been made\nout of a less clichÃ© ridden story. 2.This is as realistic as a\nHollywood movie has been made in terms of the gravity of a situation\nlike this 3.They have marvellously captured Alaska In snow.Some of the\nimages itself invoke feelings of great despair and its sheer beauty.\n4.Many of the reviewers have complained about how true is that wolves\nmay actually behave that way and that men would have died more so\nbecause of severe cold environment,which may be true but whats depicted\nin the movie is also a scenario that can happen ultimately its just a\nmovie that gives us some thrills. 5.But what sets it apart from all\nother movies in the same vein is its believable ending. So go watch it,\nbuy or rent its DVD one things for sure you will have a different kind\nof movie experience.\n"
"\nI had high hopes for this one going in, Neeson makes a good film and\nthe 'man stuck in the wilderness fighting for survival' premise looked\nan interesting one....fail!<br><br>The film is slow, so slow it felt like it was going backwards at some\npoints. The only highlights are the over the top deaths which spring up\nevery 10 minutes or so, if it's not insatiable wolves it's plane\ncrashes, frost bite or a good ol' fashioned drowning! Apart from these\nfleeting bits of action there's not a lot else too it. The suspense is\nweakened by the inane shots of the group walking through snow and the\nplot is well, well there isn't really a plot?<br><br>With a poor did he / didn't he die ending the whole thing is just\nlacking in content and delivery. Disappointing!\n"
"\nAm glad that I didn't listen to all the bad reviews. In fact I had\nsecond thoughts before I booked the tickets due to the bad reviews but\nmy wife persuaded me and am glad she did. Directed skillfully by\nCarnahan buoyed by beautiful backdrop and a gifted visual, he has\nmanaged to bring back Wolf Phobia. Liam Neeson was great as usual,\nmatter of fact this a bit different movie he has done in a while. The\nside actors have also done a terrific job and some scenes are really\nheart wrenching but never the less this movie was all about survival\nand people who like such movies will really enjoy, on second thoughts I\nthink everyone will enjoy. Pls don't go in with high expectation and a\ngreat story line, this movie is not about that.\n"
"\nMy wife kept seeing the previews on T.V. and insisted on seeing it. To\nkeep it simple, it's a horrible movie. Just no explanations of why\nthese guys did what they did. Example: They leave the safety of the\ncrash and wreckage that provided plenty of shelter and headed into the\nwoods knowing the wolves are in there. Sure, make firewood runs into\nthe woods during the day, but...weird. NEVER leave the crash site. It's\ncommon sense. The ending is the worst ending since the ending in Dutch\nTreat. The wolf is about to have it out with the lone survivor and it\nends. The credits roll. Everyone in the theater leaves. AFTER the\ncredits, the grand finally of the wolf/man fight! How were we to know?\nI just heard that's how it ends but I ain't wasting more money just to\nsee the very end. Why after the movie \"ends\" and credits roll? Who's\nidea was that? Folks, trust me. Een with that, the movie sucked...BAD!\n"
"\nIt's not awful, it has Liam neeson in it, that's worth something, but\ndamn, why'd he choose this lame script with predictable plot points,\n\"go on without me\" , yeah we will, because we knew you were gonna say\nthat at some point and now we wish the wolves Bonn appetite. It's also\ngot pseudo philosophy and convenient/stupid plot points. E.g. of all\nthe places in all of these wild frozen woods John Agua ends up in the\nwolves den. Or the ridiculous jump into the trees...what the hell, you\nguys know adults might be watching this film too. It's a poor plot and\na bad script but it has superb cinematography and Liam Neeson. We knew\nit'd be just him in the end but, you know, if they could have all these\nsilly nonsensical things going on throughout the film then why oh why\nare we denied the pleasure of seeing an Irishman fighting a wolf with\nmini shot bottles taped too his hand. Why are we fobbed off with this\npseudo intellectual \"what is death\" crap, you have no integrity, you\nproved it throughout the film, why you no give us our last hurrah?\n"
"\ni watched it last night with 6 people from different ages in the end of\nthe awful movie we all agreed it is bad ending with opened end .<br><br>i mean even the wolfs u can feel they are toys.<br><br>the time line of the movie is predictable.<br><br>and the end killed us.<br><br>and the thing with god all mighty how they dare to talk to him like\nthis.<br><br>he curse him and say help you ***** how they agree for this.<br><br>they should be ashamed and especially the \"Liam Neeson\".<br><br>i liked this actor and now i am not.\n"
"\nI can buy into the stretched premise of a pack of super-intelligent,\nsuper-aggressive wolfs chasing humans even at own peril, but only in\nthe horror genre.<br><br>An A-list actor like Liam Neeson doesn't associate with horror. His\npresence spells mainstream, and mainstream needs a credible plot, which\nthis film doesn't have.<br><br>I acknowledge the pluses: imagery and acting, but (after many other\nturns I couldn't buy, though could forgive) when the hero falls into a\nriver, then comes out and just keeps walking, soaking wet, in arctic\ntemperatures, the film lost me.\n"
"\npeople downvoting this movie because it is unrealistic miss the point.\nof course it's unrealistic! it's a movie! i wonder if these people also\ndownvote \"Avengers\". <br><br>besides that, \"The Grey\" is more poem and metaphor than documentary,\nfortunately.<br><br>this is not \"Taken\" with wolves. this is a very bitter, grim and\nmercieless story about keeping the will to life.<br><br>it does have action elements, but it is not an action movie. it is\nhighly suspenseful, but it is not an horror movie or thriller.<br><br>for me, it is the best movie this year. equally depressing, uplifting\nand touching. and liam neeson is bad-ass as someone can be.<br><br>10 stars! just perfect\n"
"\nThis movie is yet another evidence that movie production companies are\nsomehow influencing IMDb ratings. The average rating of this movie\nshouldn't be higher than 6 and when I say 6 I am extremely kind. I did\nnot have high expectations for this movie I just hoped for some\nbrainless action film for Friday evening after a long week. Well it was\nbrainless without doubt but not the way i hoped for. The whole movie is\ntotally unrealistic from top to end. When one is watching a good movie\none is sucked into the story and feels absorbed into the main\ncharacter. Well with this one there was not a single moment I didn't\nfeel myself as a critical observer. All the way through I was thinking\nhow can a script so poorly written, did they think this animation\nseriously?, this is ridiculous,etc Without wasting more of my time on\nthis poorly executed film I just warn you: Give yourself a favor and\nsave your money/time from this crap. I don't understand how on earth\ncan someone think this movie deserves 7.1 rating?\n"
"\nSpoilers !!! You couldn't spoil this movie if you beat it to death with\nan axe. By the time the end of this movie arrives and Ottway is left on\nhis own to fight the alpha male armed only with a small selection of\nminiature whiskies anything could have happened. It would have come as\nno great surprise if a flying saucer had majestically swooped down from\nthe sky to Ottway's rescue. As this is my first review I was rather\nhoping to write something in a more positive manner. But there are no\nredeeming qualities. At times I found myself laughing, sometimes I was\nopen mouthed in disbelief. At least it did remind me why I now mainly\nwatch foreign language films. The biggest issue with this movie was\nthat Ottway did not shoot himself at the start. In fact he could have\ndone us all a favour and shot the cameras filming this rubbish.\n"
"\nIt's great movie, it makes me think. With the grit within his act, Liam\nNeeson is at his best to present the director's point.<br><br>Liam Neeson appears to be a man in grief, for him the meaning of life\nis love and being deeply loved, but sometime love fade, then comes the\npain, and he numb the pain by try to avoid human connection, so he lost\nthe meaning. Long to suicide, he failed to commit it.<br><br>And then, the plane crush.<br><br>The crush suddenly gives him a task, a test. The survivors need his\nexperience, and when a man is needed in such situation, we won't back\noff. After a Hollywood style walkthrough of wild survival struggle\n(it's good but the point is not stand in there), the meaning of a life\ndisconnected from love, which seems so vague in the start, finally\nshapes itself. <br><br>The Grey remind me of Smith in the Matrix. He would say, the meaning of\nlife is to end. Sorry Smith, the meaning of life is up to everyone. It\ncould be love, could be a great purpose, or something else.\n"
"\nWhat made this movie so disappointing for me was that it begins well\nand my expectations where that this was going to be a great story. I\nstayed with it because i kept thinking the scenario is such that there\nwas a great story in there and it would develop. I wish someone could\nhave rescued me. I'm not sure what was the worst thing in this schlock,\nwas it the ridiculous confused wolf puppets or was it the completely\nstupid antics of the hero and his mindless followers.<br><br>These guys had the ingenuity of a drowning blow fly. i mean come on,\nthey had knives and fire! They kept leaving each other alone! This\nmovie was direction-less and the plot was so vague it was like watching\nthe editors off cuts. Oh boy what a waste of money. Liam baby, your\nbetter than this!\n"
"\nI liked to watch the movie, for one because Liam Neeson is playing the\nleading role, and again he did a good job. The Grey isn't a movie based\non reality, or a true story like the movie The Way Back were also a\ngroup of men had to survive in the wilderness. if you like to see a\nsuspense movie were people get picked of one by one like in Alien, but\ninstead of on a spaceship the setting is Alaska and the Aliens are\nreplaced by Wolves. The acting in the movie is good, it doesn't come\nover like a cheap style of movie with bad acting, the only thing thats\nto bad is you don't really get to see the wolves that well until far in\nto the movie and than only a couple of seconds. Don't get me wrong its\nstill a good movie to watch, Ones you start the movie its easy to watch\nit till the end.\n"
"\nA bunch of guys in Alaska survive a plane crash and have to fight the\nfreezing weather and fend off wolves, Liam Neeson is the wolf expert\nleading them.<br><br>If you take this as a serious epic survival movie, you will be\ndisappointed, too many factual errors (not freezing to death after a\ndive in the river, wolves appearing out of nowhere immediately after\nthe characters jumped off an impossible cliff, mauling a guy and be\nthoughtful enough to leave his wallet). The wolves feel more like\nsomething out of a horror film than an actual threat of nature. Not one\ncharacter puts up a fight before dying, if Neeson is supposed to be\nsome kind of inspiration it wasn't showing.<br><br>If you take this as a fun flick where everyone dies, you will again be\ndisappointed, it's just unbelievably dull. There's hardly any action at\nall and the wolves just randomly jump on someone when he least expects\nit alien and predator style.<br><br>You've been warned.\n"
"\nOK but it lacked research and realistic series of events.<br><br>I will say it is unrealistic, poor survival techniques researched,\nunlikely random series of events and in no way would they not build\nbetter weapons! Why do they just assume no one is coming? Everyone\nknows airplanes have black boxes and Global Positioning Satellite\nlocator's. Why couldn't they have barricaded themselves in the plane\nfor protection and kill wolves for food? Good chance if they are not\nfound in 48 hours they will be found in a week! <br><br>I'm not saying it wasn't entertaining it just had me saying \"as if\"\nthroughout the movie.\n"
"\nthe movie was awesome on all levels. it kept me an edge throughout the\nmovie and Liam Neeson at his best next to taken but he done a amazing\njob and is a movie worth watching. if you like a good suspense movie\nthis is one to see. it will leave you on edge all the way to the end.\ngreat movie and great plot i loved it and will watch it again. just\nfrom the battle of the harsh cold temps, to the harsh weather, and the\nbattle of fierce sum wolves it couldn't get any better <br><br>key points; the grey in my opinion goes beyond the color grey. there\nare multiple meanings and there is one in particular that i think fits\nthe movie perfectly but to not spoil the movie i recommend looking at\nthe different meanings of grey. and pay attention to each characters\npast they'll help at the end. thank you and i hope you enjoy the movie\nlike i did\n"
"\nA film out of the Hollywood pipeline that seems like anything but.\nBrutal, gritty yet teeming with subtle ideas as big and compelling as\nthe Alaskan vistas that provide the film's backdrop, \"The Grey\" is a\nfilm of barren beauty, suggestive, at moments, of the grandeur and\nmystique of a Tarkovsky film, and clearly intended for audiences more\nsophisticated than those Hollywood usually targets. The casting is\nterrific, a small group of actors offering up a set of superbly\ndelineated characters and Neeson is in great form. Though still early\nin 2012, critics will be reserving a space for this title on their top\npicks lists. Simply, I was stunned.\n"
"\nOK so first off the reason why I decided to write a review is partly in\nresponse to these IDIOTs who are slating it for not being realistic in\nthe behaviour of wolf packs.... If you want a documentary-realistic\nfilm then... well don't watch the film.. or any film for that matter -\nstay home in your slippers and watch the Discovery Channel! Its like\nThe Da Vinci Code reviews all over again - people, we are watching a\nFILM - a MOVIE, STORY, not a documentary so who cares if it doesn't\nperfectly portray the behaviour of Wolves... if it did, it WOULD suck!<br><br>So for the movie review - WELL... If you want an eerie atmosphere and a\nfun, exciting, intense movie then this IS for you!!!!! A great film,\nand not being a fan of Liam Neeson's acting, I have to say, he did VERY\nwell..... Think the movie Taken but with big bad ass Wolves and better\nacting! ALSO - make sure you watch it till AFTER the credits finish ;)<br><br>GREAT FILM!\n"
"\nI just saw the premier of \"The Grey\" and I loved it. It was all action\nand thrills. My hands were gripped the whole time. The whole cast was\nIncredible and real. I was shivering in my seat from the cold whether\nthey were In, as well as the fear they were surrounded by. I don't want\nto give anything away, but you must see this movie. It was mostly about\nsurviving the most unbelievable trenches to try to save their lives for\ntheir families.<br><br>I really felt for the Characters and truly got engaged in their\nsurvival. Of course Liem Neeson was amazing as usual. I can't wait to\nsee this movie again. Just be prepared to have an exciting time at the\nmovies.\n"
"\nThis movie is a gem period! 10/10 and hands down Liam's best. Don't\nlisten to the critics!!! If you like wilderness themes, survival,\nsuspense, and horror then this is your movie. Watch it and enjoy you\nwill not be disappointed I promise. I couldn't understand the bad\nreviews? I believe this movie will someday be considered a classic.\n"
"\nAmazing from beginning to end. Liam and the cast were amazing!<br><br>I laugh at those idiots that gave this a bad review. If they didn't\nfigure out what type of movie this was going to be from the previews\nand then you paid money to go see it, then give yourself a low score\nfor being a stupid. Get a life and stop posting negative dumb reviews.\n"
"\nI respect those who view this as a dark existential tale about the\nsavagery of the world and the inevitability of death. Nevertheless the\nfilm left me cold (no pun intended). A group of men are stranded in a\nfrozen wilderness and eventually succumb to the cold and a ravenous\npack of wolves. So what? The story is unexceptional in the sense that\nthis is what would normally happen. Yes, the performances are strong.\nLiam Neeson is as usual excellent, but what's the point? Yes, people\nare often quite brave in the face of death even when they do not\nsurvive. Believe me I've seen it. But the film is unnecessarily\nnegative. We do sometimes triumph over evil. I'm thinking of the\nexcellent biography of Lou Zamperini \"Unbroken\", which shows how much\nan individual can endure and still prevail. Especially in these\ntroubled times this is what we must tell ourselves, because, ultimately\nthat's the truth.\n"
"\nOverall decent movie, The acting was good, not really any good\ncharacter development at all, i liked the main character but again\nthere was no action and no depth,aside from the depressing message of\nthere being no God and the absurdity of life. The point of watching a\nmovie is either to be entertained, sometimes stimulate your mind, this\nmovie did neither for me, who wants to leave the movie theater\ndepressed. I'm not completely knocking it down because i'm sure some\nwill enjoy it if they share the belief of the message the movie tries\nto make and as i said the acting was good. Anyway...promising at the\nbeginning...then i got disappointed. nothing to watch again.\n"
"\nFirstly, I mention that The Grey remains a genuinely gripping survival\nstory and a refreshing change from stale urban action flicks. It is a\ngood film. I recommend it. It is very excited. But its ending is not\nattractive. It is quite a survival tragic tale, it's not deep at all\nbut you'll feel every bit of sadness in characters.<br><br>I just can't imagine how Neeson survived and thrown out that far from\nother survivors when he strapped himself by two seat belts. Also, I\nthink that while the wolves are in danger of being wiped out, this\nmovie is only going to serve in maligning these poor animals more than\nthey already are! Wolves to don't attack people. Wolves attacking\npeople is totally out of character for them and it seems to only happen\nin the movies! Please put a disclaimer at the start of this movie so\npeople know the truth! After all, main character is a wonderful actor.\nHe acted his role out perfectly.\n"
"\nReading reviews a lot of 1 stars are given due to the fact that they\nleave the plane when they should have stayed put, which is correct, it\nmakes little sense wandering around in deep snow getting picked off by\nthe wolves. The same logic applies to horror movies, people wander off\nalone in a house with a serial killer on the loose, its called\nENTERTAINMENT, with out it we would watch an hour and a half of boring\npeople huddled in a room, a bit like big brother.<br><br>Anyway the film, this could be a science fiction movie of survivors in\nan alien world being attacked by aliens, forget that the wolves simply\ndo not act like wolves. I thought Liam Neeson was excellent, his world\nweary approach, his realisation there is no god just an uncaring\nuniverse, which is indifferent to you living or dying.\n"
"\nA few more survivors and a different animal and this added up to a\ncheap version of The Edge. And I really was hoping it was like The Edge\njust with the wolves taking the place of a giant grizzly bear.\nUnfortunately, that was not even close to what this movie was. I am not\nsure if this is a spoiler but the animal scenes looked to be straight\nout of a B horror movie. I also could find nothing to take away from\nmovie and I don't think I can say that about any other Liam Neeson\nmovie that I have ever seen. I honestly could not wait until this movie\nwas on Netflix and I was so excited that I was going to be able to\nfinally watch the movie. However, what I think was a great idea for a\nmovie in my opinion turned out to be a huge disappointment.\n"
"\nHow a bunch of Alaskan oil-rig workers, and a hunter, can make so many\nstupid survival decisions is beyond me. They appear to come to all the\nwrong conclusions for all the right reasons. If you've got even a\nlittle bit of knowledge about wolves, or survival in an arctic\nenvironment, this film will leave you smacking your forehead and\nscreaming \"You idiots!\" at the screen.<br><br>The wolves are hokey, and far too big to represent the typical wolves\nfound in Alaska. Furthermore, the behaviors exhibited were not entirely\naccurate.<br><br>Worse still, the supposed expert played by Liam Neeson appears to know\nnext to nothing about wolves, and leads the survival party toward the\nonly cover, in the mistaken belief that the wolves don't den there. As\nthe end of the movie reveals, the character is a moron.<br><br>Too bad, this movie had a good premise, but terrible execution.\n"
"\nI was left disappointed by this film. The storyline itself is\ninteresting and there was so much potential for suspense and drama but\nin the end I was left rather uninspired and let down.<br><br>I found the context of the plot to be poorly detailed for several\nreasons. The main reason being that if you are being stalked/hunted by\na pack of murderous wolves, why would you:<br><br>1) Have no weapons in your hands for self-defence? 2) Have large gaps\nbetween each person, making it easy for the wolves to pick off the last\nman? 3) Walk without having look outs in each direction to ensure\nyou're not being circled?<br><br>So for me, despite moments of intensity the film was rather limp with\ninsufficient focus on the details and I found a lot of it implausible.<br><br>Thanks james\n"
"\nIf I were to rate \"The Grey\" on the first 30 min of it's runtime it\nwould get around 7/10. Unfortunately writer and director Joe Carnahan\nflubbed the majority and remainder of the movie badly. (spoiler)\nStarring Liam Neeson as a fatalistic but reserved hunter in the\nFreezing Bush after miraculously surviving a plane crash, this movie is\na classic example of a story likely re-edited too much. Dialog is\nwholly awful, dreary, boring and wandering. It' meaningless and devoid\nof substance from the 2nd half on. The cinematography of the wolves is\noften sub-par. The end of the movie leaves you scratching your head -\nwhile it could be realistic given the circumstances, it cheapens and\nhighlights just how excruciating the last hour of dialog has been.How\nthis movie averages a \"7\" from general users and how it got green-lit\ninto production is beyond me. Not recommended.\n"
"\nI had to make an account to argue my point. Everyone who is saying all\nthe events are unrealistic and that the wolfs behavior is laughable.\nYes i agree, but its a movie, Just like most horror movie it is\nunrealistic. Its a fantastic story, a great plot, good acting and good\ncamera work. Its not a documentary so don't judge it but how plausible\nit is. How good would the movie be if the Wolfs were scared and acted\nlike they would of in real life? It would just be a normal story of\nsurvival in the Snow. I thoroughly enjoyed the movie, it drew me in and\ni was almost upset at the end. The main character at 60 years old has\nproved himself still worthy of been a Star Actor.<br><br>Great job to the crew 9/10<br><br>I am not a very good review writer but i had to express my opinions.\n"
"\nA harsh, bitter, introspective survival picture that wasn't at all what\nI expected from the trailers. What the film chooses to do, it does very\nwell - the suspense is so thick that my neck muscles remained in a\nstiff vice grip for hours, and the constant landscape shots are\nawe-inspiring - but those wildly successful qualities come at the\nexpense of others. It's not a story with a firm resolution, which is\nsure to polarize a lot of viewers, and most of its intentions are left\nambiguous. Liam Neeson is his typical commanding, badass self, but\ndespite a few action hero moments he makes some boneheaded mistakes and\nhis leadership qualities leave a lot to be desired. I've read that the\nplot is a metaphor for existentialism, which makes plenty of sense in\nreflection, but in the heat of the moment it feels desolate and\nhopeless. That innate duality makes it a complicated picture to rate; I\nwasn't oblivious to its faults, but still found it a dense, intriguing\nand enveloping experience. Worth watching, even if you wind up hating\nit.\n"
"\nThe Grey is really a great movie and it's plot is quite interesting. As\nI was watching the characters try to survive, a part of me felt that I\nwas in the movie with them, hoping for salvation. The only part I\ndidn't like is that yes, the nature of the wolves and their behavior is\nunrealistic, but I tried to forget about it and just enjoy the movie.\nIf it was realistic, the movie would have ended in 30 minutes with\neveryone been rescued. Having the wolves behave like that provided an\nextra threat which made up the movie. Even though the wolves weren't\nrealistic, the rest of the story was. The ending was really amazing in\nmy opinion, and I can't think of a better one for this movie. I\nrecommend this film to everyone.\n"
"\ncritics of this movie are missing a big point of the movie. it's not\nnecessay to be purely accurate with respect to wolve life and nature.\nthe story convey a couple important points, expression of life itself.\na lot of truth in it.<br><br>The movies is done extremely well and the point is illustrated\nextremely in the actions, reactions of the men. the message are brought\nin a fashionable way, intriguing, action packed even.<br><br>Joe Carnahan score points for an excellent screenplay. Liam Neeson is\nstill a formidable actor with explosive and emotional action scenes.\nInteresting additional characters as well with different views and\nopinions make for interesting themes to think about...<br><br>Survival of the fittest!!! Go see it, it'll touch a lot of heart.... ti\ncould be watched again.\n"
"\nI watched this movie and I've heard a lot of talk about how good this\nfilm was, and I wasn't disappointed. It grabbed me from the first\nscene's and didn't let me down. The story was well done and the scenery\nwas just as good. I like Liam Neeson film's and I know a lot of people\ndon't but I don't care, he was again great in this movie. I could watch\nit again and again and still enjoy it. Yes I know that the wolves don't\nact the way they did in this film but again I don't care. Do any of the\nanimals in thriller/horror movies act the way they should? No! The\ncharacters were played well too and they made me feel for them and had\nme wanting them to make it through their ordeals. So in summary I give\nthis movie a solid 8 out of 10.\n"
