"\nI am now trying to find words to describe this movie for an hour. I\ncouldn't.<br><br>You've seen it, or you haven't. It's monumental and outrageously good.<br><br>The cast is brilliant. The jokes lovely. The story and the idea behind\nthe movie is beautiful. Especially when you've worked/lived with\nhandicapped people. The music is such a perfect choice, it is\nunbelievable.<br><br>I hope this movie makes a plenty of people think about how good their\nlife is and how bad it could have been.<br><br>Bottom line: Oscar-worthy. Period.\n"
"\nThis movie surprised us. We checked on IMDb and saw 8/10 for a french\nmovie, without hesitation we went to the movie theatre to watch the\nmovie.<br><br>The subject is hard but the movie is really funny. In a few seconds you\nare fully projected within the film from the beginning to the end.\nThere is no special effet but the actors are playing very well and the\nmovie is based on a real story.<br><br>If you are skeptical for French movie don't be for this one ... it is a\nmust see movie.<br><br>Enjoy the movie.\n"
"\nWell, I've just got out of the theater and i must say that all the\nreviews are right. this is an amazing film! The actors are simply the\nbest, Omar is not only a great comic but also a great actor.<br><br>The filming has a certain touch that brings to mind \"What's Eating\nGilbert Grape\" in the way the director was able to capture not only the\nsuffering of Phillip but also the joy.<br><br>Not wanting to spoil the film for others, i highly recommend seeing\nthis in the theaters and with a loved one.<br><br>It is also a good film for teenagers as it holds a few wonderful life\nlessons.<br><br>Enjoy.\n"
"\nJust seen last night, amazing movie, great performances from actors,\nparticularly from Omar, and Cluzet is great as usual. Photography of\nimages are great, supported by good choice of locations supporting\nactors are all good and natural so doing a great job to give a great\nsolid base to the story. RIch of emotions on a simple story where\nordinary people become extraordinary. Good representation of social\ndifferences in France without being too heavy on it. Simple, beautiful,\nefficient, like a good French cuisine, making a great dish full of\ntastes magically mixed :) Most to be watched and even more emotional\nwhen you know its based on true story !\n"
"\nI CANNOT BELIEVE that \"Bridesmaids\" is nominated for an Oscar, just\nlike Brad Pitt for his completely boring and not convincing part in\n\"Moneyball\", when in 2011 such a great movie was made!!! Did the\nAcademy even see this?<br><br>It's a shame and in my opinion proves that the \"Academy Awards\" are\njust ridiculous and have nothing to do with good film and acting. <br><br>Francois Cluzet's performance is outstanding, as is Omar Sy and the\nstory is just lovely and touching in a wonderful non-Hollywood way.\n(REMAKE? ARE YOU KIDDING ME?)<br><br>Spread the word and enjoy this beautiful movie!!!\n"
"\nSometimes u pick a movie and straight away u feel it is going to be a\nspecial one. I had that feeling with intouchables ,The story of poor\nmeets rich is not a new one ,but this story is in a strange way\ndifferent. This movie shows we basically are all human, no matter what <br><br>.Due to the very big contrast of differences on almost everything it is\nvery unlikely they would meet each other ,but they met each other on\nthe right moment for both .As i don't want to spoil everything, i would\nlike to add this is in my honest opinion the best movie from 2011 along\nwith incendies.The acting was tremendous and i liked every second of it\n.<br><br>This movie is very funny and laughable but there are a lot messages in\nit ,it has the right balance of funny and serious so it doesn't turn in\nto a comedy enjoy and don't doubt to watch it.\n"
"\nThis was for sure one of the Top5 or Top10 movies I've ever seen. The\nactors, the ambiente, the story ... simply everything was in a perfect\ncombination. This film is for me in a league with films like \"The\nElephant Man\", but for a much wider audience. And as the title say,\nafter this film I really have to consider to reduce my ratings for\nseveral films, because it seems a bit unfair to put them on the same\nlevel as this film, although I don't have anything to criticize on them\nat all. All the persons in the film are very authentic played. And both\nmain characters surprised me with a brilliant performance. I would say,\nthat both actors are really what they are playing in the film. If I\nwould see François Cluzet in the street, I would be surprised not\nseeing him in a wheelchair. The emotions shown in the last sequence of\nthe film are so brilliant.\n"
"\nThis movie completely brought magic to my life. I don't remember the\nlast time I've seen such an awesome movie.<br><br>At the moment, this is my favorite movie.<br><br>I had a bad opinion about the French people but after watching this\nmovie my opinion has changed. I've learned a lot after watching it.\nWhat did I learn ? Holding everything I have to the most, loving\neveryone I have on my life and really living your life.<br><br>This movie makes you want to get out and breathe, loving your world,\nhow beautiful it is.<br><br>I completely recommend it, I've rated it 10 out of 10.<br><br>I'm sorry for any mispelling as English is not my primary language.\n"
"\nThis is one of the best movies we have ever seen. My wife and I see 3\nmovies a week on average over The past 40 years. Saying it is one of\nthe best is quite a statement. This French movie with sub titles is\nsimply Spectacular. The storyline involves a man crippled in An\naccident, his wife has passed away and he cannot Find adequate help\nwhich he requires 24/7. Until he meets the Most unlikely of people to\ncare for him. The acting by Omar Sy &amp; Mr. Cluzet Is the very best. The\nmovie has everything you want in a Movie. It has compassion and is\nspectacularly Funny. Run to see this movie. The two prime Actors must\nbe recognized for a whole host Of awards. Wow!\n"
"\nI can't remember when I've been so moved by a movie or story. The power\nof love and interconnection, and learning how to care for someone else\nbesides yourself are strong themes in this movie. It was funny,\ntouching, tragic and wonderful all at the same time. For why are why\nhere on this planet if not to take care of each other and impact each\nothers' lives? These actors I've never seen took me on an amazing ride\nthat I'll not soon forget. It is amazing how two people can affect each\nother so deeply. Absolutely one the best movies I've ever seen. <br><br>I went to the movie with my sisters, dad and husband. My dad is frail\nand my husband helped him to the restroom during the movie. Life is so\nfragile, but we prop each other up and that is how we get through it\nall.\n"
"\nA typical, wonderful, french film, full of surprises that grip the mind\nand the heart, being an Englishman living in France and having a good\ngrip on the French language this film enveloped me like a cozy blanket\non the sofa on a Sunday.<br><br>The Acting is marvelous, the scripting is genius, and the Paris 'decor'\nhelps to give it a certain romance between the 2 principal actors.<br><br>A must see even if you can't understand French get yourself an\nauto-translator or take some french student with you that can translate\n\"en-direct\".<br><br>Go watch it!\n"
"\nI love French movies, so different from typical Hollywood stuff full of\nspecial effects but often with lack of depth in stories.<br><br>This movies is so simple, humane, deep. It's about what should happen\nmore often, great friendship between two so different persons who are\nable to go beyond prejudices and stereotypes. It's not a sad movie at\nall, like it could sound to some people, and it's absolutely not racist\nlike I have read somewhere else in the comments. I suggest to all\npeople to go and watch this, you will go out of the cinema with\nsomething great you have learned and seen. It's definitely the best\nmovies I have seen this year so far.\n"
"\nBy just looking at the front-cover for this movie, I could imagine this\nwould be something good. The beginning really got me into it and I just\nwanted to see what would happen later in the movie. It did not take\nlong before I actually felt that I was in their lives. From start to\nthe end I was just stunned by all emotions this movie gave out.<br><br>I had never thought that I was both going to laugh and cry at the same\ntime, just to mention I am not that guy who easily get affected by a\nmovie. This was something really impressing! To all out there who not\nhave seen this movie, I really recommend doing it. You may be thinking\nthis is a another boring drama, but after seeing it I can tell it is\nmore than drama. Comedy mixed with love, feelings and friendship makes\nthis movie something out of its own.\n"
"\nThis movie is excellent.<br><br>Actors are very good and touch you on many levels. It is funny, it is\nserious and has a story to tell which won't leave you intouché.<br><br>First I though this is going to be more or less a cultural film for a\nselected audience. But this wasn't true at all. This is a film for the\nbroad audience, and I think it can be appreciated by everybody.<br><br>I don't know if this film has been dubbed in English, it will certainly\nlose some of it charisma. If you understand french, then get it in the\noriginal voice.<br><br>Give it a try, you won't be disappointed. It is a beautiful movie.\n"
"\nThe actors give good performances here but the script, and the movie,\nultimately is ridden with clichés and not terribly sympathetic. Anyone\nparalyzed in this manner deserves sympathy, but if you have a vast\nfortune, an army of caretakers, and every imaginable comfort and\nresource you may need less sympathy than some others. Why did the\nfilmmakers transform a North African (Muslim?) caretaker into a\nSenegalese? Why is this black African's conformity to every cliché --\npot-smoking, violent, rap music, he even dances well -- supposed to be\nrefreshing, either to Philippe or the viewer? So much was simply\nartificial -- dressing Philippe like a doll, playing with his beard and\nhair, the caricature of the other applicants, the behavior of the\nadopted daughter -- or further clichés -- e.g. the police. Mildly\namusing at times, way too long, just watchable.\n"
"\nI saw this title and I was really skeptical to the storyline : \"Another\ncomedy drama that will neither make you live the story alongside the\ncharacters (feel their emotions) nor will it make you laugh\" that is\nwhat i thought. But men was i wrong. I love the way François Cluzet and\nOmar Sy play in this movie ; so natural , so good. I lived every second\nof the movie like it was my life. I came to like Driss and Philippe as\nreal characters and now at the end of the movie i wonder where did they\ngo. That is the kind of emotion this movie generates. It has everything\nyou could expect from a great movie : story, characters, laughs and\ncries, tension and so on. You won't regret seeing this movie alone or\nwith someone. I appreciate great work when i see it and this film made\nme take into consideration seeing more french movies as it improved my\nopinion on them. Enjoy this movie and every frame of it :D.\n"
"\nIntouchables is a very nice movie about a man in a wheelchair and his\ncaretaker-buddy who injects life in the boring life of the man. The\nperformances are really good and in the case of Omar unexpectedly good\ngiven his little experience.There are many humorous scenes in this film\nbut the overall climate is depressing. The reason I give it a 7 is\nbecause it isn't deep enough and you don't get to know the characters\nvery well, maybe a little more screenplay time would be for the best.\nAlso the ending wasn't really satisfying and left you a bit incomplete.\nBut overall, you won't regret watching Intouchables, I guarantee you\nthat!\n"
"\nThis is my first time stepping to the other side, from been a viewer to\nbeen a reviewer. <br><br>This film made me do it. It shook me and made me realize that when you\nhave nothing to lose then you have all to earn. It start with two mans\nthat are in the lowest points of there lives. They are so different yet\nso connected. It will show you that you don't need to judge by look or\nby color and anyone can have a chance to influence the life of the\nother.<br><br>I will not say any more but this: Go and see this movie. this is a once\nin a lifetime.\n"
"\nAfter watching this beautiful film I felt two things. Shame at my prior\nlaziness for avoiding any non-English speaking films and excitement for\nthe wealth of films I am about to discover. There is a film world\noutside of the UK and USA. Anyway I haven't much to say about the film,\nyou'll get a good incite into it by watching the trailer. From the\nsubject matter I assumed at some point during the film I would need\ntissues to dry my tears which would have made reading subtitles\ndifficult but thankfully I didn't. At times its sad but is also\nuplifting throughout. Its just a lovely film and may throw caution to\nthe wind by watching it again without the subtitles!\n"
"\nI was almost unknown to French Cinema, until two years back watched \"\nTell no One \" one of the best thriller I ever seen and I become fan of\nFrancois Cluzet.<br><br>The Intouchables is an excellent movie to watch.<br><br>The acting from all leading roles are really good, they lived their\ncharacters.<br><br>Movie has emotions, jokes, funny situations &amp; gives positive thoughts\nto look at life.<br><br>One word, go and watch the movie<br><br>10/10 for movie<br><br>10/10 to Francois Cluzet\n"
"\nWithout giving away too much, this was simply one of the best movies I\nhave seen in a very, very long time! It has humor, life lessons,\nfriendship, love, etc. There are so many emotions, but mainly laughter\nand humor that really touches you. The acting is superb and all people\nof all ages, genders, backgrounds can really enjoy this movie. You\nwould be foolish not to see this film. <br><br>I have read that they want to remake this movie in America, however, I\ndon't see why they should do such a thing. It is perfect exactly the\nway it is. Nothing about the movie needs to be changed one bit.\nAbsolutely Oscar-worthy - saddens me that it was made in 2011 and this\nis the first I had heard of it. It leaves you with a warm, fuzzy\nfeeling inside.<br><br>Don't miss it - you will be sorry!!\n"
"\nWatch it to see what life's all about. Watch it to find out what\nfriendship's all about. Watch it to hear some amazing music. Watch it\nto see how to live your life even when you think it's too hard\nsometimes. Watch it if you still don't believe life is wonderful. Watch\nit if you're bored with your life, if you think there's no point or no\nhope. Watch it if you've stopped enjoying simple things. The plot is\nsimply thrilling, the acting as well,with a large amount of extremely\ngood humour plus a great deal of equally amazing music. You have to be\ncareful, however, as once you've watched the movie for the first time\nyou will not be able to keep your mind off it and the beautiful music\nmakes it even more difficult... Watch it. :]\n"
"\nThis movie is so good that we watched it twice in two days. Such\nfriendship honest, true and natural is something to be jealous about in\nthe most positive way. A big surprise, so it needs a lot of very\npositive comments because you do not want to miss this one. Although\nyou may think this is a dramatic movie, it is actually more a very warm\nmovie loaded with very good humor. The trailers, advertisement and also\nthe Dutch tittle actually first put us of to watch this movie. Then it\nis also a French movie so normally that comes with a lot of not too\npositive expectations. This all is easily overwon within just the first\nfew minutes of the movie but gets totally shattered the longer the\nmovie lasts.\n"
"\nA comedy like that is tough to master. Balancing the funny and the\ndramatic stuff and still keep enough character development inside. And\nwhile I wouldn't say that both characters really redeem themselves\n(wholly), it gives them nice touches. Touches that include quite a lot\nof non-PC behavior (be alert and do not watch, if you are sensible to\nthat sort of thing).<br><br>It is a french comedy with heart. And it was a sleeper hit in Germany.\nWord of mouth made this a big success. A bit of credit has to go to the\npeople who dubbed it I guess (I watched the original version with\nsubtitles), because they must have done a phenomenal job. It is not\nperfect, but that fact makes it even weirder and more adorable\n"
"\nIn these days, in my country, the movie Intouchables is ranked very\nhigh in box office. Usually French films are not that popular or\nfamiliar in this country's movie industry. Therefore it is quite\nsurprising to see that people are very eager to see Intouchables, a\nfilm from France. At first, it was not famous to people at all because\npromotions were not big for the movie. However, as time goes by,\nIntouchables is getting bigger and bigger. Almost every person who\nwatched the movie tells to friends or writes review on the internet\nthat Untouchables is a amazing film. And I think that is a real and\nsuccessful marketing.<br><br>I also watched it today, and I definitely recommend this film just like\nothers did to me. So fun, moving, beautiful. While watching the movie,\nthe audiences including me burst into laughter or tears for every\nsingle second. very priceless moment.\n"
"\nThis is a truly excellent french film which highlights themes from love\nto comedy. I really enjoyed the music which went with the movie as it\ncaptured the mood of the (based on a true story) storyline. The main\npiece was Fly by Ludovic Einaudi. The actors play a splendid role to\ndepict the life of the real paralysed man and real carer.I only watched\nthis last night and i watched the original - in french. It is a very\nrecent film filmed in Paris and i find this film suits any watcher for\nthe reason that it contains both high-up, posh lifestyles compared to\n\"chavs\" smoking and speeding Maserati's. The Humour is captured best in\nthe original version as i would imagine a few humorous jokes may not\nwork in translated English. I Loved it.\n"
"\nWow. That's all I can say about this movie. The fact that it's based on\na true story is all the more amazing, and I immediately looked up the\npeople the movie was based on as soon as it ended. <br><br>Once in a while, a movie comes along that elicits emotions from deep\nwithin the heart. You don't know how it's going to end and you are\nsmiling when the movie is over, wishing there was more. I usually don't\nlaugh out loud while watching a movie but found myself doing so because\neven the jokes in this movie were so genuinely funny without being\ncrass.<br><br>Both the lead actors did a wonderful job. The chemistry between them\ncan be felt and you really feel as if you are watching the story unfold\nin front of you and not on the screen. All the characters were well\ndeveloped in their own roles and there were no loose ends (something\nmost movies neglect to tie up). <br><br>Watch this movie. You will surely recommend it to others as I am doing\nright now.\n"
"\nIf u only could see one movie from 2012 u should pick this one. This is\na wonderful film about the relation between two persons who you never\ncould think would be friends. Omar Sy and Francois Cluzet is the\nperfect choice of actors. What really touched me was the sort of\nhonesty their relation proceeded in and that its not always the\nconventional way who is the best way to go, you always have to\nunderstand that all people are and should be treated as who they are\nand not by a manual.The change in Omar Sy,s character is wonderful to\nwatch and he, well deserved, won a Cesar for hes performance.All the\ncharacters in the film are very likable and i strongly recommend this\nmovie for all ages, this is a feel-good movie with a ll the right stuff\nin it!\n"
"\nTo be honest I didn't even know this was a foreign film, till I started\nwatching. I saw it on IMDb's best since 2011 list and decided to give\nit a shot.<br><br>This was a fantastic story that was portrayed brilliantly. It left me\nsmiling nearly the whole movie.<br><br>Any person that just likes a good story about life, friendship,\nhardship, and man overcoming his fears(no matter how small), this is a\nmovie for you.<br><br>still smiling... <br><br>:)\n"
"\nAnother great film from the French film industry that made a great echo\nall over the globe. All this with a low budget and a story inspired by\ntrue events. The tetra person was played very convincing by François\nCluzet. Omar Sy delivered a surprising and respectable performance. I\nfind that the Intouchables should deserve at least an Oscar. I laughed\na lot about all the funny jokes and adventure scenes. Each one of the\nsequences had lot of emotions and every detail of the handicapped man\nwas well studied. The running time was not too long for me. I didn't\nexpect such a beautiful happy end. Just see it and let you surprise how\nnice it is. 10/10.\n"
"\nIt's quite rare to find and have the pleasure to enjoy a genuine movie,\nblending comedy and drama with such naturalness: that's why\n\"Intouchables\" is undoubtedly a rare authentic picture and the fact\nthat the story is inspired by a true one helped make the movie more\ninvolving. Funny and touching at the same time, the picture evolves\nwith simplicity but strong pathos, with the merit of avoiding every\npathetic or melodramatic attitude: there's brutal honesty in\nrepresenting the real condition of Philippe, as well as Driss's initial\nuncompassionate attitude. There are touching moments, there are true\namusing moments, both accompanied by a forceful soundtrack. Acting\nproves brilliant, to say the least, and the pairing between Francois\nCluzet and Omar Sy sparkles and captures the viewer's attention. I was\nswept away by Dryss's genuine smile as well as by Philippe's\nmelancholic eyes, and the moments when they are together filled me with\nan authentic feeling-good sentiment. Definitely, a must-see picture.\n"
"\nThis one is excellent movie. I am from India i don't get too much\nforeign titles in theaters. But i watched this movie last night it was\ntoo good.Its a comedy between friendship and trust and its based on a\ntrue story.its not an innovative story or highly budget flick but it\nguarantees good humour and pranks. Now its one of my favorite movie .\nbrilliant acting by every one of them not too much sentiment or comedy.\nMy rating is 10/10 . this is one of the movie you should watch before\nyou die..! Thanks to its strong cast and some remarkably sensitive\ndirection,A movie or rather true story of two men who should never have\nmet--a quadriplegic and a street con.François Cluzet as Philippe and\nOmar Sy as Driss make you sit tight on chair for the whole movie\nbecause it's a plausible enchantment.\n"
"\nIt has been long since I laughed, cried, and more over, felt over a\nmovie. And this has given me all the feelings to be acquired by a man\nin just two hours. I have to say, I wasn't expecting much. But after\nwatching this movie twice in one go, I have to say it now.... This is a\ngreat movie, a wonderful work and a beautiful tale as it is.<br><br>The story, from the very start to the very end, is so beautiful. And\nthe performances were mind blowing. This movie can teach you the true\nessence of life and friendship.<br><br>I have nothing more to say, except one thing. If you are looking for a\nmovie that can melt you literally, you should watch this one.\n"
"\nBrilliant feelgood-movie, based on a true story, of two very different\npeople who become very good friends. Driss is a troubled man without a\njob and applying to be Phillipe's \"handyman\". Phillipe is paralyzed and\nneeds help to do everything, but everyone that works for him only gives\nhim pity, when he decides to hire Driss he knows that he won't get\npity. Driss treats him like he would treat any other person, and that's\nthe start of a very good friendship.<br><br>This is one of my absolute favorites of all time, and on my top 10 list\nof greatest movies ever. This is also my first review at IMDb.<br><br>This is a movie for everyone, and unless you speak good french;\nremember to turn on the subtitles.\n"
"\nI'm not one for leaving reviews and I shall not attempt to describe The\nIntouchables from a technical standpoint as is often the case with\nreviews, in terms of lightning and cinematography etc as I'm not the\nbest judge in that sense. I do feel compelled however to comment on the\nfilm simply because I have not enjoyed a movie as much as this in a\nlong time, especially a foreign language film which is very much a\nminority in my viewing history. It's a wonderful heartwarming story of\ntwo people from polar opposite walks of life who form the strongest of\nbonds living in each other's pockets and it is also at times hilarious\nand I have not laughed so much for as long as I can remember. I found\nit to be very well acted and the two leads are both very well suited to\ntheir roles, it is thoroughly worth watching and can only leave you\nfeeling good at the end\n"
"\nA true film which offers a story that makes the viewer filled with\nemotions. The untouchables is a gorgeous story that breaks cultural\nbarriers and shows the human side of relations. I liked the movie for\nits honesty as it was \"pragmatic\". The cinematography is beautiful and\nthe acting is outstanding. The story follows a quadriplegic aristocrat\nwho is looked after by someone who comes from a deprived background,\nbut knows what really matters. The characters of both Philippe and\nDriss perfectly complement each other although they come from different\nworlds. Their relationship is strengthened as the film progresses in a\npoetic way filled with humour. Totally recommended!\n"
"\nThis is a don't miss film if there ever was one! Any age will find this\nfilm to be one of the best films they have seen in years. Even\nteenagers, who typically only want to see action films, will be drawn\nto this film. One does not even remember the film was subtitled. This\nis the story of a quadriplegic who continually needs to find new\ncaregivers because of how badly he treats them. He finally finds the\nmost improbable candidate and hires him. This begins a fantastic and\nvery funny relationship that kept me spellbound for the whole movie, as\nit did the entire audience. When it ended, the audience all clapped\nloudly. See this movie if you want to laugh a lot and if you appreciate\nthe development of a true, unique friendship.\n"
"\nKnowing this movie had great ratings and reviews going in, I was hoping\nfor something just enjoyable that I could agree with.<br><br>After spending my time watching this film, I was smiling from \"ear\" to\near the entire time.<br><br>Both characters come from a different neck of the woods but it's their\nfriendship that blossoms into something more than words can explain.<br><br>Art, Poetry, Friendship, Loneliness, &amp; the Human Relationship is\nsomething that this movie goes over the top with.<br><br>I highly recommend this movie to anyone who is looking for a\nheart-warming story, a great film, or just something to enjoy to pass\ntheir time.\n"
"\nThis movie is brilliant. It is about two men from different background,\ninterest, class, and culture developing a close friendship and lighting\nup each other's world. <br><br>It touches your heart, it is not emotional but it takes you on an\namazing emotional ride about what it means to be human, dealing with\nthe tragics in life, the things we feel helpless about, anger, fear,\npassion, love, beauty, intellect, and hope.<br><br>It leaves you feeling a mixed of emotions and just speechless. <br><br>It is sooooo real, and using Driss's favourite quote, it is \"pragmatic\"\nand it is life. <br><br>It is also entertaining and funny, from the beginning to the end. The\nmusic is amazing, and love the irony about art. <br><br>Very smart indeed!!!\n"
"\nThis movie just flows. The friendship, the warmth, the feel good\nfactor, all of it sums up The Intouchables. How awesome should a movie\nbe if someone can give a rating of 10 by just reading the subtitles?<br><br>It takes you right into the story without much ado.The acting is\nexcellent as well as the cinematography. The emotional connect is a\nvery important factor in any movie. This film gets full marks for the\nemotional connection it is able to make with the audience. Rather than\nseeing it, we actually feel it. The comic moments are also handled very\nwell. It makes us laugh but the thread of the story is never fiddled\nwith.<br><br>This is my first French movie and I am not disappointed. I recommend\neveryone to watch this flick as it is worth the 2 hours.\n"
"\nA film that is so beautiful and sad at the same time, it really makes\nyou think about everything: life, love, death and tragedy. I am a big\nfan of these type of 'minimalistic' movies and in particular, french\nfilm so this ticked all the boxes and I'm very glad I stumbled upon\nthis.<br><br>The movie grabbed me from the very start, it is a well made title that\nhas a great story line, actors that fitted their roles perfectly, the\nproduction is top notch and don't get me started on the soundtrack. 10\nout of 10. <br><br>I won't go into too much depth but I absolutely loved the relationship\nbetween the main characters. They complimented each other very well\ntogether (you will understand when you watch it) and the other cast of\nthe mansion too.<br><br>Just a masterpiece for film lovers, please watch it.\n"
"\nOne of my favourite films is THE INTOUCHABLES with the famous actor\nOmar Sy who became popular because of the TV show 'SAV'. A wonderful\nand emotional story about Philippe, a rich quadriplegic who requires a\nlive-in caregiver. <br><br>One the plus side, the movie is funny and sensitive at the same time.\nIn this role Omar keeps his trademark hilarious attitude. He gets the\njob to work for Philippe, played by 'Francois Cluzet'.<br><br>Philippe loves Cedric's behaviour and attitude (Omar Sy) because he\ntreats him like a normal person without mercy or sympathetic. In this\nmovie you will discover a story of love and close friendship. <br><br>Moreover, this movie is taken from a true story which make the plot\neven more real and attractive. <br><br>Go and see this film. You won't be disappointed.\n"
"\nI'm not going to write a review, it's more like a recommendation.<br><br>I am a projectionist in a little theater/art house cinema and I'm only\ngoing to recommend films that both I and the audience in my little\ncinema loved.<br><br>Hopefully we can make it easier for you to choose the next film for you\nto view.<br><br>I shall keep adding to my list more films as time goes on.<br><br>If you like my choices then you know where to come for more\nrecommendations. <br><br>This film is a 10 out of 10 from the audience and myself.\n"
"\nHilarious and moving, Intouchables is simply one of the best films of\n2012. Based on a true story the unlikely pairing of an immensely\nwealthy quadriplegic with an African immigrant carer produces line\nafter line and scene after scene that are genuinely funny (and I mean\nreally funny not just a gentle smirk) and also wonderfully acted.<br><br>It's a hard film to fault - it isn't over-sentimental or maudlin, but\nit makes us care - the drama could have been deeper and more dramatic\nbut I, for one, like that it is a genuine odd couple, buddy comedy - it\nis simply a pleasure to watch - I have seen it twice and enjoyed it\nmore the second time around.<br><br>It is also, significantly, one of the most affirming film about\ndisability to date - this is not a film looking for your sympathy or\ntears - but neither does it gloss over or veer away from disability -\nbut it shouts that disability is not inability or shaming - it is\ncertainly a very strong contender for Best Foreign Film and expect to\nsee an American version (Dustin Hoffman would be great - they are\nalmost twins) soon....\n"
"\nThe Intouchables is a French film that is about an irreverent,\nuplifting comedy about friendship, trust and human possibility.A rich\nquadriplegic, living in a mansion in Paris, requires a live-in carer. A\nyoung offender turns up for an interview, but he is not really looking\nto get the job. However, to his surprise, he is hired. The two men then\ndevelop a close friendship.It features François Cluzet and Omar Sy; and\nit was directed by Olivier Nakache and Éric Toledano. <br><br>There are countless magical moments worth recounting - many with humor\nand involving the clash of the classes - it is not surprising that the\nfilm has been a runaway hit in France and elsewhere in Europe.Capturing\nthe unspoken shorthand, the adventurousness and the humor essential to\nenduring friendships makes the The Intouchables must see as it handles\nits potentially prickly subject matter with kid gloves.Added to that,\nit gets by thanks to its strong cast and some remarkably sensitive\ndirection.\n"
"\nA film full of such delightful twists, surprises and fun-poking at\nsocietal norms that I came out refreshed and ready to embrace humanity\nwith all its frailties once again! The acting, above all, is superb.\nNot a detail is overlooked; it's a life-affirming film. If you miss\nthis, you're a boor! :)<br><br>Phillipe and his surprise choice for a caregiver, Driss, have the time\nof their lives and take us with them. Every preconceived idea about\npeople with special challenges and those from difficult backgrounds is\nblown to bits by the dynamics of this gem of a film. It's been an\ninternational hit! Don't miss it because you're too unadventurous to go\nto a movie that isn't in English. :)\n"
"\nI hadn't expected too much of this film because of the carer/wheelchair\nstoryline. It just didn't sound very interesting. So I was pretty much\nastonished to find myself watching a truly marvellous and entertaining\nmovie.<br><br>It's a unique storyline which is apparently based on true life. <br><br>The two guys at the centre of the plot keep bouncing jokes off each\nother leaving you in fits of laughter. But it's not just a comedy;\nthere's a lot of sad, moving and beautiful stuff in there as well.<br><br>Script, direction, filming and acting are all of the highest standard.<br><br>This is a very sensitive treatment of human relationships; sad, funny\nand involving. It's simply a great movie. I can't recommend it highly\nenough.\n"
"\nOnce again out of the darkness comes another touching piece of\nsomething special. <br><br>Such reality and great character work, especially from Omar Sy. It\nnever once veered from the storyline. Everything flowed well from start\nto finish. <br><br>Throughout this movie you will laugh, expect true laughter. The music\nwas wonderfully matched and was not overpowering.<br><br>Usually one shy's away from predictability as we yearn for a mental\nchallenges, especially through movies, truly this was not the case as\nyou would not expect such touching representation.<br><br>Congratulations to all involved!\n"
"\nIf you have a chance to see this movie-do it! This is the best movie\nI've seen in years. The story is touching yet funny. It made me both\nlaugh and cry. Actors are just plain excellent, they are very talented\nand they show spirit. The script was written magnificently with great\nconversations and humorous touches. You can really tell a lot of effort\nwas put into this project. I have nothing but words of praise for this\nmovie. And those critic reviews about this movie being racist are\ncompletely false. So maybe this movie shows that a black guy smokes pot\nand lives in a poor family- but why is that racist? Maybe it is a\ncliché that a black guy is poor. But remember, it's based on a true\nstory. So trust me when I say- go and watch this movie right away!\n"
"\nBefore watching, my only expectation was, that it really is a comedy,\nnot a drama with two laughs in it. Turns out, it was a comedy with very\nsubtle touch of drama, it is a movie worth every second of your time...\ndoes it have flaws? I don't know, I was too busy enjoying every minute\nof it. Captivating actors, beautiful script and great sense of humor.\nThis is one of those very rare movies that make a tiny change deep\ninside you and you'll know it happened when the movie is over. Watching\nthis, you can laugh at a tetraplegic's shortcomings without feeling\nbad, because it is in absolutely good spirit, you can laugh at the\nserious things in life, because they can't kill you and somehow can\nalways find a way to have some fun no matter what.\n"
"\nI never wish to write a review.......<br><br>This move is awesome........It is package of everyone's performance and\nteamwork.............<br><br>everything from starting to end looks good.<br><br>music,comedy,drama ........are just loving<br><br>I you hear the theme i think not every one dare to watch,, but i\nrecommend just watch it once,,,,,,,<br><br>after a long time...there was a good movie.,and performance of actors\nwas just amazing and perfect............... just awesome movie with\nsmall touch,,,,,,,,,,,,,\n"
"\nI've never submitted a review before, but this was absolutely\noutstanding. The dialogue is excellent, with many unexpected responses,\nespecially in the beginning. The characters are exceptional, especially\nin their social contrast--but when the inevitable social comparisons\nare made, they are either handled with genuine surprize, or else\nexpertly buffooned. Some of the obvious exchanges are handled so well,\nand so unexpectedly that there are guffaws from the audience. The story\nis wonderfully touching, without any syrup. That it is a true story\nmakes it even more surprizing and appealing. I don't know which other\ncontemporary movie I would rate a perfect 10. Well done.\n"
"\nMy wife was frightened when I was suddenly burst laughing at Omer Sy's\nspontaneous acting scenes. I enjoyed watching this masterpiece. Omar Sy\nis a great actor and he deserves an Oscar for his role in this movie. I\nfound Omar Sy's role much more challenging and unusual than Jean\nDujardin's... of course, few people make silent films today, but the\ncharacter itself was incredibly stereotypical. As for The Intouchables,\nI really liked the film and found it entertaining and thoughtful at the\nsame time .The chemistry between the two leads is wonderful. Not quite\nas insufferably retro as it sounds, the formulaic film gets a boost\nfrom the endearing performances of its leads  particularly Sy, whose\nex-con-turned-servant instructs his cultured boss on the pleasures of\n'70s soul classics and pot-smoking before cleaning up nicely. The\nracial politics remain as sketchy as the sitcom-style jokes, and Harvey\nWeinstein smells a hit, having bought both the movie and, alas, the\nrights to remake.\n"
"\nEverybody said that this movie was awesome, so I gave it a shot.<br><br>Iusually don't like France movies so I didn't expect a good movie, and\nI didn't get a good movie. The scenes escalated way to quickly. Why\nwould the handicapped man want him to take care of him. The acting is\neither overacted or there is no act in the scenes. In short the acting\nis bad.<br><br>The writing It's just off, awful, Scenes either contain Way to much\ninformation or no information at all, and that confused me a lot. It\ndidn't feel realistic, I'm pretty sure no one would react like that in\nreal life situation. My recommendation is not to watch this movie.\n"
"\nIt was a great movie, great acting, great script. <br><br>I enjoyed watching it, even though i watched it more than 10 times, i\nstill enjoy it and don't get bored.<br><br>Their friendship is amazing, the differences between them where\nvisible, but that didn't stopped them for making it great.<br><br>I recommend it to everyone !<br><br>Watch it now if you haven't done it yet.\n"
"\nWhen I first saw Intouchables I thought it was great! I really loved\nthe environment and the outstanding performance by Omar Sy and François\nCluzet! The second time, I thought it was even better! All the details\nand the story itself.and the expressions of François Cluzet, is really\nbreathtaking! He deserves an Oscar for his performance!(!!!) and I\nthink the movie itself is worth an Oscar for 'Best film', 'best\nactor(s)', 'best photo' and 'best director'! I really recommend it for\nall kinds of people, exceptionally you with a sense of details and\nacting!<br><br>You can't walk untouched from this movie!\n"
"\nI have never seen a more beautiful movie. Brought me to tears at many\npoints, such a great story. Loved both of the main characters and there\nwere many funny, serious, and heartwarming parts all throughout the\nmovie, each of them done amazingly. The soundtrack for this movie was\nbeautifully. The last scene was just so moving, the smile on Driss was\njust the most genuine and pure thing I've seen while they share their\nfinal moment together and both move on to better things. I still have\nthe ending song playing and it just makes me think of so many beautiful\nthings in life, I've changed how I look on life because of this movie,\nappreciating so many things like art, classical music, nature, etc...\nthings that I normally don't really look into but now I just have\nutmost respect for them. Couldn't recommend a movie more, I literally\nmade an account on this site just so I could write this review, that's\nhow much I truly loved it.\n"
"\nThis is the only film I manage to watch 3 times in 24 hours. I was so\nthrilled with the originality and humor that I couldn't stop watching\nand talking about it for days. Both characters are genuine, witty and\noriginal. Scenario has enough of intelligent humor and it is such a\nrefreshment in the ocean of bad comedies. The film has the tragic note\nbut also it shows we should use every moment of our life. The fact that\nthe film was based on real persons and events makes it even more\nspecial. I would recommend it for every audience : each person can\nlearn from the film. Its a story of life, love, daily problems, tragedy\nbut it shows that we can change our perspective and experience the\nmaximum. Also, it shows how two totally opposite people can build an\namazing relationship. We just need to forget the prejudice we have\nabout each other. I'm planning to watch it for the fourth time in short\nnotice - that's how good the film is.\n"
"\nThis was a truly amazing story about two people in France from totally\ndifferent culture and lives coming together to become friends and to\nhelp each other out along the way. I believe that both of the leading\nactors should have won Academy Awards. This film was so good that it\nshould have won Best Picture. It is amazing how two human beings with\nall of their differences can come together in world that is divided to\ndo something awesome when people to not expect the friendship to last.\nI love watching these lower budget films, because a lot of the time\nthey are better than the big budget Hollywood movies that they seem to\nmanufacture every year. This touching film is why I go to the movies to\nexperience something amazing like this.\n"
"\nThe Intouchables is an amazing movie/experience for anyone to partake\nin. <br><br>Whether you have a great and easy life, or a sad and hard one, this\nmovie will help you to find the in-between. Laugh, love, cry, and feel\nconnected to each and every character. <br><br>This movie is a diamond in the rough. Where so many movies have failed\nto show every aspect within living with disability, whether it be yours\nor someone else's, this movie delivers it flawlessly. With laughter, it\nwill bring you in. Then you start to see the realism of this world\nwithin disability. <br><br>So beautiful. So heartfelt . So sad. So funny. So perfect. <br><br>I strongly recommend this movie to all of society.\n"
"\nI have been so annoyed by movies about miserable black people from the\nghetto who are transformed by sweet, gentle Caucasians. Finally, the\nroles have been reversed! Finally the media is graced with a movie\nabout a miserable Caucasian who is transformed by a sweet, gentle black\nperson from the ghetto. I love to see the underdog maintain a positive\noutlook, a childlike exuberance, and an optimistic approach that is\ncontagious. Yes, \"The Blind Side\" had a similar theme, but \"The\nIntouchables\" supersedes it, because a black person from the ghetto\ndoes not need to be mentally delayed to have a good heart. I recommend\nthis movie to all those who don't mind reading captions for a good\nstory. The acting was phenomenal and the fact that it is a true story\njust enhances the beauty of this movie.\n"
"\nThis movie is one of the best and the best comedy movie I have ever\nseen. Humorous dialogues, activities without foolishness and love for\nsomeone are really amazing to see. I was feeling this movie when I was\nwatching it as I was a character of the movie. The starting of the\nmovie was very good that started to feel me thrilled. But when I\nunderstood the thing, my eyes were watering because of laughing, I was\nfeeling pain in my belly because extremely funny dialogues among\ncharacters. The acting of Driss was amazing and mesmerizing. His\nimpressions and movements was very energetic and funny. His dialogues\nsometimes make him funny but not a fool. The locations, cars, artworks\nand characters were perfectly matched to make this great movie. Thanks\nvery much to the Director, actors and all crew who made this epic movie\nfor us.\n"
"\nI heard about this movie for such a long time and when i finally saw it\nlast night i realized how right were the people that talk good about\nthis movie. The dynamic of the movie is really interesting and every\ncharacter is well composed, no one at the end has his story incomplete\nor anything like that. Was also amazing to see, at the end of the\nmovie, the small video with the real Philippe and Driss. Is amazing\njust to think about the real story of those people, i can say that i\ntried to substitute the character i got in my head after have seen the\nmovie with the real person i saw at the end. The story of Driss' family\n(i was afraid) was going to be used too much to change the character,\nor just to make him look in a different way through the movie; Luckily\nit didn't. This movie is definitely going in my 'Best Movies' list\n"
"\nFrom the moment I see François Cluzet and Omar Sy, I know I am going to\nlove this film. <br><br>Driss (Sy) is a homeless loser that is hired as a personal attendant to\na quadriplegic (Cluzet). He is crude, insensitive, and incredibly funny\nwith superb dialog by writer/directors Olivier Nakache and Eric\nToledano.<br><br>Both Philippe (Cluzet) and Driss grow by leaps and bounds in the\nrelationship that develops. Phillipe says that with modern medicine, he\ncan live to 70. Who would want to live one more day as he is? Driss\nshows him how to really live no matter how long he has.<br><br>Both men, and those around them, really start to live, and that is what\nmakes this film so special.\n"
"\nThe movie revolves around 2 people, a quadriplegic aristocrat and a\nblack guy hired as his care taker. The movie showcases the turmoil, a\nquadriplegic faces in his life and shows how little things in his life\nbring about great joy. It also stresses on the point that how the small\nthings we generally ignore, provide with relief n happiness in times of\nadversity when focused upon. <br><br>The acting in the movie is brilliant. Francois Cluzet has given an\noutstanding performance as the quadriplegic. As far as Omar Sy is\nconsidered, I couldn't say he was acting at all. It was as though I was\nactually seeing things happen in real life as they unfold. He was\ndeeply in character and has delivered an award winning performance.<br><br>Overall, the movie is thought provoking one, rich in emotion n detail.\nI give it a 8/10.\n"
"\nA man who has,a lots of money,attendants,a nice big palace and\nunfortunately a body which is good for nothing.Yes he has everything\nbut he need a real friend,he need to meet with somebody who will love\nand take care of him not just for his money.And there is an another man\nwho had lived a poor life,and who has been living a poor life,who knows\nthe difficulties of life,who came from mean surroundings.And you will\nsee this two different man in the same picture,you will see their\nunbelievable friendship.You will love this excellent movie.You have to\nwatch this emotional,creative film if you didn't done it yet.Honestly\nit was,maybe the best film I have ever seen. Thank You.\n"
"\nI was slightly pessimistic going into this movie as it was French with\nEnglish subtitles, but as I got into it the french didn't make any\ndifference. This movie was a brilliant heart warming story and I really\nenjoyed it! It kept me entertained throughout and I was really\ndisappointed when it finished. The acting was really brilliant and\nthere was numerous very funny parts too. There is also a lot to learn\nmorally from this movie, such as not to judge a book by its cover and\nso on..Overall I thought it was a very clever film and I would really\nrecommend it. I rated this movie 9 out of 10 because it was very\nentertaining from start to finish!\n"
"\nSo, i saw this movie in french class. And i don't regret i did. It's\ngot to be one of the best french movies i've ever watched. It's a\nreally great feel-good movie. It's full of laughs, tears and emotions\nbeyond anything. And i'm really impressed, as this is Omar's first lead\nrole in acting, he played it off really well, not just in the funny\nparts, but as well in the emotionally acted parts. This is defentily a\nmovie i would watch over and over again and recommend to all my\nfriends. Definitely one of the best french movies i've seen in a while.\nI'm so glad i saw it. You should too. Everythings good. The storyline,\nthe screenplay and the directing. The acting is great as well, and the\nhumor would probably go well in all countries, not just France. It's\nworth a watch and deserves an 8!\n"
"\nReally enjoyed this film, and even though the sub-titles always feel\nlike a bit of a chore, there aren't too many lines to disturb the\nactual viewing of the film. Driss (Omar) is just perfection and\ncouldn't have been played by anyone else. His personality shine through\nand you just want to keep watching him. Once the film is over, you feel\nlike you want to know what happens next, where did they go, what did\nthey become? The closing credits do offer a bit of information but you\nwant to keep watching, regardless. Without giving too much away, the\nending makes the film complete. I felt like my heart was going to burst\n- when I realised what happened. And just how good it makes you feel.\nIf anyone enjoyed this film as much as me, for the same reasons I did\n(that you can actually feel good about watching a man who can move\nnothing at all from the neck down), then read \"Me Before You\" by JoJo\nMoyes. Stunning...\n"
"\nIm not a fan of french movies at all but i must say this movie\nsurprised me. The acting is superb and realistic as if they really were\nthese characters for real. <br><br>Francois Cluzet and Omar Sy had a great connection they fit very well\ntogether in this movie. I think anybody would like it as its just not\nan ordinary french movie. It is also a very funny one that will\ndefinitely make you laugh and feel happy. I really recommend this\nmovie.<br><br>So if you are looking for a movie that will inspire you then this is\nwhat you are looking for.\n"
"\nThis is a perfect film. <br><br>I had some hesitations with respect to this film before I went- I was\nscared it would be too melodramatic with a huge focus on the pain and\nstruggle of the disabled guy. Three minutes into the film, I realised\nmy prejudgement could not be any further from the truth. I have laughed\nthroughout the whole film and I enjoyed every second I was in the movie\ntheatre. It approaches the relationship between a carer and his patient\nfrom a completely different point of view than we are used to. The\nsupport actor and actresses are very good as well.<br><br>This is a must see film. I strongly recommend it to everyone.\n"
"\nThis is not just the shoe in for the best foreign language film at the\n2013 Oscars, if there was any justice in the world the Best Film, Best\nActor and Best Supporting Actor, it is that good. I have no intention\nof spoiling anybody's enjoyment of this film by spoiling it. But this\nfilm does jokes the way you and I eat the popcorn in the cinema. From\nthe soon to be classic dance sequence, to the down right hilarious in a\nwicked bad taste way tash monologue. What should be a dour tragic tet a\ntet between a down at heals Algerian immigrant and a upper class French\nbillionaire, is nothing of the sort, it's uplifting its got a heart and\nabove all it propels French Film into the super star bracket. Yep it's\nthat good However don't believe me get down to whoever wherever it's\nbeing shown and bathe yourself in a piece of Cinema magic.\n"
"\nLoved every single second of it &lt;3 .. it is so moving and inspiring and\nmoreover teach you the principles. Briefly, if you are in true love and\nyou can't express it, somehow this love will be exposed in a good way\nno matter if you are disabled or old, black or white, rich or poor.\nDestiny also take place in this movie to show that you faith is kept\nfor better days. We can't forget the importance of the family in our\nlife even if you are not a 100% related and we can see this from the\nmovie,, these are called \"Principles\". Simply, the best movie I've seen\nin a while and i would give it more than 10 if am allowed to do so.\nBtw, this is my first time writing a review :)\n"
"\nBefore watching, my expectation was, that it really is a comedy, not a\ndrama with two laughs in it.It was a comedy with very subtle touch of\ndrama.I was too busy enjoying every minute of this film. I love the\nactors,I love the subject. While I was watching, there is a smile in my\nface every time.If you watch,you'll see that; comedy is not slangy\njokes. <br><br>The relationship between Philippe and Driss is sensitive and\nquality.Same time it is funny,too. <br><br>I think, that Omar Sy was a very good actor in this role, and the\nFrancois Cluzet was a good actor in this role as well. <br><br>Two words, watch it.\n"
"\nAlthough the plot is based on real events, it must be very difficult to\nbalance sorrow and joy, wealth and poverty, constrained disability and\n(hyper)activity in such a way that the result is not rude and/or\nembarrassing. In spite of several teases and jokes related to\ndisability, they are included in a logical and realistic way into Driss\n's character (splendidly played by Omar Sy). No wonder that the film\nhas received so much warm welcome and has become one of the biggest\nFrench successes all over the world. Opposites, even antipodes have\nseveral things in common, but there are a few occasions triggering the\nevents to understand them. <br><br>The film could be recommended even to those who have disabled persons\nclosely around. Perhaps it is then possible to find new angles to deal\nwith them and bring more joy and variety into their lives.<br><br>And last but not least: I hope no Hollywood remake is made, although\nEddie Murphy and Dustin Hoffman (just my guess due to their looks and\nsimilarity) could be tempted to go for it...\n"
"\nI saw this movie today and It's really, really hard to say to what\nwasn't said before. This is just a perfect movie. A simple story about\na poor black guy taking care of old paralyze man. It's simple, sweet\nand at moments very, very funny. The actor who plays Driss makes\nexcellent job by portraying character as street-wise and amusing. It's\njust a short of person who you would want to hang-out with from the\nvery first second.<br><br>Some of my favorite parts are the comedy which often take you off-gourd\nbut drama is perfect as well. There where few small moments when movie\nfelt manipulative (playing sad music in a scene that otherwise would be\nhappy moments)but my only honest complain is the fact that the movie\nDriss doesn't look a thing as the historical one, and the fact that\nthey show the footage of actual Driss during the credits doesn't help\nmuch.\n"
"\nWhy 10/10? The casting is magnificent, simply perfect in most of the\ncases... Rarely does the movie uselessly linger. The characters'\nlaughter is simply contagious and in many cases you feel like you'd\nreally like to be able to just somehow cross the line and enter into\nthe movie and become part of it.<br><br>Oh, and it's French, which really adds to its flavor. <br><br>I didn't read anything about this movie before or after watching it\ntoday. But if someone in the future will tell me - \"From the Director\nof The Intouchables\", I would go for it. <br><br>The only thing I found redundant in this movie was the way the story\nflows - a linear story-line structure would have suited me much better.\nI think the script tried to hide the fake-ish looking climax to the end\nof the story... Moving things in front only made it worse.\n"
"\nNot many movies deserve a 10.<br><br>This one does.<br><br>The comedy is real.<br><br>The acting is superb.<br><br>The drama is light hearted yet striking.<br><br>A lasting impression is what this movie will leave you with.<br><br>Simply put, Oscar worthy material.<br><br>Now stop reading the reviews and start watching.<br><br>ps. I almost passed up this movie because of the language barrier,\nthough french movies seldom disappoint. Don't let that scare you off. <br><br>Oh, if you liked this one, you might want to check the movie \"Barney's\nversion\".\n"
"\nI have seen this movie many times like everywhere but i have avoided to\nwatch it. I don't know why but i have thought I won't like it. An\nemotional relationship between two men wasn't that good for me. But one\nday my brother told me to watch this movie, he said i will like it and\nhe was right. <br><br>I must say that I loved every second in this movie. When I heard it was\na real story my admiration becomes much bigger. I got angry myself, I\ntought how silly I am. <br><br>If you are seeing this movie around but not watched yet, don't waste\nany time and watch it asap. You won't regret.\n"
"\nHuman interaction is like a note played on the piano. The right\ncombination of keys go together to get a note running. Not every note\nmakes it to the top but The Intouchables(the name is quite deep) do.The\nmovie in its entirety shows a sublime harmony of an honest\nrelationship, between an accidental handicapped gentleman and a street\nsmart, blunt smoker black guy.There is not much to describe the plot,\nit's more about feeling it. Nothing that we have not seen but still the\nlife interactions shown here is a rare phenomenon in our everyday busy\nlife. The movie does not make use of the beautiful Parisian landscape\noutside of the closed doors, but rather stays inside to explore the\nwarm fuzzy feeling in a marriage between a quadriplegic and caregiver.\nWatch it and figure how humor and charm can destroy the overcast\nbrought by being dead serious in life. There is a time when we will die\nbut till then live life.\n"
"\nOne of my friends told me to watch this movie and since it was French\n(I'm usually not a big fan) I didn't really want to just because in\ngeneral I don't really enjoy French movies that much however I am SO\nPLEASED that I ended up giving it a go since it is literally one of the\nbest movies I've ever seen by far.<br><br>Everything about it is just so great, it's the kind of movie where you\nhave so many feelings all the way through and at the end your life is a\nlittle miserable for a while but in a good way. <br><br>10/10 Would recommend to anyone and everyone.<br><br>Thanks for reading.\n"
"\n10/10, faultless.<br><br>Given to me as birthday present, I was sceptical of the \"rave reviews\"\nsplashed across the DVD sleeve (and the subject matter put me off).<br><br>The film is authentic and genuine.<br><br>\"Untouchable\" made us us laugh because the scenes were both funny and\nbrilliantly done - real life on screen as opposed to\n\"Actors-Being-Comedians\".<br><br>Everything is deadly serious, \"Untouchable\" is based (however loosely I\ncannot tell) on actual events.<br><br>Eye candy it is not, here we have an insight into a world behind doors\nthat keeps itself to itself. I found myself looking into two greatly\ncontrasting lives.<br><br>The characters evoke empathy in different ways and for different\nreasons, even when someone is \"being bad\".<br><br>The casting is excellent, timing, pace, mood all have been handled with\nimpeccability.<br><br>Would it have come across differently if it had been presented as pure\nfiction? That may be a hard question to answer, telling myself I was\nwatching the retelling of true events undoubtedly added to the strength\nof the film.\n"
"\nI really recommend this movie, not only to those who love dramas or\nmovies based on true stories but to everybody because I honestly think\nthat this remarkable and educational but still story full of humour\nwill love everyone. I haven't met yet a person that didn't like it. I\ncried and laughed at the same time. This movie really touched me and it\nis definitely one of the best movies I have ever watched. Actors did\npretty good job like the whole film crew. Althoug it is a French movie\nand most of us are used to those in English or our maternal language\nwhile I was watching it I totally forgot that so if maybe that is the\nreason why you still considering it just stop! Everything about this\nmovie is great and all I can say is enjoy!\n"
"\nThe Intouchables has to be one of my favorite films. The story is\nincredible and heartwarming, as well as a good representation of\nfriendship + a perfect use of humor to add to the viewers experience.<br><br>I would recommend this movie highly, because despite being in french +\nEnglish subtitles (which really didn't take away from the movie at\nall), the elements expressed within the film are fantastic and make the\nIntouchables a must see film.<br><br>One of the ideas expressed in the movie is the fact that Driss (The\ncarer) and Philipe (The quadriplegic millionaire) have a strong\nrelationship, in which Driss treats him the same as a friend, as\nopposed to a child who cant do anything for himself.\n"
"\nIm usually not a fan of dramas, but in this case i was absolutely blown\naway.Plays by both of the leading actors were phenomenal,they really\nshowed us emotions and identification with real people which is this\nstory based on. From beginning of the movie jokes are where they should\nbe , short and amazingly funny for this kind of movie. Omar Sy was\ngreat at his performance, of rude African Dris who came into the\nmansion and changed his daily life buy also changed the life of\nquadriplegic millionaire Phillipe, and brought this story to the whole\nnew level. Francois was brilliant at staying focused and becoming so\nrealistic at playing disabled man trying to live normal life. Film is\ngreat , lots of fun and good humor, i would totally recommend this to\nevery one like me who doesn't like drama but will have fun watching\nthis for sure.\n"
"\nThe movie reminds you the good sides of humanity, that we tend to\nforget in our daily life. It makes you feel comfortable and gives\nwarmth to your heart while watching. There are many lessons to get from\nthis movie. The relationship between these two different generation,\nlife-style, economical difference, culture is shown professionally. The\nmovie is a reminder for all of us to cross these boundaries and build\nup strong humanitarian relationships with each other. The lessons you\nmay get from this movie are priceless. Especially when you watch it\nbefore your 30s it might change the way you look at life and your\nsocial network. It might actually help you to overcome stereotypes and\nsee the real world. The movie shows us that socio economical class,\nrace, culture, background does not mean much when you can trust the\nperson next to you. So give it a shot.\n"
"\nThe film goes to the bone and masterfully portrays stereotypes of\npeople's attitude towards the handicapped and those with criminal\nrecords. The greatest aspect of this movie lies in the interaction\nbetween the main actors where every sentence feels like exchanged\nrespect, understanding, love and acceptance in a really brilliantly\nwritten mix of comedy and realism. The scenes are in good quality, and\nthe actors, especially the main duo, completely spectacular. Omar Sy is\nfantastic in his role, as evidenced by three awards at various\nfestivals. Their chemistry on screen is great; it is hard to believe\nthat these two men are not the best friends in real life.\n\"Intouchables\" is a very touching and beautiful story of an unusual\nfriendship.\n"
"\nI don't know if I even can describe this movie. It is so beautiful that\nyou just have to see it to understand what I mean. I also think we all\nhave something to learn from this movie. <br><br>Short summary: man in wheelchair employ a man who doesn't even want to\nwork - they connect, and get a strong relationship. <br><br>If you want to spend your time properly; watch this movie. <br><br>Usually I don't like to watch movies in languages I don't understand,\nbut this is not even an issue when I watch this movie. I could see it a\nmillion times without getting tired. <br><br>MY ABSOLUTE FAVORITE.\n"
"\nHaving read critic reviews of this movie I was shocked to see it having\nsuch negative reviews on other sites. This film portrays the unlikely\nfriendship of two completely different individuals from totally\ndifferent backgrounds. Its intimate and some of the jokes are close to\nthe bone, however this is what makes this film so great, and it is what\nyou would expect the lives in this film to be like.<br><br>The acting is outstanding, the jokes extremely funny and the story is\ntruly heart warming. This is one of those films that makes me laugh out\nloud, feel happiness, feel empathy and sadness all in the very short\ntwo hour window. An absolute masterpiece in French cinema and a\nbeautifully put together movie. 10/10\n"
"\nOh my goodness, I was surprised by how good this movie was. Based on a\ntrue story and yet I forgot that the whole way through until the end\ncredits reminded me.<br><br>What a beautiful tribute to an amazing friendship. Excellent acting all\nround and some truly hilarious moments that had me laughing out loud\nand really enjoying myself.<br><br>And yet, what could have been a soppy mess simply wasn't. Where there\ncould have been bucket loads of sentiment there was charm and wit and\nin no way did it undermine what it must be like to be a quadriplegic.<br><br>A movie to be watched. Explaining won't do the job.<br><br>A must see for everyone.\n"
"\nI was skeptical at first about watching this movie considering it's a\nfrench movie therefore I wouldn't be able to understand it and I'm also\nnot a big fan of subtitles however I saw it was highly rated on IMDb\nand I watched the trailer and I had to see it. <br><br>I watched it and did not regret any of it, The movie will back you feel\na lot of different emotions and will make you feel touched about the\nstory, there's no other word to describe it than incredible. Not a lot\nof movies will make you feel the way this movie does. It's one of the\nbest movies if not the best movie I have ever seen, at the end of the\nmovie your not sure if you should smile or cry. The movies an emotional\nwreck but in a good way.<br><br>The actors are truly phenomenal, the music suits the mood, the story\nline is incredible and it's based on a real story. What more can you\nwant in a movie?! definitely a must see! 10/10.\n"
"\nThe Intouchables is a wonderfully written story by Olivier Nakache,\nEric Toledano, about two men who finds each other and builds an amazing\nfriendship together. Philippe, the quadriplegic millionaire who loves\nfine art, classical music and poems meets Driss, a cocky unemployed man\nwho deep inside is an extremely goodhearted human. He wants to help\neveryone. <br><br>The movie is a very \"easy watched\" movie with a lot of small funny\ncharacteristic jokes between Philippe and Driss while it also handling\nbigger questions like how quadriplegic and physical disabled people\noften strikes self confidence, the thrill of feeling alive in a\nwheelchair and how you want to get treated by the people around you. <br><br>One of the best actors in this movie was absolutely Omar Sy who played\nDriss and François Cluzet who played Philippe. The feeling and their\nbound of friendship made me really worm inside and happy. This is\nreally a must watch movie for everyone!<br><br>cheers!\n"
"\nSuperbly acted and beautifully executed. This is a thoughtful and\ncandid look at the lives of people with drastically different perks and\nproblems in their worlds, and it offers the audience an opportunity to\nexist momentarily in both. There are moments of insight that make us\nre-think assumptions, offered by characters who are at once likable and\nflawed. <br><br>And while the film is overflowing with heart, it is also fun! Humor and\na lighthearted look at reality keep the pace, with seamless transitions\nthat surprise us into feeling something new. <br><br>I recommend The Intouchables to anyone who loves to learn about life,\npeople, and themselves through stories.\n"
"\nIntouchables is a french dramatic comedy, this film is one of the\nnon-English movies which is the most seen in the world ! The very high\nscore of \"Intouchable\" is truly deserved ! The plot is based on the\ntrue happened story of  Philippe Pozzo di Borgo and Abdel Yasmin\nSellou. In the film, the story is about Philippe, a rich quadriplegic\nman who tries to find a carer to help him in his daily life. He meets\nDriss, an black unemployed immigrant. Driss has no competence to take\ncare of Philippe but nevertheless he accepts the job. While the context\nis very serious (immigrants, unemployment, handicap,...) the atmosphere\nis decontracted. Driss's tactless manners procures us a very good\nmoment. You can't stop watching and you can't stop laughing ! Even if\nyou've seen it a lot of times ! The main actors Omar Sy and François\nCluzet plays their role perfectly ! You get attached on the characters\nand on the story ! I will not reveal too much but if you haven't seen\nit yet (and I doubt there are many) then I warmly recommend it to all\nof you !\n"
"\nThe film's simplicity is delightfully misleading: the script is a\nmasterpiece of comedy writing,<br><br>and however good the rest of the cast is, the central duo is magical.\nSy's comic timing will have you in stitches, but it is his honesty and\nvulnerability that make you fall in love with the character. Cluzet\nisn't your typical sad-sack, instead, much of the finest pleasures in\nthe film consist in watching him use his keen mind to mess with the\nworld around him (a subplot about an abstract painting really takes the\nbiscuit, you'll know it when you see it).<br><br>I saw the second public screening of this movie at the Ryerson Theater\nduring the Toronto International Film Festival (TIFF). Tom Hooper was\npresent to introduce the movie. He was joined by Colin Firth and\nGeoffrey Rush after the movie ended for a brief Q&amp;A.\n"
"\nAnother great movie that was made ​​in France. This is proof that a\ngood film do not need 3D special effects and big budget. The film is\nexcellent in all aspects. Omar Sy is perfectly played its role troubled\nguy who is trying to make ends meet. Neither the the rest of the cast\nis not behind the of him. Then, every joke is funny. I do not remember\nwhen I laughed so hard because of the film. All thanks to great Omar\nSy. But the best thing is not acting or humor, but the story. The\nstory, which was done by real characters, can not leave anyone\nindifferent. Excellent story about friendship between two completely\ndifferent people. The movie is excellent and I recommend everyone to\nsee.\n"
"\nWatching movies with subtitles have never scared me, as several\ninternational movies have been a great inspiration to my life (Bon\nVoyage and Downfall to name a couple). Francois Cluzet is a very\nbelievable quadriplegic who is suffering spiritually and emotionally\nbecause of the death of his wife and the shame that is associated being\nparalyzed, while Omar Sy is also the believable \"welfare\"-needy man\nthat tries to also care for his several siblings.<br><br>The one main reason I loved this movie was because of it's classy and\ngenuine humor. Everything was real in this film and it was so easy to\nrelate the themes expressed within it in my own life. There isn't a\nminute or two that passes by without genuine chuckles or laughter (and\na good hearty laugh at that). You learn to love people for who they\nare, to see the good someone can bring to the world, and to live life\nalways looking forward in the future.\n"
"\nI went into this film not really knowing what to see and was delighted.\nIts subtle humor and honesty are refreshing amid overly-cheesy movies,\nThis is because it's actually based on a true story. Two men find\nfriendship when everything in their respective cultures says otherwise.\nIt showcases the vast socioeconomic differences between Driss and\nPhilippe and how these barriers are overcome. When we think of Paris\nand France in general, we do not think of the slums outside the major\ncities, the poverty, and brokenness housed just outside the \"city of\nlove.\" This movie runs the gamut of emotions. The moments of tenderness\nand truth speckled between scenes of laughter and, sometimes tears.\nOverall, I thought this movie was eye opening, touching, funny, and\nthought provoking. Give this title a shot!\n"
"\nInitially I turned my nose up at the thought of watching a film with\nsubtitles, but my ignorant logic has been changed forever.<br><br>For me this has to be one of the greatest feel good movies there has\never been. The acting and chemistry between François Cluzet and Omar Sy\nis supreme, and you feel it right from the moment the film begins.<br><br>The direction of Eric Toledano is masterful, showing both men's\nbackgrounds in such a way (subtle comedy, gripping drama, heart warming\nmoments) you learn so much about them as individuals and how their\nfeelings develop gradually for each other and their own families.<br><br>With some real laugh out load moments, romance and action too, you\nreally get everything with this movie.<br><br>You would be foolish (like I was) to pass this off as just another\nforeign film with subtitles. An amazing film that has become my most\nrecommended movie for others to see. <br><br>10 out of 10\n"
"\nI was afraid to watch this film, because I read so many reviews on this\nfilm that I was frightened to be disappointed in it. But when I finally\nwatched it I wasn't disappointed I was charmed by this film so much\nthat I couldn't stop thinking about it for a long time. This film is\nfun, friendship, care, love and beauty in one. And the music makes it\nto be a French film masterpiece! But unfortunately I can'T compare this\nfilm with another, 'cos I really do not know a similar one. I think\nthat everyone should see this one as a duty. <br><br>PS.: And if you are going to watch this film, simply enjoy it, because\nit's the only thing you can do :)\n"
"\nI really enjoyed watching this. And it's nice to see a movie where they\ntalk french instead of English. And the movie is well written, and i\npersonally thought that the time flied by when watching it. Usually i'm\npretty critical to movie endings, but i didn't have any problems with\nthis one. <br><br>This is Definitely a movie you can see again without being bored. <br><br>And i really enjoyed the scene where Driss entered Philippe with the\npaper for his payment. Very good acting. And one more favorite scene is\nwhen François Cluzet and Omar Sy are outside walking and talking about\nlife and smoking. <br><br>But i can agree with you guys here on IMDb that this movie is not a\nComedy, it's a serious movie with some really dramatical scenes. So i\ncan't really say it's a Comedy and compare it to the 'Hangover' movie.<br><br>I gave this movie 9/10 in ratings.\n"
"\nThis movie made it in my personal top 10.<br><br>It has a unique story that takes you along for a ride filled with\nlaughter and tears. The central duo of the movie looks like they're\nmade for each other. It's by far one of the most beautiful movies I've\never seen.<br><br>It doesn't have big international names in it, it doesn't have anything\nin common with any other movie I've seen, story wise.<br><br>It's hard to describe a movie like this, so I will write down the same\nstuff I told my friends: \"Go watch this movie, there is no way in hell\nyou'll regret it\".<br><br>THis movie has a very strong, realistic story. The simplicity of this\nis part of the beauty of the story. It's difficult to write about it\nwithout giving away any spoilers.<br><br>Watch it, you won't regret it.\n"
"\nIts not often i go to the cinema and am both captivated and uplifted\nfrom start to finish. The story, the characters, the cast, everything\nworks beautifully, with Driss playing the lead roll to perfection. You\ncan't fail to love that guy, regardless of his faults. The humour\ntranslates well and the jokes remain as funny in subtitles as they do\nin its original language. The fact that this is a true story tops off\nan already perfect combination. If there were more films like this, the\nworld would be a better place, and the only problem i have now is that\nI'm always expecting a similar level of entertainment as this at every\nsubsequent visit to the cinema. Other recent films i put on par with\nthis(for varying reasons) are , a royal affair, the hunt, la grande\nbelleza, sound city, searching for sugar man. If you have not seen this\nfilm, you are in for a treat.\n"
"\nWhen a film is in a foreign language and is subtitled, you know it has\nto be a very good film for you to enjoy it, and i have to say i\nabsolutely loved this film. I'm usually not one to watch these type of\nfilms, i usually prefer action films however the humour this film gave\nalong with the strong story-line was presented very well, making me\nlaugh and smile through-out the whole of the movie. I would really\nrecommend this film to many different audiences, especially to those\nwho wouldn't usually watch this type of film because It is so unique\nand gripping. The actors were perfect for the parts, and they played\nthere roles very well. The realistic story line was key to the success\nof this film, and i will be sure to watch this more than once it is\nthat good.\n"
"\nI loved this movie! It had absolutely all the elements of a great film.\nThe acting was amazing and the cinematography was fabulous. It had many\nmessages - all done in a really nice subtle way. The music was perfect\ntoo.<br><br>I really loved that last shot of Driss looking back in the window. That\nshot with his facial expression said it all and will stick in my mind.<br><br>The only thing that bothered me was the ending writing about what\nhappened to them. I thought it broke the mood some and it would have\nbeen better left unsaid. But then I remembered that this was based on a\ntrue story, so that makes it more justified.<br><br>Omar Sy is loaded with talent. I will check out his other movies.\n"
"\nThe fact that its French with subtitles makes this film all the more\nfunnier, if it was an American film it just wouldn't be so good. The\nfilm makes you feel so good, and they spare the pity which means you\nenjoy the film all the way through, which makes it uplifting in a\nrefreshing way.<br><br>The fact that in this months Top Gear Magazine ( September 2013) I was\nadvised by Mr Jeremy Clarkson to see this film makes it more special to\nme (even if his point was based on the very cool Maserati Quattroporte\nthey use in the film)<br><br>Thank you for making this film, and thanks to Mr Clarkson for the\nrecommendation! <br><br>Now go buy/rent/watch this film!!!\n"
"\nThe French film, \"The Intouchables\" is a very moving story based on\ntrue to life characters. It is directed by Olivier Nakache and Eric\nToledano. And it is written by Olivier Nakache and Eric Toledano as\nwell. The story involves a wealthy quadriplegic man who is aided by a\nblack man of little means. The plot quickly evolves and is checkered\nwith bits of comic relief as in many of Shakespeare's plays. There are\nmoments of tearfulness as well as outright laughter interspersed in\nsuch a way as to make this a very satisfying experience. I can highly\nrecommend this French film with subtitles for it's humanity that is\nquite evident from beginning to end. In addition the sound track of\ncars racing down the road give one's sound system a vigorous workout.\n"

"\nPhilippe and Driss's story is based on the friendship between Philippe\nPozzo di Borgo and Abdel Sellou, proving that even two people from\nopposite backgrounds and life styles can create a heart-warming\nfriendship. The film is excellent: touching and funny (even hilarious\nat times). Ludovico Einaudi did a great job on the soundtrack, it fits\nperfectly. The acting is superb, very natural. François Cluzet and Omar\nSy have great chemistry together. After watching Intouchables, I just\ncouldn't stop smiling.<br><br>I can't believe Intouchables wasn't even nominated for an Oscar. It\ndefinitely should have been on the nominated list. It's one of the best\nfilms I've seen so far. A film with a great message: to be together is\nbetter than to be alone.\n"
