"\nI have always loved action movies, especially those which involve fast\ncars, explosions, preposterous plans and daring execution. Fast and the\nFurious Franchise gave me everything and more!! Vin Diesel is awesome\nfor his role as Dom. For me the movie was great in all respects except\none.<br><br>A NATO General, from within a secure NATO Base, gives away (or easily\nlets a gang of robbers drive away with) an absolutely critical piece of\nelectronic hardware, which can potentially defeat an entire nation,\njust because one member of the lead character's family has been\nkidnapped is ridiculous. Juvenile. Unacceptable Story. Period.\n"
"\nI want this movie to come out on DVD now so I can watch all the movies\nin the right order :P. I also love how people clapped when they thought\nVin died. I was like have you not seen Tokyo drift? I also like how\nthey connected this film to Tokyo drift. I finally get the back story\non it. I loved this movie and am looking forward to them making more. I\nam also glad they brought in Statham. I was wondering why Vin came to\nTokyo but now I know. All the connections in this film were done very\nwell. It was good to see the full team back together again and them\ncome back home where they belong. I am interested in seeing how\nStatham's role is for this movie if he plays the same type he does in\nhis other movies.\n"
"\nA typical fast and furious movie loaded with machine guns,cars,muscular\nmen,chicks,..etc...so far this is the best fast and furious\nmovie,..very fast,enjoyable with terrific and exhaustible action\nsequences,..fast and furious fans should watch it,..and i recommend for\nothers too,..actually highly recommended... it promises u for the 7th\npart in the end which ends up in Tokyo,,.. the next thing i wont\ntell,..because i don't want to spoil u'r movie. The movie keeps u\nentertained with a very fast moving plot,...jay z and ludicrous's\nsongs,.. FURIOUS 6 is a pure action adrenal type movie,..and a must\nwatch,..GO FOR IT...don't miss this one\n"
"\nJust watched it in France, gonna admit it is just explosive and best\naction movie so far this year: Well balanced timing, good fight\nfeaturing Rodriguez, a great tag team tornado match for the grand\nfinally. Don't even think about story line because this kind of movie\ncan make you believe anything as long as punchlines from each\ncharacters, punches from the main ones, put a step further to the never\nseen before one of a kind car chasing (e.g tank vs old cars / aircraft\nvs muscle cars) You have to remember a wrestlemania like match feat.\nRock/Diesel which is as good as Superman/Batman fighting together. Over\nthe top : ending preparing the Fast and Furious team Vs The Transporter\n: 2014 great year upcoming...\n"
"\nThis was certainly best movie in Fast And The Furious series. Best in\nall 6 movies. Like always movie goes on series of events, whose\nsolution could only be fast cars and action. Laws of physics do not\napply to Fast Movies, because following laws of physics is something\nHollywood has given responsibility to Christopher Nolan. So trailers\nmade me to go watch this movie on first day and it was certainly the\nbest idea. It was more fun that any of fast movie. Great mix of comedy,\naction, romance too. An extraordinary villain was present here, who was\nundoubtedly best among all the villains we have seen before in this\nseries. Making money and steeling was not the focus, but something else\nwas at the stake. So watching criminals work with the police, this was\njust amazing. Dwayne Johnson, The Rock again rocks the action scenes\nwith his never ending style. Best Fast movie ever Made.\n"
"\nI was surprised by the low reviews and so much trash talk about the\nfilm. I am so HAPPY that the entire cast from Fast 5 is in the movie.\nFilm makers and Directors don't understand how important it is for the\ncharacters to remain the same, yet grow on screen. I am LOVING how the\nintroduced the plot- which is another Job. Not to mention sexy sexy\nsexy cast! I'm only 16 minutes in, but I am LOVING, LOVING, LOVING IT!!\nThe adversary in this movie is sure to leave you hanging on the edge of\nyour seats, while I am getting some hint of the first Batman remake\nwith Heath Ledger, by some of the cars and stunts. This \"bad guy\" in\nthe movie is giving the Guys of Fast &amp; the Furious a run for their\nmoney!\n"
"\nTo say this is a guilty pleasure would be putting it mildly. Since the\nfirst time I saw 'The Fast and The Furious' 12 years ago, I knew I\nfound my car/mayhem fix. Although I never thought it would last to see\niteration #6, I was more eager this time around than for the first. No\nsurprises, besides the unpredictable nature of Owen Shaw. The only real\ncurveball was the substantiation of an Internet rumor that Jason\nStatham joined 'Fast 6'. Well, sorta -- end credits. After the audience\n\"ooooohh's\" at Statham's revealing, I couldn't wait, yet again, for the\n7th! <br><br>Fun factoid: This movie marked the reuniting of 2 'Lock Stock and Two\nSmoking Barrels' characters. Jason Statham (Bacon) and Stephen Marcus\n(Nick the Greek) playing the CCTV supervisor opposite Lucas Hobbs. :)\n"
"\nThe cars are one of the basic elements for action movies nowadays and\nthat's the reason for fast &amp; furious's success. After Rio, Toretto's\nfamily: Dominic, O Conner, Mia are now at Europa, and Hobbs ask them\nfor help because a Russian ex-military is planning traffic with a\npowerful weapon; one argue is convincing: Letty is alive. Spectacular\nsequences, big cars, London, and Spain Highways are the complement for\nthis movie. When we think that the movie is ending, takes places a\nstory change. One of the think that like me from the movie is that\nbetween lines they promote the value of the family, and one dialog from\nToretto show this: \"Do not turn your back on your family even if they\ngive it to you if\". A excellent sequence introduce a Jason Statham as\na new villain for the next movie and explain how Han Lue dead.\n"
"\nYes, this movie had a lot of clichés, but they can be ignored by the\nfast paced and the grasping screenplay. Great direction. This can be\ncalled a complete movie as it has all the essential elements like\ncomedy, action, drama etc. If you are an emotional fool, then yes this\nmovie is for you too. :P Regarding the history of the series, it would\nbe helpful if you have seen the previous parts of the series, before\nwatching this movie. I won't say much about it, you should go for it.\nThough it is a one time watch, but it is worth every penny and the time\nthat you will spend on it. The bottom line, You won't be disappointed\nafter watching this movie. This movie has done justice to the series\nand the expectations. And don't walk out of the theater as soon as you\nsee the credits coming, because there is a BIG and i mean BIIIIIIIGGG\nsurprise coming. And all i can say now is that the next part is going\nto be legen- wait for it(literally)- dary(hopefully) So, anyways go for\nit. Great movie. 8/10\n"
"\nI'm a big fan of the Fast &amp; Furious franchise, but since the last movie\n(Rio) i was like \"it's a good action movie, but it had lost its\nessence\". Now, after watching F&amp;F 6, i've the feeling that one part of\nthe original story is back. The cars have a bigger role (now they can\nbe called secondary characters), but still isn't the same as F&amp;F , F&amp;F\n2 and F&amp;F Tokio. All the characters (specially Dom, Brian, Hobbs and\nLetty) were well created, respecting their origins and explaining some\nimportant details from the past movies. I've rated 8 for some reasons:\n1) action sequences that goes against gravity in so many ways; 2) it's\na little too long; 3) the cars and races still have a secondary role.<br><br>In general it's a great action movie, with a good plot, nice races,\nreally funny (thanks Roman!) and exciting. If you're a big fan of F&amp;F,\nwhy haven't you watched yet?? If you're not a fan, but like action\nmovies, i strongly recommend it!<br><br>Hope this review helps!\n"
"\nUnlike other movie series, this movie wont disappoint you for a bit.\nKeeps you on the edge of the seat most of the time and at times takes\nyou to totally relaxing mood, like coming back home.<br><br>Action packed, fast paced with a touch of romance and giggles, Fast 6\nopens up an entire new platform for explosive movies. Though you will\nfind Vin Diesel getting older he still has got some good fights to\nenthrall you. Rock is as usual his best, you may wonder if he is just\ncoming out of gym working out. <br><br>There are 2 action sequences that you must not miss. And also the last\n1 minute.<br><br>.. and finally a piece of advice. Its one of the movies that you should\nnot miss watching on the big screen, so don't wait for the\nDVDs/torrents to come out. <br><br>VAI SCORE : Action - 9 /10 Script - 7/10 Acting - 8/10 Music - 7/10\nTheatrical experience - 9/10 Overall - 8/10\n"
"\nAfter the last of fast and furious i was a little afraid this number 6\nwould also be one big fight and gun movie instead of a core streetrace\nand car based movie. But they definitely surprised me when i saw this\nmovie yesterday they are more back to there roots like in the first 3\nmovies with a lot of racing and cars all over the movie! Than add lots\nof humor and great looking girls, locations, cars and weapons and a\nlong with all the amazing actor's you get this astonishing movie!!<br><br>I Say GREAT Job to the maker of this movie and keep up the good\ncombination of all elements and especially the racing part as this is\nthe core of the movie and not shooting and fighting like there was a\nlittle to much on 4 and 5.<br><br>I cant wait until the new upcoming number 7 with Jason Statham!\n"
"\nHaving only seen Fast &amp; Furious 4 &amp; 5! This was pretty epic! <br><br>The story was pretty decent! Not amazing, but pretty good in it's own\nrespect! Also how it took place in London was pretty ace! Liked the\nrapid shots of the chases that took place! The fighting scenes were\nepic! Especially the ones that took place in the London underground!\nReally got me on the edge of my seat! Lacked racing abit but wasn't too\nbad! <br><br>The ending was just epic! With the car chase in Spain with the army\ntank! Epic! Along with the epic finale ending with them taking down the\ngiant air plane, along with fights taking place in the air plane!! Then\nthe plane blowing up into flames! Just awesome! <br><br>Overall a decent film! With great action sequences in it! 9/10\n"
"\nOutstanding, blow of mind, awesome movie.....Vin diesel and Dwayne\nJohnson was incredible.. Story was way better than before.. Plot was\nstrong.. Must watch movie. I really liked it personally.. It was worth\nwatching from beginning till the end.. Worth spending money ;)... Cars\nI love cars story actually revolves around it.. Awesome techniques..\nWhat a direction of the movie.. Ludicrous and tyrese they both acted\nvery well in their places. They make u laugh and enjoy the movie :)...\nI must suggest this movie as a must watch ... Awesome awesome awesome\n;) Excitement Entertaining Above all Wowwwwwwww ;) ... Fighting was\ngreat. Stunts were absolutely amazing.. Worth full movie of the month\n;)\n"
"\nAs great as the original Fast &amp; Furious! High adrenaline and fast cars.\nWho would have guessed they would have put so much time into the\nstoryline along with the time they put in these actor's appearances. It\nis a great movie for those adults &amp; young adults who have grown up with\nthese movies. Due to the fighting and drug cartel references not a\ngreat movie for kids. This is a movie you would want to leave the\nkiddos home with a babysitter as you enjoy it. Upbeat, high energy, and\nwill leave you smiling! This is a great movie to watch with the full\nimpact of the movie theater experience. An absolute must see! Never a\ndull moment!\n"
"\nI'm going to keep this short, simple and sweet because that is exactly\nwhat this film is. It's great summer fun for all ages that manages to\nsucceed on the one thing I hate in horror movies; make an idiot of\nitself. It is where this stupidity in plot events comes from that gives\nthe film its fuel to do nothing but provide brainless over-the-top\npopcorn fun. It is done so by having some of the best sound editing I\nhave heard in a while with brilliantly paced action sequences, with one\nfight scene in particular that will surly be the best action scene of\nthe year. I recommend Furious 6 if you're looking to have some fun, but\nwhatever you do, do not walk in there expecting The King's Speech,\nbecause it is not what this movie is trying to be- which makes this\nfilm so admirable.<br><br>Grade: B+\n"
"\nThe F-N-F crew has struck GOLD again yet again. Man, as long as you\nguys keeping making these movies, I will be paying to see them, and\nwaiting on the Blue-Ray to drop. And a lot of sequels, they don't get\nbetter, they don't get it right on the second, to even get a chance for\na third, but yours do. And adding more fire power as your franchise\ngrows is an awesome touch for then fan base! The Rock was an awesome\naddition. Vin and Paul, keep up the great work.... And Paul, I'm a\nNissan guy too, so seeing the GTRs and those 240sx pop up time after\ntime is all the better. Vin you need to switch from the Mopor man, LOL.\nF-N-F, you have a true fan for life. \"Ride Or Die\"!!!\n"
"\nThis edition \"took-it-all\". Fast car chases, furious fight scenes, and\nan engaging story-line with a nice \"twist\" in the end. <br><br>I am convinced that they'll have a \"very\" difficult time following this\nact. However, when you see the end, you'll without-a-doubt conclude\nthat a \"Fast 7\" is already in the works.<br><br>The villain in this film has many tentacles, and a family of His own\nthat could lead to even more intrigue in a 7th film. Michelle Rodriguez\nwas amazing in the reprisal her role as Letty, and her fight scene with\nGina Carano would make even Chuck Norris smile.<br><br>Overall, it was Tyrese Gibson's character that added the most\nsignificant amount of laughs. What I did find amazing about this\nfranchise is that each film seems to out-do it's predecessor. Should\nthere be a 7th film (and there will be), the film-makers will have\ntheir work cut-out for them, because this movie out-did the others by\nlight years.... <br><br>Go see it in the biggest screen possible.\n"
"\nDon't know if this is a spoiler but this is a Very good movie ! i've\nhave been a fan of this movie since i was kid. I recommended you if you\nare first time watching this film, please watch, in order to understand\nthe movie, and understand how the characters met. <br><br>1. The Fast and the Furious 2. 2 Fast 2 Furious 3. The Fast and the\nFurious: Tokyo Drift 4. Fast &amp; Furious 4 5. Fast Five 6. Fast Six<br><br>When you finish watching fast 6, watch The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo\nDrift again, to understand how the ending of fast 6 happen.<br><br>In my opinion, the film is setup like this<br><br>1. The Fast and the Furious 2. 2 Fast 2 Furious 4. Fast &amp; Furious 4 5.\nFast Five 6. Fast Six 3. The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift 7. Fast\nSeven (In the making)<br><br>It may seem weird but the writer is a smart guy !\n"
"\nYou might think this series of films would get dull by now,no way,it's\nstill brilliant over the top action. The main crux of this one is this\nis Dominic finds out Letty is still alive and working for a bunch of\ncrimials. So Dominic teams up with the police to find her,he does so\nand she... Well i won't tell you,but it's all brilliantly played\nout,leaving the viewer wondering just what is going on in Letty's mind.\nSo another fast and furious and the end leaves you with no doubt\nthey'll be yet another. the fast and furious series just keeps getting\nbetter and better so far fast and furious six has to be the best film\nin the series.\n"
"\nWhat an amazing movie! I can't believe the next movie will have Jason\nStatham in it, and as a bad guy, nonetheless. There has been a rumor\ngoing around, that I would like to put to rest! People have been saying\nin Fast 7, one of the main protagonists, Brian or Dom, is going to die!\nThis is untrue, although a good contributing character will be killed.\nOh No!!! But this is one of the most amazingly spectacular movie series\nof all time, but that is just an opinion of a great fan! For whoever\nreads this review, I am sorry for the spoiler, but please enjoy the\nnext movie!!! I hope that in the next movie, another new character will\nbe added to the series, which I am sure will happen. Thanks to the\nknowing of the coming of Ian Shaw!!\n"
"\nThis must be my favorite movie of all times. Having seen it for the\nfirst time this past weekend I was captivated by this brilliant piece\nof work. In the years ahead,I probably will see it a \"million\"\ntimes,owning it on DVD and future formats.<br><br>Why is it so great? This is a movie that keeps you locked to the\nscreen,because it has everything a great movie should have. A great\nstory,a good length,tension,it is Vin Disel movie and the actors give\ntop performances. Not just the Rock,although his performance is\nbrilliant,but everyone else.<br><br>I will not repeat the story here,but I can tell you,this film will\ncapture you,all the characters are portrayed brilliantly by the actors.\nThere is excitement,humor,tension,drama and emotion. See it,you will\nnot regret it!\n"
"\nI loved this movie. Yes the plot, scenes are way over the top, but\nthat's what makes this movie rock. It's an action, upon action movie,\nit was exciting to watch the scenes fly buy, the fighting was awesome,\nall through the movie, were super cool scenes, the cars, the locations,\nit was just great. I don't know what the Rock, Dwayne Johnson is doing,\nbut he is a beast in this movie. The scene between him and the huge\nwhite boy at the end made me think of the fight between godzilla and\nmothra. The fight scenes between Michelle Rodrigues character and the\nother lady were tough, and exciting. All the supporting cast did their\nparts well. Laughter and good times by the whole crew was great to see.\nThe plot was predictable but still enjoyable. You don't have any time\nto get bored because the breaks in action don't last that long. The\nmovie is a great ride.\n"
"\nGee, unlike one of the most oddly, preposterously successful recent\n\"franchise\" movies, this one decides it will NOT fall into the \"let's\nmake depressing entertainment\" category. In that \"other\" movie, the\npsychologically damaged love interest gets used sexually, and then a\nday later, just for good measure, shot in the face. In Furious 6, a\nlove interest in the series actually comes back to life. Isn't this how\nmovies are supposed to be made? Guys have been trained to walk out of\nmovies wanting to be like the hero of the movie. The box office of\nFurious 6 restored my faith in mankind. OK, it hasn't eclipsed 1.2B,\nbut there's still time left.\n"
"\nMovie was up to the mark. There were lot of hilarious moments. Rock was\nexcellent in the movie. All the characters gel up really well. Letty is\nback :D. The movie was fast and furious. The scene with the airplane in\nthe climax is one of the highlights of the movie. I will give this a\n10/10 rating right away. Don't miss it. go and watch it right away. I\nam very eager for the next installment now. the film is filled with all\nthe high-octane speed chases and close combat scenes we've come to\nexpect from the franchise. I think this is one of the best film in the\nfranchise. As is the trend nowadays, the closing credits provide a\nteaser of what's to come. In a Tokyo-set interlude we are introduced to\nyet another popular action star who will likely join the fast and\nfurious crew for joyride number seven. Keep those seat belts fastened.\nFast &amp; Furious 6 is back to wheel power.\n"
"\nIf there was any doubts as to why Fast and Furious has a cult following\nin the box office, here is your answer. It had everything that you\nassociate with this franchise. Even they part where the throw physics\nout the window!!! <br><br>It starts out with Dom and O'Connor in there retreat in Spain when\nHobbs come to ask Dom for help in bringing down a bunch of highly\ncoordinated street races cum thieves. He also shows Dom a recent photo\nof Letty so that he just cant turn down the offer. From the streets of\nLondon to an army base in Spain. Its one roller coaster ride of fast\ncars.. incredible action sequences... A couple of girl on girl fights\nwhich were pretty awesome by the way.<br><br>Total entertainment guaranteed.\n"
"\nThis movie is so cool. It is full of action and highly-technical\nstunts. I can't wait to see more of these. It has a very unique idea of\nhow a real person can achieve everything as long as he/she has the\ntenacity to pursue everything. Two thumbs up guys. I hope next time, F\n&amp; F will feature some more scenes. Some more cool races and actions. We\nwould love to see more of these. The thrill did not get out of\nourselves even after we finished watching this one. Actors are really\ninto the action. You can feel that they love the movie so much as if it\nwere real to them. A race that would amaze us even more is what we are\nlooking for in the next F &amp; F. We'd love to hear the F &amp; F 7.\n"
"\nThis is a really good, action packed, physics defying and entertaining\nfilm. After Vin Diesels return to the series it has been better and\nbetter, yes they still drive cars, yes they still do heists, yes they\nmake it look really easy and cool to race a car and drive recklessly,\nbut it all works, it is very entertaining and fun.<br><br>I also think the new not just racing cars work for this series of\nfilms, there has to be more to it then racing, the family aspect and\naction aspects really gives it something new and exciting.<br><br>I don't know what is going to happen with the seventh installment of\nthis, now that Paul Walker can't be part of the crew, he did a great\njob and will be missed, but I hope they continue in the same spirit and\nif nothing else finish it off in a nice way.\n"
"\nYou probably think most reviewers gave this film high marks because of\nPaul Walker's sudden death soon after it's release, but that is not the\ncase, it is a great film. Maybe not as good as Fast Five, but number\nsix does have a good story.<br><br>However, it is unfortunate that Paul Walker died so suddenly, because\nthe future of the franchise will ultimately be different. It really\nwon't be the same. Especially since his character is explored so much\nin this film, becoming a father and having a family. I won't go too far\ninto that though.<br><br>The cliffhanger ending makes you really want to see number seven, as it\nis the penultimate film in the series, revolving around story-lines\nthat also include those in Tokyo Drift. Like what happened to Han? And\nwhat will become of Dom and Brian? Guess we will see the answers to\nthose questions on April 3, 2015. See you there.\n"
"\nThis was by far and away THE best of the Fast &amp; Furious series! It is\nnon-stop from beginning to end. The opening sequence is awesome, the\nway this movie pulls in ALL of the movies in the series to date and\ncloses the loops/jumps of it is by far better than any other movie\nseries I have seen. I have never seen a movie pull from all previous\nmovies to make up it's opening credits! Having all the old crew mixed\nwith the new crew from Fast 5 is what put this movie over the top for\nme! I honestly CANNOT wait until Fast 7 next year! If this one is any\nindication, it will NOT disappoint. I highly recommend catching this\none in theaters. It will be awesome on DVD, but the full effect of the\nmovie can only be had on the big screen!!! Will definitely be buying\nthis the day it is released to DVD! This movie delivered everything the\ncredits promised and SO MUCH MORE!\n"
"\nFurious 6. Made on a story that can be detailed in single line \"Hobbs\nhas Dom and Brian reassemble their crew in order to take down a\nmastermind who commands an organization of mercenary drivers across 12\ncountries.\" Furious 6 is a mad enjoyable watch or some sort of guilty\npleasure. Lack of a thrilling storyline is covered by grand canvas,\nruthless action, races and chases, peppy background score, man on man\nfights, woman on woman fights, cars against tanks and even planes. Some\naction scenes go over the top and you need to avoid applying logic\nevery now and then to enjoy the sequences. All actors play their part\nOK and their conversations are mostly laced with delicious one liners.\nSo, Furious 6 delivers what it promises, fasten your seat belts and\nenjoy the ride.\n"
"\nGreat film good action and very good stunts well worth a watch. Starts\noff with vin being abroad and the rock finding him to tell him they\nhave found letty and that she is in a bad gang of people.so the rock\ntry's to get vin to catch the gang and possibly get letty out. So vin\nneeds to get the crew back together from all over the world to try and\ncatch the gang..a lot of well played stunts involved a lot of crashing\nand flipping cars caused by the flip car and to top it all of even\nmanage to get a tank in as well and flip that. But as for the cars good\nold British car the escort some good jumps with that.bmw flipping and\nsmashing them.not for getting the dodge I could go on but you will have\nto watch it and see for yourself.other wise I could go on.\n"
"\nBased on the amount of running time I think the plot was well executed.\nApart from a few goofs here and there I think the car chases were\nsuperb. Also the character would need to get facts right on cars\nespecially the V12 American muscle! Most of the scenes repeat in terms\nof cars on the road which are seen on multiple scenes. The introduction\nof newer cars is also superb typically the Nissan Skyline driven by the\nLate Paul Walker. I think Hobbs role has also been well done. Many\nfactual errors occur especially in the last bit of the tank scene and\nthe chain that hangs on the bridge together with reality versus action.\nThe Antonov also takes too long to lift thus causing an unrealistic\nsituation concerning runway length. Its a great title but not\nnecessarily for anyone obsessed with facts rather than fiction mostly\non the last quarter. We would also have loved it better in 3D the 3rd\ndimension of things would bring a bit more realism and adrenalin. All\nthe same I think that was nearly excellent. Good Work!!\n"
"\nI had kinda given up on these movies after 2 Fast, 2 Furious, skipping\nTokyo Drift.. When Fast Five came out i had SO many people at work\ntelling me \"oh it was awesome\" and with all the buzz Fast 6 was\ngetting, i splurged on the Best Buy 10 buck deal and picked up Fast 4\nand 5 and watched them... They were entertaining... <br><br>Fast 6, though, really does take it to a whole new level. The action\nand stunt choreography were incredible, the twist of who the mole was\nin Hobbes' team was a legit surprise, and Giselle's death really caught\nme off-guard and struck me emotionally. <br><br>You knew Han had to die eventually (he had become my favourite\ncharacter in the 3 films), and i think i might actually go back to\nwatch Tokyo Drift just to see the end of his character properly. <br><br>This was a really good movie. Justin Lin has got to be one of the most\nunderrated action directors going right now!\n"
"\nThis is probably one of the best movie's in the Fast and the Furious\nfranchise. It took a long time for it all to lead to Tokyo Drift and we\nfinally find out what the ending of Tokyo drift was all about through\nthis movie, Han goes to Tokyo. While most franchises lose their steam\nwith each succeeding sequel, the Fast and the Furious franchise is that\nrare exception where its later films breathe in new life into the\nseries.The cast seems to sleepwalk through the production with only the\noccasional chase or explosion or plane crash to jar the audience out of\nits stupor. And speaking of aeroplanes, the concluding sequence - which\nfeatures a Russian cargo jet lumbering for takeoff with cars and the\nentire cast either hanging from it or chasing it - goes on so long the\nrunway has to be at least 50 miles long. In conclusion, this movie was\ngood, bye.\n"
"\nThis movie revealed a powerful sequel to the 5th in the series. With\nthe classic car chases, incredible action sequences, and explosive\nending there was more than enough entertainment to sate even the most\nardent movie goer. The quality and quantity covered within the movie\nrevealed rekindled relationships, further deepened intimacies, and\nunexpected deaths. The movie managed to keep the franchise on track in\nterms of both accuracy and success. This movie was a splendid creation\nthat is a true testament to the art of mobile action. The one\nanachronism that I noticed, but not pinpointed by How It Should of\nEnded, was the scene in the preliminary car chase where the bad guys\nsimply fired gadgets onto their pursuers' cars, which in effect,\ndetonated a blow out of one of the car's tires. The question, why not\nreplace this gun with a more powerful explosive. Just something to\nthink about.\n"
"\nI don't know why people are bitching about direction of movie is bad.\nThis movie franchise is all about cars and crazy stunts and well ya\nabout cars. f**k the story story is secondary when we watch this fast\nand furious series it's all about gorgeous racing cars.. You want story\ngo watch pearl seven borne. You don't go for story when you watch\nStepup franchise all you care is freaking dance.. so to the people who\ndid't like this movie you did't see what actually the director wanted\nyou to look.If the movie had story primary then people would be\nbitching about \"there weren't enough cars in there franchise forgot\nwhat this series is all about\".get over it. Conclusion:Movies was\nawesome one of the best of the franchise. cars were new not seen early\nin any movies.cleared the tokyo drift ending connection. MUST WATCH FOR\nALL fast and furious fans\n"
"\nFast and Furious won't let you down. Even it is a 6th installment on\nthis series it still rocks. Movie is turbo loaded popcorn entertainmet\nloaded with testosteroine and smell of gas. The story isn't the\nbrightest, but that can easilly forgive because this movie is exactly\nwhat you are waiting for. Movie is full of great action scenes which\nare so exaggeration that you can only laugh for them. Thankfully movie\ndoesn't take itself too seriously, you understand that at the latest\nwhen Dwayne Johnson is to be called as a sumerian Thor. With the\nprevious movie I was hoping that next movie get it's bad guy from Jason\nStatham. It didn't became truth in this movie, but the end scene\npromises that Jason Statham will be the bad guy in next installment.\nCan't wait to see that. Leave your brains to cloakroom and enjoy great\nentertainment.\n"
"\nSuperb action. Plot failures doesn't matter. It is about love, passion\nand fast cars.<br><br>Life is very simple when you have a passion, principle and strength to\nfollow them.<br><br>Best one of the series. Looking forward to the twist in the next one.<br><br>It is hard to imagine what can top the tank and the airplane sequence.\nMaybe the Statham's charisma :)<br><br>You cannot describe an action movie in words. It's about emotions. Just\nwatch it. Reminds me of the good old action movies with Schwarznegger.\nthe spirit is there\n"
"\nYes, Yes, Yes, The film had my heart racing, the fight scene were\ngreat, the story was great, and the cars were awesome as usual. I can\neven accept the story line, and how everything ties into each other.\nRoman's character reminds me of my cousin, always got something to say,\nand keeps me shaking my head at him. Seeing Jason Statham at the end\nwas a great surprise too. I'm hoping the next movie will have a great\nchase scene. This is one of few franchises were you don't want any of\nthe characters to die, I like all of them, especially Han, he was one\ncool cat. keep the films coming guys, Vin you are a smart business man\nI tell ya, put me in a film too.....how about an audition for a new\ncharacter on the team, who is longing to be part of a family, I do my\nown stunts to.\n"
"\nI loved this movie great action scenes and amazing on screen chemistry\nbetween the whole cast. In my opinion this is the best Fast and Furious\nyet. I was on the edge of my seat for almost the whole movie and in\ntears for a couple of parts. I cannot wait for the Seventh installment\nto this franchise. I'm a huge fan of this franchise and the way it\nkeeps you guessing time after time. Vin Diesel plays this character to\na T and has since the beginning , Michele Rodriguez is absolutely\nbrilliant in this film she is as good as it gets when it comes to\nfemale action hero's and shows it off several times in this film. The\nseventh installment in this franchise is going to be great based on the\nsmall snippet show in the credits of this film.\n"
"\nGreat cars, fine actors, amazing fights and OMG the actions scenes from\nthe car chases were good enough to make me happy and put a big ass\nsmile on my face. Even if you don't like cars, this is a great example\nof a good action movie, fun, simple but with nice twists and...if you\nreally don't like cars, with this franchise you will start liking them,\nand a lot! Can't wait for the next one. Finally this movies, the fast\nand furious franchise did something other franchises should do, mix the\nrecipe, change the story, present new and exciting characters and make\na new great feeling for the movies to come. Hope other franchise do the\nsame, if necessary!\n"
"\nShouldn't this be listed as a SYfY action film? Dumb, just plain dumb!\nWho writes this crap and who is dumb enough to produce this? So\nunrealistic you can't even watch the movie, because it's just plain\ndumb! It's not even worth wasting your time watching it on cable TV.

"\nThis movie was too crazy and silly to be any good. First of all, since\nit is the sixth film in the serious, you already know there is no plot.\nAnd then too many absurd things happen. Like Brian returns to LA to go\nto prison under an assumed name. His cop friend just gets him in a high\nsecurity prison under a false name and then he meets the guy he was\nlooking for, fends him and his goons off, and the next thing you know\nhe's back on a plane to London. Yeah, sure. But the worst part of\ncourse is the ending and the plane. The action here is just too over\nthe top. Cars hanging on a plane, people jumping out of a fast moving\nplane and landing in a car. Give me a break, they would have been on\nthe runway. Then how long was this runway. And the plane explodes but\nDom walks away with not even a tear in his wife beater. And how could\nDom not have known to hide his sister, terrible.<br><br>FINAL VERDICT: Stay far away from this.\n"
"\nBy the time you see Han and his girl say that line about next is tokyo,\nyou know it's going to roll back to the beginning of Tokyo drift, and\nbecause Han was alone in the movie, so obviously the girl friend die in\nthis tragecly poor plot sequel of F&amp;F.<br><br>And then you realize Han's death was not of accident but murdered by\nmr. transporter here from out of nowhere... THIS IS HILOURISLY STUPID!\nI don't think I would care more about this franchise ... what an\ninsult. Letty's pathetic survival was by all mean has no logic in it.\nThis is cheesier than any soap opera I've seen all my life.<br><br>Thank you so much to bring a period to this awesome series to trash and\nplease put more trash cans into the next one if your intention is to\npraise trash anyway! still 1 star given to awesome action sequence\n"
"\nThis was by far the worst of the series. Fast and Furious used to be\nfilms about car people for car people now it's just another brainless\naction film for brainless viewers.<br><br>It's become too mainstream and that has ruined it for the people that\nmatter- their core audience. It actually makes me sad how ridiculous\nthis film is, I don't know where to start the Escort jump, the\nexplosions, the tank, and don't even get me started on the runway.<br><br>There was one street race and that included a ridiculous wheelie and\nsome impossible cornering. Why do they also think that changing gear\nimmediately makes you faster?<br><br>Seriously, if you are a mindless sheep you will enjoy this film but if\nyou were hoping for a proper fast and furious film you will be\nseriously disappointed.\n"
"\nI had never seen any of the Fast and Furious movies and I say this one\nby mistake, and I am glad I did. I believe they did a good job at\nexplain the back story for first time watchers. Will defiantly be\nwatching the other 5! For me there was a little to much unrealistic\nparts but I believe that is what happens with any high budget action\nmovie. Like I said this was my first Fast and Furious movie so I am not\nsure if every actor has been in every movie but I believe you can truly\ntell that they have an almost family like bond between the cast and\neven the crew. I believe that, the fact that they have this\nrelationship with each other truly adds to the movie. Now I could be\n100% wrong and they could just all hate each other and be great actors.\n"
"\nBelievability of this movie is on par with XXX (Triple X). As someone\nalready said, there is unnecessary fight between allies that no one\nelse but them sees. The part where Vin catapults himself out of his car\nto catch his girlfriend is... well.. I was pretty certain such scenes\ndied out from movies ten years ago, but no. The movie is insult to\nintelligence. I came to check it on IMDb expecting to see not more than\n4, and finding the people value it 7.4 is just another proof you quite\noften can't believe IMDb rates, both high and low. Watch it with your\nkids if you must, but be prepared for some royal punching in your\nbelievability synapses.\n"
"\nWith Fast &amp; Furious 6 the series starts going to a more darker path\nwhen one of the previous characters it's basically a ghost and one of\nour main characters tries to find it and bring it back. Luke Evans\nmakes an OK villain but the most amazing scenes in this movie is the\nones with the tank and when The Rock and Vin Diesel fought that big\ndude inside the plane. The thing that i hated the most is when Vin\njumps from the car grabs our 'ghost' (for those who might not have seen\nany of the previous ones i don't wanna spoil it that's why i don't say\nthe name) and they land on top of the car without breaking any bones so\nthat was unrealistic but anyways Fast &amp; Furious was never meant to be\ntaken seriously anyways guys.\n"
"\n\"I watched \"Fast &amp; Furious 6\" in theatres and I will tell you that I\nstarted to watch this series after my brothers showed me \"Fast Five\" in\ntheatres that film was easily became my one of the favorite action\nmovies till date\".<br><br>And when I watched the trailer for Fast 6 \"I was blown by it\" the\naction was much strong than the Fast Five so I decided to watch this\nbut I sadly say I was not impressed fully by it as compared to fast\nfive.<br><br>The action was insane but still it was not good in terms of emotions\nand feelings as they were good in Fast Five.<br><br>Dwayne Johnson my favorite hero was awesome in this movie as \"Luke\nHobbs\" and other actors were good but this movie is forgettable not\ngood as Fast Five but remains as a above average due to its action.\n"
"\nIt's not that the movie was bad, just that it became pretty absurd at\npoints and essentially lost all credibility. Now obviously I expect an\nelement of action not possible in reality but when you've got guys\njumping out of cars across a bridge while a tank is exploding and then\nsurviving all the while spitting out lame one liners.<br><br>Although the \"Fast and Furious 6\" contained unimpressive acting but\nbelievable acting and a cheesy dialogue, it was an action filled\nentertaining movie with comedy and a great plot. And just by the fact\nthat they ended the movie with a cliffhanger that connected to the\nthird instalment of the \"Fast\" saga, \"The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo\nDrift\" makes me want to go and see the seventh instalment set for 2014.\n"
"\nFast &amp; Furious 6<br><br>The best way to curb street racing in your community is to generate\nconstant gridlock.<br><br>Mind you, the racers in this action movie are inclined to go off-road.<br><br>Dominic (Vin Diesel) comes out of hiding to help DSS agent Hobbs\n(Dwayne Johnson) stop a rogue solider (Luke Evans) from selling an EMP\non the black market.<br><br>In exchange, he and his crew (Paul Walker, Gal Gadot, Jordana Brewster,\nSung Kang, Tyrese Gibson, Chris Bridges) want amnesty for their US\ncrimes and the freedom to return home.<br><br>The fifth sequel in the series, Fast 6 doesn't dazzle like its\npredecessor Fast 5 but it does maintain the franchise's new espionage\nangle.<br><br>And while street racing takes a back seat in this one, there are enough\noverblown car- chases, unexpected cameos and sudsy melodrama to propel\nthe series onward.<br><br>But, as always, this series ignores the real victims of street racing:\nran-over flag-girls. <br><br>Yellow Light<br><br>vidiotreviews.blogspot.ca\n"
"\nWhen I saw the \"Fast Five\" movie I thought and expected that \"Furious\n6\" was going to be a better movie than that, but it was not. And that's\nbecause this movie far surpassed some ordinary things that in all of\n\"The Fast and the Furious\" movies happened and I mean things with cars\nand not only.<br><br>I have to say that in this movie seemed bad (not say ugly) not all but\nsome of it the visual effects which were used on it. I like visual\neffects but when they used in moderation and not in a hole movie.<br><br>Finally I want to tell you that in \"Fast Five\" I liked the\ninterpretations of Paul Walker (Brian O'Conner), Dwayne Johnson (Hobbs)\nand Sung Kang (Han).\n"
"\nThe series that just can't quit - \"Fast &amp; The Furious 6\" is about as\npreposterous as they come (and I've seen Pacific Rim!), but all is\nforgiven when there's so much idiotic car chase action and nice\nscenery.<br><br>Like the souped-up muscle cars in the movie, it's noisy and it all goes\nby very fast, and a few hours later, I couldn't quite connect what the\nwhole James Bond plot was about, or really care. <br><br>It does have at least 4 good action set pieces, and by good I mean\nphysics-defying, Wile E. Coyote-type - but the film is somehow\ncheerfully silly/good none-the-less. <br><br>A brainless $3 matinée, well-priced.\n"
"\nThough the movie was not that bad.. I don't think it was all that good\neither. It was just a movie with action...... When compared to some of\nthe others in the series it stays with them....... I was expecting\nmore... hoping that they would top fast 5. but they didn't.<br><br>There were some good driving action scenes that's classic fast and\nfurious but the movie felt unfinished. The teaser at the end of the\nmovie was actually more exciting to me than most of the scenes in the\nmovie and that's saying something.<br><br>If you love the franchise don't miss the movie as it answers some\nquestions, however if you are looking for a good action movie to kill a\ncouple of hours....... Well this would not be my first choice... as a\nmatter of fact it would not even be my second.\n"
"\nFirst of all I cannot believe this is the 6th of this franchise!! Wow.<br><br>Well, the movie was exactly what I was expecting! Fast cars, and boom\nboom action! Regardless of what the real franchise was meant to be this\nmovie was OK. But only because there was some good action sequences\nmost of which looked real to me not like the animated looking action we\nsee these days! But guys, this is suppose to be a car racing type\nmovie! Which suddenly dissipated since the 3rd movie! Well you can find\nso many flaws in this movie that i don't even need to mention! But that\nrunway thing was totally i mean tooootally stupid.<br><br>You want good action? Go see this movie. You want to make sense of it?\nNo buddy this movie isn't for you.\n"
"\nHow should I start off this wonderful review? Hmm... Maybe I should\nstart off by saying this movie is probably the best one yet in the\n\"Fast and Furious\" serious! Maybe I could even say this movie is the\nbest movie of 2013! This movie is what some people like me like to call\ndiversified, I mean it has a little bit of action, comedy, and a slight\nbit of romance. There's this special type of bond that Paul Walker and\nVin Diesel have when they are acting together, it's like they bring out\nthe best of each other and when you have two good actors that can do\nsomething like that, it helps the other actors in the movie step their\ngame up. Ide also like to give congrats to the director of the film\nJustin Lin for another job well done. He never fails to amaze me with\ngreatness. To sum this whole thing up this movie is great and should be\nseen by any and everybody!\n"
"\nOK, you would think that by now I would have grown up a bit. Haven't I\nhad enough of mindless car chases and smoking hot scantily clad girls? <br><br>NAAAAAAAAAH!<br><br>Vin Diesel, Paul Walker, Dwayne Johnson and the rest of the bunch are\nback for FF 6, including Dominic's ex g/f Letty (Michelle Rodriguez)\nback from the dead (don't you love how they do that in movies?). The\nplot has something to do with preventing some international bad guys\nfrom getting the final piece to some dreaded weapons system, and...oh\nwho cares? <br><br>What's great about FF 6 is, like it's last couple of predecessors, it\ndoesn't take itself too seriously..at least not too often..or get too\ndistracted with silly things like a story. There are a few obligatory\nmoments of feigned drama, but it's once you get past those and get to\nthe racing that the movie really gets fun (there's one bad-ass racing\nsequence in particular, through the streets of London). Racing,\nshootouts, cool cars and hot babes bending over..what else do you need?<br><br>Stay tuned for FF 7.\n"
"\nThe new installment in the fast and furious franchise delivers exactly\nwhat you would expect it to; a lot of humor, unbelievable(bordering on\nunrealistic) action, stale emotion and of course fast cars<br><br>The plot is based around the team getting back together after their\nsuccessful Rio heist to help agent Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson) catch an\nequally impressive group of international villains lead by mastermind\nShaw(Luke Evans) to steal a high-tech government weapon. But the real\nreason that They agree to help is because Hobbs will give them free\npardons all around and Dom can get Letty back.<br><br>I am extremely happy that unlike most franchises, fast and furious is\nat it's 6th movie and is still pleasing it's fans.In conclusion, if you\nhave seen the previous fast and furious movies and enjoy seeing big\nexplosions, flipping cars and classic buddy-cop type humor than sit\nback, relax and enjoy the movie.\n"
"\nFollowing Fast Five and its post-credit scene, this was the most hyped\nsummer movie. And it did justify it somewhat, with me being edged to\nthe seat throughout its 130 minute run.<br><br>Its different from any other action series for having a gang that is\nfamily and has a code, primarily laid out by Dom. It increases its grip\nby nostalgic moments from its prequels (\"We Own It\") and is incredibly\nfast (amazing action sequences). Some of it is non-realistic, but we\nwon't term it as no-brainy. Yes it does have its weak moments, but\nit'll still be termed as 'Must Watch'.<br><br>Though best movie in the series still remains the 2001 original, this\nis pretty awesome. Without revealing much, do enjoy this and whatever\nyou do, don't leave your seat till the credits roll, believe me!\n"
"\nThe story line is continued from the previous part. So you will find\nrelations and references to their previous parts. It is satisfactory\nactually. In here they have added back a few characters, lost a few.\nAnd I should say, they are gonna introduce a really special character\nin their 7th part (I should keep that a secret for now). Totally\ncombined package of guns, blood, bullets, cars, and everything you can\nimagine in a Vin Diesel + Dwayne Johnson kind movies. And for action, I\nshould say they have really worked hard. Forget critics. If you are in\nthe FastnFurious line, this is a must watch. Also, they have got a\ntank!!! Worth the buck.\n"
"\nFast and Furious 6, With lot of expectations like other i being a\nmildest Fast and furious fan watched movie and shocked to see a lot of\nflaws in the movie. Being a 6 Sequel, it doesn't reach the fan's\nexpectations at any point of time.<br><br>Flaws i Observed : *How can team ignore when a Tank Crush a Lot of\nVehicles on the Road? Don't they Concern about the people in them? *How\nCan a Crushed Car with Ordinary Rope Can Dislocate the Tanker? *The Way\nVin Diesel caught Michelle Rodriguez looks Unrealistic. *How can three\nnormal Cars Control the High Speed Rotors of a Plane? *How can hero\nescape with his car from front part of plane while it blows off? <br><br>Being a Hollywood Movie Fan I myself felt Bored while watching and\nMovie Did not surprise me at any point of time. Hope F&amp;F 7 will be Good\nwith Jason Statham in it.\n"
"\nI don't want to go into too much detail because I hate when reviews\ncontain spoilers and I want to make sure I don't do that. To keep this\nshort and too the point this is probably the best movie in the series\nso far. If you've been a fan since the first film you will definitely\nenjoy this one as they go back to more of the street racing and such\nthat was so prevalent in the first film. There are a few twists and\nsurprises to this one, and yes a few scenes where you sit back and say\n\"Not possible\" or \"Only in a movie\" but what would an action movie be\nwithout completely impossible scenes at times? <br><br>Truth be told, go see it, I highly, HIGHLY doubt you will leave feeling\nlike you wasted your time or your money...and make sure you stay past\nthe initial credits.\n"
"\nJust came back from watching the 6th installment of the fast and\nfurious franchise and it lives up to it's expectations and then some.\nThe film brings the old crew back together for a final job to stop a\ncriminal only they can stop and of course The Rock approaches them for\nthis final task. There is plenty of action, a few racing scenes and as\nyou can expect cars being destroyed and hand to hand combat taking\nplace. The film offers more action then Fast 5 but I enjoyed them\nequally. There is also some scenes that will make you laugh thanks to\nthe character that Tyrese Gibson plays. Just when you think the film is\nover it is not and you are given one final encore. When the film\nfinally does end you will see a message stating not to attempt the\nstunts in the movie and then you are shown a race taking place in\nTokoyo with an unexpected surprise waiting for you if no one has ruined\nit yet. The film is a little over 2 hours but enjoyed every minute.\n"
"\nWhat an addition to the already top class franchise! This is Paul\nWalker's best performance of all the parts..Vin Diesel plays Dom\nwell,as always and Dwayne Johnson is the quirky,smart,big cop.Luke\nEvans plays Shaw so well,he's one of the best villains of the series.\nThe entire star cast looks well adapted to their respective character\nwhich makes the plot more believable. The action sequences are crazy!\nLetty returns,makes it even crazier. Inspite of such a crowded star\ncast,there's no confusion whatsoever throughout the movie. Gal Gadot's\ntragic end is touching..so is Han's. Overall,the movie may not have\nsuch a strong storyline,but it more than makes up for it with it's\nsoul,it's 12 year old core,superb action,great actors,crazy stunts and\nof course,that background score. Also,it's wonderful how the value of\nfamily is showcased. For me,its super-hit,adrenaline packed\nentertainment!\n"
"\nThis was by far the best of the Fast &amp; Furious series! It had a very\ngood storyline, a great villain, and the action was non-stop from start\nto finish. Can't wait to add the Blu-Ray to my collection when it come\nout! The humor is just the right amount without overshadowing the plot.\nSomehow, they continue to seamlessly weave the story lines of all\nprevious f&amp;f's together so that it all comes together with a big aha!\nDwayne Johnson and Vin Diesel (wow!) are both very good in their\nrespective roles. There really is no supporting cast in this movie\nbecause everyone carries off their roles like lead actors. Kudos to the\nfranchise for a great summer kickoff! Based on this latest release, I\ncan't wait to see what's next!\n"
"\nI wasn't sure what to expect when I stood in line for the advance\nscreening of Fast and Furious 6 four days before it opened in theaters\nto the public. All I knew was that I was a fan of the franchise thus\nfar and had high expectations. I am so pleased to say that the movie\nexceeded any of my existing expectations and did some things I didn't\nexpect at all. Fight scenes, great stunt work, fast cars, high powered\nweapons, gorgeous men (and for the men, beautiful women). I suggest\nthat you make sure that you have your drink, snacks and whatever else\nyou need to enjoy the movie prior to it starting, because if you leave\nyour seat, you will miss something. There is a thrill ride every minute\nin Fast and Furious 6. Action fans unite and go see this movie. Don't\nleave just because the end credits start rolling either.\n"
"\nWell Toretto went for the right thing as far as I am concerned. Those\nblack pants with the white design were worth the fight!! I couldn't\nhelp noticing all those Land Rovers travelling at break neck speeds.\nWay back when I purchased a surplus British Land Rover Series IIA. With\nFairey Hubs/Overdrive the best you could ever do was about 50MPH. But I\nguess with a V8 engine you can really push it now. Despite all the\npyrotechnics, I think the storyline was quite believable and the actors\nwere well chosen. Michelle Rodriguez is striking not so much for the\ntough fight scenes but more so for a moral toughness. I bet she is like\nthat in real life. The other characters were well played and fit their\nroles. Even though intellectually you know that the scenes can't\npossibly be real, your body believes it. The tank and huge aircraft\nscenes were scary beyond belief. I can't figure out what type of tank\nthat was, sort of a cross between a Chieftain &amp; AMX.\n"
"\nOK, After seeing the trailer and seeing the \"Airplane\" i thought \"this\nis gonna be horrible\" and guess what... IT WAS AWESOME. Honestly there\nisn't a single franchise that has the 6th film be the best, until now.\nEveryone is back, the story was great, then action was seriously out of\nthis world. This film makes Iron Man 3 look like garbage. I mean that.\nThis is without a doubt the action film of the summer, and is going to\nbe very difficult to top. And like all great movies, the ending was\nperfect. Go see it, I will be seeing it again, and without a doubt\nbuying this one on Blu-Ray. If the trailer is stopping you from seeing\nthis, don't let it, it's so worth your time and money.\n"
"\nAfter watching the trailer you go to the cinema with some ideas or\nfears of silly fun. Not at all! This movie is a really really enjoyable\nfun packed in a superb dose of action. Maybe 10 is a very high note,\nbut thinking on the kind of movie we decide to see, is what it\ndeserves. The movie have a lot of jokes that really work well with the\nplot. It's hard to get that combination (plot-jokes) work properly but\nthis is one of that rare cases. About the action, the scenes looks very\nnatural maybe some annoying close ups but overall very good job with\nchasing scenes. Funny, nice twists, nice action scenes, by far the best\nof the whole series. People was laughing, wowing and clapping. You love\ncars, action and fun? then you have to see it and enjoy it asap. Is by\nfar the most entertained movie released this year.\n"
"\nThe last one was good, because a lot of action at the rest of the plot,\nbut this one connected all the lost cable that bring us the 3 movie\n(Tokyo drift). Is sad to see how they traded one for one, I mean the\nlost of the girl in the last part, but that was necessary, but the\nending of this movie is going to make another epic fast and furious. I\nlike how the director make this movie, a lot of action, a little of\ndrama, a little of sad part, even race like the old times in the first\nmovie. Something that i did not saw was Tego Calderon and Don Omar. But\nVin Diesel told that in the next movie will be in Puerto Rico( or\nalmost some part of it) so the next one will be a revenge, plus a add\nto the family of toreto, the protagonist of the Tokyo drift. Is logical\nhe is going to revenge his friend Hank. So if you are reading this go\nsee the movie, and prepare to be 2 hours of action and in the last\nminute of the movie don't go , sit and watch the last part.\n"
"\nThe sixth movie of the fast and furious franchise continues on the new\npath that the franchise took with fast five. Toretto has gone from\nbeing a local street racer to the master mind of a heist of 100 million\ndollars. That sort of transformation is what the franchise has become,\nit isn't about street racing anymore. I am not condemning nor praising\nthis transformation, just merely pointing it out. The rush of NOS is\ngone and instead we have the rush of hand to hand combat and gun\nfights.<br><br>The movie starts with all the people from the previous movie(except for\nLeo and Santos) enjoying their life but Toretto decides to stop that\nbecause its time start a plot rolling. Hobbs who now wants to team up\nwith Torreto's team (despite the incident at the end of the last movie)\nto stop the master criminal Shaw.<br><br>The movie is hard to talk about without spoiling it so I will say that\nthe movie is ridiculous and if that intrigues you, then go see it!\n"
"\nWhy 5? Because they threw enough money at it to make it resemble\nentertainment.<br><br>Basically this film is about a group of immortal rich people who drive\nfast cars wherever and whenever they want, regardless of consequences.<br><br>There are only three ways that any of these immortals can die: <br><br>a) Failure to act cool regardless of the scenario <br><br>b) Deliver a line in a natural and unforced manner <br><br>c) To pretend that their not immortal after all, in the false hope that\nit gives them some depth<br><br>To round off the irrationality of this film, I'll pose a question. If a\nmember of your family died, how soon after would you have a bbq?\n"
"\nThis is not a movie, its a clip-show of stunts. There's not a lot of\npoint in reviewing \"Fast &amp; Furious 6\" because nobody is going to watch\nthis as a movie; you'll watch it to see the stunts and you'll watch it\nfor only as long as the escalating scope and scale of those stunts can\nhold your attention. For what its worth, the heart of the (I use this\nterm loosely) plot is a mcguffin. Usually this device is used to drive\na story; in the case of \"F&amp;F 6\" the only thing it drives is cars,\ntrucks, a plane and...uhm, no, that might count as a spoiler. Let's\njust say there's a sequence that is a militarist's wet dream and walk\naway. No character development, an awesome array of destruction, no\nwit, no sense, and dialogue unworthy of an 8th grade melodrama. But we\ndo get to watch, listen and cringe as Vin Diesel tries to do sensitive\nand romantic. THAT'S worth something. But in the end, remember that\nPaul Walker died making \"F&amp;F 6,\" and that is both tragic and ironic.\n"
"\nOver-earnest and determined to shoehorn in the funny despite that, this\nlatest instalment is a well-honed version of all the rest. Well done. I\nfound the 'family guys' interpolations insufferable and - typically for\nall sequels, of course - the scowling seriousness is now infused with\nirony. These people smug at being paid to re-hash the formula. At least\nPolice Academy tried to come up with jokes.<br><br>The big draw on this occasion is probably the location. We start in\nMoscow and then move to London for the first half of the film... in\nfact we start in London as well, as Lambeth Bridge seems to be doubling\nfor an anonymous crossing of the Moskva. My favourite appropriation is\nwhen an aerial shot prepares us for the obligatory motor party &amp; race.\nIt seems to be heading for the Treasury... oh, it is, right in the\ncentre of the Treasury! The consequent race spends at least four times\nas long on Lower Regent Street as is feasible at any speed and ends in\nBattersea. Loony. 4/10\n"
"\nI expected too much of it and that might be my fault, but i am more\nthan sure that the movie has not done enough justice with all the fans\nout there. <br><br>The previous parts were all great but this sixth sequel has sunk the\nbar too low and with all the cheap and cliché-contained tricks, applied\nto make this movie do something, has failed badly.<br><br>The only good parts are the hand-combat scenes and a little bit of\nhumor, while the rest of this crappy movie can't be bought by the\nintelligent viewers.<br><br>I did not wanted to write this review but i think it will save your\nprecious time if you just watch those scenes.\n"
"\nHello everone I hope this my short review on this movie will help you\nto decide watch it or not. First to say this movie will attract younger\naudience who seeks lots of destruction, chicks and nice cars..<br><br>Those who want a action movie with little reallity wont find this move\ninteresting<br><br>This film has moved a little in wrong direction since first one...its\nnot based on street racing and cars but are heroos are now specialist\non weapons, some sort of super anti terroristic crew...hehe that is\nfunny but who cares..thats the way it is...<br><br>there are many scenes like in mission impossible...I thought I am\nwatching some kind of cartoon! Thats one of the biggest reasons I am\ngiving this film 4 out of 10<br><br>The scene with the tenk on highway when Leti is flying towards Toreto\nover the cliff and they grab each other on air is for kids ..really\nthat thing makes me go to toilet<br><br>Storyline is very predictable and not deep so your brain will relax\nwatching this.\n"
"\nThis movie by far is the best in the series. It's filled with lots f\naction and the story is just excellent. It's well written and I'd say\none of the best written trilogies. They have 6 about to be 7 of these\nand it is still awesome. Usually sequels don't last after the third one\nbut this one is at 6 and it is still an outstanding movie. I don't know\nanyone who wouldn't like this movie. I also think this it one of the\nbest movies I've seen and I can't wait for the seventh to be released\nbut I hope the fact that it's a different director doesn't change it in\nany way. I'm expecting a lot from the seventh. So awesome movie most\npeople should love this.\n"
"\nSometimes trailers are fast and original movie fails to deliver. This\ntime, its not the case. Fast 6 is exactly what it promises to be. Fast,\nStylish, Crafty and Intelligent. From the montage video in the title\nsong (We Own It) including important scenes from all the movies (except\nTokyo Drift) - the series finally connects Tokyo Drift to Fast 5. The\nstunt scenes including the tank are one of the best ones I have seen\never. And the emotional side of Vinn Diesel is one of the best. Its sad\nthat they took Han and Gisele out of the equation, since they are one\nof the coolest people in the movie. This movie is definitely the finest\nFast and Furious Movie ever. Loved it. Must Watch.\n"
"\nIm not going to talk too much about the film and I only have a few\nwords.<br><br>Amazing!! To start off with, from beginning to end, the film sucks you\nin and engages you in. The film has a serious enough plot but with the\ncharacter Roman, the film manages to have its comedy element\nthroughout. Decent story line and a good build up to the final 40\nminutes of the film which is all action pretty much. <br><br>Overall. The performances were great, the action was spectacular. Just\na fun film to watch. <br><br>So my final rating. <br><br>5/5 Stars. (10/10)<br><br>Other FF movie rating's by me. <br><br>The fast and the furious, 4 and a 1/2 out of 5 stars. 2fast 2furious\n3/5 stars. Tokyo drift 3 and 1/2 out of 5 stars. Fast&amp;Furious 4/5\nstars. Fast five 5/5 stars.\n"
"\nLots of action here from start to finish. The story plot I thought was\nbetter in fast 5 but Fast 6 doesn't disappoint with it's ambitious\naction scenes. Undoubtedly the scene that got the biggest pop from the\ncrowd was the second ending. <br><br>The ending after the credits but thats saying a lot considering we saw\na full slobber-knocker scene with Michelle Rodriguez and the MMA chick,\na ambitious air plane scene, and insane highway-bridge sequence. Oh\nyeah...we still got to see some cars and some hot girls with daisy\ndukes on.<br><br>THis franchise definitely got better as time went on...a welcome change\nsince usually most movie franchises go down the drain.\n"
"\nI looovvveeed this movie,we were glued to our seats.Let me just\nsay,there is a lot of eye-candy in this movie. Justin and Vin did it\nagain, those guys...I wasn't sure about another movie,but there will be\nanother.Really, most of the action was so new unlike so many movies out\ntoday. I am not sure who I like the most, all of the stars are\nexcellent and we hope the girl isn't really dead. The ending,who would\nhave expected to see Jason,there are beautiful men in this movie,OMG. I\nam a critic,serious movie watcher,and I love talent.This movie is not a\n10,but a twelve,easy.Great job guys,and us moms, really appreciate the\nfact that our family's can view this together. WELL DONE FELLOWS,WELL\nDONE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n"
"\nI think this one is the best in the series! It has action fast cars and\ngreat stunts. The franchise is just going to get better and better. I\nwould make one change and that is to return to its roots, Drag racing\nand a bit less circuit racing. Don't get me wrong I love the movie but\nDrag racing is just so much more exciting. I was really pleased with\nthe return of Michelle Rodríguez, I love her character. The car\nselection is great from the Nissan Skyline to the '74 Ford Escort\nRS2000. The casting is great all my favourite actors and actresses are\nback and looking good. The fight scenes where very well choreographed\nand very entertaining. And the way the audience is told about Letty was\nvery well planned out and brilliantly executed.\n"
"\nI Just Loved The Movie Overall But , Gal Gadot Should Not Die In The\nMovie and Also Han Dies In The upcoming Part. I Feel They Give a Soul\nEssence To The Movie They Must Not die. A Movie Ending On a good Note\nIs always Loved By people. Sir Please See To This. Jason Sta-ham is a\ngreat actor but just to bring a change in the new part Old Characters\nbust Not Be Disturbed Much. The Problem i Felt In The Whole Harry\nPotter Series. Thanks But No Doubt Its a good Movie With Tremendous\nAction Scenes. a few Points On which i will suggests you that like\nLetti comes back in the series ... somehow please try to restore the\nroles of gal and Han .\n"
"\nThey've brought this series a long way from the streets of East L.A.;\nexotic locales, more characters, gonzo stunts and frenetic editing. But\nit's still the same hokey dramatic plot twists, hot-body posturing and\nreally bad one-liners from way back. And the fast cutting and noise\nwith these car chases just grows numbing after a while. I'm not kidding\nmyself; I know I'm not the target audience. And that audience is\nspecific and well-catered to. But this is really bad soap opera. On the\nplus side, it's still fun to watch The Rock work, and they sweetened\nthe pot with Gina Carano. <br><br>But this recurring cast is awful. <br><br>5/10<br><br>On second thought, what i really do like about the last two movies is\ntheir serial nature. The end of one folds right into the beginning of\nanother. You don't see that every day on the big screen.\n"
"\nExcellent Movie Indeed well.. Dom Nick ( Vin ) u made up.. dude...\nExcellent Action scenes made up.. i meant.. every one.. including Paul\nWalker and D.Smith as well.. waiting for Fast and Furious 7 movie\nActually goes up when o'brian's wife get kidnapped. else everything\nwere going smoothly, and what about latty.. btw she'z back no doubt.\nAmerican Hero.. D.Smith.. awesome actions .. Especially Fight Scenes\nand all the team members of fast and furious series has done a great\njob.. love this movie in fact. and i hope in next season of 7 you guys\ngonna rock everything. as of now you are doing well. you have won lot\nof hearts indeed ... one is mine for sure :)\n"
"\nReview of Fast &amp; Furious 6\nhttp://www.yusufpoonawala.com/movie/fast-furious-6/ <br><br>The gang is back,yet again. Fast 5 had taken this street racing\nfranchisee to a new high and current series director Justin Lin, in\nwhat seems to be his last outing in this series, manages to say that\nelusive goodbyein style.<br><br>This is pure adrenalin rush.<br><br>The gang, living in early retirement after their 100mill heist in Fast\n5, are reassembled by DSS Agent Luke Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson) and his\npartner Agent Riley (Gina Carano). Yes, its the cops asking the help of\nthe thieves, since their latest case involves sophisticated thieves of\na similar kind, but different class altogether. And the movie keeps on\nreminding us that class difference, repeatedly.\n"
"\nOK lets get down to why I think this movie is utterly stupid.<br><br>1) When Shaw is trying to escape in the beginning in the low slung\nracer why the hell didn't cops just block the exit with their cars??\n2)Why didn't Hobbs just use the sniper rifle on Shaw when he was having\nthe talk with Vin Diesel's character?? 3) DO I even need to mention the\nutterly stupid highway save of Liddie? 4) OK why is that runway scene\nfeel like the longest stupid runway in the world?? 5) If they really\nwanted to stop the Antonov from taking off why not shoot the bloody\ntires instead of trying to harpoon the flaps??<br><br>Whoever wrote the bloody script and approved everything must've been\ntargeting newborns.\n"
"\nFirst of all I don't know How much time since the first fast and\nfurious , and I did not see it or just don't remember <br><br>However I don't<br><br>know if it's really important if you saw them or not , I didn't get it\nmuch <br><br>2- Way too much of Sience Fiction Bullshit That I pretty much didn't<br><br>understand at all <br><br>3- Too much fake fighting way to exaggerated<br><br>4- How much people that look like each other you can put in a movie<br><br>5-bassicly the only thing I liked is the funny black dude\n"
"\nThis is a great movie. This movie grabs and holds your attention as you\ngo for \"fast and furious\" ride with the now familiar group of guys and\ngals who are tough on the outside and strong and good on the inside.\nThis is Michelle Rodriguez's best movie to date. She is a wonderful\nactress and delivers another great performance, and dominates her\nscenes. The rest of the cast is excellent too. Vin Diesel and Dwayne\nJohnson once again team up to create a lot of excitement. The story\nitself is great. It contains almost nonstop action interspersed with\nclever lines. The good guys are good and the bad guys are bad. Luke\nEvans delivers a strong performance as the lead bad guy, Shaw. Although\nthe story is far-fetched and stretches the boundaries of plausibility,\nstill it works, and as a result is entertaining, and for that reason\nalone this movie is worth watching.\n"
"\nThe movie was big. It had a large scale. It had good actors and a big\nbudget. But poor direction and bad story left it as a more than\ndisappointing experience. The director seems to not have even the basic\ngrasp of elementary physics. My woes arise from the many lost\nopportunities. There are many movies out there which have a shitty\nstoryline, but great action to make up for it (Die Hard 5 comes to\nmind). But this couldn't even achieve that. The action choreography\nseemed to have been done by a child playing with action figures. The\nmovie is plagued with bad dialogues and stupid attempts at comedy.\nFrankly, the only thing positive about the movie is the cast. Overall,\nit is not worth your money.\n"
"\nHell yeah!! Now this is the movie to go see in theaters!! <br><br>Hearing those loud car engines roaring,screaming, and rushing makes my\nears tickle in excitement!! The cars are sexy and the Toretto family is\nstill kicking in gear in a another action pack adrenaline rush manhunt.<br><br>You think the movie will start off slow but, oh no it cuts right to the\nchase to not leave the viewer bored. Not only its filled with action\n,but good humor as well. Especially, Roman who kept the audience filled\nwith laughter mostly every scene he is in. <br><br>I loved how The Rock simply kicks so much ass even when he is standing\nstill giving orders. Very glad to see he is in the pack again. A great\ncharacter to the franchise. Vin Diesel is still the same old Vin we all\nknew from the previous Fast and The Furious movies ,but pairs up with\nThe Rock which makes it even better.<br><br>Very good movie you wouldn't want to miss in theaters. Also extra\nending at the end of the movie will blow you away!!\n"
"\nAre you f u c k i n g kidding me? I guess this got positive reviews\nbecause compared to the other installments in the franchise, this one\nis like a masterpiece. But still absolutely ridiculously stupid &amp; can\nbarely be called a film.<br><br>Not sure what we are supposed to take less seriously: Paul Walker's\nacting, Vin Deisel's monotone delivery, or that this is the 6th one of\nthese pieces of garbage. <br><br>Is this all Hollywood has to offer us these days? Reboots, remakes, and\nsequels? May as well continue the theme of making board games into\nmajor motion pictures because this is just absolutely horrendous. <br><br>Fast and Furious is slowly becoming the Police Academy of our time. See\nyou all again at Fast Fingered 14\n"
"\nI'm not over exaggerating when I say this, but I'm pretty sure that\nit's impossible for anyone who has the knowledge of what they're about\nto see to be anything less than amazed by this movie. Fast and Furious\n6, the definition of pure awesomeness.<br><br>The charm of the franchise is that it cares about it's story and\ncharacters. Quite a feat since this is the sixth entry in what is quite\nfrankly a mindless action extravaganza. The pairing of Vin Diesel and\nDwayne Johnson fighting on the same side is a genius move which pays\noff for the audience throughout the whole movie, but mostly at the end\nit has to be said, you'll see what I mean. Luke Evans makes a great and\nintelligent villain and is probably the best one that the series has\nhad so far.<br><br>Amazingly heart pounding set pieces, strikingly beautiful and strong\nfemale characters, hilariously well timed comic relief, Fast and\nFurious 6 has it all. A near perfect action movie, bring on the\nseventh!\n"
"\nThe Fast and Furious movies are never going to be Oscar darlings but\nwhen you pay your money at the movie theater to see them you know what\nyou're going to get and they deliver it for you. Not only are the F&amp;F\nmovies fun and great popcorn entertainment they don't insult your\nintelligence like the Transformers or Battleship type blockbusters do.<br><br>Vin Diesel and Paul Walker have great chemistry together as the leads\nfor the series. Great to see one of the original 4 characters of\nMichelle Rodriguez back in the fold. Her lack of presence was missing\nin Fast Five. Don't get me wrong Fast Five was a great movie even\nwithout her but the Brian, Dom, Mia and Letty characters make it feel\nlike a true F&amp;F movie. Without one of the 4 main characters it takes\naway from the F&amp;F feel of the movie. That's probably why Tokyo Drift\nwas the weakest of all the F&amp;F movies.\n"
"\nThis movie should have been called Gone in 60 secs because that's when\ni felt like leaving. I'm giving this movie a 2 star rating because it\nwas pretty cool when the 2 semi's crashed on the highway and exploded\nin slow-motion. Otherwise this franchise seems to have died off long\nago. Its no longer about the cars and racing, but horrible subplots\nabout people id rather see written off then saved. Paul Walker is as\nbad as ever, but good thing is he was barely in this. Vin Diesel is\ngetting to old to act and its showing. The rock also seem's juiced up\nlike always. Paul Walker is so bad i wanted to say it twice. If you are\nfamiliar with the newer Mission Impossible movies then you've pretty\nmuch already know the story. I would rather XXX then this POS. I still\ndon't understand how the series has gone so very wrong since the 1st\nfilm was only half bad. You know how at the end of the 1st one... where\nVin Diesel flips the cool classic car? I really wish it had landed on\ntop of Paul Walker's car and killed them so this movie would have never\nexisted.\n"
"\nI'm sorry, but suspension of disbelieve is not possible for me with\nthis movie. There's only so far you can stretch a rubber band before it\nsnaps, and with this movie, they stretched the rubber band about a\nhundred times past snapping point and expect the audience to believe it\nwon't snap.<br><br>Take the scenes (yes, plural) involving the plane near the end of the\nmovie. After it had achieved takeoff speed, it was still struggling to\ntake off for the next, what, 15 minutes? Was that run strip really 50\nmiles long? Note I didn't time the sequence, so my numbers might be\noff, but that's just an example of the extent of the ridiculousness. I\ndon't give it a spoiler, because part of this was in the trailer I saw.<br><br>Besides the ridiculous overly exaggerated action scenes, I thought the\nacting left much to be desired.<br><br>It would, though, make a good video game.\n"
"\nRemember when this was a series of movies for people into cars? I guess\npeople into cars don't buy enough movie tickets or DVDs..<br><br>It's basically a multiple main plot character action movie with almost\nnothing to do with cars or tuning anymore.<br><br>It literally feels like you're watching a die hard movie, which is a\ngood movie, but this isn't a action franchise about explosions and\nterrorism.<br><br>It might be good to watch if you are bored and have nothing to do with\nyour money. It's great as many things the franchise isn't suppose to\nbe.<br><br>It's like batman and die hard edited together..\n"
"\nWen you have Vin Diesel and Dwayne Johnson in the same movie and the\nwhole audience goes nuts when these two figures arrive, its safe to\nassume the movie is hit. And yes it is.<br><br>Leave performances, Ludicrous got the cheesiest of lines and man I\nalmost laughed my heart out. Paul Walker, Sung Kang, Tyrese Gibson,\nMichelle Rodriguez and rest of the cast fits in perfectly.<br><br>The antagonist of the movie keeps up to our expectations of being a\ncomplete bad-ass. The movie has its fair shares of twists and turns and\nthe car chases and chick fights really keeps you glued to your seats.<br><br>The post warning and before the credits roll out,the cut scene has a\ndelightful surprise. Better watch for yourself. Just the one complaint,\nthe time line of the movie has put me in a doubt and people who have\nseen and remember Tokyo Drift are going to agree with me. Cheers. Don't\nmiss this one.\n"
"\nI went to the cinema with quite low expectations due to the trailer.\nHowever after watching this film i was amazed by the outcome. There was\nso much thrilling tense action, at one point i was on the edge of my\nseat. The fights and the car chases were magnificent. The series seems\nto be getting better and better. Fast and furious 6 is by far the best\none, and i can't wait for number 7. There was so much going on and the\nending was awesome. I will definitely buy this on DVD when it comes\nout. Great acting from the casts. This is the most entertaining film of\n2013 so far. There was epic cars, sexy girls and brilliant locations.<br><br>10/10\n"
"\nI really did not like the first movie of The fast and the furious. I\nlike 2 fast 2 furious. I also liked fast and the furious Tokyo Drift.\nBut this is better. This is a great movie. It has a great story line.\nIt also has great acting. It has a lot of action. Fast and the furious\nnew model original parts is better. Fast five is also better. Furious 7\nis also better. 7.1 is a good ratting. But this is such a great movie\nthat 7.1 is underrating it. I give it 8. Because it is a great movie.\nIf you like action movies then you will like this movie. This is a lot\nbetter the V of vendetta. It is a lot better then 300. This is better\nthen suicide squad and that is not easy to do. See this movie.\n"
"\nWarning, this may contain Spoilers: This was the biggest and the best\none of the franchise. The cast is amazing, each actor shines brightly\nin their roles. Vin Diesel, Paul Walker, Michelle Rodriguez, Dwayne\nJohnson, Gina Carano. The action is fantastic. Aside from the action,\nthe film has a nice sense of humour producing a few big laughs over the\ncourse of the movie. The film is fast paced and doesn't slow down. The\nfilm has an awesome set of fight scenes. The Gina Carano and Michelle\nRodriguez fighting scenes is one of the film's best parts. They both\nshow impressive skills. The main villain is good, well played by Luke\nEvans. The death of Paul Walker was very sad, I miss that guy. The\ndirector of Furious 6, Justin Lin. He really makes this his best action\nfilm ever. Watching this movie on the day it was released in cinemas in\nmy country, it was one of the most awesome cinematic experiences of my\nlife. It is a movie that knows what it is and remains that way from\nbeginning to end. It is a movie that every one should watch. It is lots\nof fun.\n"
