i was skeptical at first about this movie which is why i didnt go see it the week that it came out
i just figured it was all too obvious what would happen and to be honest some of that did happen yet they did the expected so well that it really didnt seem to make a big difference that i saw it coming a mile off
which made the things that you didnt expect even better
i enjoyed this movie so much that i would do the unthinkable that ive done only once in all of my years and that is pay to see it again at the theater
i may even buy a copy of it when it comes out on blu ray
thats how good this is
the acting was superb and what i enjoyed most is that finally someone knows how to end a movie
bravo
all spoilers ahead
warning
who wrote this movie a 6th grader
why does the smartest man in the world do such stupid things
why didnt he think of the best way to make an endless supply of the drug right away
why didnt he figure out how to get rid of the russian instead of giving him what he wanted
why did he choose the stock market and expose himself to all the attention
he could have made a vast fortune in his apartment trading on forex
if hes so smart why was he popping pills without knowing the eventual effects on his brain
why was he running from the guy with the knife who was following him
the guy knows where lives that part was plain idiotic
i could go on and on but the worst was why would anybody that smart want to be in elective office
he would have far more power being a billionaire
this was a dumb movie i actually was cheering for him to jump off the roof and my wife was telling me to shut up
it was just another drug movie except it was a brain drug and not heroin
this is my favourite movie with bradley cooper
i watched it like 10 times
i recommend this movie to everyone
this story is excellent and the actor talent of bradley cooper are amazing i was hoping i can taste this nzt some day hahah
with this movie bradley cooper is one of my favourite actor now and i buy this movie in bluray too  im impatient to see his future movie i think 7
3 is too low for this movie so keep it go up
and if nzt exist some day  call me i think robert de niro and bradley cooper does a great team
and i want more movie with these two actor in the same movie
in november 2012 we will be served
limitless could have been a great story that highlights addiction in our society
addiction to pharmaceuticals and to power
here is a guy like a lot of people in our society supposedly down and out who then is given a drug that makes him smarter
what does he do with it well what every man in this capitalistic society would dohe finds a way to make lots of money
the story does a good job of making you feel his addiction which i guess is because of some decent acting
the problem is the ending of the movie
everyone who has become addicted to this drug is faced with the consequences except for the principle character
this is a mistake
there are always consequences when you are addicted to something whether it be drugs or power
there are always consequences when your actions are nothing but selfish
the movie should have had the guts to show that
seriously the director and writers need help
the film is basically a disaster of 100 never ending sub plots that start and dont end completely pointless
there are so many questionable scenes where you stop and think am i stupid enough to watch this the characters are all boring and clicha you really wouldnt care if they live or die
oh and the unnecessary narrating  seriously were not dumb we understand whats going on seriously the narrating explains everything going on as if the audience are blind or something
look im a really optimistic person but im angry because the reviews on here convinced me to watch it seriously dont waste your time
ive seen this film twice and loved it even more the second time
i absolutely adored the opening sequence as it gives you some idea of the speed of the journey you know youre going to take
yes there are small holes in the plot and questions you may ask but the very nature of the film is not based on real life so who cares
bradley cooper is brilliant and very engaging to watch the direction and cinematography of the film are its major selling point because as the story develops the colour and clarity of the film become brighter
bradley delivers his lines faster and faster and robert de niro gives the film that little bit of extra credibility and has been cast in the perfect role
its a fun exciting story with a great idea behind it and enough eye candy to suit all the women out there
those eyes
as for the men theyll appreciate the slightly scifi wrapping and the fight scenes but above all the comedic lines that flow along nicely with the pace of the movie
brilliant entertainment
since its been a couple of weeks that i watched this movie here are my thoughts bradley cooper has now come into his own among compelling movie stars with this his first film in which hes the whole show
he plays an aspiring novelist who has writers block
that is until his former brotherinlaw provides him with a drug that helps him functions all parts of his brain
so cooper does lots of things to the point of him skipping through time and being way over his head when some troubling revelations of his doings come up
though quite entertaining some of the logic lapses near the end
still with such fine supporting turns from among others abbie cornish anna friel and the one and only robert de niro not to mention some trippy camera shots limitless is a quite entertaining for the 90 or so minutes that pass
this movie could have been named potential
we went to this movie in a theatre thinking that it was going to be a really interesting movie about brain possibilities
many people have already commented on what sort of things were illogical about this movie so i wont repeat them
my husband and i were both very disappointed because while it had some good special effects the storyline was poorly written the characters were weak and the ending was pathetic
we kept waiting for something to happen that was even slightly believable and it didnt
then it just ended
it would have been better named as endless
we could give it a little higher mark for the special effects but because there was such great promising topic and then such a let down it gets a 1
i got the privileged to go to an advance screening of limitless with a q and a with screenwriter lesley dixon at my school tonight
i came in with very low expectations due to the horrible advertising but came out with a big smile and a feeling of satisfaction
the movie is very unique in every aspect
the dialog is comparable to the social network in intricacy and craftsmanship the acting was great not oscar worthy but got the job done very well musicsound was very enjoyable and unique the cinematographycolor palate was great but the editing stood out the most and will definitely be nominated for an oscar
with the screenwriter having more freedom than most writers these days as well as her producing input it aloud the movie to be well crafted and tastefully done rather than a hollywood crap flick
it is definitely the best movie of the year so far which isnt really saying much but hopefully it sets the bar for even better films to come
limitless is by far one of my favorite movies just because of how intense the film is
you are always wondering what will happen next and what will happen with eddie morra and his adventure with this pill
this pill that morra takes lets him use the other 80 of our brain that we supposedly never get to use
it makes you extremely intelligent to the point where you can do anything
i love adventure and action so this movie suits me
it was really interesting how they brought science into the film with the pill and how to find a way where all people could use it
the only down part to this movie would be that this pill is very unrealistic and is almost impossible to be done
the acting was phenomenal to say the least
i felt like i was in the movie trying to find out how people could live off the pill
some people say that the movie is too unrealistic because if someones iq shot up that high they could get sick or die
to me it is a movie not real life and it was great
limitless is bradley coopers first crack at a leading role
he pulls it off as a head strong cocky man on the upward slope after coming in to contact with a drug that releases 100 of his brains ability
the drug is the captivating yet corrupt attraction with coopers freshly obtained confidence and comatose knowledge being something wed love to experience
blahs cooper rapid ascent has its setbacks though
juggling a relationship with unchecked intelligence a crazed russian on his case and a stock exchange job under robert de niro threatens to engulf a simple plot
instead director neil burger manages to unravel it neatly by soundly crossing them over
the script is direct aided by coopers voiceover and the plots enhanced by firm acting
unlocking the brains full power could take us to places unimaginable
thankfully a realistic approach is taken to avoid doubt amongst its viewers
perfect argument
the idea of a pill that allows you to access 100 of our brain is just perfect
a solid baseline with no space for exaggeration that combines the super power that the drug gives and the hangover that hits him when he doesnt take a pill
then the flashback in the beginning makes perfectly sense
it let us better comprehend the hole picture and at the same time wondering if he is gonna jump or not
the only thing i didnt understood was that ending
they could perfectly explore more eddies life history and provide us a more consensual ending
i saw lucy the other movie with a similar concept and it was rubbish
limitless is way better then lucy
i remembered i watched this movie several years ago
however i did not remember much
i guess i probably only used 20 or less of my brain the first time
i watched it again last night and found it was quite entertaining
roger ebert did not give too good a praise
his reason was the movie should focus on the comprehension of human brain not the memory
i think he got the point
how the brain connect the existed information to generate solutions to the problems would be a more logical approach to the whole story
however the adrenalin rush scenes are exciting and keep you suspended
brandley cooper gave a solid performance just wish he would have been given a better plot
i have seen this movie more you can imagine
why
here is an explanation
one of the reasons which involved my watching this film was how human brains can amazingly work with simple one tablet of drug
how much amazing things can be created
and if it exist in real life how great stuff could be done
but
every great breakthrough has its own drawbacks
not everyone wants it to use for good purpose
so in this movie you could deeply think of good and bad sides of drugs like making your brains work 100
of course all these action movies has its own love stories which makes film sweeter
enjoy watching
hope it will become one of best your ever seen movies like mine
cheers
great story line and overall acting
appreciated the visuals this movie incorporated without doing too much
one of my favorite movies
i specifically enjoyed the colorless to colorful transitions the director incorporated
the idea of this movie created more life in the mind of the viewer for endless possibilities
light humor provided some smooth scene transitions
the movie creates an image in the mind of the viewer that definitely lasts
watching this you never become lost in the storyline and the plot is very understandable so it allows for great flowing
the actors do great jobs of portraying their roles and even the extras seem involved in each scene they are incorporated into
i give it a 810 because its doesnt seem to be a timeless movie
but i loved it
brilliant storyline and makes you wonder how many instant fame type events in the past could be related if this drug was possible
the film does contain strong graphic scenes and language at times but does not detract from the impact that the storyline has on ones psyche
be warned  this film will leave you realizing just how easily we fall victim to substance abuse and the influence of power
sometimes we seem to grasp at straws in order to make some sense of our lives  it would be fantastic to have an assistant like this  just to help us focus
but will we apply our new found focus and intellect to the betterment of mankind
the film will also peak the curiosity in the domain of experimental drugs and the ethics involved in testing these on humans
science says that you can access only 20 of your brain but eddy morra has other ideas
he decides to up his ante to 100
this movie takes on a crazy ride that fills your entire body with an adrenaline rush that has a lasting effect
bradley cooper acts in a way you wont feel hes acting
robert de niro is a perfect thug to coopers innocent but soon to become mafia of sorts
abbie cornish is the only person who spoils an other wise perfect cast
she is irritating and just spoils the whole experience
but alas
the promise of the first half does not lead up to the perfect movie it was supposed to be
the ending was predictable
but still it was good enough to be one of the best movies scifi or otherwise that i have seen
fantastic film and it would be amazing to actually unlock your brains full potential
i thought bradley cooper did a fantastic job a completely different character from the hangover although hes the type of guy that can pull any look off
i thought the ending was perfect showing exactly how smart he became and making robert de niro look like a loser
which i may add is pretty damn hard because that man just demands respect
really cool film which is well up to date
i even see that some firms have been trying to plug the drug nzt the clear pill and nzt48 not sure if it is what it claims to be
it would be hard to believe that such a drug would have that effect although it makes for interesting discussion
has anyone else ever heard of this magic drug
in my opinion limitless is a fast paced edge of your seat action thriller that leaves you wanting more and more
the concept of a drug that would let you use 100 of your mind compared to the average humans 20 is intriguing and exciting
i have never seen anything quite like it this film takes you on a ride limitless is so fast paced you wont even find time to blink
the film has good acting and just the right blend of new york atmosphere mixed with a scifi feel
the tension was the same of as any good action move but the plot kept it teasingly interesting
you could guess what was going to happen next it could have been anything thats why you dont want to take your eyes of the screen because one minute eddie is hanging around with russian drug dealers and the next is a million in his hitech apartment
just completed watching the movie and not for one single minute i could divert my mind to any where else
it is a very well choreographed nicely sequenced and edited movie with a strong plot
its a must watch for people who loved inception dark knight
yes the movie may not have touched the heights of christopher nolan but certainly made a statement of its own
bradley cooper has again shown his class
robert de niro is also a pleasure to see
the movie takes you through many ups and downs and ultimately leaves you with a thought
the movie also refers to the novel based on which this movie was made
at the end i would say limitless is a super creation
acting 710 plot 910 effects 810 continuity 810 other 910 watching the trailer made me unsure whether this really was the film for me but the film grasps your attention from the very start
i watched it twice in one week because i simply needed to show the film to my friend to show her how good it was
there are a few continuity issues and it was a little complicated for my slow brain to comprehend and also the acting was good but could have been better
but this film definitely makes it to my personal top 5
the plot is clever and the script is full of wit and this is echoed by the ingenious filming and effects and is a thoroughly good watch that leaves the viewer buzzing once the credits are up
810
directed by neil burger limitless offers fast pacing and solid entertainment for its runtime
it is slickly edited and delves into the drugworld adeptly
spoiler it is chiefly a fantasy but i thought the characters and thus storytellers fell pretty short in creating worthwhile goals given the kinds of powers they were instating or describing
spoiler the bradley cooper character can use huge amounts of his brain power but what does he use it for
running for the us presidency and his own selfish purposes
thats a bit shallow
anyway while i thought the filmmakers thematically couldve made better endpoints their cast and direction is a glossy fun picture with excellent cues great narration and quickwitted dialog
overall recommended
i like the special effect zooming scenes but the plot was very week
let me see if i became super smart what would i do
i would finish my book and try to make as much money as i can
oh yea and i would not think of how do i make this drug
until i was in a stupid state wtf he had to be off the drug to think of that
there was not even the slightest hint that he would use his super intelligence to better mankind
i do not know about most people but things like this made me think the movie to be totally stupid and child like
very ridiculous
and if someone can quintuple their money four days in a rowwhy one earth would he need to borrow 100000
i believe he said quintuple every day for the last 4 days
let me see starting out with 800 would that not put him right at 100000 already
why
on earth would he need to borrow money from the mob
and if he did borrow it and was super smart why would he then not repay the loan on time
kind of stupid dont you think this makes no sense what so ever
basically guy takes pimped up version of adderall and exciting stuff happens
im surprised no one else made this comparison
i guess for us add folks its the difference between taking your meds and not taking them
its pretty funny actually when i was trying to remember the name of this movie to another add friend i said you know the one where the guy takes super adderall and he can do super stuff
and he says oh yeah you mean limitless
while there is a nicely innovative sweeping photographic technique used in the beginning credits and later in the movie there potential sophisticated intelligence expected from a movie with this theme seems to be missing
consider how robert redford performs his seemingly intriguing ploy without medicinal enhancement at decade earlier in spy game 2001
or consider what scarlett johansson accomplished in lucy 2014 three years later
the plot just seems to be missing the intelligence and the de niro aspect might have been better just as its own stand alone little drama
what if you take a pill that allows you to use 100 of your brain
of course you could become an excellent writer and why not make some money with the stock market
old dreams of the average american man
this movie makes for one hour and some minutes spectators dream to change their lives just eating a pill
and this is the marketing idea behind the movie a pleasant escape from reality mixed with a soft thriller
its a pity that it ends there
scientifically speaking is not the percentage of your brain that you use that makes you smarter but is more a matter of the number of interconnections
the same i think is for the movies is not only the original idea that makes them smart but also the number of interconnections with the reality and the truth
while i found this movie extremely entertaining the story line to a small degree resembles an episode from the old outer limits tv series titled expanding human
the story line was that a group of professors and students at a college were experimenting with an experimental new drug that enhanced both the mind and the body
it allowed one of the professors skip homier after taking the drug to become this hulking strong man with super strength and intelligence
the opening teaser of the episode shows this hulking figure slowly walking down a college hallway in the middle of the night and ripping a steal door off its hinges and then choking the night watchmen while he holds him two feet off the floor
watch the episode and you may see some similarities between limitless and this episode
when he takes this pill he basically gains superhuman intelligence
so first off why the heck doesnt he just figure out how to make the drug on his own so he has an endless supply
if a normal person created the drug there is no doubt he should be able to figure out what the drug consists of and how to make it in record time especially once he has the means money to buy the equipment and whatever he needs to testcreate it
secondly by the end of the movie you would think he would buy a gun or two for protection since there are goons constantly coming after him to hurt or kill him
but no no guns for some strange reason
the smartest man in the world is being targeted and he doesnt have the common sense to buy a gun whether he buys it legally or illegally it doesnt matter
the premise of limitless is highly intriguing and the casting of bradley cooper in the lead role makes us hard to look away from the screen
the charismatic cooper carries the movie on his shoulders as he inhabits his character perfectly and makes the movie a treat to watch
on receiving a mysterious drug which supposedly allows an individual to access 100 percent of his brain bradley coopers character is able to complete a novel in 4 days by taking this wonder pill
as his ambitiousness grows he decides to use his deductive skills to make some quick money in the stock market
even though the effects of the drug made a remarkable turnaround in his life its sideeffects were starting to show up which happened on withdrawal of the drug
the flaw in this movie is that a lot of action seems to happen at a convenient time and it seems a little unrealistic
also at the end we do not know the whereabouts of the people in his home
the movie was a decent one but do not have exceedingly high expectations
61 a very watchable popcorn thriller with neat direction good production values a degree of bite fine support and a strong leading performance from bradley cooper
the premise is implemented well even if the script wants to get absolutely every last drop of use it possibly can out of it
theres a clear warning about drugs that runs through but you would be hard pushed to call this a valid morality tale which in the balance of play is a good thing
this despite being far from great is certainly worth a look for its sheer style and was at least partly worthy of the massive attention it had ladled upon it upon its release
it was a good time seeing this movie
but it has a slow start
this guy is like my favorite actor good job the story line is complicated in between but see it with patience u will understand every thing in the end
the ending is not something u wont like but it is something that suits the movie the writer really did a good job on this book for sure
its a total imaginary thing
like it really do
people liked it a lot
not sure but some how still feel the movie needs a little more to it that it missed out
see it you will like it no spoilers
just 8 stars coz of the beginning was slow and the complicated dialog it has
well written scifiish thriller
i actually became a fan which i never really do of the actor bradley cooper with this movie
it would really be great if and there probably already is and we just dont know it if there really was a drug that would greatly enhance your intelligence like the drug that is depicted in this movie
the movie itself was filmed in a riveting style with all kinds of things really happening to this guy now that he has enhanced his confidence with the drug that made him extremely intelligent
things really start to happen as soon as the main character takes his first pill and that is what drives the viewer to keep watching this great movie
plus the interesting manner in which the movie was filmed made it very good to look at
sorry to say i missed this at the theaters and only started to watch this now that cable will play this on the tube
action
suspense
mystery
thrills
very beautiful women in compromising situations
what more can a guy ask for
i loved this movie i think it had a very good idea behind it but there are some plot problems
overall i think it was a good movie the idea that someone had invented a designer drug which would turn a person into a super smart brain child is a good one
the idea of a down on his luck loser writer happens to run into an exbrotherinlaw who just happened to be a drug dealer was kinda out there but believable enough
then you have to add the element of the star always in danger that keeps the audience wondering what was going to happen
the ending was kinda out there too but all in all it was a good movie to watch
i liked the idea of the movie and enjoyed it very much
it was a fun movie with a feel good ending
limitless sends an amazing and positive message
the message is that we all have unbelievable potential hidden within us that is just waiting to be released
but we have to learn how to harness control and use our vast intellectual potential
the movie was suspenseful exciting and unpredictable but in a good way
the acting was excellent and believable and the plot was intriguing and creative
the cast matched the roles perfectly and i enjoyed the sets scenery and style of filming
i have watched this movie multiple times and enjoyed it every time
it is very hard to talk about this movie without giving away the plot so let me just leave you with this if you like movies that are interesting inspirational and well executed then i suggest you watch limitless
the setup really surprised me in a very positive way
i just would have expected a different ending as it remains pretty much open whether eddie will get off the drug at any rate or just massproduces it in own laboratories
neither unclear remains the question about melissas future
yes she got away with it however her body took a lot of consequence there
it would have been nice to see a little more of her in the end
de niro as carl van loon was absolutely enjoyable he performed really well
at the first glance i didnt expect anything while watching the movie however the story shows you all kinds of ways to see the world out of different views
the turning point once eddie was at the balcony and the attack of gennady was the best scene in the movie
a writer suffering from a severe case of writers block finds a pill that essentially turns him into superman
not only does the pill boost his brain power and stamina it also makes him an expert on anything he has read or seen since birth
its a silly premise that has the potential for a good comedy but doesnt really work as drama
given that cooper proceeds to take the pills despite the dangerous side effects the story could have worked along the theme of a faustian bargain
however the film is not up to the challenge
the filmmakers are unsure of where to go and the story just rambles rather aimlessly culminating in an unsatisfying ending
limitless was messy in a good way right from the start and then they ended it all cut and polish
the alternate ending on the dvd was much better
if they had combined the two i would have given limitless at least a 9
as it is 7 is generous
i am always mesmerized by bradley coopers blue eyes and robert de niro is one of the grand masters of acting
the idea of mind enhancers is old but limitless presents it in a fresh way
i liked the opposite reaction to the drug  eddie vs
lindy
bytheway i am new to abbie cornish and hope she has a long and fruitful career
he tasted the power and wanted more with little or no reservation she tasted it and liked it but saw the inherent danger
of all the locations i liked his old apartment the best
it had so much character and set the basis for the contrast between prenzt eddie and postnzt eddie of course clothing and hair helped
what were they thinking with that ending  there was no struggle no questions
he was like the addict that finally got all the perks without the consequences
it just didnt fit
the movie has been full of excitement until the last minute when bradley cooper popped out the mandarin chinese
seriously if you play the movie to 10 chinese grown up in different places they will all burst into laughters and give you 10 different translations
made me think the movie is all about proving chinese is the hardest thing to learn above all from my interpretation the last line was like bc xx bowl of noodles xx dumplings xx shrimps oh please dont give me the scarfor monosodium glutamate
waiterbut the scarf or monosodium glutamatewill protect your clothes bcampampamp the end
this film borrows way too much from fight club
the visual stylethe tone of the narrative voice and certain plot devices are especially obvious
limitless opens in exactly the same point in the chronology that fight club does with main character in a similar predicament
but the storylineamong other things is not nearly as clever or compelling
i guess you could say it just doesnt pack the same punch
sorry about that
at times its just plain boring
robert de niros presence adds some gravity to the production but there really isnt much for him to do with his character so even he cant rescue this pretty looking failure from itself
youd be better off watching a slashed version of fight club on basic cable for the umpteenth time
limitless is a fairly formulaic hollywood movie that a churned out by the dozen
it is very difficult to feel any empathy with any of the characters
it tells the story of eddie morra bradley cooper who is introduced to an experimental drug in fairly unlikely circumstances from a former inlaw
the drug helps your brain to work much better and transforms eddies life
as with most drugs the feeling becomes addictive and their are serious side effects which is what much of the film focuses on
theres a role for robert de nero and im quite sure this will not be one of the films that he looks back at with any great affection
overall its fairly disappointing and also leaves you or at least me feeling quite cold at the end of the film
is it scifi or mystery
both
eddie morrabradley cooperis an author without a novel to be exact it is a strain to find inspiration to write just one word
if this isnt enough eddies girlfriend lindyabbie cornishdumps him and promises there is no way she will take him back
the hopeless writer runs into an old friend that offers him a powerful cuttingedge pharmaceutical called nzt
talk about speed on steroids
nzt causes the brain to function at 100 percent and provides the power to understand very complex mathematics
a powerful businessman carl van loonrobert de nirowants to use eddies new abilities to share a fortune upon brokering a major corporate merger
one drawback nzt has a debilitating side effect
the more you take your future is threatened
being limitless is definitely hazardous to your health
the cast also features andrew howard darren goldstein anna friel and robert john burke
i wasnt holding out too much hope for the film after reading some of the reviews posted on imdb as it happened it wasnt the crock of sht some people have made this flick out to be
granted its no oscar winner but the story for most parts zips along just fine and the premise is interesting if a slightly used one
i think the one complaint i have and i think im not alone on this point is the ending or lack of it was a bit of a let down
in my opinion if time goes quickly when youre watching a movie then it cant be all that bad and for me time did go fast just like the character in one of the better movie releases of late
in limitlesscooper proves that he can definitely act truly impose himself on the screen and not just show off and flash that flirtatious smile of his and his effectiveness as an actor goes a long way toward making this thriller a lot more entertaining and more credible than it possibly should have been
you could probably rummage through the film for deeper themes an indictment of the pharmaceutical industry or our need to have it now and have it all or you could pick the script apart for impossibilities
but why bother
its much more enjoyable to shut your brain off for awhile and have a good time
limitless may not be as brainy as it would like to think it is but its a relatively sharp and a surprisingly playful headtrip with satisfyingly novel twists on mindless entertainment
it could also be described as a disreputable and trashy piece of entertainment but it goes down well with the comfort of a kfc meal and if thats what you are in the mood for then go for it
limitless takes that old chestnut about us only using part of the full capacity of out brains long since proved false in order to spin a yarn about a failed writer who gets his hands on a pill which will unlock his brains full potential
he takes it and before you know it not only is he churning out great books hes also moved onto the stock market and is making oodles of cash too
as a metaphor for drug use it misses the point drugs make you feel like youve got more gas but they dont actually give it to you its all illusion
theres a mild thriller element as some clichad russian gangsters take the day off from bad action films in order to persecute the hero but it doesnt come to much
its competent enough without ever being all that interesting
what would you do if you could somehow release all your potential
thats the question the film asks
and on the whole it tackles the subject very well and thoroughly entertaingly
you will not be be bored by this film
theres enough story to keep you interested and make you think all the way through
right up until the last disappointing moment
obviously i dont want to tell you how it all ends but for me it was like one one ronnie corbetts stories he used to tell on the two ronnies
hed cleverly pull you along through the story thered be a few laughs along the way but the final punchline always seemed a bit flat
in the end i was glad to have seen this film would recommend it to anyone who enjoys a good sortof scifi thriller but im glad i watched on dvd and didnt fork out for a cinema ticket
btw bradley cooper from tv series alias plays an excellent part and one hopes hell get a few more alist roles
settling down in the theater seats before the show limitless seemed like a complete dud of a film
the thought of watching a man rule the world because he took special medicine seemed boring but was the exact opposite of what i expected
as the film began to roll i got the feeling that it was going to be as i expected but after the intro i was hooked immediately into the world of nzt and a strange man named eddie
the film takes the audience on twist and turns of the mans life as we try to figure out who exactly he is and what was going to happen
i found it very difficult to predict what the end would take meand i was thrilled through every step it took me
seems hollywood has come with an exceptional new gig
to have an ambiguous ending
christopher nolan is a master of this genre
now neil burger has made a movie with a great storywith an excellent ending
bradley cooperseems to have an excellent past few years
all the supporting actors have also done good
special mention to robert de niroandrew howardabbie cornish amp anna friel
the lead actresses get to experience the way the actor feelswhich is also new
not the usual way to make movies
youre almost sorry they ended on such a notebut also why the movie ended at all
butmakes the viewer finish the movie in hisher own way
very cool
910
if only for making us guess
i originally was not planning to see this film instead i was going to see insidious but things change although after viewing the movie im glad i saw it
in limitless the hangovers bradley cooper plays a writer who tries a mysterious new drug that allows him to activate his entire brainthe average human can only activate 20 of their brain
this movie delivers a good message while still being able to entertain the viewer
limitless had great acting and also was funny dramatic and had some action mixed in
though the film confused me at timesi could still follow the story
i encourage people who take illegal drugs or people who are even considering taking illegal drugs to watch this film because i guarantee you it will change your attitude towards the subject
i give this movie an 8 out of 10
go see it
hadnt watched other movies starring bradley cooper  aside from the last version of a team  so the lead actors quite a a new face to me but i reckon he never looked out of place his actings not phenomenal but in this instance he has appeared to convey the exhilaration of these special new powers
coneversely the good looking abbie cornish playing his girlfriend doesnt get to to put across visible emotions as his fianca does
robert de niro is cast as the great old wall street moguls different form the criminal type he played other times but he certainly gets to prove believable
on the whole limitless which never sermonizes on drugs and the morality of drug created intelligence is a fresh and wellwritten thriller
it might not pass a logic test but logic sometimes lacks in good movies as well
its part fantasy and part thriller but conceived in an ingenious way
while robert de niros movie career has been on a continual down turn for the last 15 years  bradley coopers is definitely on the up but luckily  with limitless  both actors have struck gold
this is a cracking thriller that is fast paced from the very start
it has a superb and original story that has you thinking throughout but without ever being confused
there are lots of drug addiction connotations you can make with the story yet this never really feels like a story about drugs even though it should
cooper is the perfect actor for the role of eddie morra
charming  yet somehow vulnerable and im pleased to at last say that robert de niro is great too
its many years since i have been able to say that
theres nothing not to like about limitless
its a roller coaster ride that i recommend everyone goes on
or should you
dont forget kids  just say no
limitless is somehow similar to two other movies i watched deja vu and the adjustment bureau
all of these movies are pretty good but they are ruined by a quick nonexplain hollywoody happy ending
if you watched any of these movies you know what i am talking about
if you havent watched any of these movies i can tell you that limitless is a pretty good thriller that makes you feel thrilled what a thriller should do
using the urban legend of humans not using 100 of their brain and a pill that can do so the story is pretty good but as again the ending isnt so
howewer there also some other positive points in the movie interesting action scenes directors musicvideoy scenes an unexpectedly good performance by bradley cooper
but as again the ending pretty much ruins the whole impression
fun movie to watch
bradley cooper does an outstanding job
there was plenty of action
i actually found myself wishing this pill really did exist in real life
watching this film i felt that the struggles that the lead character faced were well displayed from his writers block to his girlfriend to his complete vulnerability as he faces the mysteries of this newfound power that he stumbled across
it was good to see how not everything worked out the way he expected it to
the big flaw in this movie is this if he can outsmart every stock market analyst after just a few days of studying why cant he himself study the pill and find a way to reproduce it
why leave this to the amateurs who are using only 35 percent of their brain
the same holds true for fending off the bad guys he should be able to out smart them or at least buy a gun with a silencer
he knows they are after him
every issue he attacks should have been studied by him as his brain is superior in learning capacity
this movie was great
it opens your mind to so many possibilities that would be made true if you only that those little pills
i just knew i had to see this film by the commercial which rarely happens these days
i know of so many people who could benefit from such an invention including myself
the story is of a struggling writer who happens to be a drunk and also happens to always be getting dumped by his chicks
i wonder why
sarcasm much
this all started to change one day he ran into an unlikely character
his exfiancas brother
the exfiancas brother happens to also be a drug dealer even though he tells him that he isnt anymore before he decides to take the pill for the very first time
