"\nThis movie was absolutely fantastic. I have been waiting for it for\nwhat feels like forever now and it truly did not disappoint. The\nstoryline was clever, the dynamic between Watson and Holmes was\ncharming and beautiful, and the effects were incredible. Honestly, as\nmuch of a fan I am of the first movie, its sequel surpassed it and my\noverall expectation. Some the effects were unnecessary at times, but I\nreally enjoy the style in which these movies are edited. It can be\nslightly confusing periodically, another reason to rewatch, still pay\nattention closely. Jude Law and Robert Downey Jr.'s chemistry was\ncompelling and the supporting actors were on par. I laughed, I nearly\nscreamed, and I even cried. Game of Shadows is gripping, exciting,\nhilarious,and even draws tears. You'll be cheering throughout and\nsatisfied with the end. Too be honest, it is absolutely one of the best\nmovies of this year.\n"
"\nTalking about sequels, more often than not, they are disappointment\ncompared to the original. But this team has done again. They brought\nback the sequel with quality. I enjoyed this film as much as I did in\nthe first part. The action, thrill, intelligence, all are placed\nperfectly in this film. The screenplay and making pattern is pretty\nmuch same as the first part and story moving in good pace. The main\ncharacters did a fantastic job once again. Holmes and Watson chemistry\nis perfect and delivered a great performance. Here I really like the\nway how the hero and villain play their games, both are very clever and\nthe equality was very interesting. Simply, if you liked the first part,\njust go for this one. This is perfect entertainment and No\ndisappointments.\n"
"\nSomething about anarchists and tensions between France and Germany, a\ngypsy fortune teller of indeterminate nationality with a missing\nbrother who at one point I thought was buried in a basement but shows\nup at a peace conference/ballroom dance high up in the Alps. Oh, and\nthrow in an evening at the opera, a dead dog brought to life with a\nshot of adrenaline to its heart, and a severe case of TB communicated\napparently by teacups. <br><br>On top of this, all the male characters come across as gay. Holmes\nseems jealous of Watson's marriage; Holmes's brother acts like Oscar\nWilde; Watson dances at a ball with Holmes, etc. Maybe this was an\nintentional subtext but just seemed odd.\n"
"\nI went to see this film last night and was immersed in it from the very\nfirst minutes.<br><br>The action was constant edge of the set stuff, the locations stunning,\nthe CGI, the acting excellent. The use of slow motion in this film adds\nto the action.<br><br>The only possible minus would be a little too much flesh from the\nweighty Stephen Fry. How Kelly Reilly kept her composure I have no\nidea, but I would expect it was easy to look away.<br><br>The best part for me was the verbal war of wits between Moriarty and\nHolmes especially.Clever writing and acting. Also, the ending; it left\nme wanting more.<br><br>It is not often that a sequel is as good as the original film. I would\nsuggest that this is better. I left the cinema saying I wanted to go\nback in to see all the hints I had missed .\n"
"\nDoesn't matter how you look at it, this movie is darn good fun. I loved\nit from opening credits to the close. So what if the acting is a bit\nover the top, so what if there are probably too many explosions and\nbullets and bombs. The end result is a thoroughly entertaining 2 hours\nat the movies with popcorn and Pearl and Dean ads. Moriarty is\nsufficiently creepy and played with restraint, Holmes is completely\nover the top but for me if its Robert Downey Jr there are no\ncomplaints. The story keeps moving and the action is terrific. The\nstory is loosely based on the last book of the Conan Doyle's first\nseries of Holmes stories ending with the famous Reisenbach Falls in\nSwitzerland. It also gives a great image of early 20th century on the\nbrink of the first world war. If you want to enjoy a good story with\ngreat imagery and costume then you will enjoy this, if you are looking\nfor Sherlock ( wonderfully called Shirley by Mycroft ) as Conan Doyle\nintended then you may be disappointed.\n"
"\nSherlock Holmes is supposed to be about clever mystery and crime\nsolving not martial arts action, Mission Impossible style disguises and\nfuturistic plastic surgery. Most of the plot is so impossible for the\ntime period. The machine guns, the plastic surgery, the massive\nweaponry etc - it's just so wrong. There is little humor and they made\nSherlock so beaten up and damaged looking.<br><br>The good points: the sets art direction provided an atmospheric\nvisually pleasing 19th Century European feel. Old London and Paris were\nwell recreated.<br><br>Casting: Jared Harris is a bad villain - too rough looking. Too little\nRachel McAdams. She was the best thing about the first movie. Noomi\nRapace is not pleasant to watch even if she looks gypsy like. Robert\nDowney's accent is bad and his mumbling is incomprehensible. Jude Law\nlooks haggard and the actress playing his wife is common looking.<br><br>Guy Ritchie's direction with some sequences so fast you can't see\nwhat's going on then silly frozen nonsense just doesn't work.<br><br>Don't bother with this one it's a dud.\n"
"\nLet me get this out of the way first: I loved the first film. In fact,\nfor this one I had high hopes especially since we were finally dealing\nwith Moriarty.<br><br>This film severely disappointed me. The story was disjointed, and there\nwas no clear direction of that story until the very end. They used\ntheir iconic cinematography, wild action scenes, and silly humour to\ncarry the film nowhere to the point that both my friend and I were\nactually bored of it. And that, unfortunately killed the ending for us\nduring which we did not care at all for the characters nor for what\nkind of ending the film carried. I never read any original Sherlock\nstories, but I found that Robert's portrayal, though well acted, was\nexcessively \"OCD\" and \"insane\" - far more than the first film.<br><br>I'll be honest - I far more enjoyed Brent Spiner and his co-star\nportraying these characters on Star Trek the Next Generation than this\nfilm.\n"
"\nMissing all the intrigue and light hearted fun of its predecessor, Game\nof Shadows is quite a mess. While fun at times with plenty of jokes and\nlittle things to like here and there, it never seems a cohesive whole.\nMore importantly, it never seems like a Sherlock Holmes movie.<br><br>From the start (actually, before the start) we know who our nemesis is:\nProfessor James Moriarty. A fiendish name accompanied by a wonderfully\ndevilish performance by Jared Harris. That's no problem. What is the\nproblem is that his duel with Holmes seems geared more towards action\nscenes than a well paced mystery. Holmes fights in slow mo, dodges\ncannon shells in a forest, is skewered by a large industrial fish hook,\nand survives a flurry of machine gun fire in a train. This movie is a\nvictim of sequelitis: it knows it has to be bigger and badder, but\ndoesn't know how to do it while keeping the core content the same.<br><br>Go to http://thethreeacts.wordpress.com/ to read the complete review!\n"
"\nNot even worth a few lines of review. Wasted my budget on this\ngarbage!! How can you spoil such a rich collection of characters,\nactors,story lines or even budget?! Just a pathetic attempt\nat...nothing! This is a crime against movie going humanity just because\nsomeone has the budget and backing to make a movie for idiots and\nmorons. I wish we could tip the director over the waterfalls just as\nHolmes in the final scene except that he stays there forever!!I am so\nfrustrated and feel someone has duped me with a sick sense of humour.\nWish I had waited and taken the family to see MI next week.Want my\nmoney back!!\n"
"\nWell, I am bit puzzled. What can I say? Was the movie well done? Yes\nand no. There are certain weak parts and obvious stronger bits. Jude\nLaw and Robert Downey Jnr both are great as Watson and Holmes, as well\nas Stephen Fry is a very funny Microft. But then, there are some big\nmistakes in casting. Noomi Rapace is The biggest blunder. She was great\nin The Swedish Girl Who... Trilogy, but here no. She is weak, pale,\nblunt, shallow and gray. The only part we remember of her? Her eating\nsome food near The Eiffel Tower. Pity that there is no so much Rachel\nMcAdamas this time, she was great then and good here What else can I\nsay? The movie is well cut and shot, it is dark and ominous, as\nintended, and some scenes are pure Matrix-quality. But then, there are\nso many goofs and funny anachronisms that make the whole movie a bit\nunserious. My opinion? it was OK, and fun. A bit too prolonged at\ntimes.\n"
"\nOne of the few films I haven't bothered to finish watching. I like an\naction movie as much as the next guy. Mixing it with comedy though -\nnot so much. Still, could've been OK. Not a huge Downey Jnr fan though\n(not that believable as an actioneer). But the accent was just brutal\nand the humour for me just rankled. Might've watched the rest of it if\nI hadn't sky+'ed something decent ... but I had. Easily the worst\nHolmes feature I've ever seen - indupitibly so. Bring back the Holmes\nof Basil Rathbone. No bromance with Watson in those B&amp;W's. And what's\nwith Jude's Watson?!?! The imagination can only stretch so far. Please\nknock this franchise on the head (though i'm sure it made gazillions)\n:( Look out for Laurel and Hardy reboot with Cruise and Crowe...\n"
"\nI liked Guy Ritchie's first Sherlock Holmes movie, even though it had\nso little to do with Sherlock Holmes that one suspects the writer\nlearned everything about the original from half-listening to a friend\ndescribe a story he'd read 20 years ago. But if you took it as a movie\nabout characters that just happen to have names like Holmes and Watson\nbut are otherwise their own thing, it was pretty decent.<br><br>That cannot, alas, be said for the sequel, which is just plain dull.\nThe movie lacks, for the most part, the intriguing flirtation between\nHolmes and Irene Adler, instead bringing in some strikingly bland\ncharacters to populate its muddled story. The direction seems\nunnecessarily gimmicky even compared to other Ritchie films, and while\nI wouldn't describe the movie as a *huge* waste of two hours, it is\ncertainly two hours I could have spent in a better fashion.\n"
"\nI believe the first Sherlock Holmes was much closer to the books\nformula of mystery solved by Holmes logic. The second installment is\nmore like an action film. There is more action in this movie, but the\nmovie still goes back the original formula when Holmes locks his\nwits/logic against the evil professor. The movie is a good mix of humor\nand action while the storyline keeps the viewer interested. Guy Richie\ndirects the slow motion action excellently, which Richie is famously\nknown for. The movie is worth seeing in the theater. It was a good New\nYears eve date. I give Sherlock Holmes A game of Shadows a seven out of\nten.\n"
"\nI rate this movie with 1 because I expected better movie than its\nprequel which was a very solid viewing but that is not a reason for\nthis review. I only wanted to point out that it was a serious mistake\nfor Holmes to send Dr.Watson to find (or deduce!) the assassin in the\nfinal moments of the movie. He is trying to find a killer with\ncomplicated methods but he only had to consider this: - Madame Simsa's\nbrother Rene (as she is of course) is French. - The easiest person for\nhim to imitate is also French. - It is not easy for him to imitate\nBritish or German person because the languages are too different. - So\nonly logical deduction would be - French ambassador. Probably something\nHolmes would have discovered in no-time. Or maybe not. Too bad that\ndirector has tried to make this movie interesting with kung-fu skills\nand slow/stop motion instead with cerebral powers of the world's\ngreatest detective.\n"
"\nThe original movie created an excellent formula that should have been\ntaken and used successfully in this sequel. Unfortunately this movie\nsells out to an American \"Hollywood\" audience, and as a result\nalienates fans of the Sherlock Holmes genre.<br><br>Robert Downey Jr and Jude Law are very entertaining, however Rachel\nMcAdams is painful and brings little to the movie other than the usual\nfluttering of her eye lashes and cliché promiscuity.<br><br>Guy Ritchie seems to be a one trick pony. His directorial techniques\nhave changed little in the 15 years since his 1997 hit Lock Stock and\nTwo Smoking Barrels. Obviously, the main difference being the seizable\nWarner Bros budget now at his disposal.\n"
"\nI wrote my university thesis on Sherlock Holmes. This is a crock of\nrubbish. Hollywood-ized, exaggerated, unbearable trash. It seems to\nexpect us to believe that Holmes is a Matrix-era Neo with\nsuper-hero-styled martial arts abilities. Downey could hardly overact\nmore without this film being deemed sheer comedy. Indeed, that would be\nwhat this is, were it not so woefully bad. 'Suspension of Disbelief',\nanyone\"? Aye...not even worth a free download. One wonders why anyone\nwould pass this script or agree to act in it. It must just be a cynical\nhope that some money can be made. The first film had, at least, a\nslight nod to the brilliant restrained excellence of a TV actor such as\nJeremy Brett, in his utterly British, ironic and subtle acting of the\ndetective icon. Downey and whoever acts Holmes (he's too 2D for me to\ncare who he is)simply dissolve into a pap of loud SFX and rushed\nstereotypical trash. All that is sloppy with modern Hollywood\ndistilled. I give two stars for the waterfall finale with Holmes and\nMoiraty: that was poignant....sadly undone by a facile ending.\n"
"\nI am a Sherlock Holmes snob..that said, I think Robert Downy Jr. is the\nworst thing that ever happen to Holmes right up there with Basil\nRathbone who only did one real Holmes story the rest were, well I don't\nknow what they were). The best Holmes being Jeremy Brett. Holmes didn't\nlike women so he wouldn't be following one around like a dog. He would\nhave never let his good friend Dr. Watson down, nor would he have\nharmed his wife in anyway. Mycroft would never have paraded around his\nhome nude in front of a guest... the list goes on. I had to get up and\nleave the theater, it was so bad. Why is it when American's make a\nHolmes movie it is nothing like the story. Just follow Conan Doyle's\nbooks they are a hit on their own. I will never watch another American\nmade Holmes movie again. Awful, Awful, Awful!!!!!\n"
"\nThe movie is handsomely filmed and has all sorts of clever special\neffects but the story line was totally incoherent to me. RDJ's Holmes\nlooks like he has not only shaved in days but he hasn't bathed in days,\neither. Jude Law's Dr. Watson looks equally scruffy. Didn't anyone\nshave in the 1890s? There's a lot of bantering between Holmes and\nWatson which is entertaining but very little of the deductive reasoning\nthat was the core of every Holmes story. And yes, in the books Holmes\ndid know some sort of Asian martial arts but these new movies make him\ninto a martial arts expert an a par with Bruce Lee. It's so incongruous\nto the rest of the story and the setting as to be very distracting.\n"
"\nThe character sometimes talks like Sherlock, but fights like a damn\nBruce Lee, shoots like freaking Rambo and has a lot of Jack Sparrow in\nhis humoristic backbone. Absurdly nothing like what's in the books. Sir\nArthur Conan Doyle must be weeping in his grave by now. If you have a\ncontrary view, then follow up your disagreement by first reading ONE of\nthe books.The director seems to have it confused with Batman; I would\nnot be surprised if he actually had some sort of Sherlock-Belt along\nwith a baseball bat. The detective role he should play in this movie is\nreplaced by a vicious brawler breaking bones and performing dazzling\nacrobatic moves. It's fun, it's well edited, but it is NOT Sherlock\nHolmes.\n"
"\nI suppose if I had seen some older version it might had made more\nsense, maybe. As it was I was left hanging at the end. Holmes's accent\nwas hard to pin down. I would say from the Burbs in America, but the\nBurbs had yet to be discovered in Middle America. Another thing, try to\nget a definitive explanation of what buddy cop film is or was i.e.\nTANGO &amp; CASH, Lethal WEAPON 2. It is hard as the root of the Victorian\nage. It seemed to have been damp there all the time. I would have a bad\nrash I am sure. The slow motion scenes (which caught my eyes on the\npreviews) just made the boredom all that more excruciating. One mystery\nto me is how a movie with a lot (too much) of action could at the same\ntime be so boring, but it succeeded very well at accomplishing this!\nAlthough I heard many people laughing in the theater, I can't recommend\nthis movie to anyone looking forward to a good Sherlock Holmes mystery,\nor good movie period.<br><br>I prefer the oral history version I have of my childhood memories. Nuff\nsaid.\n"
"\nEven if I were to accept the ludicrous ending which offered some\nobscure bugs as the culprits of the disruption of Victorian officials,\nthere were still so many plot holes to ignore. In addition, the martial\narts sequence was too blurry, too-close up to take seriously. We know\nthe actors aren't pugilistic experts and it showed. What they should\nhave done was employ long angle shots to convey a sense of majesty and\nbeauty in the martial arts, but of course they couldn't because the\nactors were just not skilled. And the CGI was just so fake. Especially\nthat of London, the capital city of ancient Britannian Dynasty, and the\nclock of Bing Ben. Coupled with the lengthy story-line that was so\nboring, this film is a must avoid-at-all-cost. Consider yourself\nwarned.\n"
"\nWaking up early in the morning to catch the first day first show of\nSherlock Holmes because you are a serious Guy Ritchie fan and have seen\nall his movies and loved them,well I had some ideas that maybe it wont\nbe good enough and guess what i was right.I was disappointed with Guy\nRitchie and Robert Downey Jr whom people are regarding as an \"Amazing\nActor\" well let me just tell you this Game of Shadows was a complete\ndowner not only because of drifting screenplay and predictable plot but\nalso because of juvenile acting done by our Mr Holmes here.The script\nwas fine but i sincerely felt the previous movie was way better than\nthis one.Only Jude Law and Jared Harris saved the day for me throughout\nthis 129 minutes of what they call a movie which actually was a messing\nup everything Sir Arthur Conan Doyle worked on.\n"
"\nSometimes one watches a movie and weeps because the story is so strong\nand compelling that it evokes a cathartic experience. And then there\nare movies that cause the eyelids to grow heavy and the mind to wander\noff to slumber land. This movie is in the latter category. Sherlock\nHolmes is not a cartoon character, yet this movie not only transforms\nMr. Holmes into a cartoon character, he is a cross between Daffy Duck\nand James Bond. Not surprisingly, the movie provokes some unintended\n(or maybe intended) laughter, but with a ridiculous story that brings\nnew meaning to the word contrived, there is little that can save this\nmovie from DVD land where it belongs. Robert Downey and Jude Law give\nit a try, but their efforts are for naught. Sometimees the current is\njust too strong. The story is simply too implausible and the special\neffects too gratuitous. Okay, tastes change and maybe the producers are\nplaying to a certain audience. But one thing that does not change is\nquality, and in this respect the movie could have been better.\n"
"\nNow i have read all the books of Sherlock Holmes, and if you are going\nto this movie thinking that they have made it from the book, then you\nare wrong and will be disappointed. This movie has as much with the\noriginal book of Sherlock Holmes and Moriarty to do as Sherlock Holmes\nhas to do with The Detective Colombo. Yes they are both detectives and\nthey solve crime, but thats about it. Many characters in this movie\ndoesn't exist in the original book, a lot of the main story of the film\ndon't exist in the book and Sherlock Holmes don't act like the Sherlock\nHolmes in the book would have done. The creator of this movie has not\ngiven Sherlock Holmes the credit that he deserves. This movie doses not\ndeserve to be called Sherlock Holmes. If this movie had been called\nsomething completely else, i would have given this movie more stars,\nbut since this is called Sherlock Holmes then i cannot give this movie\nmore stars.. because it don't justify to be called Sherlock Holmes.\n"
"\nNo, no, no, this is not a Sherlock Holmes movie. If Sherlock Holmes was\nan action hero, then this movie would be excellent. But Sherlock is not\nan action hero. He is gifted with an incredible intellect, that you\nvirtually see nothing of in this movie. What you see a lot of is\nrunning, hitting, kicking and shooting, as well as people who don't die\neven after being knifed several times and falling 20 meters off a\nbuilding... falling not only once, but three times. Well, I must admit\nthat this review is based only on the first 60 minutes. I did not want\nto waist more of my time on this. It was already 60 too many minutes.\nSo, don't waist your time on this, like I did.\n"
"\nThis movie is bad in everything I may Imagine,<br><br>I can save cinematography and thos high speed camera shots. All the\nrest is crap. There is not story, the plot seems to be wrote by an high\nschool teenager. The lines are basically senseless just to get one or\ntwo smiles. Everything has been already seen, no pathos, no mystery. <br><br>Acting is terrible and there is nothing to be remembered, is it a\nsequence on sketches like benny hill meets Bud Spencer, a lot of\nteenager jokes and stupid fights, this is a movie well focused for\nyoung teenager that will smile for old jokes between the characters and\nmacho statements every scene or two. This movie will be easily\nforgotten by everyone (just to test: ask someone who saw the movie what\nwas the story about three days after he saw it, you will be amazed by\nhis reply)<br><br>what a waste.\n"
"\nThis Hollywood movie is a disgrace to the intelligent, wise, intuitive\ndetective \"Sherlock Holmes\" character. Instead of being focused on his\ndetective skills, it focuses on special effects and violence so much\nthat his character and the shallow plot are minimized. Therefore, if\nyou enjoy Hollywood movies with special effects and violence more than\nplot, then I recommend it. However, if that is what you want, then why\nsee \"Sherlock Holmes\"? There are hundreds of movies with that emphasis,\nand with even better special effects. If you enjoy a good Sherlock\nHolmes detective film with an engaging, suspenseful plot, then you will\nbe tremendously disappointed!\n"
"\nThey could call the main character in this film John Archibald, Peter\nSmith, Vera Gardner, or whatever because it makes no difference<br><br>He simply has no resemblance whatsoever with Doyle's creation. Those\nthings should not be allowed. It is like painting mustaches on Mona\nLisa or adding another leg to Michelangelo's David.<br><br>What we have here is a guy, a \"thing\" who is a mixture of a buffoon\nwith an adult with ADD (nothing against the folks with ADD!!!). He is\nnot a hero, nor anti-hero, he is just a messy individual.<br><br>And to make things worse, the story is not that interesting. It has a\nfeel of deja-vu. It is an effortless to capitalize on the success of\nthe first film...<br><br>Too bad they don't make Sherlock Holmes like before...\n"
"\nAlthough that would be damning with faint praise.<br><br>Clearly, the screenwriters this time had actually READ something by Sir\nArthur Conan Doyle, so I give them credit for getting characters right\nto a degree.<br><br>And we have Noomi Rapace, who is in everything nowadays. Hope she's a\nfad which wears off soon.<br><br>It was better than the last one, absolutely. They had a few pointless\naction scenes, and some telegraphing, like Holmes giving Watson that\nadrenal shot, you knew that would be used later.<br><br>Downey was better as Holmes this time and Law was more believable as\nWatson, but frankly, there was only just enough characterization to\nhand the action scenes on, which were forgettable.\n"
"\nThe film is a nauseating mixed up muddy mess, from beginning to end.\nIncredibly gimmicky and shallow. Nearly unintelligible dialogue. The\ngimmickry present reminds one of how the works of Arthur Conan Doyle\nshould *not* be turned into CSI, Batman, or James Bond. And sadly other\nrecent works within the \"Sherlock franchise\" fall prey to this evil\ntemptation (eg: the BBC's recent Sherlock series). Save your brain.\nSave your money. Keep your lunch in your stomach. Avoid this film.\nInstead seek out works with Jeremy Brett. Other portrayals by Robert\nDowney Jr., even by Benedict Cumbersplatch / Smebersmoch / Hoobersmich\n/ Cumberbatch, are rather akin to shallow harlotry in my view. Mostly\nunconvinced. Forced. Contrived. Gimmicky. But Jeremy Brett's portrays\nwere near perfect. So search for them instead.\n"
"\nThis is the worst film i have seen in a long time. Although it's only\nabout an hour and half long it felt like 3. There is no real story,\nit's something to do with finding a bomber and stopping a war but i'm\nstill not sure. Many of the characters are unnesccesary as are many of\nthe locations.<br><br>It is one of those films where after a while you can't actually\nremember what the crime was that they are investigating. I actually\nfell asleep for a while and it didn't detract from the story. You know\nit is a bad film when the people on both sides asked us if we knew what\nthe story was about at the end of the film.\n"
"\nI was a huge fan of Robert Downey Jr.'s performance in the first\nSherlock Holmes, and while I was excited to see him again as Sherlock\non screen, I was afraid I would be let down by yet another sequel.\nHowever, that was not the case at all! Sherlock in a Game of Shadows by\nfar blew away my expectations and surpassed the first movie in my eyes.\nSherlock is wittier than ever, while at the same time more stealthy,\nserious, and plays an amazing protagonist to the Antagonist Professor\nJames Moriarty. Whether it be an action packed scene, funny dialogue,\nor just plain enjoyment, I was thoroughly enjoyed and hooked in from\nstart to finish.\n"
"\nI'm glad that I'm not the only one who thinks that this second movie\ndidn't as good as the first one.. From the performance, Robert Downey\nJr. has did it again with his character as Sherlock Holmes, even Dr.\nJohn Watson's performance by Jude Law really got a lot of improvement\ntoo.. But their performance didn't help a lot as the story of this\nmovie got the audiences a little confusing even though I know it's\nquite brilliant to make some twist like that.. The other disappointment\nis Noomi Rapace's performance which is for me just like a sweetener\nbecause of the death of Irene Adler, but she's nowhere for replacing\nIrene Adler.. Overall, for me this sequel is a little disappointment\nbut I must appreciate Guy Ritchie's work since he did his best in here\nso this rating is the best that I can give to this movie..\n"
"\nOne of the easiest ways to sum up Sherlock Holmes: Game of Shadows\nwould be to say, 'If you liked the first one then you'll love this one\ntoo.' It's basically more of the same, but if what was done the first\ntime was a winning formula, then who really care? (it worked for\nTerminator 1-3!).<br><br>You have more witticisms from Robert Downey Jr as Holmes, more of\nlong-suffering Jude law as Watson and more trendy and stylish slow-mo\ndirecting, courtesy of Guy Ritchie. This time round they team up to\nlock horns with arguably Holmes' most famous villain - Moriarty.<br><br>You could call it all a re-tread of the first film, but in different\nlocations, but that would probably be overly cynical. It's a new story\nin itself and, while certain purists complain that it's not completely\nfaithful to Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's original books, it's got its own\ncharms. It may not be a hundred per cent accurate or believable, but\nit's basically Hollywood's take on what Sherlock Holmes was and - in my\nopinion - it's a pretty exciting take. Bring on Holmes III!\n"
"\n\"Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows\" is not as good as the first film\nin the series, but it does benefit from an interesting villain. Don't\nunderestimate how important that is to this kind of movie; when you\nhave a hero that's as smart as ol' Holmes, you better have someone that\nhe can match wits with or the whole thing will be a snooze-fest as you\nwait for this lamo to get trounced by the world's greatest detective.\nIf anything, I was disappointed that these adversaries didn't get to\nshare more screen time. The second half is interesting and well crafted\nenough to keep the audience entertained though, so it more than redeems\nitself for me. It's unfortunate that the detective work and mystery\nplay second fiddle to some of the action scenes and humor sequences,\nand I felt that some of the revelations and plot twists were way over\nthe top, but overall it's enjoyable. I actually feel like I'm being way\ntoo harsh on it, I just happened to have really high hopes considering\nhow fresh and intelligent the first installment was. (Theatrical\nversion on the big screen, January 2012)\n"
"\nAs a continuation, this isn't as great as the first part but the ending\ndoes take your breath away. <br><br>This movie portrays a very different side of Holmes quite on the\nlikeness of Capt Jack Sparrow with some Tony Stark thrown in. Dr Watson\nthankfully isn't the bumbling fool he is made out to be in the books by\nAC Doyle. And Prof Moriarty seems far more formidable than in the\nbooks.<br><br>A great portrayal by Guy Ritchie and some fantastic performances by\nRobert Downey. <br><br>If you get bored in the movie, just remember that the ending is really\nnice. Wait for it. It is worth it.\n"
"\nI am not a big fan of Sherlock Holmes.But I watched films of Sherlock\nHolmes.I watched this movie in December of 2011. I like character of\nRobertDowney Jr very much. I enjoyed this film as much as I did in the\nfirst part. If I was to say something about this movie it would be that\nit is really good quality. The effects that were used very moving. The\ncostumes and props were also very interesting I still can not over how\ngood it is. This is perfect entertainment and no disappointments.I'm\nlooking forward series 3 of this film. I can recommend this movie to\npeople wanting to watch something interesting. In general I found this\ntoo successful.\n"
"\nLots of action, a fair smattering of comedy and a thrilling plot go\ntogether to make up this film. Most of it works pretty well, however\nthere is a bit of a weak link and that is the part of the story\ninvolving the character played by the, woefully underused, Noomi\nRapace. I thought it was a little weak and didn't quite have enough\nbelievability (for me). Having said that, the rest of the film was very\nthrilling and entertaining throughout with a great ending! Over all, I\ndid enjoy this film a lot more than I thought I would at the beginning.<br><br>SteelMonster's verdict: RECOMMENDED<br><br>My score: 7.7/10.<br><br>You can find an expanded version of this review on my blog: Thoughts of\na SteelMonster.\n"
"\nThe 2nd in the Sherlock series starring the dynamic duo of Law &amp; Downey\nJr. does not disappoint. What was disappointing was that I took Tomato\nMeter's advice and chose to pay and see MI4 at the theater over\nSherlock. MI4 couldn't hold a candle to this one. The plot is\nbrilliant; the script is brilliant; the action scenes, better than the\nfirst installment; and the overall work engaging and enjoyable up to\nliterally the last second of the film. Compare that to MI4; which\nstunk, let's face it. Terrible script and screenplay, lousy acting,\ncheesy delivery of lines, so contrived to say the least.<br><br>But I digress. I think Guy Richie has done a fantastic job with these\nfilms and I'm looking so forward to the next. The only thing that\ndetracts from the overall euphoria of just having watched this is the\nreality dawning that it'll be at least two years before that next one\narrives in theaters. Until then, Sherlock lives on!\n"
"\nI could not understand much of Robert Downey's dialog. His fake English\naccent seems garbled at times. He lowers his voice and mumbles the\nwords, presumably to give the impression of fluency. It is too bad that\nsuch an elaborate production was marred by an unintelligible\nprotagonist. This was a problem in the first film that was carried over\nto the second. Surprisingly, no one caught it. For some of us that\nstill identify Sherlock Holmes with Basil Rathbone, the principal\nactors seemed a bit too silly and glib. It gives the impression that\nthe main characters are simply having fun with the movie instead of\ntaking the acting seriously and making the production believable.\nDepending on amazing special effects and not emphasizing good acting in\nfilms is all too common today. Directors should direct and actors\nshould act. There is such a thing as allowing top actors too much\nfreedom to improvise.\n"
"\nI suppose I'll sound like a broken record. I enjoyed this movie, but,\nlike the first, I almost never think of it as a Sherlock Holmes film.\nIf Indiana Jones were to be transferred into Robert Downey's body, it\nwouldn't make any difference. Because of the name recognition, many\nentities are capitalizing on the Holmes name. Making him a quirky\nindecipherable enigma, or making his partner a woman named Watson who\nis of Asian descent. These are certainly interesting but so far removed\nfrom the Holmes mythos that it does nothing for me. This is a wild\nadventure with lots of twists and turns, leading to some really\ndramatic moments; but it's also so full of contrivances that I have to\nsuspend so much disbelief. People just know things without the\nratiocination that was the whole of the original character. We could\nuse a dose of that in any new Holmes incarnation which would really\nsubstantiate the character.\n"
"\nGuy Ritchie created something really neat with 2009's \"Sherlock\nHolmes\", and manages to equal it with \"Sherlock Holmes: A Game of\nShadows\". The part about a series of mysterious assassinations plaguing\nEurope and possible leading to war sounds exactly like something that\ngovernments would do to distract their populaces from any problems.\nRobert Downey Jr. continues his depiction of the famous detective as\nhaving another side that the audience never knew about, with Jude Law's\nWatson often irritated at the antics. The movie sometimes goes a little\noverboard on the action, but the intrigue more than makes up for it. I\nespecially liked Noomi Rapace (Lisbeth Salander in the \"Millennium\"\ntrilogy) as the enigmatic Roma woman.<br><br>The movie probably isn't for everyone, but it pleased me.\n"
"\nThis was a very enjoyable movie with breath-taking action sequences.\nThe 'chase through the woods' scene was spectacularly done through\nslow-motion but it isn't until \"Little Hansel\" is unleashed when the\nviewer is left truly awestruck.<br><br>The scenes between Holmes (Downey Jr.) and Moriarty (Jared Harris),\ngreatly done, are the focal points of much of the movie's plot. The\nchemistry between Downey Jr. and Jude Law are also further developed\nfrom the first movie. My only complaint about this sequel is that\nMycroft Holmes' character was dismissed as utter garbage.<br><br>Hans Zimmer's score deserves a worthy mention. All in all a thrilling\nmovie that conveys Arthur Conan Doyle's Holmes to our more 'adrenaline\nhungry' generation.\n"
"\nI really enjoyed this movie from the beginning to the end. A lot of\naction and I really enjoyed the Sherlock Holmes character played by\nRobert D Jr. A awesome cast and a great story. I was surprised this\nmovie was directed by Guy Ritchie, he did a great job on this one, keep\nthem coming. Its good to see Robert D Jr at his best again. The humour\nin this movie was also very good and made it also the movie that it is.\nJude Law played his character also very well, and I was amused by\nSherlock Holmes's brother.The costumes and sets looked amazing. I would\nhave loved to see this movie in the cinema, but watched it via movie on\ndemand. I definitely recommend this movie to my friends and family and\nI don't do that quickly.\n"
"\nSherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows<br><br>CSI in the 1800s wasn't as glamorous as today.

"\nI'm a big Sherlock Holmes fan. I read the abridged adaptation of \"The\nHound of the Baskervilles\" as a kid and was immediately addicted. I was\nthen introduced to Basil Rathbone's movie version of the sleuth. Over\nthe years, I've read a few of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's short stories\nand loved them all. Unlike many Sherlockians, I had no problem with\nRobert Downey Jr. playing the character. I thoroughly enjoyed his\nunique, physically fit, and active exploits in Guy Ritchie's first\n\"Sherlock Holmes\" film. <br><br>Sequels can go south very quick. I was happy this wasn't the case here.\nThat's not to say it doesn't have its flaws.The only real issue is the\nbeginning of the film, where it feels like Ritchie is trying to\nfront-load it a bit too much. The rest of the movie moves along at a\ngood pace and keeps viewers riveted. Don't try watching this in a noisy\nroom or while doing something else because it's way too complex and you\nwon't be able to keep up.\n"
"\nIf you have seen the first installment of the franchise, you come with\ncertain expectations. Well, those expectations are met in full, as A\nGame of Shadows has the same feel as the first film. Now, however,\npeople cannot nag that this is supposed to be a prequel to Doyle's\nbooks and thus the youthful superhero stuff is not utter tosh, but some\nsort of smart reimagining. No, it is not. It's just special effects\npoured generously on a transparent thin copy of the original stories.\nSherlock Holmes is extremely brilliant, but he doesn't even explain\nmuch what his deductions are. He barely has the time, since he is in\ngun fights and explosions half the movie.<br><br>The only reason I did not fail the film is the presence of Jared\nHarris, who we see more and more often in American productions such as\nFringe or Mad Men and he is great in all of them. As things stand, I\nreally wish they would resurrect Moriarty in the third part, rather\nthan replace Harris with some nondescript villain.\n"
"\nI liked the first Sherlock Holmes a lot: the pace was good, the acting\ntoo and the chemistry between Holmes and Watson excellent. Quite an\narbitrary reinvention of the character, but an enjoyable one: I\nappreciated that psychopathic facet of Holmes taken to paradox and the\ninjection of fun and action. Yet it was still Sherlock Holmes, the\ngenial detective, whose logic skills are beyond human. In the second\nmovie one can find all the good ingredients of the first, but Sherlock\nHolmes: now that he has found his match and his nemesis, one would\nexpect the main game to be played on the court of cleverness, one would\nwant to assist a titanic chess game between the genius of investigation\nand the genius of crime, a sequence of formidable moves and\ncounter-moves leading to plot twists one after the other. In truth,\nthere is nothing of this: lots of speaking of cat and mouse games, but\nno cats, no mice and no game. It's not even worth to post spoilers...\neverything is so predictable.\n"
"\nIf you enjoyed the first film you will definitely enjoy this one.<br><br>Its fast action packed fun that left me wanting more of the same. I\nwatched the first movie without any expectations and wasn't\ndisappointed, I was impressed. I went into this movie with very high\nexpectations it was refreshing to see them all met and exceeded.<br><br>The chemistry is great between the actors and the movie does not let up\nfrom start to finish. After walking out after the movie i was very\ntempted to go buy another ticket and go back and watch it again it was\nthat much fun. <br><br>The fact that the movie keeps u entertained for the whole 2 hour\nduration is a tribute to the director, he manages to keep all the good\nparts of the first movie but to also expand and make everything bigger\nand more exciting including the brilliant plot<br><br>Its very hard to talk about the movie with out giving to much away. For\nme its a must watch and easily the best movie of the past few years.\n"
"\nThe moment I came to know that this movie was gonna be out, i was\nexcited to watch it. Now the wait is over and this movie has not\ndisappointed any Sherlock Holmes' fans. Its an absolute cracker of a\nmovie and some may find it even better than the first one... The\ndialogues and the flow of the movie is absolutely brilliant. Robert\nDowney Jr. and Jude law.. when i see those two together.. i wonder\nwhether they are a couple in real life... what a chemistry between\nthese two!!! They can't show a better bonding in a movie... Who needs\nan actress?? ;) Robert Downey Jr's acting.. well what can you say...\neach of his movies is a treat to watch just coz of his acting alone..\nJared harris .. The villain... well it is amazing to see a villain who\nis as good as a hero... and it is a treat to watch the fight sequences\nwhich they create in their minds.. don't want to reveal much about\nit... Just go and watch the movie... you wont regret it... !\n"
"\nReading some reviews I can't understand why some people get so serious\nabout something that is clearly about entertainment and entertaining it\ncertainly is. I enjoyed the whole movie thoroughly and will definitely\nwatch it again. Furthermore I particularly liked some of the filming,\nsome great camera work going on. For me this is an excellent and highly\nenjoyable movie. I laughed all the way through and so did the rest of\nthe audience, a good sign I suspect Dr Watson. Additionally I really\nhave to say Robert Downey Jr is superb in the role and overall I think\nit is a must see flick. I hope it leaves you as entertained as I was.\nEnjoy C\n"
"\nMy review -<br><br>First things first..... I loved the movie.<br><br>For all the fans of the detective from Arthur Canon Doyle's book, this\nversion of Holmes is blasphemous. For all those who got the first taste\nof the great detective after watching the first installment, this movie\nis one hell of a joyride... Take your pick.<br><br>For the original Sherlock Holmes fans.... Sherlock Holmes, the great\ndetective, does not deduce anything in the movie. There is no mystery\nto solve here,no clues, no surprise elements.While the first part had\nnot one but many puzzles to solve, this time around, the story is plain\nvanilla. Here, Holmes is on a mission to stop Prof. James Moriarty from\ncommitting a dastardly act (no spoilers this time).<br><br>For read further, pls click on - <br><br>http://filtercoffeechronicles.blogspot.com/2012/01/sherlock-holmes-\nend.html\n"
"\nThere will be a many bores who complain about the slow motion action\nshots, the aggressive camera work, the noisy soundtrack or indeed\nDowney's portrayal of Sherlock Holmes.......<br><br>Ignore them!! I am a Sherlock Holmes fanatic, so much so that I have\nread virtually every book ever written about the character and have\nhovered noiselessly in Marylebone library on one or two occasions...\nThis film while not without it's faults is wild entertainment from\nbeginning to end! Downey and Law have great chemistry and the leads are\nbacked up by a nuanced Moriaty and an all round effective cast. Most of\nall the backdrops and effects are sumptuous and worth watching in\nthemselves!<br><br>The only downside I could mention was the character of Mycroft. Why\nchose that awesome bore Stephen Fry? And having done so not develop the\ncomplex relationship between the two characters? Any number of actors\nwould have been better as a brotherly foil for Holmes! Nevertheless a\ngreat film which put a great grin on my face!\n"
"\nWell, their is not much different from part 1, the main star of\nSherlock Holmes series from my point of view is the Directing and\nphotography! the acting of all the movies stars are average but still i\ndidn't like how fast Doctor Tomson acted like he totally forgot his\nwife , it was like he was a machine and as soon as the director clicked\non a button he totally changed ! anyway the story and the act kept a\nlittle smile on my face all the time but still i never said WOHOOO, for\nme Sherlok Holmes a game of shadows was like a simple dinner, which i\nenjoyed a bit but was not a first class dinner with chicken or meat ! I\nthink if they wanna keep this chain running, they must produce some\nreal action, some speeding in the censes because it was so slow ! also\ni am sure that in the next part ppl will already be bored of the new\ntechniques the director used for the camera ! so they really should\nthink hard before making a new part !\n"
"\nSherlock Holmes A Game Of Shadows was a great sequel that had great\nslow motion scenes and awesome fight scenes.<br><br>Sherlock Holmes and Dr. John Watson did a very good job of saving the\nworld from an evil professor named James Moriarty. Stephen Fry who\nplayed \"Mycroft Holmes\" Sherlock's brother was funny character that\ntalks very English and he was strange sometimes. I thought that Noomi\nRepace who played \"Madam Simza heron\" did great job playing that\ncharacter. And Jared Harris who played \"Professor James Moriarty\" was\njust as smart as Sherlock Holmes. And I thought the last fight scene in\nthis movie was interesting. Sherlock and Moriaty could think different\nattacks on each other, that scene was intense.<br><br>The train scene was awesome,Sherlock disguised as a girl was funny.\nAlso, the running scene in the forest was great.<br><br>This movie was very thrilling!\n"
"\nI was totally caught up in the story from the very beginning beside the\noutrageous and extreme scenes one upon the other. You can only do\noutrageous if it works and that's exactly what Downey Jr. and Law\npulled off. I hope that this is just the beginning of Sherlock Holmes\nand Dr. Watson with these two guys. It was a great bromance in its most\nasexual sense--after all part of the story line was Dr. Watson getting\nmarried. Perhaps unintended but it showed a powerful relationship they\nhad together as much as Dr. Watson had his frustrating moments not\ncompletely understanding the motives of his partner but ultimately\ntrusting his incredible acumen in dire situations. <br><br>I also enjoyed that there was more story line plot than just one action\nscene after another. Finally, Downey Jr. nailed down the English accent\nand even the expressions of an Englishman .<br><br>Clearly, one of the top ten movies of 2011.\n"
"\nI didn't care for this movie; it was a hodge podge of a mess. The plot\nmakes little sense. It's basically to get Holmes and Watson and a gypsy\non an adventure to foreign lands. All I know is it had something to do\nwith this guy Moriarty and him having all these big weapons. And Watson\nditches his wife right after being married to go along with the manic\nHolmes, so silly. And what was it with Holmes seeing a fight scene\nbefore it happened. I guess it was supposed to be his incredible mind\nat work but it made him seem like a psychic. And they used slow-mo in\nall this.<br><br>FINAL VERDICT: waste of money and time\n"
"\nI enjoyed the first Sherlock Holmes a lot. The mystery, the dynamic\nbetween Watson and Sherlock and the camera work was brilliant.<br><br>This sequel disappointed me. Unnecessary ultra-slow motion effects, an\noverly eccentric Sherlock, messy plot, superhero action ('Sherlock\nvision' is kinda ridiculous) and lack of investigation ruined this\nmovie for me. It feels as if the movie has been created for the sake of\nshowing off. Even the 'bad guy' doesn't get the chance of showing his\nacting abilities - and the man can definitely act!<br><br>It seems Guy Richie couldn't handle the success of the first movie. I\nhope for the third installment (if there will be any), he'll focus on\nstory, characters and dialog instead of fancy effects and locations.\n"
"\nMaybe you all thing differently but Holmes was a detective.He looked at\nthe evidence and deduced the crime. He now seems like James bond with\nmore. he is able to fight and even predict the movements of his\nopponents. <br><br>Holmes was a character that reviewed the facts from s crime and items\nthat were not noticed and put the jigsaw together.<br><br>He can predict a fight before it can take place!! The slow motions just\nseem more like the matrix<br><br>For me this is nothing to do with the real sherlock Holmes that went to\na crime that has happened and solves it.\n"
"\nWhen my supervisor at Dish said that the next Sherlock Holmes movie was\nout on DVD I knew I had to watch it. I have been reading the books\nsince I was a child and had always wondered how they would include\nHolmes' amazing intellectual insights without using a narrator. They\ndid an amazing job of it. Sometimes these amazing leaps of mental\nagility would be stated plainly, or stated as if it were very plain to\nHolmes rather. On other occasions they would actually slow time down\nand go through, step by step, what was going through the mind of\nHolmes, which was just as good if not better than the former. I would\nhave loved to buy this movie but since I couldn't afford to I rented it\nwith my Blockbuster at Home subscription. Since then, I have watched it\nabout three times total now. It is a must see. Even if you cant afford\nto buy it outright, you need to see this move.\n"
"\nBest scenes in it great story line Robert Downy performed the role\nexcellently. Cannot wait for the third one. You have to see it! It is\none of the best movies around. do not listen to the other reviewer\nbecause it is not a waste of money. Excellent work with the speed\ncamera. Loved the \"little hazel\" scene excellent ending but I wish\nIrene returns in the next one. Just putting dots in just to fulfil ten\nlined rules. ................ .....................\n..................... ................ ......................\n........................ ............................ ........\n.................. .............. ................ ..................\n......... ...........\n"
"\nI must agree i was really awed by the art-direction and near-perfect\ncostume design. It's really difficult to bring forth the life and\nculture that existed more than a century back.<br><br>The movie failed to meet every single expectation set by its prequel.\nSherlock Holmes, known for his wit and intelligence in deciphering\ncodes, codes that could unfold a mystery, is presented as a polar\nopposite of his original-self in this movie.<br><br>The Editing that forced all our jaws ajar in the prequel, has become\nnothing less than a bore. Too many plans of action makes the editing\nhackneyed. Hans Zimmer's reboot of the original tracks is the only\nbright facets of the movie, though the originals were comparatively\nbetter.<br><br>Guy Ritchie raised our hopes of experiencing a near-Doyle world in\nwhich Sherlock rescues the yesteryear England from the hands of\nMoriarty in the first part. But he failed miserably to meet those\nexpectations he set.<br><br>Guy Ritchie is capable of reviving the Sherlock Doyle envisaged in his\nnext part, if he ever plans to make it.\n"
"\nThe first \"Holmes\" was well made and hooked us into this travesty. I\nrealize that movie makers think that they have to cater to 14 year\nolds. We're many times that age and we don't need, fancy special\neffects to make the movie enjoyable. The first half was merely a video\ngame with the depth of a trout pond. The second actually came alive\nwith some real dialogue and even a dash of substance, like Die Forelle,\nclassical music which madmen have been happy to obsess about since\ntalkies came into being. Then the added Don Giovanni, beautifully\nstaged for more musical color. Not there is anything wrong with Hans\nZimmer's score. That was the highlight of this movie. To have such well\ntuned actors as Law and Downey acting more like Bugs Bunny and Mr Magoo\nthan the real talents they are is sad. And it will probably only get\nworse. Those of us who enjoy fine acting and a credible plot will\nsimply stop going, leaving the audience to an ever attenuating\nadolescence which is happy with lots of booms and little brilliant\ndialogue. Sad.\n"
"\nSherlock Holmes  A Game of Shadows  CATCH IT (A-) Guy Ritchi yet has\ndirected a finest Sherlock Holmes movie, which defiantly requires\nmultiple viewing. Though, the story is less complicated compare to the\nfirst Sherlock Holmes movie. <br><br>Robert Downey Jr. and Jude Law bromance is the highlight of the\nfranchise. Their awesome chemistry completely elevates the movie. Noomi\nRapace makes her Hollywood debut after critical and commercial\nphenomena Lisbeth Slander Aka. The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo. Noomi\nRapace did a decent job as gypsy magician but I think she is capable of\nmore greatness. Rachel McAdams makes an impressive cameo and reminds\nyet again why we all Love her.<br><br>Overall, Sherlock Holmes another impressive movie and cannot wait for\nSherlock Holmes 3. And in the end I must mention the Slow Motion\nsequence of Firing/Bombing in the woods will gives you Adrenaline Rush.\nSimply Amazing.\n"
"\nIf you love action movies with a touch of suspense, this film is the\none to see. We saw it twice, and would see it a dozen more times.<br><br>This one is far better than the first, and I hope they make a third.\nThe year is just beginning and this film should be one of the top of\nthe year.<br><br>The action scenes seem more crisp that the first one and less choppy.\nWe did not see this one in 3D the two times we saw it, but this film\nwill be worth waiting in line for at midnight to buy when it comes out\nto DVD.<br><br>Sherlock Holmes is brilliant with the witty humor. Watson is the\nbrilliant side kick on his witty come backs. The fast paced graphics\nstill could use a little more polish, but if there was a movie since\nAvatar I can say I was blown away on, it would be this one.\n"
"\nI have watched this movie 2 times, at the first one i've just focused\non the main subject, the second one was for the details on movie. it\nwas absolutely fantastic, i hope that the 3rd one will be on the way\nsoon! By the way, the subject choice was better than the first movie,\nbecause i can truly say that you will have 4 different mood while\nwatching it. Jude Law is also very successful at playing his role. If\nyou want to go a funny exciting journey with Sherlock, you should\nreally watch this movie, i bet you will understand what i meant :)\nHoping to see next comment will be alright, because i don't expect\nanyone who doesn't like Sherlock's interesting life :)\n"
"\nThe new Sherlock Holmes, which had huge boots to fill from the first\none had clearly stuck in my mind. Action, comedy, a little mystery, it\nwas just brilliant. It brought back the child in me. It had everything\nyou wanted in a film, romance, great fight scenes, a twisting plot and\na shocking end, big guns, witty lines, a great theme tune I couldn't\nstop humming after wards, this is the type of movies that should get\nfive stars. I liked Stephen Fry in the film, he was just superb as\nSherlock's older brother, Mycroft. People may complain that it is\nreally different from the Conan Doyle books and that the BBC series is\nbetter, Sherlock Holmes is probably in the top five best Sherlock\nHolmes movies of all time, maybe even number one.\n"
"\nWhile Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows (2011) is an enjoyable,\nthoroughly entertaining film, the characters of Holmes, Watson,\nMycroft, et al. are so completely bastardized as to be unrecognizable\nto those of us who are devoted to the adventures of the world's\ngreatest consulting detective. As was the case with the first Guy\nRitchie Holmes film, Robert Downey, Jr. is the most un-Sherlock-like\nSherlock Holmes since Peter Cook essayed the role in 1978's The Hound\nof the Baskervilles. Jude Law is slightly better as John Watson, M.D.,\nthough the difference is negligible. The most surprising performance of\nthe movie is Stephen Fry as Sherlock's elder brother Mycroft. Easily\nthe most unusual portrayal of Mycroft I've ever seen, the sight of\nFry's Mycroft wandering the house naked must surely have Sir Arthur\nConan Doyle, the creator of Sherlock Holmes, spinning in his grave.<br><br>This is a Holmes that not even Conan Doyle could recognize. Thank God\nthat we have the definitive Holmes, in the person of Jeremy Brett, with\nwhich to console ourselves.\n"
"\nWorth watching! I must say, I was waiting for its release with quite an\nanxiety but also with some fear, didn't want to be disappointed being a\nSherlock Holmes fun and all. However it was even better than the first\none. Robert D. Junior excels as Sherlock Holmes! Also the villain VERY\nconvincing! You know he will prove to be a worthy adversary from the\nfirst scene. Fast, adventurous, funny. A great story nicely put on the\nbig screen. Guy Ritchie has done it once again..anyone who's seen his\nmovies can see some of his touches in this one as well. Also the\nPicture/photography is excellent, dark taking you back in time. Overall\na great job. Will watch it again in the future.\n"
"\nThis was either going to be a complete success or a complete let down.\nThank god it was a success.<br><br>I wouldn't go as far as to say it was better than the first film but by\nno means was it poor. The first film set a very high standard as far as\nSherlock Holmes films goes and this one was almost back at that same\nlevel.<br><br>The acting, directing, cinematography, style and presentation are of\nthe highest caliber. The story is fun and entertaining but at the same\ntime clever and intriguing. Everything you would want really with the\nemphasis on ENTERTAINING.<br><br>I could easily watch this film again and can't wait to add this one to\nmy DVD collection when it becomes available.<br><br>If I had any criticism that I had to mention I would say there is\nprobably too much action to the point where the whole Sherlock punch\nups become slightly repetitive. Only a minor thing and I will let you\nmake your own mind up on that one.<br><br>If you haven't seen it yet what are you waiting for?????\n"
"\nWatching this one, you don't make any mistake. The flick contains a\ngreat story, great acting, great action, even above-average\nhand-to-hand combat, thanks to Downey's individual skills. You hear\ntruly superb dialogues that makes you listen and makes a piece like\nthis so worth- while. Thanks to the new concept, Sherlock Holmes has\nbecome an entertaining mix of wit and action speaking to all audiences.\nThank you Mr Downey. Rachel McAdams was kinda out of place even in the\nfirst movie, but that has been resolved in a way well fitting into the\nstory. (This is not a spoiler.) Costumes, backgrounds, inventions,\nnothing is missing or neglected. Looking forward to the third piece.\n"
"\nI went and saw this film with my family last Saturday, and we all loved\nit!<br><br>I would say that this film is definitely as good as the first, maybe\neven better! My mum fell asleep when she watched the first one at home,\nbut agree'd with me that she did like this one. It was very clever the\nway that Sherlock could see how to fight his enemies before they even\nattacked him, and how he would even notice the tiniest detail of a\ncrime scene. If you are going to see this film, look out at the last\npart of the film when Watson is writing a book about his and Sherlock's\nadventures, as he believes Sherlock to be dead, when actually he is sat\nin a chair just in front of Watson, disguised! It will stun you in the\nend how Sherlock defeats Moriarty, and you will be amazed at how he\nretrieves Moriarty's diary!<br><br>Overall very, very good!!!!!<br><br>There is also NO part/clip after the credits at the end of the film, as\nI stayed right until the very end!\n"
"\nLoved this sequel, and in some ways better than its predecessor...\nRobert Downey Jr. and Jude Law were both fantastic and Moriati was\nexpertly played by Jared Harris.<br><br>i also loved how they included the first modern weapons and\nartillery,this combined with the again riveting action scenes, the\ngenius of Holmes and the witty banter throughout the film makes for a\ngreat watch...<br><br>Great ending, loved the mind chess battle and the forest scene was just\nmind blowing!!!<br><br>really hope there will be a third\n"
"\nSHERLOCK HOLMES (a game of shadows): normally all the sequels fall\nshort of its ancestors ,,but believe me this movie is far great than\nthe first one.<br><br>sherlock holmes meets his exact rival as clever and cunning has himself\nand the story takes lots of twists and turns and a wild cat and mouse\nchase.<br><br>dr.watson is again been very helpful to the most wisest man and both of\nthese characters are played very nice by jude law and robert downy<br><br>the background music is simply awesome and especially camera work in\ncertain frames are simply mind blowing and you guys really get your jaw\ndropped by the climax i assure you\n"
"\nSherlock Holmes has always interested me. I saw the first Sherlock\nHolmes movie and I really enjoyed it. When I read that this movie was\ncoming out I was really pleased because I liked the first one. I'm sure\nyou already know the plot so I'm not going to summarize it but this\nmovie has a great plot and a twist at the end. The last few seconds of\nthe movie really made me excited. I can really see how this movie has a\npotential for another movie. At some points this movie can be kind of\nhard to understand but you can put the pieces together and understand\nthe plot. I also really like Professor Moriarty's character a lot. You\ncan tell that Watson and Holmes are really good friends by their humor\nand the hard times they give each other. I would suggest this movie to\nsomeone else.\n"
"\nSherlock Holmes(Robert Downey Jr), and Dr. Watson(Jude Law) are trying\nuncover a plot by Professor Moriarty(Jared Harris). But Moriarty is\njust as smart as Holmes. They both really try to out think each other,\nwhich becomes a mind game of cat and mouse, where one proves to be\nabout has clever as the other. Will Holmes and Watson be able too\noutwit Moriarty before it's too late? <br><br>Guy Ritchie does it again, with it's adventure, humor, and\nintriguingness. It became a fun ride for everybody. Robert Downey Jr is\ngood as Holmes, I think he had him down little better this time then he\ndid in the first, he seems more relaxed. Jude Law is also good as\nWatson, he and Downey play off each other perfectly.\n"
"\nThis is my first movie review. I liked this movie very much. Its much\nbetter than MI4:Ghost protocol. Even the action sequences-specially\nnear the arms-ammunition factory- are excellent. Kudos to the director. <br><br>The plot and the story may be normal, but the game played and the\ntwists take us into the movie. Its the best suspense-thriller movie i\nfaced in recent times. <br><br>Robert Downy Jr was excellent at his acting skills and the guy\nportraying Dr.Watson was also good but could have been better. Few\naction sequences were far from normality, but few are absolutely good.\nI don't know why people rate it low, but its good. I wanna watch it\nagain (if possible). Its worth my money.<br><br>I recommend it for the people who read Sherlock Holmes stories and like\nthe character and like the character as much as I. The story seems to\nhave been taken from the short story 'His last bow' of the Canon Doyle\nstories. I don't remember the exact short story. Its good and reached\nmy expectations.\n"
"\nWhat a bloody awesome movie is SHERLOCK HOLMES:A GAME OF\nSHADOWS.,.,.,.,,<br><br>the starting seemed to be slow but only after a while you would realize\nthat it is like loading of a gun, once the plot is the following\nsequences are like machine gun,.,.you cannot take your eyes away from\nthe screen for a moment or you won't know what you will miss. And I\nhaven't seen a better slow motion shooting than in this movie after\nSherlock &amp; Gang escape from the Gun Factory.,.it is one of the best of\nthis year,,the acting of Robert Downy Jr.,is well stupendous, Naomi\nRapace &amp; Jude Law have played their role very well. The comedy sequence\nare really hilarious, Watson's Wedding ,between Watson's wife &amp; Mycroft\nHolmes ,especially when Holmes throws Watson's wife from the train on\nher way to honeymoon,but the greatest triumph as always was the\ndirection of Guy Ritchie and the script,,,, it will blow you. Not to\nmention the climax scene,,,,,just waiting for Sherlock Holmes\n3..............It is Definitely a must watch.\n"
"\nI had really low expectations on this one. Sequels are rarely as good\nas their predecessor, and I had read a few negative early reviews.\nHaha. I'm glad I went and saw it for myself. Honestly, I loved this\nmovie.<br><br>It's a pretty fast-paced film; a nonstop thrill ride filled with\nmystery and intrigue. Downey and Law are great together, as always.\nTheir 'chemistry' is spot on, and they really feel like friends who\nhave experienced much together. Noomi Rapace is a great addition to the\ncast as well, and Jared Harris plays an excellent villain in Moriarty.<br><br>It's a really fun film as well; don't even get me started on the action\nsequences. They are thrilling and extremely well shot; the\ncinematography is beautiful. The forest sequence (if you see the film,\nyou'll not what I mean) is one of the most awesome action bits I've\nseen in a long while. It's crazy.<br><br>A really good sequel, that really goes above &amp; beyond the first. The\nending is killer, too. Perhaps the best bits of the film are the one on\none scenes with Holmes and Moriarty. It's poetic.\n"
"\nWe all knew this was coming with a setting up like the end of the last\nfilm. Sequels have been popping up more and more recently, they are a\nsure seller, but this one definitely lived it to it's first instalment.<br><br>Guy Richie's signature blue tint is back in force but didn't manage to\ndepress me, the comedy between Robert Downey Jnr. and Jude Law\ncertainly lightens the mood. The angles used for the chase turn a now\nnormal and possibly mundane scene into something new and raw, we move\nwith the punches as the camera swings around. Things that are so often\ntaken for granted in films such as establishing shots, are used\nperfectly so the only questions the audience is asking are the ones the\nstory has set up.<br><br>Stephen Fry as Mycroft Holmes is bloody marvellous, I'm not afraid to\nsay that he is quite simply perfect and the final fight scene is epic.\n"
"\nNot as bad-arse as the first one, but definitely keeps the same\nguy-ritchie'esque feel and swag to it throughout the movie. There were\ntimes when it drags, and one point where there's a naked dude walking\naround which I don't really quite understand how goes with the\nstory/characterdevelopment/plot/priceofcheeseinbangladesh, etc... At\nany rate, the additions were subtle from the first one, but it\ndefinitely laid the ground-work for future SHs movies to be made, which\nI for one am a fan for. I know this won't win any awards, and I'm sure\nit won't be as highly praised as this year's winner of the terribad\nartsy film, The Tree of Strife, but it'll win all kinda awards in my\nbook. <br><br>1) Film with the most BROmance - Winner 2) Film with the coolest\nrunning away from danger shot in slow-mo - Winner 3) Film with the best\ndialogue between good guy and bad dude - Winner <br><br>All in all, it's worth seeing but maybe not as good as MI:4.\n"
"\nYou know... sometimes when you watch a film... in the first few\nminutes, it is clear that the film is going to be special.<br><br>It doesn't have to be deeply significant, possessing social commentary.\nEvery genre has the potential to be 'done well'... and this film meets\nthose expectations.<br><br>Holmes: portrayed so many times... yet here we have another great\ninterpretation (along with his relationship with Watson), perfect for\nputting a smile on your face.<br><br>This time, perhaps a more realistic approach... no excessive\nconcentration on deduction, we see Holmes with all his weaknesses, but\noverall, a man of adventure. Perfectly matched to the gorgeously\novercast portrayal of Victorian London, yet sublimely mixed with\nexplosive action more typically associated with a Bond movie.<br><br>No obnoxious violence, sex, or swearing... no need for any of that.\nIt's just a great film for everybody in the family. Enjoy.\n"
"\nSir Arthur Conan Doyle is turning over in his grave over this trash.\nNothing but special effects, childish, no acting, no story line, the\nworst Holmes and Watson ever, , boring,dull, the lady was about as\nexciting as a heart attack and the forest scene was the worst ever,\nmycroft was a joke, the nude scene was so out of place it was not even\nfunny. I gave it a 1 only because it did not go lower. They should call\nthis movie 'Descent into F/X by some 8th grader playing on his\ncomputer. Many fine actors have played Holmes and Watson, these two\ngentleman may well be good actors, however, after viewing this pathetic\nexcuse I am sure that all who have gone before are turning over in\ntheir grave at warp speed over this, whatever it was...\n"
"\nI find that Sherlock Holmes:Game of shadows was an E.M.P.(Epic.Master.\nPerformance.).But I just feel that somehow they left something behind\nfrom the first one. WARNING, THE REST OF THE REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS!\nI'm not sure what it was. The movie had a great script,amazing actors,\nsuspenseful scenes, and plenty of twists(my favorite). The very end was\none of my most greater surprises from the movie. I think something that\nwas both a great and yet disappointing element, was when Sherlock takes\nsome time to plan and we get to see some thing that happens before it\nactually does.This is great because people might learn from this and\nit's great to see just how intelligent Sherlock is. But there is a\ntrade-off , people can get bored of spoilers and feel the time could\nhave been used for something else. The introduction of new characters\nwas a help to the overall plot an performance. But like I said, it\nstill feels like something's missing. I'm not sure what it is that\nkeeps me from giving 10 out of 10 stars\n"
"\nThis movie was worth every penny I spent on it. I watched it\nimmediately when it was released on the pre-premiere on the 16-th of\nDecember 2011. 2 hours and nine minutes just flew by. I couldn't\nbelieve it. But whatever. The plot was really well constructed and\nsituations intertwined really smoothly, with no rough, unnecessary\nscenes and plot deviations. The humour - very thin, light and naughty.\nFull of hilarious and in the same time horrifying deeds of Sherlock.\nThe characters fill their positions amazingly well. Actually this is\nthe second movie after The Devil's Rejects, which is actually better\nthen the First Part. I don't want to give details in order not to spoil\nit. Watch it - it's going to be worth your time and money!\n"
"\nWhat a great movie, kept me entertained. It was a smart, clever,\naction-packed, suspenseful film with unpredictable twists. Typical of\ncritics to give it low reviews, my advice to them, go back to your\nboring, crying, dramatic, senseless movies i.e. Young Adult and leave\nthese movies to us.<br><br>As a Film major it surprises me how many good films are badly reviewed.\nJust because the story doesn't have someone crying intensely or it's\nnot really realistic they give it a bad review. If I remember\ncorrectly, movies are made to \"entertain\" people, not bore them to\ndeath. Last week, we went to see Young Adult and I swear it was\nprobably the grayest most mind numbing movie I've seen this year.<br><br>What critics should start listening to is the audiences. Because\nwithout us, they would be out of a job. Funny how most critically\nacclaimed movies do so bad in the box office and the low reviewed ones\ndo so well. Might want to start paying attention to those numbers.\n"
"\nI have no idea why the meta critic score is so low! This film is\nexcellent! The fight scenes were well played out and the relationship\nbetween Holmes and Watson is portrayed by Downey and Law perfectly! I\nwould like to make a point that I have read all of the Sherlock Holmes\nshort stories and novels and was extremely entertained. I enjoyed all\nthe references and characters appearances from the short stories and\ntheir roles in the film. Also, the soundtrack for the film is\nunbelievable. They music keeps you immersed in the film! Hans Zimmer\nreally out did himself! If you're an avid reader of the Holmes novels\nand short stories, you will not be disappointed!\n"
"\nI give the movie a 3 because I like Downey and Law, but the plot is so\ngarbaged up with political and social agendas that I couldn't enjoy the\nmovie. Just more gay-ism being shoved on the public. Downey should\nrefuse to do another sequel unless another director takes over. Its\nobvious Guy (Gay) Ritchie, the director is using his movies to push his\ngay lifestyle agenda. I believe that the Sherlock Holmes franchise\ncould be like the Mission Impossible franchise, but instead of trying\nto put together good movies they use a good movie to push their social\nbeliefs on the rest of us. I say boycott Ritchie and the producers. It\nwas a waste of good acting. Downey is a great actor and should take his\ntalents elsewhere.\n"
"\nI shall not give away anything, except the fact that it was the best\nfilm of 2011.<br><br>With laugh out loud moments, welling up moments and 'edge of your seat\nmoments', Guy Ritchie has made one of the best films i have ever seen,\na brilliant sequel to the first one, if you watched the first one (and\neven if you didn't!) you should go and see this film. It has brilliant\nCGI effects and excellent actors. Robert Downey JR and Jude Law make an\nexcellent partnership, and i think that they are friends even off the\nscreen, as showed on the Graham Norton Show the other week. Elementary,\nmy dear friend.\n"
"\nI enjoyed the movie a lot and I rate it as one of the best movies of\nthe year. The lead actors Robert Downey Jr and Jude law are too good\nand the rapport between them is fantastic. The plot, dialogues, music\neverything is good about the movie. I am a great fan of the director\nGuy Ritchie and he lived upto my expectations. Especially the climax\nscenes between sherlock Holmes and Jared Harris are too good. In fact I\nloved this movie more than Sherlock Homes(2009). <br><br>On the flip side, I could have enjoyed more with normal action\nsequences instead of kung fu. If you enjoyed Sherlock Holmes(2009),\nthen you will definitely enjoy this movie more than 1st part.\n"
"\nWatched Sherlock Holmes: A Game Of Shadows Starring Robert Downey\nJr.(Iron Man) as Sherlock Holmes , Jude Law(Sky Captain) as Dr. John\nWatson, The Stunning Rachel McAdams(The Notebook) as Irene Adler ,\nEddie Marsan (Mission : Impossible III) as Inspector Lestrade, Noomi\nRapace(The Girl With Dragon Tattoo) as Madame Simza Heron, Keilly\nReilly(Pride &amp; Prejudice) as Mary Watson, Stephen Fry(V For Vendetta)\nas Mycroft Holmes and Jared Harris(Extraordinary Measures)as Prof.James\nMoriarty .I really enjoyed the first Sherlock Holmes but it was lacking\na villain Strong is good actor but he is by no means the ultimate\nbaddie; which Harris's Moriarty proved to be more than a Match for\nRDJ's Holmes which it was a Game Of Shadows the film was brilliant in\nthat aspect moves and counter moves it was a giant giant chess game\nplayed on a global scale. Amazing Music By Hans\nZimmer(Inception),Cinematography By Phillip Rousselot(Larry Crowne),\nCostume design By Jenny Beavan(Amazing Grace) and Direction By Guy\nRitchie(RockNRolla) Truly The Best Screen Adaption of Sherlock Holmes\n9/10\n"
"\nSherlock Holmes, in his second outing played by the Robert Downey Jr.\nwho like an old wine is getting better and better with time and his\nside kick played by charming Jude Law take on their fiercest adversary,\nProfessor Moriarty played creepily by Jared Harris. Guy Ritchie in his\nsecond outing, gets under the skin of Sherlock and his sinister world\nbetter than the first time and gives you the show of wit and action\nthat keeps you awed during the whole run time. Action scenes like one\nin the train and one in the jungle are done exceptionally well. The\nbromance between Sherlock and Dr. Watson holds the movie together\novershadowing all female characters what so ever. The story holds many\nsurprises and keeps you engaged till the end. I am going with fantastic\n8 out of 10 for Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows. If you liked first\none, this one is a bigger treat for eyes, ears, mind and heart.\n"
"\nThis Movie is good,but not Outstanding.Firstly,too many slow mo effects\nhave been used as some others have pointed out.Secondly,it lacks the\nmystery of he first one....it is more of an action movie.The visual\neffects were stylish though not quite used appropriately <br><br>However,the actor's performances were quite decent especially Robert\nDowney Jr.Seeing Sherlock struggle to stop Moriarty was quite\nsatisfying.There is some comedy though it occurs infrequently.The\ncharacters in the movie also have quite a bit of depth,especially\nMoriarty. I am still a bit peeved that Moriarty was portrayed more of a\nMafia Boss than a ruthless and cruel villain.<br><br>Overall,this is a decent but not groundbreaking film that focuses on\naction but not mystery as I had expected.Still,it could be\nbetter............significantly better.\n"
"\nMy Respects sent out to Guy Ritchie and British Television. This\noutstanding movie not only intrigued me to think while watching, it\ngave incredible visuals, crazy plot twists and flattering character\ndevelopment, did i forget Robert downey's insanely clever performance?\nThis movie stands out from a lot of 1800's based films, see in this\nmovie it doesn't show the 1800s as a boring depressive age, it shows a\nclever modernizing society that functions outside of the trouble. Plus\nyou could watch this movie not caring if it was in the year 3000 or\n2013! I think Guy chose the 1800's because it was just outside of the\nage of industrial revolution and it provides an environment where there\nare more possibilities within the plot, and more can be done under the\nradar so to speak. Also the original book series took place in the\n1800's anyway. Anyway overall i'd give this movie a 9/10\n"
"\nSherlock Holmes (Robert Downey Jr.) and trusted friend Dr Watson (Jude\nLaw) take on their arch-nemesis Professor Moriarty (Jared Harris) with\nthe help of Holmes' older brother Mycroft Holmes (Stephen Fry) and a\ngypsy named Simza (Noomi Rapace).<br><br>Director Guy Ritchie creates this sequel to his reboot franchise. This\ntime around Irene Adler (Rachel McAdams) has little screen time, but\nshe does drive the storyline. It is too bad she's not there because the\nchemistry between Irene and Sherlock jumps off the screen. The film\nfeels the absence terribly. Simza is no replacement. I am getting a\nlittle tired of the speed up/slo-mo FX action style. It doesn't make\nthe action any more dramatic. It just feels like Guy playing around and\nshowing off. Other than that, it's good watchable grand action\nadventure.\n"
"\nWhile the interactions between Holmes and Watson were classic Holmes;\nthe rest of the movie played more like James Bond or Jason Bourne. Very\ndisappointed. The inclusion of Mycroft was a nice plus, however, having\nhim naked seemed very much out of place. Nice to see Watson's wedding\nas it sets a foundation for a continuing story line. Moriarty and\nHolmes fighting at the falls was stolen directly from the Doyle, but in\nthis case it felt forced and out of context. Not nearly as solid as the\noriginal, I'm hopeful that any future movies in this series return to\nthe 'true' Sherlock Holmes roots.<br><br>Overall, very disappointed.\n"
"\nADHD, ADHD &amp; ADHD. This might be be a very nice movie to the recent\ngeneration, but a huge disappointment to the friends of Sir Arthur\nConan Doyle. <br><br>Lot's of action but non of the brilliant thoughts of Sir ACD. <br><br>Only action and non of the genius plots. The previous part was an OK\nexperience, but this was made on the terms of younger audience. <br><br>So if you're expecting some of the mind thrilling moves of the TRUE\nSherlock Holmes, please don't expect too much. It was OK to watch, but\nnot OK to enjoy.! <br><br>Please be drunk before watching, it surely helps...\n"
"\nI have to say that Sherlock Holmes: a Game of Shadows was absolutely\nterrific. It totally blew me away by how great it was.I went to see\nthis on a cold night back in January, not expecting much, but it ended\nup delivering. Robert Downey Jr. did an amazing job as Sherlock Holmes\nand the way that Jude Law as Watson participated in the plot made him\nnot seem like a sidekick but an equal.Jared Harris was brilliant as\nProfessor Moriarty. He is definitely my favorite movie antagonist ever.\nThis film is funny, the plot does not drag and it has lots of action\nand mystery. I love the first movie and this was just as good. This\nsequel definitely did not suffer the fate of most sequels. It is a\nrare, brilliant sequel that will leave you on the edge of your seat for\ntwo amazing hours. With brilliant cinematography, great acting, an\ninteresting plot, a great antagonist and wonderful music, this is my\nfavorite movie of all time along with the first movie. I will always\nfeel proud to have this movie in my DVD collection.\n"
"\nThat's where we are at with this movie, Rathbone, Brett, are the Holmes\nof old. Great actors, but now we have another strong group, in a well\ncrafted flick. It was entertaining throughout, which made up for the\nlittle glitches. I read Doyle as a child, everything in the library;\nbefore Los Angeles got over 6-7 TV channels. I also enjoyed the great\nRathbone flicks and all of the later productions, which were lacking\nuntil Brett on PBS. The first flick was choppy, but it was the fun in\nspots. They put in work and made this one a sweet ride. They even tied\nin the most famous scene of all times from the old classics. What I\nliked most is how they highlighted the social quirks, of Sherlock and\nMyCroft alike. This movie was the rebirth of Holmes. Great job. Who is\nthe best Holmes?\n"
"\nI watched sherlock Holmes 1 week ago.<br><br>Film was directed by Guy Riche, he is my one of favorite directer.<br><br>I read Sherlock Holmes books but this film has different vision.<br><br>Characters have very good acting.<br><br>Director used different slow motions techniques.<br><br>1894's England was very authentic.<br><br>Sherlock Holmes is very clever he sees every detail.<br><br>he is a good fighter and he thinks very fast he knows enemies' next\nmove Dr. Watson is his helper they solve every case together.<br><br>The forest scene is very fantastic. Oxygen mask used very cleverly.\n"
"\nThis movie is amazing.... and I would have given it a 10 rating only if\nit was the same movie without the Sherlock Holmes character I mean it\nis a great action movie but lacks the deduction parts of Sherlock\nHolmes I mean if you counted them in this movie they will be less than\n4 or 5 deductions. And I didn't expect that from a Holmes movie. So, I\nrated it 8 because it is really good: full of chases and actions and\nfights. Of course, I recommend watching it but I still insist on my\nopinion that this shouldn't be a Holmes movie. The first part of this\nmovie was a far exciting than this one because the deductions were many\nand amusing. But the effort done in this one is pretty good too.\n"
"\nIn order to enjoy this film, you have to stop comparing Downey Jr.'s\nHolmes to any other interpretation of the character you may have\nencountered. If you take him as a stand-alone character, completely\ndisregard any other interpretation of Sherlock Holmes - including that\nof the books - then you have a fun, action-packed movie that's\nguaranteed to entertain. <br><br>I personally enjoyed \"A Game of Shadows\", more so than the first film,\nand even laughed out loud on occasion. If you walk into this film\nexpecting to be blown away by a complex plot, then you are sure to be\ndisappointed. Instead, accept it for what it is - a fun movie with\nenjoyable action sequences and Robert Downey Jr. doing what he does\nbest...with a questionable British accent.\n"
