worst 3 hours of my life it got to the end and i was still waiting for something to happen
i would of had a more productive time watching grass grow
dont waste your time watching this film
i dont see the point in the film or what it was trying to achieve
it went through a boys life that had no real significant moments in it
the most outrageous thing he did was smoke a cigarette at 15
it was basically a film of a kids life that would not effect or inspire anybody
he was a pessimist with no real goals in life he didnt go through any dramatic transformations or offer anything to the world he didnt achieve much it was a pointless film
it was like the film was made to actually be as bad boring and ordinary as possible not one part of the film was embellished or interesting
to sum it up an awful film
they spent 12 years filming but no actual thought on the plot or ending
afters 2 hours i finally realized this movie was never gonna get to a point or climax
and it ended with nothing
if you want to watch just to see the actors age and their acting improve then yes watch
but dont watch if you need a story your not gonna get one here
it was basically a movie about a family no happy ending no lessens learned just life how it goes super boring and slow
i think the producers could have given it an ending or a meaning of something or the kid learn a lesson or anything
but that didnt happen it just ended
i went to this movie expecting an incredible masterpiece as advertised
on a saturday afternoon there were about 25 people there
i was so very disappointed
this movie went on and on and on
so much so that i continued to look at my watch wondering when this movie would end
would it ever end
and then it kept going
while the idea of filming over a 12 year time frame is unique and very clever the film just needs major editing
its the story of a boy growing up
there was abuse which was painful to watch but basically the film was just too slow paced and boring
it goes on for almost 3 hours so take a meal with you if you decide to go despite these alerts
it is just slow long and boring
i seriously considered just getting up and leaving and asking for my money back
i wasnt sure if everyone was in the same pain i was but i also considered standing up and yelling when will this film ever end
this was the worst movie ive ever seen truly
expecting an interesting insightful chronicle instead you get a warped concept and a painfully dysfunctional family
the pace was slow uninteresting and unreal
it was like listening to a college student perpetually asking what is the meaning of life instead of moving ahead in life
since it was also difficult to identify with any of the characters the viewer is left on the outside listening to someone boringly philosophize their view of life
my wife and i went to see it because of the extremely high rating but instead were imprisoned in a far too long film
perhaps critics ignored the trite story and awarded the successful unique achievement of filming the same person over twelve years
ethan hawke was outstanding as usual and it was nice to see patricia arquette of medium fame again
otherwise save your money and especially your time
i usually dont comment on movies i didnt like but after seeing the rating of this movie i couldnt stop myself
the only interesting thing about this movie is that it was shot over 12 years
considering that the whole movie was shot on 45 days they filmed about 4 days each year
that alone tells you a lot about this movie
the director didnt do anything special
and the story is boring
nothing happens
movies are supposed to give the audience some kind of emotions
to feel sad excited to be scared or to laugh
none of that happens
this movie is a total waste of time
take a look out of your window and watch birds fly or people walk by is more exciting believe me
i wouldnt even give this movie 1 star but there is nothing less available
i do not understand any of the good reviews of this movie
i think that its hook is the gimmick of the kids growing up in it
but there is nothing redeeming or even entertaining about this movie
it was terrible
the story bordered on depressing
the trailer leads one to believe that this is a documentary of a childs life but it is not
there are actors in it
it was awful just awful and i do hope it will not end up winning an oscar
surely someone could do a coming of age movie better or a documentary set over 12 years better
i wish i could understand what the reasoning behind the good reviews i watched the movie and i just cannot see it
real life well yes for this boring persons and heroes of this movie
life is here that is for sure but life that really should not be meant for anybody as you can see that heroes of the movie are bored with their every day life and if that was intention than they really nailed it but then again why watch it what is the purpose in making movie about completely regular life of one functional but boring family
at the end of the movie i started to value my time only because i lost three hours spending time with this people while i could have spent it on my people and again if this was purpose of the movie then again great job as i am going with my family now and we will have some joy and happiness so totally opposite then this and who nows maybe we will record things on video from now on and we will maybe make more enjoying life movie with heroes getting older and with no budget at all
i wonder
i usually dont write these reviews but i am so antiinspired and this way would like to warn people if you dont like first 10 mins everything later will be even worse
i thought that skyline is worst movie ever but after watching this one i am really not sure
the plot doesnt lead anywhere
almost all characters have horrible personalities they are absolutely stupid and not capable to to lead their lives
scenes are lasting too long and for many i find no reason of including them to the movie
the movie lasts too long and it is so frustrating and irritating that after watching it you realised it was total waste of time
just dont make the same mistake
looking the reviews i thought it was worth a watch
the 1st hour was not too bad  highlights of the usual family problems in american culture etc  but the other 2 hrs was really disappointing
while the timeline of actors and culture serves to make this movie somewhat unique there wasnt much of a plot other than this is what its like in real life in which case it would be a documentary but it was not
there was a good introduction in the 1st hour
i was still waiting to anticipate how the plot would go but not much buildup no climax and no resolution
pretty disappointing to what i thought might be a good story
i checked the spoiler box just in case but nothing happens nothing to spoil huge waste of time
everyone is allowed to formulate their own opinion about movies but i would highly recommend to stay away from boyhood this movie is terrible
it is filmed over a twelve year period yes twelve same actors and actresses
the movie is 2 hours 46 minutes long and we had to turn it off at 2 hours2 hours of my life i will never get back
i love all kinds of movies action adventure drama comedy even a chick flick now and then but this movie went nowhere did nothing and ended up like every other person in life
see it for yourself but you have been warned
cant figure out how its up for 6 award nominations other than the artsy fartsy crowd loves this kind of crap
the only thing interesting about this movie is the fact that there was a serious commitment in peoples time to film it over 12 years
i did enjoy watching the main characters developgrow over 12 years but the movie as whole was boring and uneventful
the story didnt impart any profound life lessons or anything else that could be gained from my investment of three hours in front of a television
i kept waiting for some big climax in the story to take place to redeem the whole thing but it never happened
im not real sure why this movie has such high ratings
makes me wonder about the views who think this was actually a good piece of work
seriously save your time and watch something else
this movie was boring at best
this was the most boring movie i have watched for some time
i even registered with imdb just to say i want my 3 hrs back
i can appreciate the time it took to make and the places it was shot but thats it nothing happens
honestly after the first 15 mins i was saying something will happen soon
after 2
5 hrs i was just watching out of spite to see if something would happen at the end
no nothing
i think that the main actor lacks substance too it was as if he almost wanted to be there but not quite
i was waiting for him to loose his temper and do something anything
but again nothing he just kept plodding along and mumbling away
i personally think that during the 12 years someone lost the script
this movie was very boring pointless and an unfortunate waste of my time
i hate to say this but the drunk stepfather was probably the most exciting part of this whole movie disaster
it made no sense and there were way too many loose ends
if i could give this movie a 0 then i would because i feel that 1 is way too generous
i feel like that 8
3 rating should be on a scale of 100
the premise of a 12 year project unfolding before your eyes just sounds absolutely mind blowing
im very disappointed that there wasnt more done with this movie
it had so much more potential to be more than it was but it just never took off
i would not recommend this movie to my worst enemy
this movie is not even close of what i was expecting it to be
nothing really happens in the whole movie
i mean come on is this even real life
everything was so quiet and simple
no interesting plot no interesting characters
9 years for a complete failure on my opinion
the idea was great and it could have been a hell of a story but it was just a waste of time
it isnt even a drama nothing dramatic happens at all
i dont know what people saw in it and rated it with almost 9 stars
it surely does not worth to watch it at the cinema
if you want to watch something the time before bed its perfect cause all it can make you is to become sleepy
the most stupid film ive ever seen
surely the day ill be sick i know ill regret the precious hours ive spent watching this movie so now i feel ive the duty to advise other imdb people not to lose their life this way  michelangelo created the sistine chapel in 4 years and then 12 years to assemble this thing
could have written a better screenplay and chosen better settings in 12 years of work
the characters are hatefulaside from the hispanic plumber especially the young protagonist one of those guys that feel special an unappreciated snowflake even if its just a moronic adolescent
there is not a single dialog not a single scene that make your neurons bump its just a tedious and endless movie in which nothing happens
i was looking forward to seeing this film but the points i would give it is nothing out of 10
everything about it is remarkable in its awfulness
writing acting absolutely unconvincing and you knew what they were going to say before they said it
i hope that is not the american way of life because its unreal
the word they use throughout the film is awesome and whenever even the tiniest thing like batting a baseball ended up with the high five
i would have been better off weeding the gardens and growing swede it would have given me a great deal more pleasure
it is a film i wouldnt say is a turkey but a massive pork pie with plenty of jelly even that sounds quite nice
i am always thoughtful about films i love films and the film that leaves the memory lingering is jet boy a remarkable canadian film i would give that 8
510
if anybody wants to waste their time in totality get this film for a10 remember you have been warned
i put the film straight in the fire
just rented this from itunes today and watched it awhile ago
when ethan hawke asks whats the point
near the end of the movie i yelled exactly
i think it was a neat idea of a movie but so darn boring i just wanted it to end
there was some good acting but i could not relate to any of these people
i think the photography of the movie was good
i felt like i wasted 3 hours of my life ill never get back
i know the critics have loved this movie but i think its just because the director had such a novel idea to film the same actors over a 12 year period
im trying to come up with something more positive to add but just cant
my advice is go see an interesting movie because this one is not
before watching this movie i wasnt sure if the plot would interest me since the movie seemed to be just about an ordinary kids life and the only interesting thing about the movie seemed to be the fact that it was made over 12 years and followed the actual aging process of the actors
after seeing the movie i realized that i was completely wrong
boyhood is more an experience than just some other conventional movie
seeing the protagonist and his family growing up and changing constantly during the movie makes the viewer think about family life in all its aspects and when at the end mason leaves his home dem feels kick in
the fact that the movie itself was written over 12 years also brings something special to the movie
seriously the only thing epic about this film was its length
it literally dragged on and on
there was nothing groundbreaking about the technology or story patrica arquette and ethan hawke gave very good performances but then again theyre very good actors
there is nothing new here i was shocked as i invested hour after hour of my life watching something that never really went anywhere just telling a story of the life of pretty much every other person living in america in the 21st century
do not get me wrong i am not one of the antiboyhood critics and i certainly didnt think the film was boring i just i expected more after reading rave review after rave review
i understand the critics who value this film its 12 year scope is innovative and i appreciate the intense reality of an average boys journey through a fairly unremarkable life
yet that for me is the problem
my enjoyment of movies derives from their creative and imaginative storytelling
im engaged by a good tale using form to encapsulate the plotdriven action
in addition the characters need to be either extraordinary in an ordinary world or ordinary in extraordinary circumstancesor both
in boyhood everything and everyone is just excruciatingly ordinary and there is no particular story except insofar as we follow a normal young man through his normal life
i know some people are captivated by such filmmaking but im not i felt bored and distracted
boyhood didnt generate enough interest in the characters or their lives for me to care
quite frankly my life has been much more interesting so sitting through someone elses plodding memories left me unimpressed
this has to be one of the most tedious films i have ever watched which i think may have been the point
the idea is good following the same charactersactors over 12 years
also the acting of patricia arquette and ethan hawke is extraordinary in their portrayal of ordinary people and the reason i rate this with 2 stars one each
but thats all i can see thats good in this film
the son mason is oversensitive and lazy
the daughter amanda is sulky and selfish although her character is underdeveloped
the biggest issue i have with this film is nothing happens
at all
alright so a lot of the life is about the mundane and the boring but i cannot imagine anything more dull than watching someone elses everyday life
like big brother following the same people for 12 years
boyhood needed something of interest to happen to reward the audience who invested over 2 and a half hours and some money in watching it
the best films are ones that have an effect on the viewer afterwards
the only effect this had in me was to bore me
it was am opportunity missed
i have seen birdemic birdemic 2 the room sharknado and etcetera but none of them come remotely close to this terrible film
the aforementioned are at least comical in their terribleness
boyhood is neither funny nor inspiring or anything positive for that matter
halfway through the film i felt myself wishing that ellar coltrane had died in a tragic car accident or something of the sort just to prevent this film from ever being produced
the concept for the film is splendid and one of a kind
unfortunately nothing else was remotely interesting
please save yourself 3 hours and do something else
eat some dirt lick a bee smack your arm with a sledgehammer repeatedly for 2 and a half hours to give yourself half an hour to spare
anything and i mean anything is better than this film
i got little out of this movie
all characters at least the adults were narcissistic and selfish which i realize is all too typical of americans these days but still who wants to watch a movie about them
movies are for escape not for watching what you can see around you every day
i didnt like anyone in the movie and i felt sorry for the poor kids who had to grow up in a badly broken family broken multiple times
im sure this happens all the time but why would i want to watch a movie about it
depressing
i kinda wanted to slit my wrists after it was over
i surely wanted the three hours of my life back that i spent watching it
what was seinfeld about
nothing but it was so cleverly written and casted it was classic
what was boyhood about
nothing and it was so stupidly written so boring so annoying
it was close to three hours of complete visual and acoustical torture
its actually up for oscars
the fix is in folks
all its about is a time sequence study of the same people for more than a decade
as they age the movie gets lousier until ones bladder tells you the large container of soda is having a greater effect on you than is the picture hence the rest room becomes a part of an escape from the garbage being shown to a lot of suckers like me
no kidding all this picture is worth is an extended visit to the throne room
the fact that this awful travesty of cinematography is so highly rated just lowered my opinion of humanity
its downright boring and about as original as a rocky sequel or a disney princess cartoon
watching the characters in this film grow through adolescence was painful and i terminated the movie with extreme prejudice after a little over an hour
thanks richard linklater for showing us what 95 of american boys experienced either directly or indirectly while growing up in the 90s
you managed to create a movie that made my formative years seem boring tedious and frighteningly more deserving of an oprah episode than the espn 2 stuntman series i was hoping for
i fell asleep no less than five time during this flick and thats a very conservative number
i guess i just cannot relate to this kid
there were only a few moments that touched me
all the rest was boring
after watching this movie i dont have any feelings  no desire to be better to get the best of life no gloomy thoughts on life
so for me the movie seemed pointless
although i can see how for many people it would be their real life
i guess just not my case
so if you want to see a quick recap of a boring and tough life of a kid growing up then you should see that movie
but theres not even ups and downs of his life  it just kinda flows its ways and thats it
and the ending
well i guess it leaves you a way to decide for yourself what the ending will be
i would say that i appreciated the effort in filming a movie over the course of 12 years but it actually didnt seem like much effort was taken to create a seamless movie
sometimes the kids hardly change in appearance and the movie just jumps to another storyline without ever resolving the conflict from the last scene and youre left wondering what the heck just happened
other times the kids have obviously had a growth spurt and youre stunned because they just shot up 6 inches from one scene to the next  again with no real resolution from the last storyline
often times people talk about story arcs well this movie has 12 beginnings to arcs with no real climax or resolution  with the possible exception of minor storyline involving a worker at a restaurant
in summary this movie is comprised of 12 loosely coupled scenes being passed around as a movie
you have more continuity watching 12 episodes of seinfeld than you do with this movie
i really wanted to like the movie because i want more films that try to be different  but this just wasnt my cup of tea
34 boyhood a realistic story of the simple and subtle tragedies and joys of childhood and young adulthood without any perspectives on such things
cinematographically frank and unfortunately disparate the tales sporadic thematic grasp did not quite live up to the scope of its production and ended up being more of a nostalgic tribute to the last fifteen years than an actually cohesive gripping story or commentary on them
this film had the balancing act of being relatable and deep emotional storytelling and frequently shot at spots that missed both marks
but above all the innovative style of literally watching the characters grow up gives this film not only visual but historical significance
the juvenile point of this film is summed up poorly in the awkward choppy delivery of two teenagers the audience cares little about
sorry i wasnt impressed
the only thing that was interesting about this film was his aging knowing it was real
the story line was slow labored and boring
at times to attempted to be political
making references to various liked and disliked politicians mostly in a derogatory form
i judge movies on how they make you think or feel
the good ones linger and leave you reliving the story or imagining it differently
this movie only made me think about how much time i just wasted
i found nothing redeeming or valuable in the jumping around
when it was at the end all i could think is great now i can get on with the rest of my day
the 12 years lifejourney shooting is a good concept just dropped into a very disappointing movie
i pretty much agree with everything thats being said here no plot and therefore no dramatic tensions nor dynamics
i understand its suppose to be real life but honestly most of our lives have much more twists or fun at the age of 18
the performance of this coltrane kid is so apathetic and inexpressive that makes it impossible to relate with the main character
he even physically resembles to hayden christiansen and his acting skills are equally non existent
editing is bad as well with characters and situations coming out of nowhere and disapearing all of a sudden nonsensly just like that did i mention no plot
oh yes
just four stars mainly for the idea terribly executed and for arquettes effort which is rather good but not oscar winning material anyway
ok this is one unique movie  making it trough 12 real years with same team  and that is why people will say how great it is
but really it is not
it has nothing but that 12 years making fact
almost three hours about a superboring retardish boy growing
sooo boring
i can watch almost everything and i did
but this is too much
imagine everyone of us making a movie in episodes trough 12 years
just cutting clips and putting them in one 3hours movie
separate parents a bit of drinking problems first school loves
and all so shallow
just showing moreless normal kidos life
any awards this movie will get is only because 12yearsmaking of it
but it is so boring that it doesnt deserve any
big disappointment
really watching a tide for three hours is more exciting than this movie
i gave 2 stars  one for original idea of making it and one for my favorites ethan hawke and patricia arquette
such a boring movie like watching paint dry
if i remove the gimmick that was used all that remains is a boring snooze fest the story was nothing extraordinary to offer just follows a life and a not very interesting one i add
the actors are very good but that does not a good movie make
i feel like ive been conned
i knew i should like it everybody else does but i couldnt
i know my review does not have much content but neither does the movie so theres not much i can do there
stay clear and lets hope movies stop creating gimmicks when there is no creative power behind the projects
if they used 5 or 6 different kids this movie had a 5 imdb rating and would never be considered for awards
i guess people like to be conned
not me
stay way
i watched boy hood the other day and all i can say is that to me its the most overrated film i have seen yet
a 3 hour film with barely a story line no thank you
all i can say is that the only reason critics gave this a whopping 100 review is that the critics were too in love with the fact that the production filmed this film for 12 years using the same people
yes the idea of seeing a person grow up from a child to a young adult in 3 hours is a good idea but i would like to see some what of a story line
in my opinion the life of the childs mother was far more enjoyable and exciting than the boy that the actual film was based on
sorry but im giving it a 410 and thats being generous
i love linklaters movies but this one was one long boring drivel about a brooding boy who sleepwalks through life and mumbles some philosophical musings while you almost nod off to sleep
there isnt a plot or a storyline or even a script
nothing really happens in the entire 3 hours
save for the wow factor that this movie was indeed shot over a period of 12 years and you can see the main character actually age on screen there is nothing in this movie that deserves an oscar nomination
it is just a pretentious self indulgent film with some nice soundtrack thrown in
i love patricia arquette though
shes good in it and you can see that she didnt get paid much to do her role
you can see the pain in her eyes for having gotten suckered into this project for 12 long years for no money
i hope she wins an oscar
it was ok but there really wasnt a storyline
i mean i understand that it is about him growing up but it just seemed like it kept going and it really never ended
the ending was pretty bad also
what happens after that
what happens with his sister or mother or anyone
maybe they turn out fine maybe not no one will ever know
not only that but it seems like it wasnt really the most intriguing movie ever
i was kinda into it at the beginning but as it went on it kinda just dragged and slowed down
then to top it all off it seems like the scenes never really finish without going into them 20 years later
of course that is an exaggeration but i never know whether it is the same problem as before or a new one until the scene is almost over
maybe this is just not my type of movie but i have seen plenty and go into them open minded
i never just pick one genre
maybe they could have elaborated on some problems more
like what happened to the step kids
they probably should have added a little more to some parts and left out others
great idea
poorly executed
screenplay dominated by factual biography
minimal external contextual references
few glimpses on internal struggles doubts nuances of choice
no cinematography
this could have been a good reality show
belongs there
no reason for 2
4 hours
there is no substance outside the historical sequence of events
ver similar transitions to slacker and waking life main character posses a pervasive equidistant phlegmatic stance
hard to digest some of the clichas when describing political preferences social classes
some moments of embarrassment also when characters seem replicas of tabloids
the most disappointing film ever
terrible
not original whatsoever
its just sad
so sad
so overrated
doesnt contain a coherent plot so much as a chronological sequence of loosely connected vignettes
theres no thread tying it all together no central conflict animating the characters
people talking that took 12 years to make people walking that took 12 years to make people running that took 12 years to make people laughing that took 12 years to make people crying that took 12 years to make theres no interesting stuff to be said about this film at all
it literally has no other reason to exist
it just follows the regular boring life of a regular jackoff kid as he grows up into a regular nerd teen
nothing special or dramatic happens its just a regular boring kids childhood
the movie is given so much love and praise because it took 12 years to make
how impressive that they were able to keep calling back the same actors over 12 years
i oh
incase you dont know boyhood is a movie that took 12 years to make
its also a boring piece of turd
i did rent this on br and watched it over several days so i realize that is not the ideal viewing experience
still i was looking forward to this and was disappointed
i have seen previously two of the before
series by the director and found them to be charming
but what works in a constrained time frame did not work for me in this coming of age story
the story is routine and meandering like much of life but i prefer a more artful rendering
the 12 years of filming sounds so audacious but is actually just a stunt
so i was not engaged with the characters or the plot
i normally check out the features on a br but skipped them for this film
one of the worst movies i have ever seen
bad acting terrible script no plot too long
cheesy afterschool special scenes with clicha one dimensional characters
the lovable loser dad
the single mom who has to pull herself up by the bootstraps
the ahole abusive 2nd husband
what a joke
and dont get me started about the kid
i dont give a rats ass about the boring brat
negative stars
one of the most boring movies i have ever watched
i mean whats the point of this
it made me angry that i wasted nearly 3 hours on this crap
according to me its rating on imdb should be between 5 to 6
it seems to be a trend that wellformed characters are lauded as excellent movies when in reality it takes more than characters to make a story that works
boyhood spans 12 years and has vivid characters yet its hard to nail down what the movie is about
what is the conflict
what is the issue that must be resolved
lack of conflict is no minor thing
it gives framework to a film and the viewer something for which to cheer
i never felt i had an outcome for which to cheer
i was not deeply moved
my heart was not touched
my suggestion dont watch this movie
thanks
i have no clue what i have just watched this has to be the most pointless and forgettable movies of the year
yes i get what the selling point of the movie is it was a coming of age movie that followed a boy into adolescence over the span of 8 years
yes this is novel and a producers deserve praise on this front
but there was literally no storyline
dont be worried about spoilers either because there are bloody none
if this is the storylines we make movies of these days then i might as well just film myself over the span of a day going to work star bucks and then returning home
but who the hell would want to watch such an uncompelling boring movie
well apparently the hipsters who gave this an undeserving 810
the movie is beautifully shot and to see this boy grow old in front of us is incredible yet what is an amazing starting point for a movie project falls short as theres simply no plot to the movie other than this
the story of this boy is extremely conventional despite the will of the director to bring some drama to it via the complicated relationship between the parents
so in the end it feels like a attempt to appeal on everyones nostalgia showing memories most of us white middleclass people share and objects from the past we all cared for like a gameboy etc
i actually couldnt go through the whole movie as i was bored to death and quickly understood that the prowess of seeing this boy grow old on camera was the only interesting fact of the movie
245mins ill never get back
dont bother starts off a bit slow then slows to a crawl for the rest of it
then at the end having waited for something to happen it didnt
imdb say you have to write 10 lines for a review sorry but this not possible as the film is just not exciting enough
dont really know what else to say except if you value your own time then give this one a miss it ma seem a little harsh but thats my view
the concept of the film being done over the actors and actresses lives is very good but sorry the concept is sadly better than the film
sorry to witter on but i have to fill the review box with more dribble as i have not yet got to the correct amount of lines
looks like i have now
i tried to watch all the films nominated for the 2015 oscar awards best picture
if im not mistaken this film was the 1st exit of all  not caught my attention and did not look up to know the nomination
this was the last of the 8 i looked and i really do not like it one little bit
it do not generate me anything is a film that spends waiting to happen something central and resounding and yet nothing happens
jumps in time although they are not marked are almost always immediately recognizable
moreover the center love swings experienced by the mother that the child passage teenager
im always a little influenced by the scores see on imdb and i think thats the reason why not abandoned by half
however they are not all bad news
is to recognize the fact that it was filmed over several years 12 if i am not mistaken  and increasing age of the characters is clearly noted
sorry if i had some english mistakes
i have seen richard linklaters movies before and i have to say i love his work
specially the movies like waking life and before trilogy are amazing
now when it comes to this movie i see this movie as an attempt to put some kids ordinary life on the big screen
and i am being honest this boys life is ordinary
and why this movie got so many good ratings
its because people found it different as it took them 12 years because of the same crappy castokay the cast is good but storyline is sh
t and then there are some lowlife clicha philosophical talks and drunk people
i mean if you want philosophical crap then watch waking lifeit is far better
i dont understand the intent of this movie
people dont wanna see something they see everydaythis kid as he grows up like all other american kidswho wants to see that
well directed
yeah kind of
but still stupid
i am being kind by giving this 5
hope richard linklater does better in his next movie
