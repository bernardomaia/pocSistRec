great cast
great acting
however the entire film feels like the beginning to a movie
you keep telling yourself wow the intro was long now the movies really starting
oh nevermind
spoilers the entire goal of the protagonist is to acquire more of his regimented medicine
the goal of his enemies is to kill him
there is no trying to get back at the cia no typical bourne stuff
the bourne series was unnecessarily reused and they really should have just started off fresher
scenes were drawn out there were only about 2 clever plays made and the main enemy never meets the prot
its all very separated and remote
no connections are formed and we are not given the hope that he seeks to solve the issues at hand
they also completely write off bourne
wouldnt he know pamela gets framed and that the overhead is still controlling black ops groups
a lot of things were not well thought out for this movie and it was entertaining but disappointing
thanks to the 2 heroes i give a good mark though the script was a labyrinth of complications between different us national security services and their different projects more or less secret some of them more secret within secrets because untellable unacceptable
and when one of those has to disappear lots of dead people it means
here is the story of another runforhislife hero jeremy renner
he surprised me this actor
he blows the screen from his very first appearance until the last
and mrs weisz the corunnerforherlife does well too as an evolving character a woman scientist who goes from naive close to stupid terrified victim to a full grown resilient survivor doing very well with mr renner
wow they are good
they save the movie lets hope there will be a sequel with these two but with a much improved script please
i declare myself a fan for mr renner please forgive my probably curious use of english my second language
i had dragged my feet on seeing this film due to lukewarm reviews but i was pleasantly surprised
the bourne legacy is much better than the previous installment in the series although diehard fans might be disappointed over the absence of matt damon and the relegation of supporting characters played by david strathairn and joan allen and others to mere cameo appearances
however the principal performers in this film jeremy renner rachel weisz and edward norton infuse the franchise with a welcome rush of new energy and considerable onscreen charisma
the locations look great and the action sequences are genuinely exciting and impressive
the film begins somewhat slowly but this results in a degree of characterization that helps us invest in the wellbeing of the hero and heroine and the pace definitely picks up in the second half
the openended nature of the conclusion seems designed as a brief pause before a sequel while the lack of narrative closure will be frustrating for some viewers i can hardly wait to see more of these characters from these filmmakers
i have watched about 20 movies in 2012 this one is the best so far
many negative comments were posted mostly from the fans of bourne movies however i did not watch any bourne movies because i did not like their movie trailers
so i can express my opinion without any prior attachment
this movie trailer though was surprisingly right on the money
it has great actors great ideas and great script it has action love and suspense
i can not understand why the score of this movie is less than the score of prometheus
this movie is a lot better than total recall 2012 expendables 2 avengers amazing spider man men in black 3 etc
i did not see any of the bourne movies prior to going into the theater and therefore did not know what to expect
but decided to give it a chance since one of my favorite actresses rachel weisz was among the casting
i was impressed
i loved the action the heart pounding chase scenes the great story line of wanting to break free and develop a mind of your own kind of thing
after finishing this film i couldnt wait to get home and see the previous bourne movies and now have become a fan of the entire franchise
i thought the movie delivered from the dialogue to the action absolutely loved it

the lengths a man would go to get his drugs
movie started out great similar to the original bourne trilogy
good action and chase scenes
casting of jeremy renner and rachel weisz were spot on
im a fan of rachel weisz and plan on watching most of her films
only gripe i have with this film is the storyline
renners character aaron cross wants to stay alive and tracks down weisz just to save his own behind
but he doesnt want to just live he wants to live with all of his enhancements by way of his medications
its best explained with the backstory of aaron cross
before the supersoldier outcome program he had an iq of like 5 and as a result of the program and the medication he takes his iq is significantly better
he runs out of his medication while hes out in the field training and to prevent himself from becoming stupid again he goes to great lengths to track down more meds
in the process he saves weisz life
the end
great story
good action flick for my dad who doesnt really understand complex plot lines and enjoys pure action
let us just start with the fact that you cant compare it with the bourne trilogy
i know that most of jason bourne fans got disappointed when matt damon said that he wont be a part of what you may call the fourth installment of the franchises
you may have easily noticed that aaron crossjeremy renner has this common factor with jason bournematt damon an agent vs an agency but the story takes different turn here and just to be direct and clear i watched the entire bourne trilogy and comparing this story with bournes story doesnt do any favor for this movie
jeremy renner does a very good job also rachel weisz great potentials and they did what it take to make the bourne legacy a good movie
as for the writing it didnt meet my expectations as i thought the writers will put as much effort as they can to make this movie a hit with the consideration that it didnt have the original cast
all i can say that its not as bad as some people claim
the bourne legacy was a good movie and i liked it
bourne series is all about one guy matt damon
nevertheless jeremy renner is another bad ass and i understand they got a different story line in here
i got excited watching this film cos the chasing scenes was shot in my beloved countrypinas
i like the concept of getting aaron and the doctor survived in this movie
i think bourne ultimatum is the last series but they tried to expand the series so there what happens the legacy
much more different now especially the cast but almost the same story line
chasing everywhere and in the end they wont be able to catch simply because it is a bourne movie
still a great movie but bourne is always matt damon
cheers to the great actors it did make the film a little interesting to watch even your not a bourne fan
the bourne legacy is an action film with a difference of a normal single fault which has three great action film part of a series from the fact that the signature
the audience from time to time with unnecessary dialogs occasionally suffocates the movie manages to experience the exciting times
however the rest of the series as the affectation of his own films this fourth ring greengrass and damon would be lying if i said i did not call damon
matt pair candlesticks action fiction everything was superb but at least a few on the stage bourne could see
film to considering separately not bad but using the name of the bourne so i tried to make a premium compared
bourne them hit the bottom of the trilogy as well as the action is also a fantastic part of the screenplay and acting only a certain portion of the film and gave most of the action sequences in the first three films
ive seen it say its not a search of dejavu but different players really watched
beautiful bored in a movie that will be followed
end of film is a little more fuller but still not bad
this movie rocks because of the scifi twist and is packed with action and romance
to boot i got some good laughout loud moments
pure enjoyment for a guy who has to be in love or have an adventure to be happy
lol
the movie visits several locations and gives one a feel of a man that is largerthan life
go for entertainment and you will not be disappointed
the subplots are a bit difficult to follow but overall one does not need to have read the books to understand or enjoy this movie
the book is always different than the movie
both are unique yet follow the the same themes
for example the main characters are well according to robert ludlum not playing with a full deck of cards
in the movie love conquers all
a pathetic attempt to revive one of the greatest spy movie series the bourne series the bourne legacy fails dishearteningly to revive and capture the thrill drama and excitement of jason bourne travelling hunted and hunting around the globe
a hardhitting black ops task force suddenly and inadvertently turns into a viral infection movie portrayed in a disgusting script horrible sequences hilarious background music and pathetic action melodrama
the tension thrill excitement and excellent action sequences of the earlier bourne movies was alltopsdown lost in this new reboot
aaron cash never looked deadly or an important cia spy went wrong and the antagonist larx 3 though was introduced at a top notch killing machine ultimately turned into a comic punk kid in the way
i personally being a huge fan of both matt damon and jeremy renner unbiasedly will give matt damon the definite edge
one thing has been very clear from the movie that aaron cash is no jason bourne and tony gilroy is no paul greengrass
what the hell was tony gilroy thinking
it might have received some patchy reviews at the time it premiered in the box office and jeremy renner as aaron cross might be lacking matt damons jason bourne instalment in the series of bourne trilogy while bourne scriptwriter tony gilroy chooses to carry the can alone directs in place of paul greengrass
generally the film plot got off with a suicidal and messy start and was considered to be hard to follow but then things really started to pick up smoothly as renner delivers an excellent performance as he searches the truth about himself while dodging bullets and explosives from the corrupt organisations he worked for
there are some good levels of action here with stunts and getaway scenes and thats perhaps the good thing i can say about the bourne trilogy of films
being intrigued and entertained enough from the bourne trilogy and having bought the completed set i was a bit put off by the introduction of another bourne movie presuming it to be a lame attempt to capitalize more on the franchise
so much that i didnt bother to watch it  till now
i must say that i found everything about this movie unexpected
the integration of this story with snippets of the original ultimatum was very well done
there is one thing i find in many movies though to be disappointing believability
its the subtle things that a person may or may not do that makes a story convincing
that the fine technical details are not overexplained to assure the watcher gets it is laudable i love looking details up later on a subsequent viewing
when a filmmaker takes the effort to add those little subtleties to a movie i take special notice and legacy is full of them
one of the things i loved about haywire
renner is a great branch from the bourne character
this movie will be added to my collection
the best action series i have ever watched in my whole life
not only fight and war but intelligence games also and best acting ever by the hero
a good movie is one which we wish to see again and again
and these are the ones
very well directed by the director and i simply loved the talented acting of jason bourne matt damon
actually this movie is so much appraisable because every scene of it looks real
i have watched almost every movie hollywood and bollywood but i believe that i will never see such a fantastic movie again
one thing to share  is that whenever i search for movies i just enter these movies name and search for related movies list i swear
just saw jeremy in legacy and really enjoyed the movies story
i found his action scenes better and just loved rachel
nothing complicated about my review just loved the story and the idea of trying to get his body together
do not like the idea of messing with genetic material to enhance humans or animals
all the species on the planet evolved over thousands of years and by changing things to quickly mother nature can come back and harm you worse
humans know just enough to destroy the world and it is called surviving progress
we are killing off species by inventing compounds that should not exist and excavating oil and coal that is toxic to living things
stop being god
loved the movie as entertainment
jeremy you were great
i gave it a 5 only because the lead actors were so good and the plot was reasonably good until it devolved into another silly carmotorcyclefoot chase
hey you can do this once
not every damn movie
its boring
the rest of the plot was plodding but at least it had some structure albeit trite
then bring in the big names albert finney unknown for anyone under 40 probably scott glenn joan allen for their 2 minutes a piece to pretend its a continuing saga
then they sail off into the sunset
mon dieu bond did that a hell of lot better
everything was set up to keep the senate from hearing about the super secret program yet we only get 3 minutes of testimony and thats it
the gilroys kept the screenplay for themselves and what a colossal mistake that was
it stinks
wow what a superb film
starts out with an interesting plot in which we observe a manchurian black operative survive against all odds in a freezing climate
then somehow they weave it into a great story about the female lead waking up to the truth about the program and fighting the bad guys with renner
i think they were both fantastic because they stay low key
the motorcycle scenes are really incredible  suspense throughout
i forgot all about matt damon 30 minutes into it
and i like matt
i highly recommend this film
gotta watch it again so i can enjoy the martial arts impressive
bonus is the attachmentlove interest angle which develops and renner is extremely easy on the eye
this is an interesting view of the bourne series from another parallel perspective
i had never seen jeremy renner before but i thought his performance was excellent
i really grew to care for aaron cross
rachel weisz is terrific and beautiful as always
the droneshellfire missile sequences are scary as hell
i liked how a love affair grows out of the carnage that attends so much of the movie
rather better than the 6
7 rating that it has so far drawn
it seemingly sets the scene for aaron cross and jason bourne to team up to really raise hell with some completely amoral washington bureaucrats who think nothing of killing american heroes to protect their own sorry asses
bring it on
in the bourne 4 it features a new protagonist aeron cross aka jeremy renner
although they were a lot of action scenes and chases the scenes were choppy and confusing going all over the place unlike the other three bournes that were intelligent fluent and acting is good
in this movie the story was all over the place and didnt really connect much to other ones and the ending was horrible and it wasnt a cliff hanger unlike matt damon bourne movies where he was shot of something no they just float off in a boat and i said what thats it for the many actions scenes it does not leave you satisfied at the end and is not very intellectually motivating unlike og bourne movies
all in all it was okay
i suggest watching it but you may not like it
bourne is regarded as a very good trilogy
honestly i never really was a fan of the first 3 films
they were enjoyable enough
maybe a 6
510 as far as i am concerned
anyway after seeing the trailers for the 2012 version i said
hey this looks nice but will it even be as good as the last ones
after the first 30mn i understood that the bourne name was soiled
this movie was bad
yes bad
what is this hype i read online
story is poor action is not interesting
and the soundtrack is not memorable
believe me this should have been a direct to bluray movie at best
the only thing that saves this crap is the good lead actor and a few action moments that are nice
if you have not seen it skip it you are not missing a damn thing
people who have watched bourne series and expect the same kind of fast paced action and drama
this film will disappoint if you go with that thought
but if you watch the movie just to spend a good time and dont expect much then its a good movie to watch once
the movie doesnt have the fast pace and at the beginning it goes so slow that you wonder if this movie title had bourne in it
there are some dialogues in the movie which take the story nowhere you wish they got to the point directly
the director of the movie is changed so should the title so that people dont expect much from this movie
jeremy renner does a good act and recently has come up as the new action hero
fourth film in the bourne series initially based upon robert ludlams novels goes a different route with new characters and a new leading man jeremy renner in place of matt damon
despite an endlessly complicated setup the plot is an intriguing one with an agent for the department of defenseaddicted to physical enhancement drugs once supplied by the operativesrealizing hes become expendable eventually leaving the states with a female scientist in search of more medication in the phillipines
both renner and rachel weisz give surprisingly strong adept performances for a picture that essentially just wants to be a stuntdriven thriller
director and cowriter tony gilroy does get the viewers blood pumping with some overthetop vehicle stunts in the final third however his sense of pacing flags in the talkier sections of the film which are full of hot air but not much insight
12 from
i havent watched more than 5 minutes total of the three previous bourne movies so i couldnt care less whether this one does or doesnt star matt damon or whether it continues the story properly
so no biases
i just watched this movie
i see improved humans who have outlived their usefulnessbecome a menace
different people are called in to shut themthe program down
violent interactions result in many dead
theres even a brief bit about 23 of the way through where ed nortons character is watching tape of renners character being asked a series of questions
is this a test
renners character asks
renner is essential a nexus6 replicant
ed norton is a blade runner
everything else is window dressing
i give it a 5 bc its a halfdecent adrenaline rush but 15 minutes after its over you wont remember a thing
all those moments will be lost in time like tears in rain
well i am a bourne fan but to be honest i was not expecting much about this movie because i knew there was no point on making another one it has already ended in the ultimatum but yeah here is finally  the bourne legacy
what to say it is of course not a bad movie it has a good history good acting and good action scenes
but there is something i really missed from the bourne series it was the realism
i am a big fan of realism in movies since i watched bourne and when i heard this new  bourne  will be about some experimental pills which gives him advantages such as speed intelligence etc
it ruined my hopes about this movie
more like a  super soldier  as bourne
giving it a 610 due to jeremmy ranner and rachel weiszs acting
quite disappointing this new film for our trilogy which has already lost its original jason bourne
i personally liked the movie irrespective of any idea about direction or storyline
those who say it was poorly executed are just who are following the critics blindly
its good to give reviews but you should watch it without being biasedwho is making
watch it twice or thrice to ensure you havent missed the concept or else you would be like oh my god i dont get it so this is a boring not worthy movie
and stop comparing it with others so in that way you may enjoy it
and my suggestion please dont see the reviews given by critics
their opinion may vary
we should not expect a perfect movie but go for an entertaining one
when you watch the bourne trilogy to me those 3 movies were equal in suspense and excitement
its hard to come away with a sequel and have it be as good as the first one
here jeremy renner is really good in his role but im not sold on rachel weisz
its like she is trying too hard
when you watch her and renner in the car when they leave her burning house its like she is forgetting her lines or something
just not very good acting
anyway the action scenes are really good but the story isnt
it doesnt carry the same flair or interest like the first 3 do
the movie is not awful but its not great either
good to see at least once
it gets a 6 from me
bourne is back and better than ever in the fourth movie installment of the bourne series
the bourne legacy is still the same gritty and violent action that you came to expect
the only problem is
jason bourne is gone
the good thing is that jeremy renner takes over the roll just as well as matt damon did
id say my favorite scene in the movie was probably the end moter cycle scene because it was just so extensive and made you want to just fast forward to see what happens
believe it or not this is actually probably my favorite bourne movies because it gets a little old just to keep seeing matt damon in each movie when it seems like each of the movie had their same plots but this one was better because it had a cast change
not the best movie of the 2012 summer but still a great action flick that fans of jason bourne have come to expect
so go see it
a 5 is generous
overall the bourne legacy was slow when it should have been fast and fast when it should have been smart
cross motivation was singular almost animalistic  smart pills movie over
for one thing it takes more brains and skill to disable than to kill
early on we are fed the idea that mr cross is of substandard intelligence without these little pills
later we are told that if he survives being given a virus he wont need the pills anymore
the problem is that its coming from all directions and doesnt stay with an idea at least a good idea long enough to make a connection something to identify with
jeremy renner was like the energizer bunny on meth
rachel provided the emotional connection and some stability
the only other thing i can say in a positive way was the relationship development between dr shearling and cross
go matt
i walked into the screening theatre with a bit of apprehension
i confess i am a big matt damon fan
he did a tremendous job as jason bourne in the previous three episodes
however jeremy renner is a refreshingly pleasant surprise as the new agent
he is a great actor who has tremendous screen presence and energy
rachel weisz as dr
snyder is outstanding
ed norton as byer does not have too many lines but his expressions show why he is such a great actor
the story is excellent and so is tony gilroys direction
the action scenes will keep you at the edge of your seats
the finale on the streets of manila is aligned with the previous three bourne movies
the locations chosen are perfect
the cinematography is grabbing especially the scenes which were shot in alberta canada
the bourne legacy is a must see not only for the bourne fans but also for those who love a good story and good action movies
i am going to watch it again and pay for it when it is released in august
its well worth it
for mealthough this movie was decentit didnt really feel like a bourne moviemainly because the character of jason bourne isnt in it
thats not to say its a bad moviebecause it isnt
it just doesnt stack up to the three previous bourne films in terms of action characterization and dialogue
the story was okaybut again not overly compelling none of the actors can be blamed
they all put in good efforts
this film just had too big a pair of shoes to fill
tony gilroyduplicitymichael clayton directed and cowrote the screenplay
as far as i can recallnone of the characters or actors from the three previous film appear in thisalthough i could be out to lunch on that
for methe bourne legacy is a 610
the bourne identity the 4th and god i hope last of this continuation
this movie has nothing to do with bourne is basically aaron cross played by jeremy renner and rachel weisz trying to escape from some people and edward norton trying his best godfather part iii look since he looks like hes 58 years old
the action is over the top the acting is fine and then instead of actually trying to do something new with the series they use half of the footage from the previous film damn they are smart right
nope
this is the terminator salvation of the bourne franchise but theres one problem t4 was at least enjoyable this one
not so much
lets just pretend that they never made a 4th movie and that the 4th movie is the upcoming jason bourne one right
right
the movie starts off really well but tends to get worse as it progresses
the cinematography and acting is amazing
the films plot is not as strong though and their choice of location was disappointing
bourne movies seem to me more satisfying when filmed in europe or the states any spy film shot in in europe or the states is better due to the value it adds to the film
there seems to be more locations and better landmarks in europe
the film lacked location as well
some dialogues were off
i personally believe the movie couldve been more detailed and had a better ending
jeremy renners performance was good
robert elswit did a great job as the director of photography
the characters were not introduced very well and it would be hard for some people to get locked onto the movie
rachel weisz sp
is not a great actor for the role she plays
kind of gets annoying at a lot of times
the sad part is that the movie could not follow the plot of the book in which jason bourne was the main character because matt damon refused to be a part of the movie
thus the plot is entirely different then the book
the books plot was incredible and would have made a great movie but i guess damon was selfish and set them up for disappointment
still an alright movie but the plot is a little unclear and weisz acting sucks
its just no match to the real bourne trilogy
should you watch do not have the expectation that it will be as good as the first three movies
because in my opinion those were easily 1010 and this one was probably 5
5 or 6 out of 10
this latest bourne movie is a fast paced action packed movie with incredible chase scenes and clever situations and escapes
i thought the actors were all decent and convincing in their roles
for those of you that love fast paced action violence and fans of the bourne movie series i suspect youll find this movie is everything you want and hope for
but for those of us that would like a storyline that actually makes sense and is moderately easy to follow well then this one fails to deliver on those lines
when watching this i kept telling myself that this will all make sense eventually that the plot will come clear soon and that all the pieces will fit
unfortunately i find those essential elements of movie making were not present in this one
there was a lot to like about this movie but there was also a lot to dislike
i wish the producers and script writers would of done a better job of plot development had they done so this movie would rate way better than just mediocre
i got this movie on amazonand its actually a pretty good movie better than i expected
i thought it was going to be almost an off brand of the other ones but id actually take this one over the others
but a few days after i bought it  i downloaded apptrailers on my ipodi found out i could of gotten it on apptrailers for free
when i entered the promo code under videoshrvat11 and got 2000 free points which is enough for one movie
luckily they have a ton of different movies to choose from so i got dark knight rises instead but i think the code it a holiday special so it wont last forever
you guys really need to check out their movie section its impressive to say the least
with the code you get onew free then you either have to earn more points or buy the movies
ive seen all the other bourne movies several times each
when i sat down to watch this one the first half of the movie just jumped around and felt like it was disjointed
seemingly a forced attempt to bring all the movies together which didnt work by the way
i was so confused i got up and went to wash the dinner dishes
when i came back my absence helped because it seemed to have launched into another act and more of it made sense they let the current characters run with the story instead of flipping back and forth
overall i didnt particularly enjoy the movie
the actions scenes were too close in similarity to the other movies not sure if this was done for overall feel or just laziness
wasnt impressed
though the bourne legacy doesnt quite live up to the original bourne trilogy it is still an outstanding movie in its own right
for one jeremy renner does an absolutely phenomenal job
while i dont think the character development or acting is necessarily up to par with matt damon i think he more than legitimizes the film
i also thought that rachel weisz did a solid job and edward norton provided a decent villain for the movie
in addition to the acting and character development the plot developed superbly
i thought making this film coincide with the bourne trilogy was genius
honestly the only elements of the movie i didnt enjoy were the general lack of action and the outlandish aspects of some of the action sequences
these two poor aspects coupled together to really hurt the movie because it would start to drag but then when action would finally happen it would sometimes be silly
still this movie is definitely worth watching
just dont expect it to be as good as the first three
the long bla bla bla of the misguided critics of the script miss the point of this bourne movie
for that matter perhaps the point of movies
movies tell stories through physical actions
the actors did not redeem the script
it seemed obvious to me that the script was much better than the previous bourne movies
i dont care about jason bournes personal identity crisis
this is a sociological thriller
the script created a vacuum that made a simple eye brow flick and a deep look of interest culminate in a gush of pure believable humanity
making the finale greater than the perfect action which preceded it
whats unbelievable is the way these technocrat wordsmiths dodge the bullet points of the story and the point of movies and acting
sometimes it is a good thing to step back and chill a minute
even knowing the propensity for this director to use rapidcutting techniques didnt prepare me for the confusion and well lets admit it big fat headache it gave me while at the same time trying to focus on the quivering handheld camera
yikes
just cause you know how doesnt mean you have to use all your tricks at the same time
this was a good story that tied onto the bourne mythos and rebooted the movie franchise with actors who were terrific
good action sequences and stunts also so my advice to the director or directors of future bourne or will they be cross
flix is to trust the viewer to get the drama without adding in those cinematography gimmicks
this movie reminded me of so many other chase movies
the thing that made the first 3 bourne movies stand out was they were trying to get him before he got them
this movie lacked a number of other things that made me just about walk out before the end
firstly the intensity of this bourne movie  no where near the same as the others
next  the fight scenes  choreography left wanting too dark to see what was going on could barely see one scene
last  good movies have good 1 on 1 good guy bad guy scenes and a near death experience from one of those for the good guy lets just say you will be disappointed with the last actionchase scene
overall it really missed the mark for anyone expecting a good powerful movie from the bourne stable
and ed norton wasnt the guy for the top job in my opinion
doesnt have a voice that instils fear or command
510
the bourne legacy was a great addition to the bourne franchise
jeremy renner does an excellent job as aaron cross and the whole cast do some amazing acting
the only downside to this almost perfect film is that the beginning is quite confusing even if you have seen all 3 original films and the ending lacks imagination
although you may think this would ruin the film it certainly does not
throughout the film there are some great fight scenes epic chase scenes and scenes synonymous to the bourne series
overall there is great acting and some memorable action scenes which make this film what it is
it was an enjoyable film and i would be happy to see a sequel
i will keep my review straight and to the point
watch the first three films as i did then go watch the bourne legacy
the movie just doesnt feel the same
no adrenaline no amazing gun scenes ok the house was decent followed by the weakest ending i could imagine
really
the guy on the bike was supposed to be the best agent they ever put into the field and yet he gets ousted by the doctor
where is the agent on agent fight scenes
where is the brink of death feeling and close calls
no wonder matt didnt want anything to do with this film
the first bourne film i almost fell asleep watching
what a disappointment
