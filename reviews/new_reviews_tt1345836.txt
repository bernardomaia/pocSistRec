the movie was so boring and lengthy that i considered to leave the cinema
the script was predictable at some points and the acting was so poor amongst some of the actors
anne hathaway was horrible she was not convincing at all and her outfit looked like a cheap halloween costume
bane the main villain of this movie was killed in a split second and everything was forgotten about him thats it
its like the script writers wanted this movie to end quickly as possible at this point
the actor playing miranda who appears to be ras al ghuls daughter talia should get the award for worst death presentation it was some of the worst acting i have ever seen you can tell that she is acting
its like she is taking a nap for crying out loud
blake who appears to be robin gets access to the batman cave and all the high tech stuff that is in there but he didnt receive any training at all so he wouldnt know how to use it
robin is just an ordinary cop in this movie with no combat skills yet bruce wayne gives away the cave to him and settles down with the supposed catwoman
it took me one week to finally watch this whole movie fell asleep twice got distracted by lint in my belly button watching paint dry etc
i dont know what people are looking at
this was soo boring and the plot holes and ridiculous story lines was just too much
i agree with all the other negative reviews
couldnt understand anything bane said the fight scenes were yawn boring what happened to batmans kick ass kungfu
he got slapped around like a 2 dollar hooker
no reasonable explanations for anythinghow did he get back to us
and what kind of hell on earth prison has cable tv
policeman come out of dark sewage like they are getting ready for a parade
the big melee fight police have no guns bad guys have guns and they just let the police beat them up
talias death scene she needs to go back to acting school i just burst out laughing
it goes on and on and on
save your money wait till it comes to video
i knew right from the opening shot of gordons eulogy i knew harvey dent
with the breaking to form the bat symbol that this was going to be epic
it was obvious from the beginning that the film legend
in fact i loved it and i think it is the best movies the dark knight
i absolutely loved it and im glad they really humanized batman and limited his screen time in this film
some comic bookyactiony type fans didnt like the small amount of time we actually see batman but that was the whole point of the trilogy
the ending where foley says theres only one police in this town while doing their march against bane was really awesome
the ending was perfect
but the movie has missed the joker
i say as both a batman fanboy and especially a nolan fanboy that this is the perfect trilogy
there is not much to say about tdkr because after some days there is not much left in my movielovingmind
not much except this a disappointing villain who is beaten in a fistfight
and without any cool action which wasnt shown already in the trailer
a batman who was once struggling about his gone loveofalifetime rachel but bangs now two girls in a row
a main villain who suddenly plops out after bane is dead but acts just some minutes as head of the bad
and a foreseeable average climax with an atomic bomb how creative is that
where was the epic conclusion
where was batmans inspiration to the people not just blake were was alfred
tdkr is technically well done
but thats it
dont be stupid and let cheat you by that
not a bad movie
but not more
you disappointed me nolan what the f
cheesy way of ending conflicts uninteresting characters
deus ex machine in its cheap form
sleepy time in action sequences not in the more hardcore action images that balance content persuasion
destroyed the image of a passionately followed character not talking about batman
are you going to slack in next project
more preproduction man think stuff trough
where you in contract debt to finish the movie or something
you know you are better than writing stuff for the ridiculous 10 line in comment rule last night i proved my girlfriend its a hassle to take care of one another while drunk
right from the start of the movie you will be on the edge of your seat
personally i think this is the best conclusion i have ever seen
performance of each actor in the movie is outstanding
before i saw the movie i thought that anne hathaway wouldnt be as good catwoman as michelle pfeiffer was but not only was she better she blew michelle away
all the special effects are amazing and unbelievable
i have to say i love some of the batmans new toys
i have seen it in v max theater last night but i am going to see it again in i max because its worth the experience
it runs for 2 hours and 45 minutes but it felt like 30 minutes and i wanted more
10 stars is not enough for such a great movie
i recommend to all movie lovers out there to go and see it in cinemas
the plot is a total nonsense from the beginning to the end
they dont even try to make it believable
i know its a super hero movie were not in the real world but still
i felt this movie was an insult to the public
its like saying you dont understand anything of what is happening in the world around you why would you care to understand what is going on in the movie
we end up with a very childish plot where whatever you want to happen just happens with magic
a nuclear reactor turned into a nuclear bomb with a screwdriver in 2 minutes in a garage a broken spine healed with a rope and 3 push ups its all like this
just boring and lazy
even the fights are lame
bane and batman are supposed to be the 2 best fighters in the world but they fight like a couple of drunk cowboys
jackie chan would kick their butt in no time
cant believe its rated 8
7 today
so is the dark knight rises better than the dark knight
if you were one of those fans who prefer batman begins to tdk then youll find much to love about tdkr
and if you werent then no batman film will ever match tdk for you
spolier alertand yes it is the end a resounding resolution for what batman begins begun
threads from that film are picked up lengthened and strengthened bringing a staunch integrity a in every sense a to the overall arc
is it perfect
factor in some clunky catchup exposition near the start a cringey logfire love scene and moments where hans zimmers score nearly foghorns the actors off the screen and the answers no
an even bigger question is it up there with the dark knight
not quite
i have just seen this movie and was deeply disappointed
i think this is the worst movie i have seen in years
i really liked the previous film the dark knight with heath ledger in a fantastic role as the joker but this film
why not rename it the dark knight s
the messy plot all the logical faults the soft comments where to sacrifice oneself for the city of gotham the tears the worn out wisdom of the wiseman in the cave
i suspect a were only in it for the money attitude for the creators of this film but then again it looks as if they tried but failed and an expensive film to make it must have been
why not use some of that money on an intelligent plot
instead of this mess
just forget this movie and save your money and your time
i am not going to lie
i was fearful for this movie
normally when you think of trilogys the third one is always the weakest onegodfather part 3 spiderman 3 matrix revolutions
however this movie isin my opinionthe strongest of the nolan batman trilogy
nolan proved to all of the critics that he was right with going of the character of bane a terrorist who has great plans to fulfil his destiny in the city of gotham
tom hardy excels in this role and it is one of his best roles in any movie hes done
he is required to do a lot of acting with his eyes and he has great screen presence it immediately makes you feel intimidated
anne hathaway added depth to the catwoman character and portrayed her excellently
yet the icing on the cake is christian bale who reprises his role of batman
the whole atmosphere in gotham is created through nolans direction of the film
its a very dark setting darker than the dark knight was but this adds further to the main theme of the storyredemption
it was the best movie in 2012 and nolan i thank you for a superb trilogy
after watching dark knight rises i concluded that if there is anybody who can make kickass sequels its nolan
the film contains everything from brilliant acting raw action out of the world oneliners and amazing cinematography
it is already very hard to make a sequel for a film which was just good enough hit but to make a sequel for a film which will always be remembered as the best you have to do a very impeccable job and that is what is done in this movie
from the beginning to the end you have some very beautiful and emotional scenes like the mob fight between the police and the thugs the rise of the batman from the prison and the chants deshi deshi basura basura towards the end where alfred and bruce see each other for probably the last time and both know that he has made it
the plot is very good and unpredictable the story is amazing just like the dark knight
nolan did a great job doing this movie with a very huge expectations from the movie critics following the huge success from the earlier sequel the dark knight in 2008
the catwoman role was bigger than i thought it would be she was an enemy but then became batmans partner tom hardys bane look terrific and menacing with his controlfreak personality and a bit of jokers agentofchaos
joseph gordonlevitts role is also bigger than it looks like from the trailer from a young cops to be the new batman its very satisfying how nolan showed us that batman always win and the fact that bruce wayne live made my day overall a very great movie
so after seeing the the dark knight my expectations were pretty high for this movie and most movies would fail miserably but luckily the dark knight rises is not one of most movies
it absolutely lived up to my expectations
what was good about the movie
pretty much everything
the acting was top notch in this movie everyone does a good job in it
the action was great but the movie is great without action
tom hardy as bane is one of the most terrifying villains i have ever seen
i likes the characters the story everything
the one gripe that people might have is that it is very dark
but even that is not a real issue
in the end i loved this movie i recommend it to everyone an even though its not as good as the dark knight its still an amazing movie
the dark knight rises was a perfect sequel to a masterpiece
christopher nolan took a different direction and focused more on bruce waynebatman
this movie is filled with lots of emotions
it has such great characters and of course the dialogs is so good
the performances are incredible
it was my most anticipated movie of the century
the more i watch it the more epic it gets
personally i think the dark knight trilogy is the greatest trilogy of all time and this movie gives the greatest ending of all time in the movie history
i remember seeing it thrice and the more i watched it the more respect it earns
thank you christopher nolan you sir are a master
im sure at this point everything has been written about nolans 3rd installment to this trilogy
so i am just going to add this i had two major problems with this movie 1 the dialog audio was periodically buried in the soundtrack
there were many times i had no idea what was being said
i have this on bluray and had to back it up multiple times and still some things were impossible for me to understand
along with this was banes audio which was even more difficult for me to make out
i realize it fashionable to emphasizehypeup the audio for the rockconcert effect
but there was so much bottomend eqboost it made for much of his dialog unintelligible
spoileralert 2 four times in the last 30 minutes someone is on the brink of being killed  or at least seriously hurt only to be rescued
its not always necessary to write in this kind of fractional desperation and these actions became obvious and annoying to me
other than these 2 items i loved the movie and was a fitting end to nolans brilliant and masterful vision of this character
words cannot express how i felt after watching the dark knight rises
a sense of hope that even in the most dismal of situations one should have
a sense of relief that this trilogy did not go in the way of most trilogies
a sense of sadness that this would be the last batman movie in the nolan franchise
but more than all this i was elated and joyous about the way this movie kept my interest throughout the whole 2 hrs 45 min
to say one word about this film
epic
all the characters completely complimented one another
was especially astounded by bale hathaway hardy and caines performances
i am definitely going once again for this one
as much as i am huge fan of the batman in almost every facet of the genre i am having a hard time getting completely behind this film
it makes the same mistake a lot of sequels do it tries to pack too much into the story
the reason why the first two films in the trilogy batman begins and the dark knight worked so well was because they mostly focused on one central story and villain
in the dark knight rises there are too many new characters and too many story lines to be introduced and told that the film loses focus
sure it has plenty of action which you would expect but nolan strays too far from the source material when it comes to the characters in the film
the cast does a fine job with the script they had to work with and most film goers will probably like this film but i think true fans of the batman who know the history of the characters will wonder what nolan is doing to their batman
i loved this film a perfect ending to the  dark knight trilogy
it was shocking but just perfect when batman blew up in the bat
because at the end when joseph gordonlevitt went to the batcave to become the new hero it showed that batman isnt a person but a symbol
it barely won anything though
i dont know how the oscars didnt nominate it for sound visual effects i even think it shouldve gotten an adapted screenplay nod amp maybe even best picture theyve nominated action films before for best picture
even at the kids choice awards stupid kristen stewart beat anne hathaway for favorite female buttkicker
it won nothing at the mtv movie awards amp at the teen choice awards it won 1 out of 5 awards winning for choice movie actress action  anne hathaway
this movie deserved more than it got and it gets a full 1010
i have loved the last two movies and was expecting a perfect conclusion to this epicsuperherocrimesaga
this movies is so fantastic
the new characters are welldepicted that are banecatwomantalia and blake a
k
a robin
as this is christopher nolans movie the acting is topnotch but i wanted to see more of banehe is good but not as jokeranyways tom hardy did a great job especially physically and that nasty voice
christian bale is again the superherohe is most unique
anne hathaway did very nice she looks smoking hot kitty as the role demands
all other actors morgan freemanjoseph gordongary oldmanmichael caine and marion cotillard did supported great
there are few scenes which gave us goosebumps like the one where batman returns with the batand hans zimmers music as always epic
but it doesnt feels perfect like the dark knightmaybe heath ledger pulled out in that one but its slightly lower that the last movie
special effects are amazingeverything else is great and finally a satisfying conclusion
a movie of epic proportions because its time to rise
as bruce wayne faces having been gone for 8 years youd think hed lost his touch but with a little help and the bane of gotham making himself known its time for the dark knight to rise to the its hype
unfortunately the hype was a little to much for the movie and in my eyes was a little disappointing but not so much im going to downgrade the rating because all in all it was a brilliant film but hard to compare to the second movie because it was an extremely good film with some absolutely amazing actors
bane was well portrayed as the villain he is
a simply fantastic film that i give a 9
christopher nolan has made tons of great movies in the past
insomnia memento the prestige and inception
his most recognized movies are from his dark knight trilogy which contains batman begins the dark knight and the dark knight rises
the predecessors of tdkr were nothing short of great but tdkr exceeded all of my expectations
the very first lines of the movie picks up right where we left off in tdk with jim gordon talking about harvey dent
then we cut to one of the greatest opening scenes ever assembled
then learn about the dent act which is keeping all of the mob contained in prison
then things start to go bad again and bruce wayne decides he must put back on his cape and cowl
the story is very entertaining and keeps you drawn in for the entire movie from start to finish
speaking of which the ending of this movie was fantastic
i did not see it coming and it was just flat out genius
in this epic conclusion christopher nolan out does himself again
this is a must see movie 10 out of 10
this is my first review i want it to be simple tdkr is an epic conclusion to any superhero movie ever seen its lengthy and dark because of pressure of previous blockbuster tdk it builds up its story slowly n deserves multiple viewings to clarify every aspect its not fast paced as tdk but it is just like begins in terms of story telling and it is superior to every other super hero movies because it delivers what it promises and this is satisfying ending it doesnt leaves you frustrated tdkr completes on the great trilogies in movie history
finally i would like to thank christopher nolan for portraying batman in a way no one ever thought was possible and for making one the best trilogy of all time
i wanted to write just see it but imdb requires 10 lines so here goes nothing
theres something in this film for everyone especially batman fans
that doesnt mean chris nolan and team tried to please everyone  if youve seen any of his films you know hes got too much integrity and cinematic love for that
theres romance real drama and feeling in contrast to the first two movies
action fans will dig it wingnut techheads will dig it
theres even a hint of the supernatural in this movie
war movie fans will dig it
i think its fair to say that most chris nolan fans will dig it too
i cant even fault the film for its moment of garbled dialogue because those moment just fuel my desire to see this movie again
just see it
i hate this movie
i just really really really hate this movie
everything about it is about as entertaining as the room the quality of the acting is feeble at best and im pretty sure christian bale gives the single worst performance of his entire career in this mess of a movie
it tears apart batman lore it makes bane into a lovesick puppy dog that couldnt escape the friend zone and talia just turns into a cow without any of the honor her father or her clan had in the previous movies
probably the only redeeming factor about this movie is the cinematography and the acting done by gary oldnan and joseph gordon levitt as for the rest of the cast it was mediocre at best
to hell with the dark knight rises almost everything about it can be summarized by saying christopher nolan thought he could get away with this he thought wrong
oh my god this movie was awesome
and what an amazing ending to a superb trilogy
this movie cant get better the story the cast everything is just too perfect
and no one is better than chrestian bale for this movie he is a very talented actor with a really special acting skills
i am confused why anyone well hate this movie its one of the best movie for all ages
in my opinion its the best action movie of 2012
and of course the well directing and superb special effects of the movie makes it more amazing
what a blockbuster movie is this
this movie is no doubt a most watch and best of the year and it deserved an oscar at least
this movie has everything you could want all while wrapping up one of the best film trilogies
as far as bad guys go bane is pretty much the epitome of the character type
i personally feel the villains in the trilogy is what makes them so special
the story is great and engaging it was so good i didnt even realize that the runtime was over 2 hours
if you like dark gritty andor action movies its a must watch
also it should be noted that you should watch the first 2 films in the series otherwise some stuff might not add up
it wraps up everything in the trilogy and answers pretty much every question you could have
how it relates back to the first movie is quite impressive and after watching this one youll probably try your best bane impression
his voice is as memorable as his stature
so even if you dont like batman you must watch it for bane because he is that amazing
props to tom hardy on his out of the park performance
the dark night rises is one of mines favorite movie
christan bale and tom hardy are classy and they show great commitment to they roles
fascineting scenes
just brilliant
after joker is hard to find a true rival for batman
but bane was great and i really enjoyed
i watched this movie two or three time
and im gonna watch it again
such a great story and im sad because it cant be minimum ten batman movies
who wasnt see this must see it
now
i really hope this review helped someone who was undecided about this movie
the women in movie was great and i love them
marion cotillard and anna hathaway are beautiful and really good actresses
they merged they two very good
i have watched this movie several times and the last time i watched it i was still sitting in the edge of my seat
nolan is a brilliant director who weaves every scene together and makes it look meaningful
although the movie is well beyond 2
5 hours there is not a scene in the movie that looks out of place or was just thrown there without meaning
we endured the old 60s styled batman with his cute sidekick robin
it was silly and stupid and tore batmans legacy apart
then came the cheap imitations by val kilmar and michael keaton in the 80s and 90s batman movies
seriously arnold as mr
freeze
nolan takes batman back to his dark roots
he injects some realism into the story reasons what shaped him to become who he became and brings frank millers depiction of the dark knight straight out of the comic book into the screen
nolans batman trilogy is masterpiece
and there could not have been a more fitting end to the trilogy
the joker was awesome and so is bane
go watch it if you havent
watch it again if you have
the first thing i have noticed iswe got a situation in the movieand again and again we struct in it
its beyond a moviebeyond a story
its about a hopeabout a regular prayer for the man with a mask for the last 4 years when he was running and dogs and cops were chasing him
after watching the dark knight in 2008i became the disciple of batman
after watching the dark knight risesi realized he is god
sometimes when your excitement level cross the limitsu cant explain much
same happens to me
batman is a normal human being who inspired us to ask jesus christ not to take our sins
he is among and within us showing the way of perfection and purification
well before entering the theater like most of u guys i had 3 questions in mind
1would it b worth the 4 year gap
2can it outdo the last one pretty tough one
and finally would this be the end of the nolan batman saga
one thing more i didnt watch a single trailer of this movie on purpose which was pretty hard though
so the excitement was sky high
so after watching the movie
its not as good as the dark knight
reasons  heath ledger was too good  the story of this part is not as complex as last one
this is the kind of story which builds up to a magnificent climax but offers little before
plus this part deals with more characters than last one so less time to build them up
the most interesting and exciting part is the ending which gives a definite hint of a new series
from start to finish a great movie in my life i watch the best films one of the previous films in the same way was very good batman versus a special affection there player selections were wonderful and the characters are very good especially the previous film wild card character was amazing
director christopher nolan is a great director as all the movies will be very good no part of the criticism of the film from beginning to end i do not think a movie masterpiece
christian bale is very good and the characters well suited to a player in his place someone else if it would suit you do not think the new will be drawn batman series this film should keep out of this film trilogy end as i think the same staff fourth film possible these three films grow missed i believe
with this film i would say it was quite magical
the affects that took place were spectacular a great increase from the dark night
when i saw this film as a batman fan i purchased the trilogy ticket starting from the first batman featuring christian bale up to the dark night rises
one thing i would have to add is that i feel as if anne hathaway didnt live up to the role of catwoman as i expected also known as selina
i thought that she could have used some studying from older movies or even comic books to display the attitude of selina just a little bit more
but overall this was an exciting film and ultimately one of the best batman movies to come in this day in age
unfortunately i am not that ecstatic for ben afleck to play the new batman coming out in theaterss in 2015
i know most people did not like how bane was played or portrayed but i loved him as a villain
i actually loved the voice that nolan gave him
to me he was a menacing and impactful villain in the movie
i also thought the plot by miranda tate was exceptional
it was devious and deceiving while deceptively cunning
sure there was things that nolan could have done without the kiss scene between batman and catwoman but the overall vision for batman was exceptional
i also like that he left the possibility open for future movies featuring robin
i loved the original batman with michael keaton but the following batman movies left a sour taste in my mouth
i would describe this movie as a great production with great directing and a terrific cast where in my opinion everyone put in great work
i am not gonna spoil anything specific from the movie but just say that its obviously a huge production with great talent behind it and a very worthy third movie by the today legendary christopher nolan
it is in my opinion a great movie and lives up to the huge hype witch in itself is an amazing achievement
the movie will be seen by all previous fans and you should see it but i can not agree that this is the dark nights finest movie even after all the great work put in and with all the great scenes combined with the best of effects with this huge budget
i consider this movie a great one but far from my top five and even this great movie in the batman category would be behind the dark knight but as u know that certainly doesnt mean it couldnt be great
go and see it
this movie is full of excitement explosions and edge of your seat moments
it ties up all of the loose ends in a great culmination to the series
the casting is perfect
i was surprised by some of the characters that were added
i would have liked to see the story line continued though
it is a bit of a let down that they didnt incorporate more of the villains
or even continue the series to include cooperative adventures for multiple dc heroes
it is great that they managed to keep all of the same actors from the previous movies
it irritated me when they changed the actress who played rachel
i think that this is a good date movie or movie for a family with older children
of course it is great for a guys night
make sure you have you popcorn ready
i love the whole batman series with christian bale
i love the fact his voice was not nearly as annoying in this film
i did not see that twist at the end coming which was a nice surprise
the only thing i didnt like was banes character
i think it was just because of the mask thing and not really being able to see him
the actor did a great job portraying the character despite this
this is one of those movies you can watch multiple times and pick up different clues along the way
i do wish morgan freeman had a bigger role in this one
love lucius
i would like a tv movie of lucius and alred having some adventures together
after seeing this one i think its time for a batman marathon
i really enjoyed watching the film but as a batman fan it felt like something was missing
with some of the characters written differently from their origins in the comics it almost made it feel like a non batman movie with political under tones
i had to forget what i knew about the batman universe in order to enjoy this last installment of the series
but knowing what i know about how movies are made it really didnt surprise me that things were done the way they were done
personally i think that warner bros
and d
c
executives need to get it together
i marvel at the fact that their animated movies are more accurate and entertaining than the live action movies
this needs to change very soon
despite my dislikes about how the film was made i was entertained for the time spent in the theater
these batman films made by christopher nolan always give you a feeling of wanting to become a masked crusader
the reason this is is because of the realness of these films
the dark knight rises is not just a comic hero movie it is an example of socio cultural problems that we have in todays world
these problems such as the poor against the rich
the movies action is amazing
the fight between bane and batman showed that you sometimes have to fall to get back up
this movie had many life lessons
another reason why i love this movie is because of its darkness that nolan portrays in the film
this darkness allows you to feel as though something like this could really happen minus the superhero
this is my favorite movie in the franchise and i will continue to watch the masterpiece for the next 40 times i watch it
awesome movie and just not a superhero movie at all
you will get to see real life sufferings and all other related problems that you have and you can get inspiration as well
batman here is more of a human than that of a immortal superhero
actors gave their best
plot is completely unexpected and gives you sense of anxiety all time
had a great time and one of the movies i would like to watch with my family and yet will not get bored at all
worth every penny spent
looking forward to seeing some similar films is future
but the ending could have been better
it seems robbin will be seen as the boy wonder or nightwing in the next parts so lets see
thumbs up
d
in a season filled with big movies that somehow ask even bigger questions the dark knight rises feels like the superego to its competitions id
an action opus that manages at to be both viscerally and intellectually engaging christopher nolans highly anticipated third batman film comes full circle examining both the dark knight and the society that produced him without sacrificing any of the sweeping thrills for which the series is known
a literate thoughtful and invigorating finale the dark knight rises delivers everything audiences ask for and then some albeit in fewer of the ways that they might expect
this film was a great and fulfilling finale to christopher nolans genius reinvention of the caped crusader
dont get me wrong this film has flaws
its inferior to the first two and has a mild case of sequelitus
this films picks up 8 years from where tdk left off batman is gone and harvey dent is remembered as a hero
the first half is a little slow and cuts a few corners but when bane is introduced as the biggest threat to gotham yet the pace really picks up
only to slow right back down again
despite what people have said both bane and batman are easily audible catwoman is awesome alfred and lucius are good as always and the action is awesome
the problems lie in some lazy writing 3 months glossed over in about 5 minutes and batman fixes his knee with a magic knee brace and spoiler
alert
fixes his broken back with some string
overall the film is good dont let a few issues put you off
810
i did not like how this was the most sentimental of the three nolan batmanmovies
i prefer when the emotional aspects are more subtle letting the audience draw its own conclusions about the characters feeling given their circumstances and backstories
in the dark knight i felt the director trusted his audience more to understand waynes reactions after having heavily emphasized his childhood in batman begins
whereas in the dark knight rises it was much dwelled upon and fed to us with sentimental music
this made the first part of the movie a bit dreary but it quickly became more enthralling and kept getting better as the story progressed
the acting was impeccable as were the visuals
i admit to having prejudices against superheromovies but the characters are complex and interesting
so was the plot though it is clearly made to appeal to a massaudience
there is nothing wrong with being popular and i did not waste my time watching these three movies
it has been eight years since batman vanished into the night turning in that instant from hero to fugitive
assuming the blame for the death of d
a
harvey dent the dark knight sacrificed everything for what he and commissioner gordon both hoped was the greater good
for a time the lie worked as criminal activity in gotham city was crushed under the weight of the anticrime dent act
but everything will change with the arrival of a cunning cat burglar with a mysterious agenda
far more dangerous however is the emergence of bane a masked terrorist whose ruthless plans for gotham drive bruce out of his selfimposed exile
but even if he dons the cape and cowl again batman may be no match for bane
am not a great fan of super hero movies but nolan changed the entire mindset
of course the film has a lot of loop holes and glitches but that doesnt take away the edge of the seat thrilling heartbeat experience
what i loved most was the way a simple comic story was presented on the screen
i really appreciate nolans creativity and presentation
what one needs was an awesome experience and not 100 logic to action movies
the film stand all amid all minor glitches
the film has a lot of positives the way bruce amp tom hardy character was portrayed the way real new york city was presented the way the whole experience stood at the end especially bruce climbing out of the well
hans zimmer played a wonderful part in giving a master piece
all in all i would recommend everyone to watch whether they like it or not but for the cinematic experience it gives in the end
a comic super hero movie depicted magnificently after a lot of flops earlier
nolan has silently conveyed that he is the right man who can do it
first of all it was going to have to have been a miracle to top tdk
it tried
but this is not a fail
no way
this is a conclusion to a bigger story
so as a continuation its very good
bale is excellent as is caine
in fact all the cast show here that comic book movies can have alist actors and acting
the film is long but never feels so
it always builds on its momentum with you just wanting batman to return and kick bane into next week
the story is complex with a lot of plot points
but with plot points come plot holes
anyway just get comfortable sit back and enjoy
as a standalone movie its good
as a conclusion to a trilogy its excellent
the problems with this mess of a movie are endless
mainly its just boring and completely unbelievable
and way too long
theres not nearly enough batman and when he is on screen he mostly gets his ass kicked
meanwhile the villains are capable of doing everything successfully
as a result batman just comes off as tired and lame
the movies war scenes smack more of iron man than dark knight
the movie desperately tries to prove how badass bane is but hes just
not
truly i expected a scene with bane loading cancer surviving crippled grandmas into a bus and blowing them up
it was that silly
all the subplots slow things down i could care less about the backstory of the chick with the accent robin gee i didnt see that coming two hours before it happened the corporate stuff alfreds blubbering
dull dull dull
lastly the sound is amateur
everything is pushed up front so its often difficult to understand dialogue
just a disorganized mess
following the cult of the classic the dark knight this movie brings out another masterpiece by christopher nolan
starting from direction stunts visual graphics to acting everything just seems to be so perfect
christian bale reprises his role as bruce wayne alias the batman thereby establishing his fit to the role
tom hardy as the strong evil bane who is even more powerful than batman and in front of whom even batman is no match adds lots of value to his role
anne hathaway as catwoman is pretty much fitting and justified
however one thing missing in the movie was the charm of the joker
evil seems to be faded away in this movie as compared to heath ledger as joker in the previous installment
other than that the plot storyline script dialogues and dynamism scores equally well making it another masterpiece by christopher nolan
it is a very great movie
the movie is just on point watch it and have a full day but i swear you will cry it is horror bit then it is nice
please watch it and enjoy your hole day

christopher nolan steps back into the directors chair for this sequel to batman begins which finds the titular superhero coming face to face with his greatest nemesis  the dreaded joker
christian bale returns to the role of batman maggie gyllenhaal takes over the role of rachel dawes played by katie holmes in batman begins and brokeback mountain star heath ledger dons the ghoulishly gleeful joker makeup previously worn by jack nicholson and cesar romero
just as it begins to appear as if batman lt
james gordon gary oldman and district attorney harvey dent aaron eckhart are making headway in their tireless battle against the criminal element a maniacal wisecracking fiend plunges the streets of gotham city into complete chaos

what a great movies this is and what a power was brought in to this movie by the role of bane by tom hardy
he became after this role one of my favorite actors
it was a very dark movie witch came out very nice
im waiting for a new part in witch they probably bring in robin
cant wait  for those who didnt see it yet just do its really good
i liked the part where the stadium got blown up i thought they didnt do that like in a lot of other movies
but yeah they did and it has given this movie something more
i must say i did like the previous episodes but i was never this blown away i think this part had it all
the great and big action the story line and not to forget the makeup and costumes
im given this one a 9 of 10
this one got me more emotionally involved than the previous two installments but still feels like it lacks real substance
the images of the october revolution repeating itself in new york er gotham are chilling but the movie holds back and it shouldnt
let us see alfred and lucius fox hang
lets see catwoman gangraped
lets see batman really die
thats the problem with hollywood movies especially of the superhero genre a in what i suspect is fear of alienating a large portion of the audience they dont allow anything of real consequence to happen in the story
when all is said and done everyone still lives everyone is happy with no hint of the tremendous social impact that banes reign would have left on the city and the world
the dark knight was a step in the right direction and its immense popularity attests to that but instead of building on its success and going even further nolan apparently got cold feet
which is a shame because he had all the elements a great actors great special effects a to create a truly great movie
