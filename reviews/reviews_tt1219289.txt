"\nI was skeptical at first about this movie, which is why I didn't go see\nit the week that it came out. I just figured it was all too obvious\nwhat would happen and to be honest some of that did happen yet they did\nthe expected so well that it really didn't seem to make a big\ndifference that I saw it coming a mile off. Which made the things that\nyou didn't expect even better. I enjoyed this movie so much that I\nwould do the unthinkable that I've done only once in all of my years,\nand that is pay to see it again at the theater. I may even buy a copy\nof it when it comes out on Blu Ray. THAT's how good this is. The acting\nwas superb and what I enjoyed most is that finally someone knows how to\nend a movie. BRAVO\n"
"\nI was really looking forward to this movie. It has so much potential:\nan intriguing and clever concept, superb actors, decent script, good\ndirection, sensational visual effects and editing, so what happened? I\ncan't help but feel there was a great story driven film in here at one\ntime during development. However, somehow studio executives -- no doubt\npandering to the teenage boy demographic -- just had to add in all the\npredictable car chases and shoot-em-up gratuitous action. In the end\nthis action was irritatingly distracting from the very captivating\nstoryline that I kept on wishing they would come back to - i.e what\nhappens when one has unlimited cognitive capacity. This is the same\nflaw that marred Christopher Nolan's otherwise fascinating story in\nInception.<br><br>Note to studios and filmmakers why can't you be bold enough to just\nstick with the STORY? You're squandering these great concepts. Not\nevery film needs to be an action/adventure.\n"
"\nALL SPOILERS AHEAD! WARNING! Who wrote this movie, a 6th grader? Why\ndoes the smartest man in the world do such stupid things? Why didn't he\nthink of the best way to make an endless supply of the drug right away?\nWhy didn't he figure out how to get rid of the Russian, instead of\ngiving him what he wanted? Why did he choose the stock market and\nexpose himself to all the attention? He could have made a vast fortune\nin his apartment, trading on FOREX. If he's so smart, why was he\npopping pills without knowing the eventual effects on his brain? Why\nwas he running from the guy with the knife, who was following him? The\nguy knows where lives, that part was plain idiotic. I could go on and\non, but the worst was, why would anybody that smart want to be in\nelective office. He would have far more power being a billionaire. This\nwas a dumb movie, I actually was cheering for him to jump off the roof\nand my wife was telling me to shut up. It was just another drug movie,\nexcept it was a brain drug and not heroin.\n"
"\nThis is my favourite movie with Bradley Cooper !!! I watched it like 10\ntimes !! I recommend this movie to everyone ! This story is excellent\nand the actor talent of Bradley Cooper are Amazing, I was hoping I can\ntaste this NZT some day hahah . With this movie Bradley Cooper is one\nof my favourite actor now and I buy this movie in bluray too , Im\nimpatient to see his future movie I think 7.3 is too low for this movie\nso keep it go up ! and if NZT exist some day , call me I think Robert\nDe Niro and Bradley Cooper does a Great team ! And I want more movie\nwith these two actor in the same movie . In November 2012 we will be\nserved .\n"
"\nMy friends recommended me this movie, but in fact what encouraged me to\nwatch it was Bradley Cooper. I like this man. This movie worth every\nminute of watching. The brilliant about this movie is the story. A new\nway to make the mind work 100% full power. It showed us a lot of\npossibilities about what can be \"The Full Power\" of a human mind. I\nread about these stuff every now and then, but I didn't imagine it like\nthat. The writer who had this idea and this scenario is genius and have\na lot of imagination. And also the ways Eddy handled his problems with\nwere very interesting and smart. I mean every problem he faced, he\nfound a quick solution for it. At last, he managed to balance his life. <br><br>VERY AMAZING MOVIE!!!!!! 10 out of 10...............\n"
"\nLimitless could have been a great story that highlights addiction in\nour society. Addiction to pharmaceuticals and to power. Here is a guy\nlike a lot of people in our society, supposedly down and out who then\nis given a drug that makes him smarter. What does he do with it, well\nwhat every man in this capitalistic society would do-he finds a way to\nmake lots of money. The story does a good job of making you feel his\naddiction which I guess is because of some decent acting. The problem\nis the ending of the movie. Everyone who has become addicted to this\ndrug is faced with the consequences except for the principle character.\nThis is a mistake. There are always consequences when you are addicted\nto something whether it be drugs or power. There are always\nconsequences when your actions are nothing but selfish. The movie\nshould have had the guts to show that.\n"
"\nSeriously the director and writers need help!.. the film Is basically a\ndisaster of 100 never ending sub plots that start and don't end\n(completely pointless)...there are so many questionable scenes where\nyou stop and think \"am I stupid enough to watch this\", the characters\nare all boring and clich√©, you really wouldn't care if they live or\ndie... , oh and the unnecessary narrating , seriously we're not dumb we\nunderstand what's going on, seriously the narrating explains everything\ngoing on as if the audience are blind or something...look I'm a really\noptimistic person but Im angry because the reviews on here convinced me\nto watch it seriously DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME :)\n"
"\nThey say we only use a small percent of our brains . This movie shows\nhow it would look like if we used some more of it . And it's not even\nSciFi , because it shows a real possibility that every one of use have\n- ability to fully concentrate in a present moment , without usual mind\ndistractions , emotional patterns and compulsive thinking , or any\nother kind of wasting energy and losing focus on what we are , where we\nare and what are we doing Now . And the real pill is called meditation\n!<br><br>With a great message that movie carries within , all other aspects are\nstunning also - direction , acting , music , scenery ... Simply enough\n- author know what he wanted to say and how to say it in a way that\nwill suck you up instantly in it and throw you back at your seat just\nin time so you can make your own point of view and extract a meaning\nfrom it .<br><br>And if you are not searching for any meaning , just fun - you'll find\nit here . Just watch it !\n"
"\nI watched this movie 7-8 times in the first week after seeing it for\nthe first time. Not because I had some bias going into it or because I\nwanted to like it that badly. It is just that awesome. I cannot say\nthat about any other movie I have ever seen.<br><br>Why is it so good? It's original, creative, funny, suspenseful, but\nwhat it makes it truly unique is the way in which it provokes thought\nunlike any other movie before it as far as the viewers bettering\nthemselves in life. <br><br>If you had access to 100% of your brain and had unlimited powers, how\nwould you maximize them? What would be your ultimate dream???\n"
"\nLimitless is a great movie with an amazing story line,which is well\nthought out,clever and very different,and also a very talented\ncast,with fantastic performances from people such as Bradley Cooper,an\nactor I never treated seriously before because of movies like The\nHangover and The A- Team,but today he has showed that he really can\nact,even being nominated for best actor this year at the Academy Awards\nfor Silver Linings Playbook.I also thought Abbie Cornish,Andrew Howard\nand of course Robert De Niro all did a fantastic job.<br><br>Eddie Morra (Bradley Cooper) starts taking illegal pills from his\nex-wife's brother,which keeps you very concentrated and focused,and\nlead to him becoming very successful,but come with side effects.\n"
"\nI've seen this film twice and loved it even more the second time. I\nabsolutely adored the opening sequence as it gives you some idea of the\nspeed of the journey you know you're going to take. Yes there are small\nholes in the plot, and questions you may ask, but the very nature of\nthe film is not based on real life so who cares? Bradley Cooper is\nbrilliant, and very engaging to watch, The direction and cinematography\nof the film are its major selling point, because as the story develops,\nthe colour and clarity of the film become brighter. Bradley delivers\nhis lines faster and faster, and Robert De Niro gives the film that\nlittle bit of extra credibility, and has been cast in the perfect role.\nIt's a fun, exciting story, with a great idea behind it, and enough eye\ncandy to suit all the women out there. THOSE EYES !!!! As for the men,\nthey'll appreciate the slightly sci-fi wrapping, and the fight scenes,\nbut above all the comedic lines that flow along nicely with the pace of\nthe movie. Brilliant entertainment.\n"
"\nIsn't Bradley Cooper doing better since The Hangover? Hell, YES! And\nhow? By taking up roles like Edward Morra!<br><br>Limitless is a cinema wonder, thriller of its own kind which promises\nto keep you clinging. And yes, it succeeds halfway. After twenty\nminutes, you are stuck back to the magnet. Direction is pretty\nappreciable with the effects standing out.<br><br>Limitless is fabulous when it comes to intriguing people out of their\nsenses. It makes us think. It makes us laugh. It makes us introspect!<br><br>You will need to watch this if liked Inception, The Butterfly Effect\nand sorts!<br><br>Can be watched with a typical Indian family? Yes<br><br>Language: Mild Sex: Yes. Couple of scenes. No exposure. Mouth-Kiss:\nYes. Nudity: Yes. Female breasts are visible during carnal knowledge.\nViolence: Little\n"
"\nRobert De Niro is usually a sure way to know that the movie is going to\nbe above average and this is the case again even though he is put back\nin the movie and takes a backseat.<br><br>This does not make the movie any less watchable but it does not make it\ngood either.<br><br>The movie is story which revolves around the myth that humans only use\n10% of their brain and what might be possible if we could use all of it\nBradley Cooper plays the main guy and he does it very well, his acting\nis beliveble and you could not expect more.<br><br>The only problem with the movie is that its not deep or comes with any\nmoral suggestions or lecture, so if you like a action movie where you\ncan turn the brain of and enjoy then this is definitely the one to see.<br><br>Just don't expect a deep movie or a movie that demands anything of you\nas a viewer.\n"
"\n***Spoilers Below*** The reason for the title is that there was no end\nto the ways that this movie could have been better. I enjoyed it.\nHowever, I expected much, much more. Anyone as smart as Morra was\nsupposed to be in this movie would have made more NZT right away.\nMoreover, he would have never been duped into leaving the NZT with his\nlawyer. Also, I wasn't on NZT but knew as soon as they talked about\nHank Atwood's \"meteoric rise\" and how \"frail\" he looks, that he was.\nWhy didn't Morra? <br><br>I also thought that there would be more De Niro and fewer meaningless\nclips of his blackouts. This entire subplot lent nothing to the story\nand were easily cured by \"getting sleep and remembering to eat.\" Also\nhe talks about an increased dose. The drug was explained as allowing\nyou to access 100% of your brain. Do two pills allow you to access 200%\nof your brain? Makes no sense to me.<br><br>Good movie. Could have been great.\n"
"\nSince it's been a couple of weeks that I watched this movie, here are\nmy thoughts: Bradley Cooper has now come into his own among compelling\nmovie stars with this, his first film in which he's the whole show. He\nplays an aspiring novelist who has writer's block. That is, until his\nformer brother-in-law provides him with a drug that helps him functions\nall parts of his brain. So Cooper does lots of things to the point of\nhim skipping through time and being way over his head when some\ntroubling revelations of his doings come up...Though quite\nentertaining, some of the logic lapses near the end. Still, with such\nfine supporting turns from, among others, Abbie Cornish, Anna Friel,\nand the one and only Robert De Niro, not to mention some trippy camera\nshots, Limitless is a quite entertaining for the 90 or so minutes that\npass.\n"
"\nThis movie could have been named, \"Potential\". We went to this movie in\na theatre thinking that it was going to be a really interesting movie\nabout brain possibilities. Many people have already commented on what\nsort of things were illogical about this movie so I won't repeat them.\nMy husband and I were both very disappointed because while it had some\ngood special effects, the storyline was poorly written, the characters\nwere weak, and the ending was pathetic. We kept waiting for something\nto happen that was even slightly believable and it didn't. Then it just\nended. It would have been better named as \"Endless\". We could give it a\nlittle higher mark for the special effects, but because there was such\ngreat promising topic and then such a let down it gets a \"1\".\n"
"\nI got the privileged to go to an advance screening of Limitless with A\nQ and a with screenwriter Lesley Dixon at my school tonight. I came in\nwith very low expectations due to the horrible advertising but came out\nwith a big smile and a feeling of satisfaction. The movie is very\nunique in every aspect. The dialog is comparable to The Social Network\nin intricacy and craftsmanship, the acting was great (not Oscar worthy\nbut got the job done very well), Music/Sound was very enjoyable and\nunique, the cinematography/color palate was great but the editing stood\nout the most and will definitely be nominated for an Oscar. With the\nscreenwriter having more freedom than most writers these days as well\nas her producing input, it aloud the movie to be well crafted and\ntastefully done rather than a Hollywood crap flick. It is definitely\nthe best movie of the year so far, which isn't really saying much, but\nhopefully it sets the bar for even better films to come.\n"
"\nLimitless is by far one of my favorite movies just because of how\nintense the film is. You are always wondering what will happen next and\nwhat will happen with Eddie Morra and his adventure with this pill.\nThis pill that Morra takes let's him use the other 80% of our brain\nthat we supposedly never get to use. It makes you extremely intelligent\nto the point where you can do anything. I love adventure and action so\nthis movie suits me. It was really interesting how they brought science\ninto the film with the pill and how to find a way where all people\ncould use it. The only down part to this movie would be that this pill\nis very unrealistic and is almost impossible to be done. The acting was\nphenomenal to say the least. I felt like I was in the movie trying to\nfind out how people could live off the pill. Some people say that the\nmovie is too unrealistic because if someone's IQ shot up that high,\nthey could get sick or die. To me, it is a movie, not real life, and it\nwas great.\n"
"\nLimitless is Bradley Cooper's first crack at a leading role. He pulls\nit off as a head strong, cocky man, on the upward slope after coming in\nto contact with a drug that releases 100% of his brain's ability. The\ndrug is the captivating yet corrupt attraction, with Cooper's freshly\nobtained confidence and comatose knowledge being something we'd love to\nexperience. Blah's (Cooper) rapid ascent has its setbacks though.\nJuggling a relationship with unchecked intelligence, a crazed Russian\non his case and a stock exchange job under Robert De Niro threatens to\nengulf a simple plot. Instead, director Neil Burger manages to unravel\nit neatly by soundly crossing them over. The script is direct, aided by\nCooper's voice-over and the plot's enhanced by firm acting. Unlocking\nthe brain's full power could take us to places unimaginable. Thankfully\na realistic approach is taken to avoid doubt amongst its viewers.\n"
"\nPerfect argument ! The idea of a pill that allows you to access 100% of\nour brain is just perfect ! A solid baseline with no space for\nexaggeration that combines the super power that the drug gives and the\nhangover that hits him when he doesn't take a pill. Then the flashback\nin the beginning makes perfectly sense ! It let us better comprehend\nthe hole picture and at the same time wondering if he is gonna jump or\nnot. The only thing I didn't understood was that ending...they could\nperfectly explore more Eddie's life history and provide us a more\nconsensual ending. I saw Lucy, the other movie with a similar concept,\nand it was rubbish. Limitless is way better then Lucy !\n"
"\nI remembered I watched this movie several years ago. However, I did not\nremember much. I guess I probably only used 20% or less of my brain the\nfirst time.:-) I watched it again last night and found it was quite\nentertaining. Roger Ebert did not give too good a praise. His reason\nwas the movie should focus on the comprehension of human brain not the\nmemory. I think he got the point. How the brain connect the existed\ninformation to generate solutions to the problems would be a more\nlogical approach to the whole story. However, the Adrenalin rush scenes\nare exciting and keep you suspended. Brandley Cooper gave a solid\nperformance just wish he would have been given a better plot.\n"
"\nI have seen this movie more you can imagine. why? Here is an\nexplanation. One of the reasons which involved my watching this film\nwas how human brains can amazingly work with simple one tablet of drug.\nHow much amazing things can be created. And if it exist in real life\nhow great stuff could be done. But... Every great breakthrough has its\nown drawbacks. Not everyone wants it to use for good purpose. So in\nthis movie you could deeply think of good and bad sides of drugs like\nmaking your brains work 100%. Of course all these action movies has its\nown love stories which makes film sweeter. Enjoy watching. Hope it will\nbecome one of best your ever seen movies like mine. Cheers.\n"
"\nGreat story line and overall acting. Appreciated the visuals this movie\nincorporated without doing too much. One of my favorite movies. I\nspecifically enjoyed the colorless to colorful transitions the director\nincorporated. The idea of this movie created more life in the mind of\nthe viewer for endless possibilities. Light humor provided some smooth\nscene transitions. The movie creates an image in the mind of the viewer\nthat definitely lasts. Watching this you never become lost in the\nstoryline and the plot is very understandable so it allows for great\nflowing. The actors do great jobs of portraying their roles and even\nthe extras seem involved in each scene they are incorporated into. I\ngive it a 8/10 because its doesn't seem to be a timeless movie. But I\nloved it\n"
"\nBrilliant storyline and makes you wonder how many instant fame type\nevents in the past \"could be\" related if this drug was possible. The\nfilm does contain strong graphic scenes and language at times, but does\nnot detract from the impact that the storyline has on one's psyche. Be\nwarned - this film will leave you realizing just how easily we fall\nvictim to substance abuse and the influence of power. Sometimes we seem\nto grasp at straws in order to make some sense of our lives - it would\nbe fantastic to have an \"assistant\" like this - just to help us focus.\nBut will we apply our new found focus and intellect to the betterment\nof mankind? The film will also peak the curiosity in the domain of\nexperimental drugs and the ethics involved in testing these on humans.\n"
"\nScience says that you can access only 20% of your brain but Eddy Morra\nhas other ideas. He decides to up his ante to 100. This movie takes on\na crazy ride that fills your entire body with an adrenaline rush that\nhas a lasting effect. Bradley Cooper acts in a way you won't feel he's\nacting. Robert de Niro is a perfect thug to Cooper's innocent but soon\nto become mafia of sorts. Abbie Cornish is the only person who spoils\nan other wise perfect cast. She is irritating and just spoils the whole\nexperience. But alas! The promise of the first half does not lead up to\nthe perfect movie it was supposed to be. The ending was predictable.\nBut still it was good enough to be one of the best movies sci-fi or\notherwise that I have seen.\n"
"\nAnother good one that I discovered on Netflix. It's about a down and\nout writer who runs into a friend that offers to help him get out of\nhis rut. The friend offers the writer an experimental pill that his\ncompany is working on. He has nothing to lose, so he takes it. On the\nway home, he runs into the landlady's daughter, who proceeds to chew\nhim out for being late on his rent. The pill begins to work and his\nbrain goes into overdrive. He becomes so glib that he charms the girl\ninto bed. He then realizes that his brain has been souped up and he's\ncapable of analyzing any problem and finding a solution\ninstantaneously.<br><br>He's able to write his book, he becomes a wiz stock analyst, and he\ngets his old girlfriend back. All is wonderful. But, he has to take the\npills on a regular basis, and other people discover his secret. Then,\nthings get very, very complicated. The complications strain even his\nnew powers, and his race to stay ahead of the game will keep you\nwatching.\n"
"\nUsually I am not very much into sci-fi movies, especially if full of\ntechnical, medical etc sophisticated terms, reasonings and inventions.\nLuckily to me, Limitless is, in fact, a crime thriller where the\nspecific drug is mainly triggering \"down-to-earth\" events and\nrelationship changes. However, it is no drug movie either - the main\nemphasis is on other issues than drug trafficking or miserable life of\naddicts.<br><br>Director Neil Burger has splendidly exploited the values of the book\n(The Dark Fields by Alan Glynn) as well as contemporary technical\nopportunities, but the real star/gem is Bradley Cooper whose character\nchanges are performed in a great and trustworthy manner. The always\ntalented Robert De Niro plus two pleasant actresses Abbie Cornish and\nAnna Friel provide additional value to the movie. In other words,\nLimitless is a movie recommended to all keen on respective topics and\nactors; you will not be disappointed, although the script is sometimes\nunbalanced.\n"
"\nBased on the 2001 novel The Dark Fields by Alan Glynn, 'Limitless' is A\nGreat Entertainer. An Engrossing Thriller, that never loses pace &amp;\nturns out to be a Winner. Also, Bradley Cooper &amp; De Niro are in\nTop-Form!<br><br>'Limitless' Synopsis: A writer discovers a top-secret drug which\nbestows him with super human abilities.<br><br>'Limitless' is fast, engrossing &amp; crisp. Leslie Dixon's Adapted\nScreenplay is marvelous, it never loses pace. Its highly-engaging &amp;\narresting. Neil Burger's Direction is extremely stylish. Cinematography\nis picture-perfect. Editing is decent. <br><br>Performance-Wise: As mentioned, Bradley Cooper &amp; De Niro are in\nTop-Form! Cooper takes an interesting turn as the protagonist,\ndisplaying great confidence in his portrayal. De Niro is restrained &amp;\nunmatchable, as always. He can NEVER be doubted! Abbie Cornish is quite\ngood. Anna Friel is mention-worthy &amp; Johnny Whitworth is adequate. <br><br>On the whole, 'Limitless' is a Winner. Two Thumbs Up!\n"
"\nFantastic film and it would be amazing to actually unlock your brains\nfull potential. I thought Bradley Cooper did a fantastic job, a\ncompletely different character from the hangover, although he's the\ntype of guy that can pull any look off. I thought the ending was\nperfect, showing exactly how smart he became and making Robert De niro\nlook like a loser. Which I may add is pretty damn hard because that man\njust demands respect. Really cool film which is well up to date. I even\nsee that some firms have been trying to plug the drug NZT/ the clear\npill and NZT-48, not sure if it is what it claims to be? It would be\nhard to believe that such a drug would have that effect, although it\nmakes for interesting discussion. Has Anyone else ever heard of this\nmagic drug?\n"
"\nIn my opinion limitless is a fast paced edge of your seat action\nthriller that leaves you wanting more and more. The concept of a drug\nthat would let you use 100% of your mind compared to the average humans\n20% is intriguing and exciting. I have never seen anything quite like\nit this film takes you on a ride limitless is so fast paced you won't\neven find time to blink. The film has good acting and just the right\nblend of New York atmosphere mixed with a sci-fi feel. The tension was\nthe same of as any good action move but the plot kept it teasingly\ninteresting. You could guess what was going to happen next it could\nhave been anything that's why you don't want to take your eyes of the\nscreen because one minute Eddie is hanging around with Russian drug\ndealers and the next is a million in his hi-tech apartment.\n"
"\nJust completed watching the movie and not for one single minute I could\ndivert my mind to any where else. It is a very well choreographed,\nnicely sequenced and edited movie with a strong plot. Its a must watch\nfor people who loved Inception, Dark Knight. Yes, the movie may not\nhave touched the heights of Christopher Nolan but certainly made a\nstatement of its own. Bradley Cooper has again shown his class. Robert\nde Niro is also a pleasure to see. The movie takes you through many ups\nand downs and ultimately leaves you with a thought. The movie also\nrefers to the novel based on which this movie was made. At the end I\nwould say Limitless is a super creation.\n"
"\nThis film took me by surprise when I went to see it in theaters.<br><br>I love the science fiction/thriller feel it has and the way it was done\nis interesting. <br><br>There are some cool visual and special effects throughout, good\nediting, creative directing, and cinematography that could be nominated\nhonestly. <br><br>Bradley Cooper is a great lead in this role because his character is\ndifferent than his other \"frat guy\" characters. I'm interested in\nseeing his next leading roles.<br><br>Though there are some inconsistencies in the script, the whole film\ntogether was very original.\n"
"\nActing: 7/10 Plot: 9/10 Effects: 8/10 Continuity: 8/10 Other: 9/10\nWatching the trailer made me unsure whether this really was the film\nfor me, but the film grasps your attention from the very start. I\nwatched it twice in one week because I simply NEEDED to show the film\nto my friend, to show her how good it was!!! There are a few continuity\nissues, and it was a little complicated for my slow brain to\ncomprehend, and also the acting was good, but could have been\nbetter.......... But this film definitely makes it to my personal Top\n5! The plot is clever and the script is full of wit and this is echoed\nby the ingenious filming and effects, and is a thoroughly good watch\nthat leaves the viewer buzzing once the credits are up! 8/10\n"
"\nDirected by Neil Burger, \"Limitless\" offers fast pacing and solid\nentertainment for it's runtime. It is slickly edited and delves into\nthe drug-world adeptly. (spoiler) It is chiefly a fantasy, but I\nthought the characters and thus storytellers fell pretty short in\ncreating worthwhile goals given the kinds of powers they were\nin-stating or describing. (spoiler) The Bradley Cooper character can\nuse huge amounts of his brain power, but what does he use it for?\nRunning for the US Presidency, and his own selfish purposes\n(?)....that's a bit shallow. Anyway while I thought the filmmakers\nthematically could've made better endpoints, their cast and direction\nis a glossy fun picture with excellent cues, great narration, and\nquick-witted dialog. Overall Recommended.\n"
"\nYou know that feeling when you get out of the movie theatre and the\nmovie had altered your mindset and you only came back to your senses\nafter a an hour or so. Even after that the movie had such an impact on\nyou every time you will hear the name of that movie something of that\ngreatness you tasted comes back for even years or decades after you've\nseen it Well this is that kind of movie, It will grab your attention\nthe moment you start watching and it will only let you go(for a little\nbit) when the credits roll. And it won't be because of action scenes\nonly , tension or drama. It will grasp you in every way because it\ntouches (almost) every way of the human soul. We all want to be gods\nbut we already struggle so hard to be human. Prepare to be limitless...<br><br>I could tell you so much more about this movie, but i won't, reviews\nthat spoil are in my opinion bad reviews.<br><br>Whoever you are, go watch this movie!\n"
"\nHe is really a lucky dog! But I think the plot is really not good.<br><br>I don't know what messages the movie expects to tell us, and It missed\nmany details. It seems like an ugly man finally beat another ugly man\nand won the game. It has no inner beauty but an entertainment movie.\nIt's really funny and satisfied the desire in our mind.<br><br>What I learned from the movie is that never lose hope and trust\nyourself. Everybody has his own value, as long as he can develop his\npotential abilities. Heaven must be a way. <br><br>Regard to the actors, their performance is good. Cooper's eyes are\nbeautiful.\n"
"\nThis movie didn't meet my expectations in any way. It was too long,\npretentious, not structured and not exciting enough. <br><br>Biggest reason why the movie is average is that there was no\ndevelopment of character and sense of purpose. From a druggie with\nhealth problems the guy miraculously became someone with a brilliant\nmind and no issues whatsoever. And it was not clear what was his\nmotivation overall. Did he do all this stuff because he HAD to use all\nthis new energy or he had some overall goal that was important for him?\nThe movie fails to clarify this. <br><br>Two things that were fun though. 1. Cooper is a good actor. It was fun\nhow they used the color of his eyes to stress his \"condition\". 2. The\ngirlfriend chasing scene where she has to take the drug to escape. This\nwas the only exciting scene in the movie.<br><br>Overall not horrible, but certainly below average.\n"
"\nBradley Cooper gets addicted to a drug that allows him to utilize 100%\nof his brain at the cost of some nasty withdrawal symptoms. During the\napex of the movie, in a life or death situation in which he \"needs\" the\ndrug to survive two men hunting him down, he literally starts drinking\nthe blood of the other addict he just killed off the ground, and like\nPopeye eating his spinach, bounces up and handles the other two guys.<br><br>The ending was also horrid. They might as well filmed me at work\nstaring at my computer for 5 minutes and showed that and they would've\nhad the same affect. Can't recall a movie with a more anti-climactic\nending...<br><br>Other than that, the first 75% of the film was interesting.\n"
"\nI like the special effect zooming scenes, but the plot was very week.\nLet me see, if I became super smart what would I do? I would finish my\nbook and try to make as much money as I can. Oh yea, and I would not\nthink of \"how do I make this drug?\" until I was in a stupid state; WTF-\nhe had to be off the drug to think of that? There was not even the\nslightest hint that he would use his super intelligence to better\nmankind. I do not know about most people, but things like this made me\nthink the movie to be totally stupid and child like...very ridiculous.\nAnd if someone can quintuple their money four days in a row,WHY ONE\nEARTH would he need to borrow $100,000? I believe he said \"quintuple\nevery day for the last 4 days\". Let me see, starting out with $800,\nwould that not put him right at $100,000 already? WHY! on earth would\nhe need to borrow money from the mob. And if he did borrow it and was\nsuper smart, why would he then not repay the loan on time. (kind of\nstupid don't you think) This makes no sense what so ever.\n"
"\nthe idea for the movie was very interesting and \"fresh\", but there are\nmultiple choices made which could have been better... <br><br>first of all... hate the tunneling effect which was used on several\noccasions... <br><br>in the story line the guy supposed to have \"4 digit IQ\"... I will not\nget in to how preposterous that sounds, but the \"smart guy\" while\n\"quintupling\" his funds a day and having 2g in cash went to a extremely\ndangerous mobster to get a loan of 100k... simple math suggests that he\nwould make 250k in 3 days with 2k what he had if he really was\n\"quintupling\" daily... so does not look too smart to me engaging with\nmob...<br><br>and there are many other illogical choices the guy made... like if he\nhad substantial amount of these pills why he did not \"get smart\" and\nmake them himself? <br><br>and ending was just disappointing.\n"
"\nIt's well done, don't get me wrong, but beyond Eddie Mora saying some\nwitty thing that you kind of want to laugh at, there's no way to relate\nto the character. He gets the girl, the job and the intelligence? I\nguess it speaks to our desires for easy ways through life without any\nside-effects, but ergh, the whole movie just left me feeling bad.<br><br>You can try getting in to the deep spiritual meanings of the movie and\nwhat it means to be \"limitless\", but in the end I feel you're going to\nbe disappointed.<br><br>The movie itself is well directed and the effects (especially the fast\nforwarding through the streets) are good. I'm happy to see a Sci-Fi\nmovie get this much attention.\n"
"\nWhat a great premise. What happens if we can take a drug to make us\nsmarter? Well, this movie starts to explore the concept and then falls\napart. Do smart people make mistakes? Does absolute power corrupt\nabsolutely? Were the writers of this movie fired midway through the\nproject? <br><br>Perhaps the writers need to take the drug that Limitless provides. This\nmovie starts off well, then completely falls apart. There is no reason\nto care what happens to any of the characters.<br><br>Mr. Cooper and Mr. De Niro are perfect casting. The acting is great.\nHowever, the script takes a left turn, and the movie makes zero sense.\nI hope Mr. Cooper can find better scripts. <br><br>I am choosing to not give away details. This could have been just a bad\nTV movie.\n"
"\nBasically, guy takes pimped up version of Adderall and exciting stuff\nhappens. I'm surprised no one else made this comparison. I guess for us\nADD folks it's the difference between taking your meds and not taking\nthem. It's pretty funny actually, when I was trying to remember the\nname of this movie to another ADD friend I said, \"You know, the one\nwhere the guy takes super Adderall and he can do super stuff?\" And he\nsays, \"Oh yeah, you mean Limitless!\"\n"
"\nWhile there is a nicely, innovative, sweeping photographic technique\nused in the beginning credits and later in the movie, there potential\nsophisticated intelligence expected from a movie with this theme seems\nto be missing. Consider how Robert Redford performs his seemingly\nintriguing ploy without medicinal enhancement at decade earlier in Spy\nGame (2001). Or consider what Scarlett Johansson accomplished in Lucy\n(2014) three years later. The plot just seems to be missing the\nintelligence and the De Niro aspect might have been better just as its\nown stand alone little drama.\n"
"\nWhat if you take a pill that allows you to use 100% of your brain? Of\ncourse, you could become an excellent writer and why not make some\nmoney with the stock market. Old dreams of the average American man ...\nThis movie makes for one hour and some minutes spectators dream to\nchange their lives just eating a pill. And this is the marketing idea\nbehind the movie: a pleasant escape from reality, mixed with a soft\nthriller. It's a pity that it ends there ... Scientifically speaking is\nnot the percentage of your brain that you use that makes you smarter\nbut is more a matter of the number of interconnections. The same I\nthink is for the movies: is not only the original idea that makes them\nsmart but also the number of interconnections with the reality and the\ntruth.\n"
"\nYou take a pill, and your mind clears. You can consider dozens of\nscenarios at once. You have perfect recall. You find yourself able to\nkeep up with, and even surpass the smartest people on the planet. <br><br>What do you do? What challenges do you face? At what cost will you gain\nyour wildest dreams?<br><br>The movie shows the desperation and need of a drug addict, given the\nperspective of someone who believes that the drug actually benefits\ntheir life. It demonstrates the ambition of someone who honestly\nbelieves that they can have it all. And it does it well. As someone who\ngoes to a elite liberal arts school, I have seem people with absolutely\nfreakish levels of intelligence and ambition. And they think and/or\nbehave shockingly similarly to Eddie Morra. So this movie is not really\nas unrealistic as people might think.<br><br>Bradley Cooper really makes this film. This is only a 9 out of 10\nbecause the plot dominates the roles of all the other characters, so we\ndon't really get to see their complexities.\n"
"\nThe beginning got me hooked. It was great. Lots of philosophical\nthings, like in Mr Robot, which I REALLY LIKE. But as the movie kept on\ngoing, I got bored and bored. Nothing new was happening. Just the\nexpected. I expected him to get rich &amp; successful, and he did. 30\nminutes left and I can't finish the movie.<br><br>With this sort of drug he just went to be successful as a businessman,\nand not fulfill his dreams which he got screwed by and was poor because\nof them? Nah, just 1 book and lets do something else. EVERYTHING he\nwanted, and he wasted it on things that without the drug he can't have.\nLike being smart.<br><br>The main character is stupid. I can't be sympathetic towards him. He\nwas the cause of his on demise in his life. His gf breaking up with him\nbc of the drug is also very expected. <br><br>I gave it a 6 only because I like the cinematography. it would have\nbeen a 5 or 4 because it's JUST SO DULL. They could have cut SO MANY un\nneeded parts and \"fast forward\" some of the plot to keep it\ninteresting.\n"
"\nWhile I found this movie extremely entertaining, the story line to a\nsmall degree resembles an episode from the old Outer Limits TV Series\ntitled Expanding Human. The story line was that a group of professors\nand students at a college were experimenting with an experimental new\ndrug that enhanced both the mind and the body. It allowed one of the\nprofessor's, Skip Homier, after taking the drug, to become this hulking\nstrong man with super strength and intelligence. The opening teaser of\nthe episode shows this hulking figure slowly walking down a college\nhallway in the middle of the night and ripping a steal door off its\nhinges and then choking the night watchmen while he holds him two feet\noff the floor. Watch the episode and you may see some similarities\nbetween Limitless and this episode.\n"
"\nSomething very close to NZT was discovered log ago: coffee and\ncigarettes. This dynamic combination has been demonstrated to improve\ncognitive ability--though many, perhaps rightly, don't like the\ndelivery mechanism.<br><br>The movie is not all that interesting. The main way it ropes in the\nviewer is to make him ask--over and over again--gee, what if I could do\nthat! Otherwise, the tale is high-tech version of Faust except that\nMephistopheles has been replaced by a drug. Our hero goes for the money\nand the babes.<br><br>Given that the mechanism by which intellect is associated with the\nbrain has not been established (it is not necessarily a sole\nconsequence of neural complexity) I don't know how anyone can say that\n\"we use only about 20% of our brain.\" For those who are curious, there\nare many good arguments out there for why the mind is not a matter of\nbrain mechanics but something all together different--transcendent, you\nmight say. Start with the writings of Hubert Dreyfus, Roger Penrose and\nStanley Jaki.\n"
"\nWhen he takes this pill, he basically gains super-human intelligence...\nSo, first off, why the heck doesn't he just figure out how to make the\ndrug on his own so he has an endless supply? If a normal person created\nthe drug, there is no doubt he should be able to figure out what the\ndrug consists of and how to make it in record time, especially once he\nhas the means (money) to buy the equipment and whatever he needs to\ntest/create it. Secondly, by the end of the movie, you would think he\nwould buy a gun or two for protection since there are goons constantly\ncoming after him to hurt or kill him. But no, no guns for some strange\nreason. The smartest man in the world is being targeted and he doesn't\nhave the common sense to buy a gun (whether he buys it legally or\nillegally it doesn't matter).\n"
"\nI am pretty sure that you wouldn't do what this guy did. Anyway, it is\na fun movie with an interesting premise and they even made a TV series\nof it, so if you like it, you could carry on having the fun.<br><br>The story is about a guy who inadvertently finds a stash of mind\nenhancing drugs. He climbs up in the world pretty fast, so people\nnotice and try to stop him, naturally. The way they do it and how he\nhandles them is pretty hard to swallow, but then again, if you were\nreally smart you wouldn't use your own person and name to become famous\nin stock trading. You would just make money, discreetly.<br><br>The acting is OK, I would say the Bradley Cooper's acting makes the\nfilm more than the subject (or the horrible soundtrack). The script\nneeded an overhaul, though, so don't expect something terribly smart\n(see what I did there?) At least it's not Lucy.\n"
"\nThe idea behind the story is first-rate, a pill that allows a person to\nuse the available brain power that goes unused normally. By the middle\nof the picture and even before that, however, the story development\nfalters and becomes haphazard, as if a team of clashing brains had done\nthe writing and no one had the overall thing in hand so as to avoid\nobvious plot holes, and these are pointed out in the very first IMDb\nreview.<br><br>The picture is fun, though. The transformation of Bradley Cooper\nthrough makeup and appearance and body language is quite amazing. The\nphotographic tricks used to convey brain alterations contribute too.\nThe idea of making him a financial wizard is a good way to develop it,\nbut his idea of being a Senator is just fair. There needed to be a more\nconsistent obstacle or antagonist. At times, the picture lapsed into\nstandard chase scenes as if filling some action quotient. This clashed\nwith the rest of it. The way it opened and then a flashback worked\nwell.\n"
"\nThe premise of Limitless is highly intriguing and the casting of\nBradley Cooper in the lead role makes us hard to look away from the\nscreen. The charismatic Cooper carries the movie on his shoulders as he\ninhabits his character perfectly and makes the movie a treat to watch.\nOn receiving a mysterious drug which supposedly allows an individual to\naccess 100 percent of his brain, Bradley Cooper's character is able to\ncomplete a novel in 4 days by taking this wonder pill. As his\nambitiousness grows, he decides to use his deductive skills to make\nsome quick money in the stock market. Even though the effects of the\ndrug made a remarkable turnaround in his life, its side-effects were\nstarting to show up which happened on withdrawal of the drug. The flaw\nin this movie is that a lot of action seems to happen at a convenient\ntime and it seems a little unrealistic. Also, at the end we do not know\nthe whereabouts of the people in his home. The movie was a decent one\nbut do not have exceedingly high expectations.\n"
"\n(61%) A very watchable popcorn thriller with neat direction, good\nproduction values, a degree of bite, fine support, and a strong leading\nperformance from Bradley Cooper. The premise is implemented well even\nif the script wants to get absolutely every last drop of use it\npossibly can out of it. There's a clear warning about drugs that runs\nthrough, but you would be hard pushed to call this a valid morality\ntale which in the balance of play is a good thing. This despite being\nfar from great is certainly worth a look for its sheer style and was at\nleast partly worthy of the massive attention it had ladled upon it upon\nits release.\n"
"\nit was a good time seeing this movie.. but it has a slow start ... this\nguy is like my favorite actor good job, the story line is complicated\nin between but see it with patience u will understand every thing in\nthe end .. the ending is not something u wont like but it is something\nthat suits the movie the writer really did a good job on this book for\nsure .. its a total imaginary thing. like it really do . people liked\nit a lot ? not sure but some how still feel the movie needs a little\nmore to it that it missed out. see it you will like it no spoilers!!\njust 8 stars coz of the beginning was slow and the complicated dialog\nit has.\n"
"\nCan't say much about the plot of Limitless without ticking the spoiler\nbox. But I will say that it's a great little SF film. Well thought out,\nthough there are a couple of plot clangers that hurt a bit.<br><br>I don't understand why this film got bucketed so much when it came out\n- I'd quite happily keep a copy on the shelf. It's certainly not\nembarrassing (anyone seen Lucy?? Similar concept, but not the same, and\ndone by complete drooling idiots).<br><br>I really like Limitless, it's gripping, intelligent and stylish. The\nparts of the story that are there purely for plot, and don't make a\nhuge amount of sense, don't spoil it - it bounces back from them.<br><br>Haters gonna hate, but I don't have to listen to them.<br><br>Limitless rocks.\n"
"\nWell written sci-fi-ish thriller. I actually became a fan, which I\nnever really do, of the actor Bradley Cooper with this movie. It would\nreally be great if, and there probably already is and we just don't\nknow it, if there really was a drug that would greatly enhance your\nintelligence like the drug that is depicted in this movie. The movie\nitself was filmed in a riveting style with all kinds of things really\nhappening to this guy now that he has enhanced his confidence with the\ndrug that made him extremely intelligent. Things really start to happen\nas soon as the main character takes his first pill and that is what\ndrives the viewer to keep watching this great movie. Plus the\ninteresting manner in which the movie was filmed made it very good to\nlook at. Sorry to say I missed this at the theaters and only started to\nwatch this now that cable will play this on the tube. Action. Suspense.\nMystery. Thrills. Very beautiful women in compromising situations. What\nmore can a guy ask for?\n"
"\nthis movie is entertain enough to watch. good visual effect, good\ndirecting, many great actors like one of the best actor ever Robert De\nNiro. and also for Bradley Cooper, i think he is suitable for Edward\nMora character, he is charming, smart, and powerful. and of course i\nlove Abbie Cornish, she is so beautiful and sweet. she is one of my\nfavorite actress. every actor in this movie is success to play their\nrole. but one thing that i don't like about this movie is the ending. i\ndon't like it because the ending of this movie does not give a moral\nmessage that drugs is not good to use. otherwise it explain that drugs\ncan makes us be successful person. it describe at the ending that\nEdward Mora still under pill influence.<br><br>but overall this movie is entertain and fun to watch. but always\nremember that we still can be success without drugs.\n"
"\nA smart little thriller this one. Lots of chases and runs as our lead\non the bottom rung of the ladder ends up with some super drug that\nmakes him super smart and super active.<br><br>Bradley Cooper is our main man who leads the show and tries to outwit\nand outrun all the men after him. The pills are more than worth their\nweight in gold, but scarcity is a valuable commodity. Super\nintelligence means our main man makes a fortune from the markets, but\nis he alone with the secret of this drug? Also has he become too smart\nfor his own good that it has put him in danger? <br><br>It's not just our main man who's sharp. So is the direction and\ncinematography. Script is good and the fellow actors do a fine job.\nHowever, despite lots of plus points it's enjoyable and engrossing but\nnothing special. Just doesn't grip enough, and as you will unlikely\nempathise with any of the characters, you just won't invest anything in\nit. It's intriguing and intelligent but vacuous.<br><br>It's a fair film, a good Saturday night movie, but won't much go beyond\nthat.\n"
"\nI loved this movie, i think it had a very good idea behind it but there\nare some plot problems. overall i think it was a good movie, the idea\nthat someone had invented a designer drug which would turn a person\ninto a super smart brain child is a good one. the idea of a down on his\nluck loser writer, happens to run into an ex-brother-in-law who just\nhappened to be a drug dealer was kinda out there but believable enough.\nthen you have to add the element of the star always in danger, that\nkeeps the audience wondering what was going to happen. the ending was\nkinda out there too, but all in all, it was a good movie to watch. i\nliked the idea of the movie and enjoyed it very much. it was a fun\nmovie with a feel good ending.\n"
"\nI've seen this movie twice and there is not a dull moment in it. Like\nmost movies there are things best not questioned; such as why is the\nprotagonist so ambitious? This one is exciting primarily because the\ndialogue is flawless. The acting is most believable too. It's an\nexiting and believable story about an ordinary guy who suddenly finds a\nway to get it all together. It's a story with which we can all\nidentify.<br><br>Imagine that you can suddenly figure out every situation and know how\nto react. Yet the main character is an outsider with no big\nconnections. It's for real but a fantasy too. The viewer is brought\nalong because the narrator is inside his mind and thinking along with\nthe viewer.<br><br>Don't confuse the title \"Limitless\" with another movie titled\n\"Unlimited. The latter may be fine but it's another movie\n"
"\nThis movie is awesome! Bradley Cooper shines in this psychological\nthriller about brain function and drug use. He meets an old friend who\ngives him an experimental drug that helps him use 100 percent of his\nbrain. This drug helps him turn his life around and become much more\nconfident and successful. This film is full of one great montage after\nanother, plus the jump cuts get your mind racing to keep up. The\ninteresting thing is that's how the main character feels in the film as\nwell. Its almost as if your being put into the main characters head as\nyou watch. The scenes are crisp and the cinematography is clean. It's a\ngreat movie to watch because of the experience it provides.<br><br>Check out my full review with video at -\nhttp://off2themovies.blogspot.com/2011/12/limitless.html\n"
"\nLimitless is a high movie. Bradley Cooper is an author suffering from\nwriter's block and his life seems to be spiralling out of control.<br><br>He comes across a designer drug called NZT that allows him to function\nhis brain at greater heights. All of a sudden he becomes smarter, learn\nfaster and recall memory from the distant past.<br><br>However the drug is not without side effects but very soon he attracts\nthe attention of gangsters and business tycoons.<br><br>Cooper invests in his character and is charismatic in the lead role.\nHowever the film becomes rather sloppy, silly and leaden with the\nmystery thriller element. Its as if the the moves are telegraphed, you\nsort of know who the bad guys are and what they are after.<br><br>Decently entertaining and nothing much more to offer is how I see this\nfilm.\n"
"\nEddie Morra (Bradley Cooper) is not a genius but when he take a pill\nthat can get you access to 100% of your brain, become a genius. On the\nother hand you can imagine what would be the results if this pill gain\npublicity.<br><br>With this movie you can understand the alternations of behaviors of\npeople when they placed in the middle of the interests of everyone\nelse, as well as you can understand what has a man do to survive when\nthe pressure is too much.<br><br>Limitless is a movie that will stimulate your interest because of the\nplot and of course because of the cast and their performances ( Bradley\nCooper, Robert De Niro, Anna Friel, Abbie Cornish). It's a mystery\nmovie and if you like mystery movies then with Limitless you are going\nnot to like them but love them!\n"
"\n\"Limitless\" sends an amazing and positive message. The message is that\nwe all have unbelievable potential hidden within us that is just\nwaiting to be released. But we have to learn how to harness, control\nand use our vast intellectual potential. The movie was suspenseful,\nexciting and unpredictable but in a good way. The acting was excellent\nand believable and the plot was intriguing and creative. The cast\nmatched the roles perfectly and I enjoyed the sets, scenery and style\nof filming. I have watched this movie multiple times and enjoyed it\nevery time. It is very hard to talk about this movie without giving\naway the plot so let me just leave you with this: If you like movies\nthat are interesting, inspirational and well executed then I suggest\nyou watch, \"Limitless.\"\n"
"\nThe setup really surprised me in a very positive way. I just would have\nexpected a different ending as it remains pretty much open whether\nEddie will get off the drug at any rate or just mass-produces it in own\nlaboratories. Neither unclear remains the question about Melissa's\nfuture. Yes, she got away with it, however her body took a lot of\nconsequence there. It would have been nice to see a little more of her\nin the end. De Niro as Carl van Loon was absolutely enjoyable, he\nperformed really well. At the first glance I didn't expect anything\nwhile watching the movie, however the story shows you all kinds of ways\nto see the world out of different views. The turning point once Eddie\nwas at the balcony and the attack of Gennady was the best scene in the\nmovie.\n"
"\nThe premise is quite original and while the movie had potential, one\ncan deplore a scenario that doesn't develop enough certain points when\nthey deserved more consideration, and an ending a bit abrupt,\nfrustrating and frankly not that well handled.<br><br>Still, the plot is captivating and the different elements of the story\ninterlink each other almost perfectly and in a very fluid manner, even\nif the rhythm drops a bit after the hour mark before skyrocketing in\nthe last 15-20 minutes.<br><br>But the real strength of Limitless is the cinematography: ultra\ndynamic, inventive, polished, a huge work having been put into the\nphotography by adjusting lighting, colors and contrasts according to\nEddie's state. A real success.<br><br>As for Bradley Cooper, he clearly stands out, impeccable in his role,\n"
"\nA writer suffering from a severe case of writer's block finds a pill\nthat essentially turns him into Superman. Not only does the pill boost\nhis brain power and stamina, it also makes him an expert on anything he\nhas read or seen since birth. It's a silly premise that has the\npotential for a good comedy, but doesn't really work as drama. Given\nthat Cooper proceeds to take the pills despite the dangerous side\neffects, the story could have worked along the theme of a Faustian\nbargain. However, the film is not up to the challenge. The filmmakers\nare unsure of where to go, and the story just rambles rather aimlessly,\nculminating in an unsatisfying ending.\n"
"\nThe main character is a loser-type writer who is struggling not just\nwith a writer's block. He is basically struggling with anything in\nlife. One day he meets an old acquaintance who offers him an apparently\nlegal drug that expands your mental capacities. It works perfectly. The\nonly problem: it is highly addictive. Our loser-type writer now embarks\non a completely new life as a successful doing-everything.\nUnfortunately he soon comes in conflict with law and the lawless.<br><br>It's a great movie, which I highly recommend and offers a couple of\ninteresting, maybe even new, shots and ideas.<br><br>SPOILER! The end does not follow classical dramatic teaching. Which is\nvery nice and refreshing on one hand. It remains depressing on the\nother. Because what this movie tells us is, drugs are okay. You just\nneed to obey and calculate their drawbacks. This is a message I do find\ndisturbing.\n"
"\nIt was all going alright for me until the end part. That's when I\ndecided I didn't like this movie. I think it's too overrated.<br><br>A miracle pill turned a man's life 360 degree, and while everyone else\nwho took it were either dead or sick, this one man managed to survive\nand became superhuman even when he stopped taking it.<br><br>The plot was too easy.. and too ridiculous. I was expecting something\ntragic or an \"awakening\" part at the end where he stopped taking the\npill and he came back to normal, only this time he tried to do even\nbetter with his life and realized he could achieve great things even\nwithout the help of the pill. That part would have made the whole story\nmore believable, acceptable, and relatable to issues with illegal\ndrugs, cigarettes, alcohol, and other addiction problems that people\nthink make them invincible but didn't know it was ruining them.<br><br>This part kind of ruined the whole movie for me and made me regret\nwatching its entirety.\n"
"\nLimitless was 'messy' (in a good way) right from the start and then\nthey ended it all cut and polish. The alternate ending on the DVD was\nmuch better. If they had combined the two, I would have given Limitless\nat least a 9. As it is, 7 is generous. I am always mesmerized by\nBradley Cooper's blue eyes and Robert De Niro is one of the grand\nmasters of acting. The idea of mind enhancers is old but Limitless\npresents it in a fresh way. I liked the opposite reaction to the drug -\nEddie vs. Lindy. By-the-way, I am new to Abbie Cornish and hope she has\na long and fruitful career. He tasted the power and wanted more with\nlittle or no reservation; she tasted it and liked it but saw the\ninherent danger. Of all the locations I liked his old apartment the\nbest. It had so much character and set the basis for the contrast\nbetween pre-NZT Eddie and post-NZT Eddie (of course, clothing and hair\nhelped). What were they thinking with that ending - there was no\nstruggle, no questions. He was like the addict that finally got all the\nperks without the consequences. It just didn't fit!!!\n"
"\nI one hundred percent agree with peoples critique of the plot holes and\nshortcomings of this movie. With the right screenplay this could have\nbeen a revelation to sci-fi like The Matrix. I can only imagine what\nthis movie would have looked like if Christopher Nolan (director of\nInception and Momento) and the guys from Primer had gotten hold of this\nidea and ran with it.<br><br>However, with that being said this movie is still very enjoyable\nentertainment. The acting is good, the story (despite what it could\nhave been) is clever, witty, and engaging, and the movie is fast paced\nand never boring. I would recommend it to both people who like\nmind-bending movies and mainstream audiences alike. It has broad\nappeal. <br><br>Of course in my head I'm already dreaming up what I would have done\ndifferently with the script. However, with a movie trying to explore\nand in the process live up to the 'limitless' potential of the human\nbrain in some ways it sets itself up to fall short of an infinitely\nhigh stick of measure.\n"
"\nI like this movie fort these flaws.<br><br>Not only to laugh at, but really to question myself. Of course, I've\nlaughed to see the authors of this film imagining the\nsuper-intelligence as must serving first of all... TO GET MORE MONEY,\n2) to get sex with more girls, 3) to kick ass like Bruce Lee, 4) to get\npolitical power. (end of list) <br><br>I've laughed because I've more ambition than that and of course,\nbecause I think I'm more intelligent than the authors. Everybody is\nsure of its own intelligence, right ? But everybody forgets this\ncertainty is limited by his own intelligence. So what could be a real\n\"super-intelligence\" ? It's hard to imagine it since nobody is\nsuper-intelligent, but I'm sure it's not what this movie shows.<br><br>At least, this movie makes me asking the question (between laughs), and\nhad some good action scenes and visuals.\n"
"\nThe movie has been full of excitement until the last minute when\nBradley Cooper popped out the mandarin Chinese... Seriously if you play\nthe movie to 10 Chinese grown up in different places they will all\nburst into laughters and give you 10 different translations...made me\nthink the movie is all about proving Chinese is the hardest thing to\nlearn above all:) (from my interpretation, the last line was like BC:\"\nXX bowl of noodles, XX dumplings, XX shrimps, oh please don't give me\nthe scarf(or mono-sodium glutamate?)

"\nIgnore the reviews giving under 5. They don't know how to review\nmovies. I curse them to be forced to watch \"Super Babies\" over and over\nuntil giving 1-star to a decently made movie gives them pain. Skip the\nlong reviews, too: this film doesn't need a long review. If you like\ndramas with a little kick-ass thrown in and a little escapist fantasy,\nthis is a great film. I should probably develop my own scale for date\nmovies and rate them accordingly. That in mind, it's not a chick-flick,\nbut also not a pure testosterone film, though it leans more toward the\nguy side. De Niro's presence automatically adds at least 4 points to\nany film review, though you can scale that down a bit for \"Limitless\"\ndue to his relatively short screen time. That said, his screen time for\nplot purposes is good.<br><br>Summary: get out the popcorn and soda, or wine plus crackers and cheese\nand summer sausage and cuddle on the sofa for a balanced film.\n"
"\nThis film borrows way too much from \"Fight Club. The visual style,the\ntone of the narrative voice and certain plot devices are especially\nobvious. \"Limitless\" opens in exactly the same point in the chronology\nthat \"Fight Club\" does, with main character in a similar predicament.\nBut the storyline,among other things, is not nearly as clever or\ncompelling. I guess you could say it just doesn't pack the same punch.\n(Sorry about that). At times it's just plain boring. Robert De Niro's\npresence adds some gravity to the production but there really isn't\nmuch for him to do with his character, so even he can't rescue this\npretty looking failure from itself. You'd be better off watching a\nslashed version of \"Fight Club\" on basic cable for the umpteenth time.\n"
"\nThis film had a really cool premise, great actors, some interesting\naction scenes, but when it was over, I felt like it could have been a\nlittle stronger. The premise is that a man gets a drug that allows him\nto take full control of his brain, since we only use about 20% of our\nbrain's actual power. So he basically knows everything, he can also go\nback into his mind and remember anything that happened to him in the\npast. The acting is great, Bradley Cooper, Robert De Niro, Abbie\nCornish were all good. The action was entertaining and the visuals were\nminimal but very well handled. However, since it has such great things\nabout it, the film just didn't have the punch that I was expecting. I\nwas hoping for something mindblowing and what I got was a good movie,\nthat stopped short of being great. I can't explain it, there's really\nnothing bad in it, I was just hoping for more.<br><br>6.5/10\n"
"\nLimitless (based on the novel \"The Dark Fields\" by Alan Glynn) is\ndirected by Neil Burger and starring Bradley Cooper, Abbie Cornish, and\nRobert De Niro.<br><br>\"Why is that the moment your life exceeds your wildest dreams, the\nknife appears to your back? I will never let them (knives) to touch\nme\". The film starts with these lines. It's a story of a man with four\ndigits IQ but initially an ordinary book writer Edward \"Eddie\" Morra\n(Bradley Cooper), do not have any story to write, waiting for an idea\nbut still have a pretty girlfriend Lindy. So story starts in flashback\nwhere he met brother of his ex-wife who insisted him to take a drug , a\nstimulating drug which allow people to access 100% of their brain's\npower(as it is said that we, a normal human use only 20% of his brain\npower. dkexplorer.blogspot.com\n"
"\nLimitless is a fairly formulaic Hollywood movie that a churned out by\nthe dozen. It is very difficult to feel any empathy with any of the\ncharacters. It tells the story of Eddie Morra (Bradley Cooper) who is\nintroduced to an experimental drug in fairly unlikely circumstances\nfrom a former in-law. The drug helps your brain to work much better and\ntransforms Eddie's life. As with most drugs the feeling becomes\naddictive and their are serious side effects which is what much of the\nfilm focuses on. There's a role for Robert De Nero and I'm quite sure\nthis will not be one of the films that he looks back at with any great\naffection. Overall it's fairly disappointing and also leaves you (or at\nleast me) feeling quite cold at the end of the film.\n"
"\nIs it Sci-Fi or mystery? Both. Eddie Morra(Bradley Cooper)is an author\nwithout a novel; to be exact it is a strain to find inspiration to\nwrite just one word. If this isn't enough, Eddie's girlfriend\nLindy(Abbie Cornish)dumps him and promises there is no way she will\ntake him back. The hopeless writer runs into an old friend that offers\nhim a powerful cutting-edge pharmaceutical called NZT. Talk about speed\non steroids. NZT causes the brain to function at 100 percent and\nprovides the power to understand very complex mathematics. A powerful\nbusinessman Carl Van Loon(Robert De Niro)wants to use Eddie's new\nabilities to share a fortune upon brokering a major corporate merger.\nOne drawback; NZT has a debilitating side effect...the more you take\nyour future is threatened. Being limitless is definitely hazardous to\nyour health. The cast also features: Andrew Howard, Darren Goldstein,\nAnna Friel and Robert John Burke.\n"
"\nDid you ever watch a film that just surprises the heck out of you? I\nrented this movie without knowing the first thing about it. At 15\nminutes I was completely engrossed.<br><br>How can you not fall in love with the concept of a pill that makes you\nsmart and successful? The pace of the movie is fast. The story is\noccasionally implausible (for example I don't believe that one can\nfight well based on a lesson from the History Channel), but we can\nforgive that because the acting is razor sharp and mostly believable.<br><br>Overall this is a solid trip through the looking glass. What is your\npotential if you could unlock 100% of your brainpower? What If such a\ndrug existed? How many people would kill for it? This movie explores\nthese and other possibilities. It's definitely worth a watch. And your\ndate will like it too. Guaranteed.\n"
"\nI wasn't holding out too much hope for the film after reading some of\nthe reviews posted on IMDb, as it happened it wasn't the crock of sh*t\nsome people have made this flick out to be. Granted it's no Oscar\nwinner but the story for most parts zips along just fine and the\npremise is interesting if a slightly used one. I think the one\ncomplaint I have and I think I'm not alone on this point, is the ending\nor lack of it was a bit of a let down. In my opinion if time goes\nquickly when you're watching a movie then it can't be all that bad and\nfor me time did go fast just like the character in one of the better\nmovie releases of late.\n"
"\nIn \"limitless\",Cooper proves that he can definitely act, truly impose\nhimself on the screen and not just show off and flash that flirtatious\nsmile of his and his effectiveness as an actor goes a long way toward\nmaking this thriller a lot more entertaining, and more credible than it\npossibly should have been. You could probably rummage through the film\nfor deeper themes, an indictment of the pharmaceutical industry, or our\nneed to have it now and have it all or you could pick the script apart\nfor impossibilities. But why bother? It's much more enjoyable to shut\nyour brain off for awhile and have a good time. Limitless\" may not be\nas brainy as it would like to think it is, but it's a relatively sharp\nand a surprisingly playful head-trip with satisfyingly novel twists on\nmindless entertainment.It could also be described as a disreputable and\ntrashy piece of entertainment but it goes down well with the comfort of\na KFC meal, and if that's what you are in the mood for, then go for it.\n"
"\nLIMITLESS takes that old chestnut about us only using part of the full\ncapacity of out brains (long since proved false) in order to spin a\nyarn about a failed writer who gets his hands on a pill which will\nunlock his brain's full potential. He takes it and before you know it\nnot only is he churning out great books, he's also moved onto the stock\nmarket and is making oodles of cash too. As a metaphor for drug use it\nmisses the point: drugs make you feel like you've got more gas but they\ndon't actually give it to you; it's all illusion. There's a mild\nthriller element as some clich√©d Russian gangsters take the day off\nfrom bad action films in order to persecute the hero but it doesn't\ncome to much. It's competent enough without ever being all that\ninteresting.\n"
"\nA writer (Bradley Cooper) discovers a top-secret drug which bestows him\nwith super human abilities.<br><br>While I have questioned Bradley Cooper's acting ability, this film is a\nshowcase for his range. He is not the cream of the crop (at least not\nyet), but he is still better than average given what I saw here. His\nability to smoothly transition between schlepp and genius was flawless,\nand with a little help from a hairstylist he was able to look both\nparts.<br><br>The very concept of this film is one that has intrigued me for a long\ntime, at least since I encountered \"Star Trek\"'s Data as a teenager.\nWhat if we could expand our memories and recall? If not to the level in\nthis film ,at least to some degree? We could solve many of the world's\nproblems. Stock markets? Bah! We could end world hunger. Maybe some\nday... maybe.<br><br>Also, DeNiro is excellent here. Much better than he is in \"Silver\nLinings Playbook\". He was nominated for the wrong film.\n"
"\nWhat would you do if you could somehow release all your potential?\nThat's the question the film asks. And, on the whole, it tackles the\nsubject very well and thoroughly entertaingly. You will not be be bored\nby this film. There's enough story to keep you interested and make you\nthink all the way through... right up until the last, disappointing\nmoment. Obviously, I don't want to tell you how it all ends, but, for\nme, it was like one one Ronnie Corbett's stories he used to tell on The\nTwo Ronnies. He'd cleverly pull you along through the story, there'd be\na few laughs along the way, but the final punchline always seemed a bit\nflat. In the end, I was glad to have seen this film, would recommend it\nto anyone who enjoys a good sort-of sci-fi thriller, but I'm glad I\nwatched on DVD and didn't fork out for a cinema ticket. BTW Bradley\nCooper (from TV series Alias) plays an excellent part, and one hopes\nhe'll get a few more A-list roles.\n"
"\nDespite the great premise director Neil Burger does next to nothing\nwith the opportunities Alan Glynn's interesting novel proposes, while\nLeslie Dixon puts forward one of the laziest screenplays in recent\nfilm- history. As if advancing the plot trough an insane amount of\nnarration wasn't enough, most of the dialog is still used up for\nexposition giving you the feeling that you are listening to a\ndumbed-down audio book. The rest of the dialog is just plain\nuninteresting. The great central idea of a perfectly functioning brain\nthat is supposed to be the main point of interest in this movie is\nwasted in the most unimaginative way, almost exclusively on short\nmontages repeatedly utilizing the same visual effect, providing what is\nmerely a video background while the lead is reading the story to you.<br><br>If you want to get this certain experience and don't like to read, I'd\nhonestly recommend the audio book if there is one. Don't waste this\nstory by watching this cheap transcript.<br><br>2/10\n"
"\nYour dealer gives you a drug, it makes you feel awesome, you want more,\nyou would do anything to get more, everyone wants your stash, you are\ndesperate, people are trying to kill you, and you end up a complete\naddict.<br><br>The only twists here are that:<br><br>#1- The drug really does make the user smarter and more productive<br><br>and<br><br>#2- Through some miracle, the addict managed to maintain all the\nbenefits of the drug yet none of the side effects, by tapering down off\nof the drug.<br><br>This is a drug movie. I am not a big fan of drug movies. This drug\nmovie just happens to have some great actors in the cast who do their\njobs rather well. But, in the end, it is still just a drug movie.\n"
"\nDon't get it twisted: This movie has quite a few flaws. But if you are\nlooking for inconsistencies and illogical behavior, you could do that\ngame with any movie and succeed. This movie however succeeds in being\nsimple and silly enough to be really enjoyable. And maybe this, in\naddition with Hangover 2 helped Bradley Cooper to become the sexiest\nman alive 2011 (or whatever he got called, though quite a few Ryan\nGosling fans were upset about that result).<br><br>Back to this movie though. Coopers character has a choice to make and\nhe might not be the most likable character, but you can still care for\nhim. Because after all he's acting and behaving like a human. And even\nsomeone who knows it all or has abilities others don't have, does not\nact always as smart as he is capable of. Plus: What fun would it be, if\nour main actor would be completely flawless? That's right, it would be\na boring movie. And this is anything but boring (unless you hate\nCoopers guts and can't stand the \"story\" presented here that is of\ncourse)\n"
"\nbrilliant storytelling that slowly unravels its mystique in slow doses\n(no pun intended) that eventually leads to a somewhat glorious exhale\nof relief. great character development, the director looks like one to\nwatch out for in future endeavours. loved the cinematography and mind\nbending camera tricks. i have to say this was the perfect film, from\nthe crisp soundtrack to executing every shot by shot to form an ever\ngreater tapestry of brilliance.<br><br>we can argue back and forth about the validity of any claims and\nattempt to authenticate subject matters as evidence. but beyond the\nbickering lies a film that you can both identify with and hopefully be\ninspired by to better yourself at this skill called life.\n"
"\nJust read on the Did You Know section that Shia LaBoeuf almost had the\nlead role in this. Praise be for that injury as Bradley Cooper was\nperfect for the lead role. Admittedley it does not have much\ncompetition but Limitless is one of the best movies released in 2011.\nPitched predominantly as a thriller it also is humorous and satirical.\nI loved the simple but effective camera shots simulating the effect of\npopping the pills ( the speeded up street journey and letters falling\non screen) and the soundtrack was spot on.<br><br>De Niro plays second fiddle here and in an underplayed performance he\ncould have been subbed by any number of 50 something actors. Make no\nmistake it is Coopers movie. Segments of Limitless reminded me of The\nGame and The Dead Zone and i admired the slightly ambiguous ending.\nJust what will Eddie Morra do with all that power? Please lets not find\nout. How can you improve on near perfection?\n"
"\nSettling down in the theater seats before the show, 'Limitless' seemed\nlike a complete dud of a film. The thought of watching a man rule the\nworld because he took special medicine seemed boring, but was the exact\nopposite of what I expected. As the film began to roll I got the\nfeeling that it was going to be as I expected, but after the intro I\nwas hooked immediately into the world of NZT and a strange man named\nEddie. The film takes the audience on twist and turns of the man's life\nas we try to figure out who exactly he is and what was going to happen.\nI found it very difficult to predict what the end would take me,and I\nwas thrilled through every step it took me.\n"
"\nGood movie overall and Bradley Cooper is a good actor in it. My main\nproblem was the insertion into the story of the criminal thugs. If\nusing 100% of his brain surely he would not miss the importance of\nneeding to pay back this criminal fellow, particularly after being told\nwhat would happen if he did not. It's not like he didn't have loads of\nmoney by then, it was just made out that he forgot, where as throughout\nthe rest of the movie he is drawing upon his memory to recall the\nsmallest of details from his past in order to learn and improvise at a\ngenius level.<br><br>Anyway, this didn't stop me from enjoying the movie because I do\nactually think that the overall premise and delivery by Bradley was\nvery good.\n"
"\nSeems Hollywood has come with an exceptional new gig..To have an\nambiguous ending.Christopher Nolan is a master of this genre.Now Neil\nBurger has made a movie with a great story,with an excellent\nending.Bradley Cooper,seems to have an excellent past few years.All the\nsupporting actors have also done good.Special mention to Robert De\nNiro,Andrew Howard,Abbie Cornish &amp; Anna Friel.The lead actresses get to\nexperience the way the actor feels,which is also new.Not the usual way\nto make movies.You're almost sorry they ended on such a note,but also\nwhy the movie ended at all.But,makes the viewer finish the movie in\nhis/her own way.Very cool. 9/10.If only for making us guess.\n"
"\nLoved the way movie was presented. It makes people to believe in the\nabilities each of us does possess from within. It could be shocking to\nutilize so much of the brain :)<br><br>Movie has been paced very very well. And the best part is that it does\nnot bore or surprise abit. Bradly Cooper was done an excellent job in\nthe movie. Every other character seem to have revolved around the main\ncharacter.<br><br>Though the movie is a sci-fi, many things are very much believable. Its\nnot just about a drug to improve the brains capacity, its about letting\nthe inhibitions out and think what would be the best thing to do in a\ngiven situation. Many of us get into tangles and struggle to get out.\nIf we get out the shell, v all can do a lot better :)<br><br>1 person who seemed to hav been wasted is Robert Di Nero, im sure\nanyone could have done that job. Not sure why they included him, he\nseemed out of sort.<br><br>Overall, it is super movie, many be not as comparable to Inception but\na good one :)\n"
"\nI originally was not planning to see this film, instead I was going to\nsee \"insidious\" but things change, although after viewing the movie,\ni'm glad i saw it.In limitless the hangover's Bradley cooper plays a\nwriter who tries a mysterious new drug that allows him to activate his\nentire brain(the average human can only activate 20% of their brain).\nThis movie delivers a good message while still being able to entertain\nthe viewer.\"limitless\" had great acting, and also was funny, dramatic,\nand had some action mixed in. Though the film confused me at times,I\ncould still follow the story. I encourage people who take illegal\ndrugs, or people who are even considering taking illegal drugs, to\nwatch this film, because I guarantee you it will change your attitude\ntowards the subject.I give this movie an 8 out of 10. Go see it.\n"
"\nHadn't watched other movies starring Bradley Cooper - aside from the\nlast version of A Team - so the lead actor's quite a a new face to me\nbut I reckon he never looked out of place; his acting's not phenomenal\nbut in this instance he has appeared to convey the exhilaration of\nthese special new powers. Coneversely the good looking Abbie Cornish,\nplaying his girlfriend, doesn't get to to put across visible emotions\nas his fianc√© does. Robert De Niro is cast as the great old Wall Street\nmoguls, different form the criminal type he played other times but he\ncertainly gets to prove believable. On the whole LIMITLESS, which never\nsermonizes on drugs and the morality of drug created intelligence, is a\nfresh and well-written thriller. It might not pass a logic test but\nlogic sometimes lacks in good movies as well. It's part fantasy and\npart thriller but conceived in an ingenious way.\n"
"\nWhile Robert De Niro's movie career has been on a continual down turn\nfor the last 15 years , Bradley Cooper's is definitely on the up but\nluckily , with Limitless , both actors have struck gold. This is a\ncracking thriller that is fast paced from the very start. It has a\nsuperb and original story that has you thinking throughout but without\never being confused. There are lots of drug addiction connotations you\ncan make with the story yet this never really feels like a story about\ndrugs even though it should. Cooper is the perfect actor for the role\nof Eddie Morra . charming , yet somehow vulnerable and I'm pleased to\nat last say that Robert De Niro is great too. It's many years since i\nhave been able to say that. There's nothing NOT to like about\nLimitless. It's a roller Coaster ride that i recommend everyone goes\non. Or should you? Don't forget kids \" Just say no\".\n"
"\nLimitless is somehow similar to two other movies i watched: Deja Vu and\nThe Adjustment Bureau. All of these movies are pretty good, but they\nare ruined by a quick, non-explain, Hollywood-y, happy ending. (If you\nwatched any of these movies, you know what i am talking about.) If you\nhaven't watched any of these movies i can tell you that Limitless is a\npretty good thriller that makes you feel thrilled, what a thriller\nshould do. Using the urban legend of humans not using 100% of their\nbrain and a pill that can do so, the story is pretty good, but as\nagain, the ending isn't so. Howewer, there also some other positive\npoints in the movie: interesting action scenes, director's\nmusic-video-y scenes, an unexpectedly good performance by Bradley\nCooper... but as again, the ending pretty much ruins the whole\nimpression.\n"
"\nLove films in this genre, that makes you question reality, what if\ntheory, Bradley Cooper does good job as portraying the main character\ndon't think he quite pulled off as (matt Damon Bourne identity). The\nmovie is fast paced from the start, &amp; keeps you gripped throughout.<br><br>The only flaw I found was De Neros character, not convinced he was a\nbig business CEO type person but for the time he is in the movie\ndoesn't really matter. Was disappointed with the the quick ending as\nleaves you wanting more. If you like films like EagleEye, The Net Etc,\nthen this film is definitely for you. Would recommend to go see this\nmovie 8/10\n"
"\nFun movie to watch. Bradley Cooper does an outstanding job. There was\nplenty of action. I actually found myself wishing this pill really did\nexist in real life. Watching this film, I felt that the struggles that\nthe lead character faced were well displayed, from his writer's block\nto his girlfriend to his complete vulnerability as he faces the\nmysteries of this new-found power that he stumbled across. It was good\nto see how not everything worked out the way he expected it to. The big\nFlaw in this movie is this: if he can outsmart every stock market\nanalyst after just a few days of studying, why can't he, himself, study\nthe pill and find a way to reproduce it? Why leave this to the amateurs\nwho are using only 35 percent of their brain ? The same holds true for\nfending off the bad guys: he should be able to out smart them or at\nleast buy a gun with a silencer. He knows they are after him. Every\nissue he attacks should have been studied by him as his brain is\nsuperior in learning capacity.\n"
"\nThis movie was great. It opens your mind to so many possibilities that\nwould be made true if you only that those little pills. I just knew I\nhad to see this film by the commercial, which rarely happens these\ndays. I know of so many people who could benefit from such an invention\n(including myself). The story is of a struggling writer who happens to\nbe a drunk and also happens to always be getting dumped by his chicks.\nI wonder why? (sarcasm much). This all started to change one day he ran\ninto an unlikely character....His Ex-fianc√©'s brother. The Ex-fianc√©'s\nbrother happens to also be a drug dealer, even though he tells him that\nhe isn't anymore before he decides to take \"the pill\" for the very\nfirst time.\n"
