it follows the disney formula for a good heartfelt movie and while one could criticize the use of such a formula one is likely to be too busy falling in love with the characters and getting mistyeyed as those characters face the issues they face if one would simply sit and watch the film
even without being fully familiar with videogame culture and all the references and cameos that the film displays abundantly any moviegoer will likely find themselves enthralled with the animation character design plot development and genuine issues that each character faces
undoubtedly by the end you will be cheering with moistened cheeks
this movie is a mustsee
just watched this computeranimated movie from walt disney animation with my movie theatreworking friend
its the story of wreckit ralph john c
reilly whos tired of being the villain of the fixit felix jr
jack mcbrayer video game because of the negligent treatment from the rest of the inhabitants of his game
so he goes to another one to get a medal and then another one where he meets a girl who feels as lonely as him
ill stop there and just say that i throughly enjoyed the creative visuals employed throughout and the way the story went
other voices like those of jane lynch and sarah silverman were also good but i was most impressed by that of alan tudyk as king candy which he seemed to imitate ed wynn for since the character looked like wynns mad hatter in disneys alice in wonderland from 1951
in summary wreckit ralph gets a high recommendation from me
this is a review for the latest pixar film wreckitralph and i must say that its by far the best film that i have ever seen
it starts out with a prologue said by wreck it ralph the villain of the arcade game fix it felix jr saying how hard it is to love his job when no one likes him for doing it
it pans out to an alcoholics anonymous style meeting where all of the villains of todays popular video games gather round as a weekly support group
ralph then states that he wants to be a hero now
he embarks on an incredible journey by game jumping
i saw this on the very first day when it premiered and i was blown away by the plot
to all of the gamers out there i highly recommend this movie to watch
one of best animation films it will rekindle your memories of playing video games like donkey kong and then over to role playing games
this movie is so detailed in the description of its characters you will notice that movement of characters from 8bit games is different from those in modern games even the casting is so wonderfully detailed
you will feel so great while watching this it would be like you were waiting fora movie like this to come up to theaters
sarah silvermans perky voice for vanellope is absolutely amazing
it is an absolute treat for retro gamers like me
this movie clearly deserves a greater rating and an oscar for this year
i hardly write reviews and just rarely happens that a movie really blows me away i write a review
this movie is really stunning
i was just interested the whole time while watching this movie
the story is incredibly creative and the very well depicted
the animation is also excellent
everything seems so real
and not to forget its full of humour as well which is very important
the movie also had a great meaning into it
it was really touching and also inspiring
overall absolutely worth a watch
one of my favorite movies now
you can watch it with your friends family anyone and itll be wonderful
a movie you wont forget
i saw this movie in 2d at the cinema the other week
i was not expecting too much but i was pleasantly surprised and really enjoyed the film
it has a bit of everything pathos excitement thrills action tension love plot twists surprise ending nostalgia good characterisation etc
its a good story that keeps you involved and interested all the way through
the film gets you involved and soon has you rooting for the characters
it helps if you are young enough to have played the games shown in the film or have children or grand children who have  but this is not essential for your enjoyment
definitely worth seeing whether you are young or old
to all the kids who were born in the 70s and 80s or some early 90s arcade games are so popular
even though they played them regularly or not they are still there in everyones minds
when they watched wreckit ralph i think that all that kids will not able to hold back their memories of pacman mario fixit felix
and that is the reason why people keep telling me that movie is for gamers only
and just because of that reason i didnt watch the movie earlier which makes me regret
i dont know many characters in the movie only mario pacman and guys in street fighters
due to my shortage of knowledge i realized more than just a memoirs of game characters
everything has its twosided and once people spotted your bad manner they will always judge you as a bad guys
its ok whatever the person who is deep inside you is much more important
you are bad and at least its good because you know who you are
im bad and thats good
i will never be good and thats not bad
theres no one id rather be
than mei dont need a medal to tell me that im good coz if a little kid can like me how bad can i be
dralph a video game antagonist who was upset with the treatment of his negativity set an adventure to prove himself a hero towards his fellow game characters
an amazing disney production that seems to have slightly smart touch of pixar p characters development was wellcrafted and the relation between ralph and adorable vanellope was quite cute and stirring
both john c
reilly and sarah silverman made a worthwhile voice cast p despite unnecessary romantic elements a full pack of fun and emotions
this is one the best movies i have seen all year that i need to write this review
i have never wrote a review before until i saw this movie
thats how much i loved it
first of all im a gamer
i have played games for over 25 years so i understand the world of games and i know all the characters from the movie
i knew i was going to like this movie from the start but i did not know i was going to like it this much
this movie is more then just about games
the story is just so good that you really do not need to know about games to love it
of course it helps if you understand how the older games worked back then but you can still have fun on the story and how funny this movie is
as a 30something father of two i can say that i absolutely loved this movie
this is really what you hope every movie experience will be like when you go to the theater
the homage to my favorite form of media and entertainment classic video games was just the frosting on the cake as this movie had real substance
the plot was wonderful as it contained all the right elements of surprise anticipation and suspense
the characters were delightful and the movie really drew you in to their plights and made you care about them and their relationships to one another
i havent seen a movie this well made animated or not in a long time excluding avengers
this is one ill be able to watch over and over again and enjoy each time
after seeing the trailer in june i have been anxiously waiting to see this movie
well the hype is legit and wreck it ralph is the best animated movie of the year
john c
reilly plays ralph the bad guy of fixitfelixs arcade game and delivers an outstanding performance
being a hero is an overplayed storyline in almost all animated movies but disney makes wreck it ralph fresh and original
i was laughing the entire film and its charm won me over
as a hardcore gamer the soundtrack and appearances of various video game characters and references was awesome
it was not only nostalgic but cool which brought back great memories of going to the arcade and putting quarter after quarter in a machine
overall i was blown away by wreck it ralph
whatever you do go see it
and ill definitely be seeing it again in 3d
i never thought the day will come when i score a movie 1010
and this movie
i dont like cgi
i like a wellwritten story with welldeveloped characters played by actors who respect their art
i find fault with almost every movie i watch
i didnt plan to watch wreck it ralph
i was at a friends house to use his wifi when mine broke down and he had just bought the dvd
he played it and i was not interested the first minute then i was hooked
the movie is genius genius in story story telling script writing switching between the world of the tiny characters in between their little worlds and then our world
the script is flawless
the imagery is lovely
all the characters all likable
the movie is just hilarious
i am actually going to buy the dvd to watch again this weekend
there is so much going on its amazing
this movie is nearly perfect
i say nearly but i dont think ive found anything lacking about it
you can see the unrelenting hard work that went into this movie
it is one of the best structured stories of any family film
everything fits together logically
the visuals are also mind blowing and the performances are wonderful
it belongs in the highest tier of disney films
i hope it will be recognized as an enduring classic
i would like to say timeless but setting it in the world of video games may end up dating the story
if so it would be the only minor shortcoming for a film that has everything a viewer could hope for
sincerely i avoid western animated films in general once the are directed to children and i avoid at all video game films once they are idiotic so with double reason i avoided wreckit ralph for a good time until i read a positive matter about it in a video game magazine
i watched it expecting the same garbage of all video game films i had watched previously except for scott pilgrim vs the world the only good video game film i ever have watched until then and to my own surprise i loved it
not only the story and the characters are enjoyable but this film has something that lacks in all other video game films the replay factor
even scott pilgrim i watched only once but i have watched wreckit ralph at least three times now trying to figure out and recognize all video game characters and references in the film and every time i rewatch it i find something i have lost in the last time i watched it
awesome
i heard a lot about how people consider this film the who framed roger rabbit of video games because of the licensed video game characters
i agree because not only the licensed characters its the characters that are like the characters in roger rabbit
now the designs and animation of this film is colorful and creative from a 1980s 8bit arcade game to a modern day firstperson shooter game
the soundtrack is also really creative with using music from what a 1980 arcade games sounds like
now on with the characters the main character ralph who is more like eddie valiant were hes seems to have pretty much a tough life being the main antagonist of his game fixit felix jr
and wants to be a good guy now felix doesnt seem to have much of a character except we all know that hes the protagonist of the game and later fall in love with a character from a firstperson shooter game and king candy is more like judge doom witch i cant tell because dont want to spoil the climax
in conclusion wreck it ralph is most definitely like who framed roger rabbit
i found this movie funny and it was a video game version of toy story in that it focused on video game characters rather than toys
it made you see how a video game bad guy may feel centering on the bad guy from fixitfelix jr wreckitralph
ralph game jumped to try to be a good guy and win a metal at heros duty
this was called going turbo after a rogue video game character called turbo form the long since unplugged game called turbo time
turbo time was the most popular game when the arcade first opened and turbo loved that and it lasted until road blasters was plugged in and overtook turbo time
turbo got jealous and he game jumped in an attempt to crash road blasters but ended up having both games unplugged for good
turbo survived to eventually take over sugar rush and become king candy
this movie was interesting and funny
disneys wreck it ralph presents as an animation visual thrill ride through multiple video game worlds the audience is besot with comic gags and punchy one liners but is ultimately left to believe that while we are all interconnected we also exist within the restricted confines of our own social strata
through survey of film theories in structuralism constructivism poststructuralism postmodernism posthumanism and finally supermodernity it may be proved that such childrens fantasy entertainment posits social expectations within the impressionable spectator
wreck it ralph as a mainstream entertainment vehicle lends credence to the empowerment of the individual whom does not feel accepted by the status quo through recognition that as individuals we must determine our own selfworth within our respective cultures
after being dragged to the cinema by my younger sister to watch this i was overly surprised by how great the film actually was
this film had a great plot which fitted together perfectly
this film was a strangely emotional film which had laughter sadness and happiness all in one this animated is film is not like any other it did not directly aim towards the children but to the parents also with its witty puns and great voice overs this really got the parents involved in the film
although i was rather disappointed as the film claimed to have great well known video game actors from brands such as sega e
c
t although these characters had limited lines for example bowser was seen many times yet had littleno lines and that of sonic for the matter
this film also claimed to have the well known plumber mario yet he was never seen throughout the film
overall its a family film like no other and i would highly recommend it to friends and family
i watched this movie today on pc
i started watching this movie some time back but initially i got bored and then i stopped watching it
but today somehow i started watching it and i felt how could i miss this movie earlier
its so entertaining and has a very good story line
i liked the animation and overall theme about video games
i liked everything about the movie
in fact background music was also good and two songs near the end of movie are also good
a very good movie compared to the recent animation movie released last year
honestly i would rate this movie far above any good animation movie at this moment i can think of
so you can imagine how well it has gripped my thinking now and i loved this movie so much
watch this movie if you had played video games when you were younger and you will definitely enjoy this movie
yes i loved this because it had all the video game heroes from when i was growing up but this film is so inventive stylish and complete it is hard not to like it
the characters are great and the voice actors are absolutely brilliant
the humour is top notch and i laughed constantly even more so than my 6yearold who also loved this entertaining film
some say it has a dip in the middle but i disagree
without losing any of disneys sentimental touch the film moves along very nicely through flamboyant colours and excellent gaming worlds and leads to a very fulfilling if somewhat predictable ending but there is a nice twist thrown in just to spice things up
overall its a film that manages to take a brilliant idea and do a lot with it
of course you have the standard morals and emotion linked with any disney film but thats the whole point
the product placement actually works really well though kids wouldnt understand that side of the humour
anyone who says this is not a good film needs to growup
irony
well of course it is
disney has always surprised me with many amazing movies
this is not a fairy tale movie
well thats not a problem
i do love fairy tale movies just like the other disneys
but this one is different
first thought when i look at the posters i have no idea what does this story about
but when i watched it for the first time im just sitting in front of my screen and my tears falls on my cheeks
because the movie is so emotional
and delicious of course
makes my mouth wet over and over again
high quality animations real sweets animations thats authentic
i gotta love disney because besides many fairy tales story ever made this one
is very very very impressive
fun exciting and probably watched it more than one time
because its delicious
ralph john c
reilly is tired of being overshadowed by fixit felix jack mcbrayer the good guy star of their game who always gets to save the day
but after decades doing the same thing and seeing all the glory go to felix ralph decides hes tired of playing the role of a bad guy
he takes matters into his own massive hands and sets off on a gamehopping journey across the arcade through every generation of video games to prove hes got what it takes to be a hero
on his quest he meets the toughasnails sergeant calhoun jane lynch from the firstperson action game heros duty
but its the feisty misfit vanellope von schweetz sarah silverman from the candycoated cart racing game sugar rush whose world is threatened when ralph accidentally unleashes a deadly enemy that threatens the entire arcade
will ralph realize his dream and save the day before its too late
watched one of my all time favorite animated films 21 wreck it ralph amazing voice performances from john c
reillystep brother as wreck it ralph  sarah silvermanschool of rock as vanellope von schweetz also starring jack mcbrayer30 rock as fix it felix jr  jane lynchglee as sergeant tamora jean calhoun  dennis haysbertjustice league and alan tudykfirefly as king candy
the film is very funny an emotional also me being enjoying games when i used to go to the arcade when i was younger really enjoyed also an amazing performance from both reilly and silverman they both had amazing chemistry plus i really liked how they also i really enjoyed the subplot between jean calhoun and fix it felix jr it was cute seeing there romance unfold also i really enjoyed ralph characters he didnt want to be bad he was just lonelyalso amazing production design by mike gabrielbravescreenplay by phil johnstoncedar rapids and direction by rich moore futurama a tribute to gaming and a heartfelt story 910
this movie from all the movies ive watched this year really made its mark
its the first disney movie since toy story in which i was just completely blown away and was left completely in suspense
the advertising does show exactly how wretchit ralph feels about his place in the world
i think it actually is a very relatable theme that many people can relate to
essentially his game and the pressure from the system is forcing ralph to be the big bad and unlovable person that he was created to be
ralph shows them off by his heroic actions in the film
besides from the theme the rest of the movie is completely unpredictable and even more so because of the games and plots that conjoin throughout the movie
without giving spoilers wretchit ralph finally finds two things that he was looking for
one is what he was originally looking for and the second which is what he found on his journey while looking for the first
the question for him is which of them really give him the value he is looking for
wreck it ralph sure is a great cute family friendly film
this movie is well written well animated and well voiced by the different actors
sarah silverman one of my favorite people ever stars as the voice of venelope and she does such a great job
her voice fits so well for the main role
and jane lynch is a perfect choice for the call of duty like female gamer role
i really loved how this isnt just one of those pointless kiddie movies about nothing special but this is actually a very well thought out film worthy of many big time cinematic roles
the plot summary is intricate and very smart this is not a one dimensional movie this is such a great movie that anyone and everyone can and will enjoy
810
if you like video games or if you played any kind of a video game anytime in your life this is a movie that you will most likely love
various characters from famous titles live in their own game worlds and when the arcade room is closed at nights something that most players never thought about happens
you will see several cool references about video games in the movie that will make you smile that will make you remember that moment in your childhood when you were having so much fun pushing some buttons in a device that brought you into another universe while you were just sitting there
other than these wreckit ralph also carefully speaks about friendship and encouragement for both young viewers and elders
a mustsee if you are already thinking about which game to play tonight
now this is my most favorite disney movie this past year
some people say they dont get it and they dont know who the characters are and on and on
well ill start by saying i you didnt have a childhood of games and arcade playing than you wont know half of whats going on
my family has been playing games since the atari was out and when this movie came out we all knew all the characters from bowser in mario bros
to the bar tender from tapper
if you dont know your game history then this is not your movie
if you do know your game history and your child wants to see the movie or get the movie explain who everyone is so your kid isnt sitting there talking and asking questions during the whole film
for parents who dont like their kids playing video games this movies is probably not your choice either so just out of confusion know your game history
from the getgo i really enjoyed this film
it was a clever premise that computer game characters are real and interact with each other
the characters were well drawn fun and endearing
typical childrens film in that it speaks to the underdog and outcast being the hero and friendships being formed unlikely places
for children to be sure but certainly enough in it for adults to enjoy
really enjoyable entertaining and laugh out loud funny in places
great voiceactor performances from an allstar cast including john c reilly jack mcbrayer jane lynch and sarah silverman and the design of the entire film is in the style of many video arcade games which is clever
lots of little injokes and asides for gamers to enjoy
a great film almost a film that did not have a princess
a fairly original film in setting with a good soundtrack and solid characters the the interaction between ralph and penelope are really special and often dont come to surface like this in so called disney family films
i loved the design and the film actually felt like the crew that made it enjoyed being on the project it feels rare but disney of the past was small cubicles and corporate doctrine they feel very indie in this one particular film with their direction and choice of themes i think they got a free ride on game culture in general being a large mashup to draw inspiration from to begin with very rewatchable and film that stands apart from the usual disney offerings
this was a really good movie but i watched it once and didnt really have a desire to see it again
i feel indifferent toward this movie
i dont like the ending and the characters eventually became annoying
the story is very good though it was fun seeing video game character interact when humans arent around
it was sort of like watching toy story but the toys are video game characters
this movie brought out the child in me and i love it for that
but in saying that i also feel like this movie was a bit unnecessary
i guess it does kinda teach a lesson learn to love where you are and what you have but i dont feel like it did that in a unique way
i really like the movie but i have no desire to watch it buy it or tell anyone about it its kind of just that movie i saw one time because i was bored
im sorry everyone but i dont like how sonys mascot doesnt get any respect yet adhd hedgehog and gay italian plumber get always attention
crash bandicoot has sold way more than freaking qbert i dont thinkg 99 gamers have even heard about him
the music is horrible dubstep music they should have used crash bandicoot music
the story tells about some fat loser that wants to be a hero and help some annoying girl that you wish would die as soon you see her most the movie isnt even based in real video game its more like candyland movie so they false marketed this garbage to gamers
i also fuind the lack of call of duty disgustin how most popular game nowdays doesnt get even small refence when lame chartchers like sonic can
disney just went full retard with this is movie reall really bad avoid like plague
wreck it ralph is a movie that is moving and touching
it is a movie that you really you really need to take your kids and everyone else to go see
i never saw a disney 3d movie this good before ever that is how good this movie was
if you are looking for a good movie to go see than this is one of the movies
i hope you go see this wonderful film
it is a heartwarming film that will lift you up that is how sweat it is
i hope you enjoy this one of a kind 3d film
it is a masterpiece that you just have to go see to believe it
you just need to go see this amazing 3d film
i hope you enjoy wreck it ralph as much as i did
if you are looking for a heartfelt movie than this is it
