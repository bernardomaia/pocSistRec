hugh jackman takes you on a trip through the intense emotions a family is put through during its darkest hour
this may be his best role to date
from the trailers you know that his character will be out for blood as their daughter was kidnapped but throughout the film you feel his pain anger and moral struggles as he deals with this situation
the director does an excellent job of keeping you invested in the film emotionally even through some intensely violent scenes
its dreary setting provides no comfort but goes hand and hand with the narrative
this film may not be for those faint of heart but should be a must see for most viewers
prisoners is extremely suspenseful and equally disturbing
canadian director denis villeneuve whose last film was the equally spellbinding and disturbing incendies builds up the tension from the first frame and does not let up for the full 153 minutes of the movie
aaron guzikowskis script though on the surface a child kidnapping thriller bucks all hollywood trends and as well as being a taut thriller poses serious moral issues
it also helps that the film has a first rate cast doing outstanding work hugh jackman jake gyllenhaal paul dano terence howard melissa leo maria bello and viola davis
prisoners is not for the faint heated but is likely to feature strongly at next years oscars
to anyone who misrepresented this movie as being worth more than 3 stars simply because it had a decent cast
ill make the wild assertion that you dont know what a decent crimedramathriller is
it wasnt thrilling
it wasnt drama
it was just a crime
you could have bigger thrills holding your breath until you pass out from lack of intelligence
it was like three terrible episodes of lawandorder without the good parts topped off with a weak ending
i hope hugh jackman hates this movie

this movie wasnt worth 10 lines of text
some ground rules
legend has it that the firsttime scriptwriter for this oddity was paid a million dollars and then the project was shelved because they could not figure out what to do with it
then they had a brainstorm
just make it
and here we are with an almosthitchcockian pseudothriller that occasional resembles a police story and even sometimes a horror film
the story gives new life to the clicha plot holes you could drive a truck through
hugh jackman gives the performance of his life but his character is so lacking in empathy that this might not be enough
jake gyllenhaal plays himself which ironically is more than enough to carry the role
maria bello is lost
dennis villeneuve is a great director who can make even the rain interesting and one would like to see him try his hand at something better written
like the phone book
this is the worst movie i have seen in so long i cant remember a worse movie
perhaps there was one that was worse in the past but this movie is the new champion of worst movies i have ever seen in my life
if you believe that suspects can shoot themselves while under custody at police stations and torturers can stay out of prison after being found out then this movie might be for you especially if you enjoy watching torture
they even throw in a pedophile priest who murders a murderer
after all hollywood can never resist a slam at catholicism given hollywoods high moral compass
i rarely write reviews but this piece of crud is such a waste of time that im writing it for those people that enjoy hugh jackson i like his stuff and want to see a movie with him in it
even the acting stunk the place up including hughs i guess torture really isnt his bag
if i could give this movie a minus 1000 i would
really surprised that this has garnered so much praise
many comments talk of great acting performances but as i frequently point out to friends shouting with intensity is not great acting
i cant believe hugh jackman agreed to take such a risible role
you always know youre in trouble when theres symbolism
the policeman is loki norse god everyone is religious though nothing stops their sadismetc
subtext link to us forces in iraq  being bad to bad guys just perpetuates the violence
the 2 mothers are ciphers with no characters letting the men do the work
come on this is 2013
great cop whos solved every case yeh right
who misses every clue
and at 2 amp a half hours
in the end i didnt care
it has some essential ingredients for a good movie such as some good performance by jackman jake gyllenhaal and viola davis and a good cinematography but awful script and bad directing
the movie is full packed with stupid gaping holes in the plot which cannot be digested
the character of the detective is shallow despite the acceptable performance of gyllenhaal
there are many attempts to make the movie deeper than it is but in my opinion failed big time
alsothe film had way too many wasted moments
most of it did nothing to move the story along
overall its disappointing and i felt i was the prisoner for two and a half hour
i usually agree with imdbs ratings but unfortunately not this time this movie was mediocre at best and really nothing we havent seen before a lot of clichas and suspense tricks weve already seen in other movies of this type i could not really relate to the characters and felt that the dialogs were corny and that i have already seen them on other movies
i could have given it a 7 but it was way way way too long could have easily fit into 90 minutes instead of 153
to tell the truth i fast forwarded at least 30 minutes of the movie because i just got bored
the acting and plot were believable for the first hour but after that it got too much for me to even care this is really not the masterpiece everybody here are talking about
a movie about an old lady kidnapping small kids and giving them drugs with a needle
wow
and a parent losing it and torturing a guy with a deformed face in an abandoned property of his which he cannot repair due to economic problems
i think that movie adds to the mission of cinema and cinematography in general
no wonder why there are so many weirdos overseas
and i have to write ten lines the least for my movie review to b posted
so ill start say awful things about this movie
dont even try to press play on this movie it doesnt worth it
the spiderman guy tries to act as a detective and the wolverine guy tries to act as a family guy
the first has a tick and i believe thats why this movie is having an 8
1 average in imdb and the latter has a problem with alcohol and he cant be convincing for even a second
ahhh my ten lines or more are complete
go away from this so called movie
go away
suspense
thrill
edgeofyourseatmovie
after seeing these words in the reviews i couldnt wait to see the movie
and for me it was just boring absolutely no suspense at all
yes the acting was good but i hated the fathers and the policemans character as well so i had nothing out of the good acting
although there were some stunning looking scenes the whole movie was dark and depressing and i was surprised when i saw roger deakins as the director of photography
i just love his work and would give him not one but a couple of oscars but not for this one its not so impressive
before the end it got slightly better and i had no problem with how it ended so because of that and because of roger deakins it became a 6 instead of a 5 for me
this film has absolutely no redemptive value
filled with great actors and yet the story is full of plot holes unbelievable dialog and disrespectful to the audiences intelligence
how did it ever get made
do not watch this film
and the snake scene is absurd
there is not one character in the entire film who is someone that draws you in or evokes sympathy or empathy
by the end of the film i was hoping a meteor would fly out of the sky hit the town and blow up the entire place
two and a half hours and 6
99 amazon
com gone from my life
by the end i felt like i was the one held prisoner and tortured
i really hated it
i was amazed by this movie
characters are powerful and emotional
my favourite is gylenghall because i never saw him in such a way  nervous but calm devoted to his job
of course it seems that he doesnt have any personal life and i think it is a little minus
like i didnt believe some of hugh jackman characters actions at the end of the movie
thats why i give it 9 stars
the strongest part of the movie why i will remember it  its story
so twisted puzzled and provoking emotions anger pity sadness
although this movie falls into simple category of dissapeared children movies it is one of the best
the story ant acting makes it so
please if youre reading this as you consider seeing this awful excuse for entertainment run away
dont do it
my only consolation was that i saw it on hbo rather than having wasted 10 at the theater
pointless virtually plotfree full of idiotic red herrings derivative beyond gratuitously violent  need i go on
i will go on  i created an imdb account just so i could warn people away from this atrocious mess
i kept mentally comparing this movie to 7even which in spite of the violence had an actual plot made sense and lent us some insight into the characters psyches and motivations
the red herrings in 7even were woven into the movie and not just thrown in for  what
effect
distraction
shock value
i think they were for distraction  to distract us from the fact that prisoners just blows
i was so excited to see this movie i love suspenseful thrillers and it has been too long since a good ones come around
prisoners delivers a mix of predictable suspense with some elements of surprise like the ending
the movie entangles you in an emotional rollercoaster then stops prematurely
i loved the movie but left feeling twisted amp robbed
the cast was superb and the story unraveled nicely but collapsed hard on you at the end
its a terrible feeling that the director puts you through and i hate him for that
i would wait for the dvd and hopefully he will fix the ending on a special extended directors cut edition then you will have the ending this movie deserves
it is just not complete why start something if you are not going to complete it
its like an incomplete sentence you get from a loved one on their death bed
i left you a million dollars in cash in the back of
i had such big expectations for this movie
the trailer made it look very interesting
and i love thrillers
i love hugh jackman and maria bello
in fact all the actors did a very good job
however this seemed to me no more than a criminal minds episode stretched to over two hours
the storyline was all over the place
the end result made sense but took too long to get there leaving trails never completely followed or throwing things in that were never explained like jackmans not drinking for 9 12 years
and the end
well unless theyre doing a sequel the end just left me thinking thats it
id prefer to watch mystic river again than this
the real problem with this movie is that it doesnt know what it wants to be
i dont understand what the director was aiming at
the film tries to be mystic river and seven at the same time
was it a drama
was it trying to be suspenseful
it fails both way
its too full of thriller clichas to feel dramatic its too morally ambiguous to be an entertaining thriller
everything is quite good acting is great the atmosphere too and villeneuve is a great director
but all the ingredients just dont blend together i felt like i was watching two different movies at the same time
still trying to understand what the ending is supposed to mean
the whole crimein the name of love story is not that attractive due to the mass editing problemssome scenes seem to be a little strange without any logic senses
the director has tried so hard to show the story with two parts including the dovers and the detectivebut also failed to dig the real meaning from itabout crimeabout faithabout love and belief
the whole frame of the story is so vacuous that everything seems to be unrealso are the performances
to be frankhugh jackman has given us a convincing father who has suffered a lotbut some of his behaviors still remain incomprehensible
jake is awesome as a police detectivebut im not sure if he can get another supporting actor nomination
oscar winner melissa leo has shocked me indeed
it was unique and amazing had my attention the whole way through
one of the best movies i have seen in a while
brilliant acting and directing
intense and wonderful
definitely should and will win numerous awards
i strongly recommend seeing this film
it was a masterpiece and captivating
acting by hugh jackman and jake gyllenhaal was inspiring and chilling
it it was very clever and creative
deserves a 1010 it was one of the greatest movies i have ever seen and who ever made it should be knighted and presented with the most highly regarded awards
spectacular and so good and great just the best ever and wow so good
story was good
but i dont think it could have been directed any worse
first of all movie was extremely slow
the pacing the timing was so awful
there were a lot of unnecessary scenes that could have been shortened or not used in the movie at all
i can say at at least 1 hour of the movie could be cut out and the story wouldnt change in fact it would be better
the slow rhythm of the movie made it like drama more than a thriller
there were parts where it got really really boring
jake gyllenhaals bad acting made the movie even worse
and it had the worse ending ever
the only thing good about the movie is hugh jackman
hes kind of saving the movie with his great acting
other than i can say that it has a good and strong story but unfortunately turns out to be a really bad movie
this was a very teeth grinding kind of movie
very emotional
some really good acting on everyones part
they did not mess around and build it up to when the girls would be taken
right at the beginning of the movie they would kidnapped
and right then i new it was going to be a emotional ride through out the whole movie
i feel that the police did do what they could and only could do at the time when they arrested the man in the rv
now hugh jackman did what i think any father would do
my self included
im a father to a wonderful little baby girl
i would do anything to keep her safe
you could feel the anger and the determination in jackman when he was questioning the young man
great movie all around
its a must see
simply awesome
may be the best movie of this year
best acting in a leading role huge jackman do his best
i chose him oscar for this position
o my god what a movie
jack gyllenhaal i was not your fan before this movie
and huge jackman too
a lot of suspense
thrillerdrama
if you love thrillerdrama you should must watch it
prisoners is a dark and grimacing movie
it doesnt really show how hugh jackman really wants his daughter back so to say it shows even more grimace and more depth in the horror of what is one to do
hugh jackman is the heart of this story
he brings on the true grit of his character which was fantastic
so no more talking
denis villeneuves prisoners possessed an intensified unrelenting atmosphere that is provides a uniquely captivating atmosphere
this psychological labyrinth covers multiple layers of how people are prisoners in their own complicated world
the film thoroughly and informatively explores all the character perspectives with refined detail however in instances this tight grasp the story has on depicting the explicit stress each person displays perhaps gets in the way of a fluent coherent story line
subtle moments in the film such as lokis tattoos bob taylors boxes of snakes and more significantly what was the ultimate outcome to alex jones go unexplained
nevertheless with phenomenal lead performances you can happily ignore minor plot flaws to this riveting mystery and cynicism this film hits the audience with
i was still expecting for a great thrillerdrama this year and i think that prisoners is the one
the movie manage to keep you in a great suspense the whole time and the ending was well put
also the actors manage to love the movie by the end
it s close to another great movie with some kind of a resemblance mystic river
the main plot is not so different end the ending is also similar
for a two and a half hour movie i would recommend you those two movies
you wont regret watching prisoners if you like thrillerdrama kind
too bad i didnt saw it first on the cinema it would have been a better experience to watch
i just hope it wont take long until ill watch another great thriller
the previewstrailers for this film never resonated with me so i had it pretty deep on a to see list but the opportunity arose to take in a showing recently
this film has stuck with me for a while nowit has a presence about it that crawls underneath your skin
it deals with very adult themes and can at times be tough to view but it is an important film that allows us to witness how some individuals handle adversity and frustration
many of the critic reviews acknowledge the work by jackman but it is the work by gyllenhaal that really wowed me
his cop was a fascinating character who appears to have had a rough upbringing has overcame it but now chooses to dwell alongside the lowest forms of society
a beautifully filmed movie with tremendous acting
if there is one thing someone could say about this film that would be woah
has it been 2h30m already
i must say i heard a lot about this film before watching it i even read the reviews
everything about it lived up to my expectations
what i was expecting to see was a film that would keep me at the edge of my seat which it literally did a film that would have me guessing all the way through which i tried really hard not to do but did anyway and finally a film that as a friend had told me would have a predictable twist which it sort of did
this is a very good actionthrillerdrama kind of film that really manages to capture you from the very beginning and keeps you at the edge of your seat throughout
its not that we have not seen stuff like this before kidnapping movies tend to be ubiquitous but there is something about this one that stands out
jackman gives an outstanding performance easily said about the rest of the cast as well
i highly recommend this film for everyone
what would you do if suddenly your son disappears without leaving any trace
what would you do if you felt your sons life was in danger
prisoners shows us that our worst fears can sometimes take control of our minds and change our way of acting and thinking
so what if you lost your daughter and no one is capable of helping you
prisoners is the story of two families who are confronted with this exact situation
in 153 minutes we are invited to look to the changes in the family memberss behaviors while they lose their hope
finding his daughter is the one thing that keller dover played by hugh jackman has on his mind and when he sees that detective loki jake gyllenhaal is not following his clues he decides to make justice by his own hands
this powerful and emotive story about families love and fear is one great drama full of suspense and outstanding performances by all cast members
prisoners is alongside with gravity one of my oscar predictions for the next year
a subtle mix of suspense tension and questioning that doesnt fade for two and half hours
a psychologically harrowing and almost disturbing story that takes advantage of the balanced and well played actors performance
a special mention to the stunning symmetrical evolution of the main actors characters played by jackman and gyllenhaal
the director gives us the free choice to pick up our character side which evolves with the complexity of the situations
this leads to a constant questioning about the right and bad way to solve the case
i just regret that the intrigue lacks a bit of pace
overall a great movie in the pure line of mystic river and zodiac
this film deserves the praise it is earning and heres why
firstly you have a very solid cast
each character play out their roles with solid performances solid enough to become emotionally attached and sharing some part of the pain they are feeling
the films tempo is also nicely applied applied correctly so that throughout each scene you become interested and curious as to what may happen
much of the storytelling is done in a stripped back style a muck more basic ground of storytelling but an elegance that makes it so fulfilling and worth much more than that
if ever youve played the game the last of us then youll understand what i am trying to explain
overall i highly praise this film for being such a great watch but also the feelings i was given whilst watching this movie such as suspense intimidation and the thoughts of each scene i still have after reaching the conclusion of this film
if ever you gain an opportunity to watch this film i highly recommend you go and see it
jackman and gyllenhaal give career best performances in this tantalizing suspense thriller
the story the plot the screenplay the acting the direction the set everything is perfect and is comparable only to the legendary silence of the lambs
i generally do not dare to compare any movie to the later but i am just compelled to mention this here
for a movie to be this good everything has to come together
if the story does not pack the punch than no matter how many dollars the producer spends on the movie it cant become legendary
prisoners is an excellent story which is fully complemented by the acting performances of jackman gyllenhaal and every other cast member
paul dano little miss sunshine who plays the character alex is worth a special mention here
he plays a disturbed kid in this movie and is essential to the maintenance of suspense and he does it seamlessly
i urge you to watch this movie in the theaters
it makes sense to encourage and appreciate brilliance which today is so rare in the movie business
i went into this movie blind i
e i did not read any reviews
i wasnt expecting much but was pleasantly surprised by the movie
the ending may have been a bit predictable but getting there was a fun and amazing ride
hugh jackman gives a very powerful performance surrounded by some excellent supporting performances
paul dano is fantastic as always
the material is dark and the movie is not an easy watch but it will keep you interested until the bitter and controversial end
if you love good acting and a pretty decent story then this is the movie for you
i also was impressed by jake gyllenhaals under stated performance
i dont usually like the guy but hes great in this one
hes also surrounded by great performers so its hard to shine
all and all you will enjoy this movie but  as a parent its not an easy watch
in fact it can be down right disturbing and will having you thinking about the content for days
but thats what good movies do
this is a masterpiece thriller with good acting both from hugh jackman and jake gyllenhaal
its a good kidnapped story however i must say that im quite depressed after watched this movie
perhapsits too emotional and gripping
around 20 minutes before the movie finishedi can guess the kidnapper and here you can expect a twist and clever ending
i am impressed with hughs acting since i only saw him as an action hero like in xmen or wolverine
i do hope to see him in more drama movies
if you want a simple thriller movie then be brace because it can be too emotional for you
i also love melissa leos and paul danos acting
very few thrilling flicks grace the movie screen that has you almost yelling right in your seat like the movie prisoners
the acting is real as maria bello leads this all star cast down a real road of what do you do when your children have been kidnapped from right from under your noses
jake gyllenhaal is spectacular as the detective who investigates the mystery crime in the small town
paul dano plays the suspect in a way that only he could do it
what makes this so real is the other acting of hugh jackman terrance howard and academy award winners melissa leo and nominee viola davis
the movies only 2 12 hours long but seems like 4 hours with the intriguing story line
a haunting suspenseful and masterfully acted ambitious picture with emotional complexity and a sense of dread especially if you are a parent considering the subject matter that makes for an absorbing and disturbing view
the film is several steps above most other recent crime thrillers or revenge stories deciding to not only be unforgettably intelligent with an intense story while being brilliantly grounded in reality but to care as well
its so potently riveting that i couldnt turn away from it until the first ending credit
i cant praise this film enough and i feel that it deserves to have the honor of being discussed as a potential awards contender starting with both hugh jackman and jake gyllenhaal who give what is perhaps the best performances of their careers as their characterdriven roles as the two leads were raw real and makes you start questioning about what would you do if you were ever put in the exact same position either characters shoes were in
this is a really good example of its genre and is a rewarding watch
the performances really make this film especially maria bello and terrence howard in their supporting roles
its two and a half hours long but doesnt feel like its dragging on
its not especially smart but theres enough suspense and grim mystery to keep your attention
i thought it picked up nicely during the vigil scene and kept my attention from then on
i liked gyllenhaals portrayal of loki and thought the eye tick and neck tattoo underscored the dysfunctional motif
there were a few clues along the way that make sense once the film reaches its conclusion which i guess is fun if you like figuring things out
its a good movie and the actors did a good job but its not one i would watch again soon
prisoners
its a slick dark crime investigation thriller raising few questions on moral ambiguity
the theme is based on kidnapping of two small children in a small town where police fails to make much progress and a parent takes matters into his own hands
like ben afflecks smashing debut gone baby gone the movies journey is about putting the pieces of clues together and in parallel questioning how much evil you can become to counter the evil
lead actors hugh jackman and jack gyllenhall give their best and supporting actors provide nice support
movie takes the conventional route of a crime drama but its the unsettling intensity in atmosphere through grey background and chilling performances that keep you puzzled in a good way from start to finish
like other classic crime thrillers it asks you to provide your full attention and makes you discuss it more and more long after the movie has ended
surprised by the conflicting scale of reviews on this film  its not the film of the year  but its a very good one
the cast are excellent so much so that my wife has now gone from liking hugh jackman to seeing him as some sort of mad rampaging bully perhaps thats more to do with his treatment of paul dano who she has a soft spot for
it isnt jake gyllenhalls finest film much preferred him in end of watch but it is a solid performance
paul dano is excellent in his portrayal of the prime suspect amp the film builds up a true sense of menace amp suspense leading to its conclusion
the miserable setting a weather adds to the undoubted despair of the characters amp the direction is solid
if i have to add one criticism its that the film is 30 minutes longer than it needs to be which leads to a feeling of this is being dragged out for the sake of it
excellent supporting cast  well worth a watch  but not a fun night due to the subject matter
just watched this with my movie theatreworking friend who watched this yesterday though he didnt mind seeing it again
hugh jackman and jake gyllenhaal are quite compelling as a frustrated parent of a missing child and a police detective who tries to do everything right in finding this child respectively
they both go after different suspects and its quite interesting what the results are
plenty of pointsofviews of methods and which suspect is guilty abound and it got me hooked for most of the narrative
one might be disappointed at the way things end but since the dialogue offers clues as to what could happen one should still be partially informed enough as to the eventual conclusion
in summary prisoners could be good enough for anyone not minding everything not spelled out in a neat tidy package
what makes prisoners so special is that it is more than just one of the most tense thrillers ever seen classified into the ranks of thrillertitans like seven it raises questions builds up labyrinths and puzzles twists the plot countless times and leaves space to interpret
you must watch out be attentive and curious in order to find out everything and even then you have to watch the film twice if not more times
rounded by a geniuslike actresses performance of hugh jackman paul dano and especially jake gyllenhaal playing the detective loki
how would i have reacted in cases like this
what means this
finished with a great ending prisoners is a mustsee for every fan of thrillers or just movies better than the rest
legendary director alfred hitchcock could easily have crafted this brilliantly written incredibly riveting and intensely suspenseful thriller
instead the virtually unknown canadian director denis villeneuve is responsible for what is without doubt the best movie of 2013
there are staggering performances from hugh jackman and jake gyllenhaalintricate plot twists that keep you on the edge of your seat and atmospheric elements that will make your heart race and interfere with normal breathing patterns
before viewing this movie it is recommended that you keep a brown paper bag by your side to prevent hyper ventilation and make sure to trim your fingernails as you will be biting them to the very end
it was good to see hugh in a movie besides wolverine and i knew it would be a definite movie to watch because you could see all of the different emotions he was going to be going through throughout the movie and thats what made me really want to watch it and im glad i did
it was hard to see keller beating on someone so relentlessly some of the movie was a little slow but i thought it was still pretty good all in all
most of the movie was easy to follow and i didnt figure most of it out until the end i know im a little slow but the worst part of the movie was the ending
are you kidding me
i dont care if he would have ended in jail i just wanted to see him rescued
at first it is a very long and boring movie
230 hours without explaining nothing
what was happening to the girls
what is the maze all about
they found the man in the end
too many scenes crying and wasting timeexcept thati would prefer showing more about the maze and more creepy things because i saw the movie is a horrorthriller
this movie is an absolute waste of time
also the movie has a lack of inspiration and the director just couldnt think of some scenes and leave them without the spectators knowing nothing
i would like to add that detective loki was not acting very welli didnt see emotions
do not watch this movie i repeat do not watch this movie
probably one of the worst movies ever
the plot was slow and excessively idiotic
either the majority of human beings who rated this movie above 7 are all imbeciles its quite possible that they are or the algorithm of rating is skewed
the story of the priest the killer and his old disgusting wife and the rest of it is unbelievable
we feel no sympathy for any character
the idiotic alex is repulsive and him getting beaten is warranted he should have been beaten more even though he turned out to be an innocent victim in the end
the end is poor beyond belief
the girls are found and the father disappears because the old woman kills him
an old fat freak he could have easily knocked her down even while halfasleep but he didnt
whats the point in writing more
in the end i do not blame the writers or the actors for they are known to be stupid but i am very disappointed with the imdb users who rated that movie as high as 810
really there are so many retards in this world
this is a movie about two families and their two little girls that vanish unexpectedly one afternoon
this story will make you experience one of every mans worst fears
loosing your child
you will feel compassion pain quilt doubt conflict
the acting is amazing and i must admit i had a long time to enjoy a movie purely for its acting instead of its visual effects or the complex story
the plot is simple but interesting with a few twists that will keep you on edge until the end
despite the length of the film i did not get bored at any point
both hugh jackman and jake gyllenhaal do a terrific job and i can not imagine anyone better for their roles
the rest of the cast is evenly good and the actor playing the prime suspect fits perfectly the part
all in all it is a movie that will make you feel sentiments to the extreme and that is quite rare nowadays
i recommend it undoubtedly
the movie was so suspenseful that i had to deal with it by going to sleep multiple times while it was running
in fact my whole crew was sleeping while it was still on
save 2hours of our life and watch something better instead
with such a wonderful cast the whole project was badly executed
bad bad bad too much time span to deliver such a useless and unbearable story line
i hate it to my guts
dont start with giving time to pick up i gave it a chance and believe me this was the worst movie i have ever seen in my lifetime or hopefully will ever see
i have never written a review before but this one really deserved my oscar
two very good actors ply their trade very well
jake gyllanhaal plays a policeman who is utterly driven in his quest to find two kidnapped little girls
hugh jackman plays a survivalist who prays for the best but expects the worst
during thanksgiving dinner two little girls go up to a rusty old rv and shortly thereafter disappear
the prime suspect is a mentally handicapped young man the driver of the rv
but the girls are nowhere to be found
he is held for 48 hours and then released
it is then that jackman takes matters into his own hands
he kidnaps the young man and convinced he knows everything tortures him and beats him for days
meanwhile another suspect arises but jackman cant handle this and keeps pounding away
there are numerous twists and turns that seem to work well
gyllanhaal is a troubled guy himself who has some anger issues that he keeps under wraps
i had not heard of this film and it was a treat to view it
this is a very well made film
quiting its first 30 minutes the rest of the movie its a time where you got to think a lot
predicting the characters movements thinking about whos going to be the criminal and guessing the end of the movie makes this film a really watchable one
if you like thrillers youre going to love this film
watch it
this movie is one of the greatest movies ive ever seen
the performances from every single cast member is 1000100 there will never be a better cast in a movie than jake gyllenhall paul dano and hugh jackman
the cinematography by the amazing roger deakins is so bleak and dark you feel dirty just by watching the movie
the writing and directing are tight theres no scene or line that deserve to be taken out
if you love crime dramas watch this movie
this is one of the best movies i have seen in the past 20 years
i mainly watch thrillers and this is a thriller directed well acted well and keeps you interested throughout the whole movie
this movie is why jake g
is now one of my favorite actors
this guy has an inborn acting intensity that is very rare
i wish they had a sequel to this with a new case for jakes detective character  and of course it would start out with a better conclusion to this one  i just could not handle the end
i have to imagine my own ending because as far as i am concerned this prisoners movie is not over
its too late for an alternative ending but seriously the detective has not thought this thru
the pattern of the character that is missing was to pursue finding his child
he never would have stopped unless he was dead
this is a great movie especially the role of detective an actor that i like
first of all i thank you for the movie cold well
thus becoming one of my favorite movies
the prisoners made we think that from the beginning of the story we already know the principals actually but in the end it turns out we have to make an educated guess wrong
really thrilling to watch this film up to second the end of the last movie really a valuable experience i highly proud to be able to watch this movie
this is a great movie especially the role of the detective an actor whom i like
first of all i thank them for cool movie well
thus becoming one of my favorite movies
the prisoners make us think that from the beginning of the story we have actors actually know but in the end it turns out we have to make guesses wrong
really thrilling to watch this movie until the last second the end of the movie really experience precious im very proud to be able to watch this movie
wow such an amazing movie
well thats what i was saying for 2 hours and 20 minutes
ok i still agree with that old me to some extent
d but
the last 20 seconds
a cliffhanger like that
seriously
ok when it comes to the whole story the producer really did a wonderful job but why on earth do some producers think audience wants this kind of ending
fine it doesnt have to be a happy ending but give us something d we just wanna know how it finishes for gods sake
anyway definitely one of the most exciting movies i have seen for quite a long time and the actors
should i really comment on hugh jackmans and jake gyllenhaals acting
i just wish i had stopped watching a few seconds before the ending
prisoners was one of the most intense moviegoing experience i have ever had
denis villeneuve masterfully weaves a haunting atmosphere and it had me on the edge of my seat the entire run time
it creates a complex puzzle of a plot that is just impressive to behold
it unravels slowly to reveal hidden layers of depth and complexity
the actors felt real as they were emotional and nuanced with some unforgettable moments that were just simply terrifying to experience
this film is a rare gut wrenching dark and fascinating masterpiece that will be one of the most underrated of all time
everything about prisoners from its acting o its gorgeous cinematography excellent pacing intriguing writing and fabulous directing makes prisoners one of my all time favorites
but i dont recommend parents watch it with their kids
when keller dovers daughter and her friend go missing he takes matters into his own hands as the police pursue multiple leads and the pressure mounts
but just how far will this desperate father go to protect his family
thanks to 2 great performances by hugh jackman and jake gyllenhaal great suspense and even some horror or action prisoners succeeds thanks to good writing and direction
and its a shame that none of this 2 won an oscar for their performances especially since jackman didnt pretend but actually cried in one of this scenes
the bad thing about this film is definitely the ending which totally destroyed the movie but also the fact that one of the characters gets trapped and 99 dies down there which totally ruined it for me but that wont make me down grade the movie because its still a great dramatic thriller
i personally think this is the best denis villeneuve movie
this is denis villeneuve breakout movie and he is one of the best director of the 2010s
he made one of the most complex and the most intense movies of the last 2010s
if i have to give three movies to explain it sicario enemy and this movie prisoners
for this movie this is not for the weak stomach and i will say it once this is so good
this is a complex and deep in the rabbit hole you will not know who is the good or the evil
by recent years roger deakins the cinematographer is collaborating with dennis villeneuve which that makes the more better part
this movie will have the cinematography that not a lot of modern day movies will have and that makes it more intense
prisoners is a modern day classic but not a lot of people will know this classic
so if you think that you are a movie buff and you are into a lot of movies go see this movie and i bet you you will be excited to his next work and you will have the best time in recent years for a movie
real rating 7
810 those who love dearly are destined to be victims of wrath a true yet cynical thought
a decently paced thriller for its length struggles with the weird morals of its characters or lack thereof in 80 of the cast as well as their inability to see that they are all prisoners to their own ideals beliefs desires and wants
they are inhumane creatures being portrayed as humane and no better example of this is the wife character thanking god for one of the most heinous atrocities an average human could conduct
the acting while a touch over the top in scenes is stellar the cinematography is excellent and the directing superb the writing is actually the let down though it feels like it shouldnt be and most will be able to gloss over this as we the viewer tend to accept weaker writing so long as our emotional strings are being played eloquently
i went to the cinema with absolutely no expectations about this movie and luckily i found it to be quite entertaining
the basic plot im not spoiling dont worry involves two couples whose children get kidnapped
the performances are quite good and even more the characters are quite empathetic especially jackman since you can feel his frustration and anger rising throughout the movie gyllenhaal does a good job as well
i wouldnt say it should have been an oscar candidate but its still an entertaining movie to rent or even to go to the cinema like i did
in general lines its an entertaining wellpaced movie with a more than decent script
watching the trailer on prisoners i was convinced it was gonna be big fat clicha and dud but while it does have some of the storyline and suspense were used to and maybe even clichad i surprisingly enjoyed the movie thanks to some excellent performances especially by hugh jackman and melissa leo and some slick cinematography and editing
the director dennis villeneuve has put together a serviceable story with infused emotions and great settings
the closest movie i can think of that has a kindred spirit to this is winters bone
both rely heavily on hostile and dark woodsy settings
the mystery comes together fair enough but the actors take this movie up to a solid 710
recommended
