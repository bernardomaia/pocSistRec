lovely performances makes this far too clean and neat story not merely palatable but enjoyable
we know by now that the plight of the colored in the south wasnt that clean cut or gentle in any way or shape
here we can sit and watch discovering the depth of he ordeal in the wonderful face of viola davis
but it all remains in the mild margins of the real story
entertaining yes but i couldnt forget documentaries of the period or the long walk home with whoopi goldberg and sissy spacek
sissy spacek is in the help too and shes very funny
it also shows bryce dallas howard under a new light
the bitchy almost evil light
shes better here than shes ever been
emma stone is lovely and the wonderful allison janney in a disturbingly recognizable character raises the film to unexpected levels
i felt the film was too long and too careful not to offend anybody and thats were its weaknesses lay
but i do recommend it
this movie wasnt badly made its just bad that it was made
in it every character is a clicha cartoon in support of a fictional rose coloured glasses version of 60s america where almost every white person is a villain and every black person loves fried chicken
if this is how america learns its history and judging by the reviews where many have viewed this film as having a positive and accurate message of hope and struggle
then no wonder the western world is in trouble
is it worse that a story about the struggle of black people to overcome oppression in racist 60s america is centered on a privileged white woman on the road to new york success
marginalized yet again it seems
this movie started out as passable entertainment but by the time it crossed the finished line it had stepped full force into misguided and offensive
and shockingly many people seem to not know the difference
after reading the book i was anxious to see how well the actresses matched the characters
i absolutely loved emma and viola
they made the movie realistic and followed the characters from the book exactly
i dont think many actresses could have pulled it off
also it was a relief to see that hilly was a lot less intimidating in the movie than in the book
what i like most about the help is that it wouldnt be a huge deal to not have read the book the movie would suffice creating the same emotions in both film and book
two side notes 1 even after seeing the movie read the end of the book regarding the author
2 emma is awesomewould love to work with her
this is like one of those afternoon made for tv life affirming dramas
full of sugar whimsy and wholesomeness but totally lacking in truth and bite
ugh
the performances are almost uniformly two dimensional  even allison janney opted for cartoon like characterisation
the period detail is sometimes accurate but occasionally glaringly inaccurate
for example no girl in the early 60s would have worn her hair in emma stones hopelessly anachronistic style
i blame tate taylor who was credited with the screenplay and direction
apparently taylor was born in jackson and is a close friend of kathryn stockett
can this really be how ms stockett wished her novel to be brought to the screen
but there again i havent read the novel
could it be full of the same yukky apple pie philosophy
this is the most wonderful movie
i enjoyed everything about it
i adore the characters and the story line
excellent movie
i think it is well told and it is a very moving story
it is a slow paced movie but i found myself intrigued by each moment
the only thing i found myself wanting at the end of the movie was more story line
this is a touching endearing movie i cried and laughed
i havent seen a good movie like this in awhile
though most will consider this a chick flick i think men could enjoy it just as much
a must see
i would compare this movie to life as a house and evening star
a story that just captures you heart and you dont want it to end
perfect
a movie about the civil rights movement in the 1960s responds with a light hearted approach to the chaos whilst conjunctively addressing the hardship of the help
whilst the instory author requires help from the help to right about the help may seem disorienting tate taylor director does this in a way that no other director seems to be able to do correctly
great camera work located at about 30 minutes where the camera spirals upwards following emma stone up the spiral staircase is a shot that has been remembered by myself and is something i look for within movies today
however this shot and the shot at the end credits place it comfortably  in my books as the shot which is on par with final shot from the passenger
the end credits in particular allow the actors the right of recognition which they all deserve
keeping to the underlying message right down to the point
a film which is undeniably rare for our time a perfect 10 out of 10 5 out of 5 masterpiece
i just watched for the filmography of emma stone and found this movie
i didnt think about racism and even the feminism
nowadays these two topics are hot for discussing in our country
the racism are still remained to our lives and feminism is ahead for the progress
the woman emma stone played was really progressive person
she even gave up her love for fixing the wrong culture
i could know the phases of the times she lived
i thought that the racism was removed in the worlds society but from the surfing the internet i could find many examples of still remained race discrimination
also this movie made me to start having interests about feminism and the rights of women are not totally implemented
this movies story was full of touched and i could see the steps that many people experienced from the times to have their rights
i absolutely and wholeheartedly loved this film
to start any film starring emma stone is my favorite
i believe that the directors created this film with so much respect to all races
no matter what race you are so much can be learned from the story line of this film
although this film was based on times that we no longer live in it did an excellent job portraying it in a way where viewers could relate understand and be entertained
this film is not just to bring awareness to past history but it is also a film that contains different scenes that will make you laugh so hard scenes that will make you fall in love and scenes that will make you cry of both sorrow and joy
it is unbelievable that such a great appropriate and family friendly movie can contain all the factors that us as viewers enjoy to sit back and watch
i definitely recommend this film to everyone
it is a film that will open your eyes and also bring unity within different races and appreciation for bold people who one day took a stand for freedom and equality
words cannot express how excited and anxious i was while watching this film
with mysteries lurking in ever corner the audience just didnt know what to expect except the unexpected
emma stones role was played extremely well the writer whos trying to do her research by interviewing the black servants in america during the 70s
octavia spencer who played the role of minny jackson did a smashing job of serving a plate of wella do i really have to say
anyway the antagonist jessica chastain who played celia foote was most definitely asking for it
in fact everyone who were following the path of apartheid were
i must say i normally read the books before the films but the help seemed to funny judging by the trailer to postpone watching it
fantastic filled with fun and enigmatic encounters this is a definite must watch
everyone will definitely enjoy it without a doubt
watch the film and make up your own mind
i saw the help at the movies with a group of female friends
the character development in this film is really a great match for the story line
i have a list of my favorite characters which you likely agree that they are all an enterprising bunch
the storyline is in a remarkable setting brought to life from a time of racism
i love that the movie presents the perspective of a number of the characters instead of just being from the perspective of just one character
it definitely has some hilarious moments and even some tearjerking moments
its definitely not just a film for women or women of a particular race
its a film that all can enjoy
they couldnt have picked a better cast to play these characters
they really sold the story line to the viewers leaving us wanting to know more as it was served
its a fan favorite movie that i can definitely watch again and again
the help
an aspiring author played by pretty emma stone during the civil rights movement of the 1960s decides to write a book detailing the africanamerican maids point of view on the white families for which they work and the hardships they go through on a daily basis
subject is sensitive but treatment is not
in fact most of the time it is balanced comical take on the racism that makes it an easy watch rather a shocking watch
if we talk about performances octavia spencer treats big time with her delightful portrayal of minny jackson for which she was awarded an oscar
viola davis also stands tall with her sincere portrayal of aibileen clark
whole movie is crafted like a girls movie so there is very less for male actors to showoff here
movie makes its point but never hits you hard so you may not think much about what you experienced after end credits have gone down
nevertheless its nicely crafted easy watch
yesterday i had a 3 hour break inbetween classes and a free movie on my amc stubbs card so i went to the movies
unbelievably the only thing playing at my time was one of the movies i didnt want to see the help
isnt it funny how the movie you never want to see always turns out to be great
the help is based on a book by the same title and follows a young writer in the mid 1960s looking for an idea
at a party she notices how horrible people are to the african american help and decides to write their story
of course its a scandalous idea that can get them all killed but skeeter finds one woman brave enough to tell her story
this movie is funny heartwarming and inspirational not to mention the acting is top notch
viola davis deserves an oscar nomination for her performance which is one of the strongest ive seen all year
the help is an amazing story with a terrific cast and a big upside
it has a unique and inspiring story that takes us back to a very tumultuous time in american history and i cant recommend it enough
just watched this very compellingly historical drama with my movie theatreworking friend who seen it twice before
we both enjoyed this fictional account of many of the africanamerican female maids and their stories they tell to an aspiring author named skeeter emma stone
among those female servants abileen viola davis and minny octavia spencer provide the most interesting of their trials of working for their employers
the most mean of the white employers is one hilly bryce dallas howard who gets most of her comeuppance in the most dirty ways one can imagine
then on the other side of the tracks is celia jessica chastain who somehow becomes minnys savior and vice versa
theres also good supporting turns from sissy spacek cicely tyson mary steenburgen and especially allison janney
since i havent read the book im sure there are some details i havent been privy to that im sure might have made this movie even more compelling
but what ive seen is good enough for me to highly recommend the help
i wont venture in to great detail about the film i just really felt compelled after seeing the film half an hour ago to express my heartfelt thoughts on such a beautiful and touching film
not only did it bring tears to my eyes and cheeks and chin and blouse
it made me laugh made me contemplate and also reflect greatly on the history and thought provoking truth that the film so touchingly and truthfully depicts
it was beautifully directed fantastically acted and above all this films ability to touch the hearts of all those in the theatre really made it a magical experience
not only is it a film with an historical message it is a film with a mood hope
i could go on but i wont
all i have left to say is please go and watch this incredible film
i wanted to see this film earlierbut the length of it made me postpone it
i was wrong
it was so good
it shows how black people are treated by the white and it is so sincere
i wish people werent so racists
although we live in the 21st centurynothing has changed since the ages of caves
womenblack people and weak people are treated really bad
i liked that the author was white but in reality no white would lose hisher friends to defend black people
i liked the cake bryce dallas howard ate
it was so funny
unfortunatelyinjustice will always prevail
the help is an incredibly beautiful film that focuses on the racial injustice of the 60s
the good characters are very likable and the audience can empathize with them very easily as they can connect with the storys emotional impacts
the overall film is one that i cry at every time i watch it
i would definitely recommend this film that has oscarworthy acting
this movie was fantastic
it was so critical of the 1960s while remaining funny and entertaining
the relationship between eugenia minny and aibileen is so heartwarming and beautiful
they lived in a time that discriminated against blacks and women
to be women who took a stand against the injustice they saw and expressed is an example to all
i loved the movie and its message and will be watching it again
an movie that told a story about black women who stood up for themselves
i think the team shows on a good and impressive way how the black people make true even in the 60s and in some places even now
the choice for the actors was a good choice
it look like they live in that time en they came of the screen with a lot of confidence
they give you a good feeling so you understand where the movie is about
even with a bit of humor
this was so wonderful showing both side black and white i couldnt stop crying
viola is my hero and love all her work
she takes you with her in whatever part she plays
the whole cast was awesome
i couldnt believe there are people still living like this
i would recommend this movie to see
a very well developed story
it is definitely bound to move you and it puts across beautiful messages that defy any racist stereotype about colored people
i recommend it to anyone who is fond of social movies and want a happy funny and cozy film with tremendous meaning behind it though
the world is a combination of species that do not necessarily need to be mixed but if you need to create together the framework that gives you that magical texture to today
the history of mankind is perfectly prepared personalized in fact every crazy thought and benevolent but that mixture of thought is where the new born and most beautiful human behavior
each story is a time of learning a time where many people was the sacrifice for us to learn a lesson how sad is when some forget when some break the chain of knowledge that has cost both to mankind
thanks the help we can still remember the lessons learned and help those even after so long not been able to learn from our past that we are all part of the great network called humanity
i found this movie sad
it depicted the way colored people were treated and they were treated as subhuman
those parts of this film made me angry actually
i did really like the revenge parts of what the one maid did to her employer
without adding spoilers to this the other revenges which took place
it was a very good film actually and with very good acting
i was very much moved by the film and at times almost to tears with some parts
octavia spencer and viola davis were awesome in the film
i would recommend this movie to be watched
it does tell the true way of how colored people were badly treated and regarded as slaves to racist white people
lucky 13 for 2011
this little film came in right after a dozen blockbuster movies for years best grossing films
any guesses as to why
every talent and casting agent will readily tell you
guaranteed without one name attached it does not come anywhere near as close and her part in this production is limited
theres only a small number of names that incite you to search out what other work they would have done
she is one
as for this film she brought the audience to the table and it is a very worthwhile experience for those who might not have gone there without her participation
the number of individuals labeling themselves actor is huge
but those who are truly talented in addition to being a fullfledged moviestar
now thats a minuscule number
if youre looking for an informative civil rights movie this probably isnt for you
although the movie does give its viewers a good idea of some civil rights issues during the 60s i think that the dramatization takes away from the history of the era
its more of a drama about relationships than a historical film
the movie revolves around skeeter a white journalist searching for black maids who are willing to share their stories with her
i thought it was interesting to learn about the crucial role that the maids played in the families that they worked for
they practically raised the children and yet they were treated horribly and received very little pay
despite my interest in the maids stories the white savior aspect of the movie bothered me
skeeter rescued the maids and in the end she advanced in her career as a journalist when she earned her dream job
although it is powerful and interesting i think that the movie is a bad representation of important history
this was a wonderful and moving film
throughout the duration of the movie i laughed i cried i clapped i cringed with discomfort and squirmed with anticipation
the range of emotions i experienced can be credited to not only the excellence of the story writing but the quality of the acting and the personality of the actors chosen to portray each role
i especially appreciated that the focus was to develop the characters of the maids as opposed to the white ladies that they worked for
this allows for a consistency between the main characters goal to write from the negro perspective and the goal of the film itself
unfortunately it seems that some critics think that this film and storyline are not realistic
it has been criticized for simplifying the complex race relations and omitting the various forms of violence that characterize the time period
the help is a story about black maids in jackson mississippi who are mistreated by their white bosses
however there is a young white journalist who wants to help them by writing a collection of stories of what their life is like
originally she has a hard time getting people to volunteer to share their stories because it is very risky
however she manages to get lots of volunteers in the end and she published her book
fortunately for the maids they arent punished because their bosses are afraid to admit that the stories are about jackson because there are embarrassing stories
specifically about how one of the bosses ate a pie made out of her maids poop
this is a great movie for seeing how african americans were mistreated in the south for so long
it is ridiculous that the whites believe that they cant use the same toilets as blacks because they carry certain disease yet they allow them to take care of their children
this was a very good movie
it was interesting to see whats life was like for african americans back then and what they had to go through
it was crazy that they were treated that way and that they couldnt even use the same toilets because they thought it would spread disease
it was cool and inspirational to see how one person could make a difference just by telling other people about what it was like
it was also strange to see how dangerous it was just to share their experiences and how it could have very serious consequences
it was inspirational though that they were brave and did it anyways especially skeeter who didnt really have anything to gain by challenging the norm
overall it was a very good movie even though it was pretty sad
thought this film there are many main ideas that bring out the reality of the solid south during the times of civil rights and integration
although the reality of the south was much worse than the movie portrays i believe the movie carries out all the ideas it involves with great proficiency
the help shows an attitude of love even towards those who hate and hurt those you love and even yourself
it shows a persevering way of life and creates an environment of hardships and despair with jfks assassination and the death of the main characters son to demonstrate how awful life was especially for african americans in this time
furthermore nonviolent ways of life is shown allowing the historical fact that nonviolent actions were what changed generations ie the actual book the help written in the movie
overall i greatly appreciate the timeline and plot of this movie and find it to be incredibly inspiring
the help is an inspiring movie about african american discrimination and is based on the book by kathryn stockett
it goes through the lives of numerous people in jackson mississippi
although the transition from book to movie isnt perfect the writers did a good job at including all the story lines and characters showing the importance of each one no matter how little a role they had
a really emotional part was when aibileen had to say goodbye to mae mobley at the end of the movie knowing that she was the only good influence in the girls life and that her mother wasnt able to take care of her the way she deserved
this scene was put together well and had just as much emotion in it as it did in the novel
the writers did a good job at showing the struggles aibileen and skeeter faced when trying to coordinate and get together to write the book about the poor conditions of the help in white households
overall this movie is a good representation of what african americans had to go through in the early to mid 1900s and i would recommend it to anyone
after some resistance skeeter is able to record the testimonies of several african american women who work as the help for white southern families
they reveal how they are treated as well as the secrets of the families they work for
this film in set in the 1960s civil rights era
it is twosided in that it shows there were white families and people that were in favor for equal treatment of african americans
the film is able to convey messages of equality in an uplifting tone through use of comic relief
the scenery of mississippi provides beautiful views throughout the film
emma stone is a fun character and seems really genuine with the interviewees
viola davis who plays abileine a maid is an amazing actor making the film more realistic
in summary i would recommend this film to those who are interested in historical films as well as people who enjoy emma stone as an actor
i and my family enjoyed watching this film
its a delicious blend of laughter and tears hope and fear and ended with a good message
just like everyone else i agree that this is a great cast many of them delivering subtle and powerful performances
although there are sad moments heartbreaking moments there are also very funny moments too
you can feel humanity resonating here and there
the story is not dark
there is hope there is a trust in the good side of people a warm feeling from friendship and humanity that comfort your heart a whisper that says love will conquer in the end
the villain hilly was an excellent example of the pharisees and their hypocrisy
she presents herself as the most godly woman in the community but actually she is the most godless person among them
hilly is presented in contrast with celia who is a little crazy and unmannered but very sincere and sweet
this film shows us love hatred patience honesty courage and after all
love your enemy
the help is a movie about a girl who wants to be a journalist and who writes a book based on the experiences of the black maids that work for her friends
the movie handles a difficult subject really well bringing lightness to it so that it wont get tiring for the audience but at the same time it doesnt robes the subject off its importance and seriousness
the story follows the lives of many characters not only the main ones but it doesnt gets confusing as many movies with more than one stories to show gets and as i said previously it doesnt gets tiring to watch
the performances were great and that helped a lot the film to be as good but the set and the costumes contributed as well
there was only one thing i didnt like and that was the ending because it didnt keep up with the movie and got stuck into the corny happy triumph that many movies have as an ending
other than that the help is a great movie so 8 out of 10
the help is a must see
it tells of the extremely uncomfortable to watch racist beyond jim crows mistreatment of all the maids in jackson mississippi
the acting is great
the picturesque setting is in contrast to the ugly goings on in the domestic lives in the households of the middle class southerners life
the good white folk are evil doers when it comes to matters of race and the blacks are all angelic good innocent victims
i find it hard to believe that even in the deep souths racist capitol of mississippi their wasnt a righteous family to be found in sodom
but sometimes you need to exaggerate to the extreme to get a point across and hollywood is good at that
frankly saying that i know nothing about racist
im too young and was not born in a country which people hate each other just because of their races
ive heard about martin luther king jr
and his speech but i didnt care about it
until i watched this movie due to my teachers suggestion
the help is something that i cant imagine
we have maid and some of us treat their maids well but some will not and maids in my country are somehow respected because its difficult to find a loyal and good maid now
those black people they would not turn bad if their masters wouldnt treat them as a property
they are all people we are all people
i just cant imagine how you can treat the others that bad
i cried at the end of the movie
by far the best movie ive ever seen in my life
i definitely recommend this to everyone
the titanic didnt make me cry the vow or the notebook
but i can honestly say this movie impacted me more than any other
amazing acting amazing actors were chosen
just over all props to everyone that had to do with the making of the movie
im not even an african american and this just made me cry for a good 30 minutes
if you are trying to decide weather to watch this movie or another one this one is definitely the one for you  it doesnt matter if your heart is sensitive or not i guarantee you will cry
so if you dont want to cry dont watch it  thanks for reading
it is very rare that i come across a movie that i cannot stop thinking about afterwards and it is very rare that something that received industry awards was not some pretentious nonsense
however this movie is actually fantastic
it made me laugh it made me cry and it made me shake my head in disgust that human beings were ever treated in this manner
the film had a strong political and social message throughout without actually making it intrusive
instead the excellent characterisation engages to the extent that you almost miss them when the end credits finish
you care what happens to these women
this shows racism for exactly what it is completely ridiculous cruel and disgusting
if you cannot see humanity in others you lack it in yourself
i would recommend this movie as a must see
a captivating story about an ambitious young white female writer in 1960s mississippi who decides to compile the trials and tribulations of the africanamerican maids working in her hometown into a book
set during the volatile civil rights movement the film mingles a fictional narrative within actual historical events
the film is charged with personal societal and racial conflicts adding several layers to its plot
the dialogue is rich with southern dialects and colloquialisms
the assortment of diverse characters makes the film interesting and the interactions between them add substance to the story
furthermore the exceptional performances by the ensemble cast and the commendable direction makes this an absorbing and heartfelt film
my husband and i both just finished watching and loved this movie
the acting and the filming are superb
and by no means just a chick flick
filled with surprises and emotion that rivet the soul
i grew up in the deep south during this time period and i know what the race struggle was like
but this movie is not just about race
a lot has to do with upper class house wives
i am white and always knew that african americans were given a raw deal
this movie will shock youmake you sad and warm your heart in a wonderful way
it is a lengthy film but it flies by because you just dont want it to end
loved every minute of it
the props and costumes for this era were spot on
you will enjoy this immenselyno matter your age
i would watch this movie again
it has so much substance and emotion with a climax that will leave you cheering
one academy award was not enough for this movie
this movie it is one of these movies that go deeper and deeper into the subject
the whole movie is a big drama welded with a real touch of class from the director to the actors and actresses
there is something wrong about some actresses
i could say 50 of the white women of the movie over act kicking all the hard work that the rest of the cast has done to do this master piece
it is a long movie but you never get bored because talks about the real life all the time
you will not find cheap violence in fact you will not find any violent scene at all something that it is almost impossible in us films these days
remember to me this is one of the top 3 movies of 2011
this film has a very good blend of warm and cold dramatic and heart felt scenes
its a classic story of bad versus good and progress of humankind therefore i dont think its right to emphasize this whole racial issue just alone
its kind of like with schindlers list which is a disney version of the holocaust
never the less the feeling when leaving the theater teary eyed its worth going to see it and realize the help existed back than
very well made and amazing performances but perhaps too much of a film to relate to history and its discussions that follow and which you can read in other reviews
just enjoy it for what it makes you feel
human
the help is an inspiring and hilarious journey of racial tension in the deep south
this movie shows both sides of the racial segregation in the 1960s
it shows the hardships of the africanamerican maids and how they coped with their situations
likewise the movie also showed the caucasians moral dilemma as they were faced with either siding with the truth that ingratiation is the answer or continuing with the old ways of segregation
while racial tension plays a major role in the help it contains comic relief to alleviate the harsh tone of the message communicated by the movie but also maintaining the messages integrity
this movie was the buzz of the summer last year 2011 and a dozen people told me i had to see it
i never got the chance to catch it in theaters but when the blu ray came out in february i snatched it up and watched it
i was captivated from the beginning to the end
one of the best ensemble casts ever assembled and viola davis and octavia spencer both deserve oscars as does emma stone who brought tears to my eyes when she found out what really happened to her childhood maid constantine jefferson played by cicely tyson
this film has everything tremendous acting a great script drama heartbreak and some of the funniest moments on film
best picture of 2011
this movie is the break though film of the year
set during the civil rights movement the story follows two african american maids and an aspiring writer as the try to make a change by documenting the lives of the minority race and their place in a white run society
at this time this movie has won 4 major awards  one at the golden globes three at the sags all which are well deserved
octavia was fantastic as the caringbut domineering minnie and viola davis lead the the movie with a role so convincing it completed the atmosphere
actually the entire cast deserves recognition for their great work
defiantly a movie worth watching as spencer is as funny as she is serious
wishing the cast and crew luck at the oscars even though with a movie such as this they need to luck theyve got it in the bag
the help is a great movie to see that i would definitely recommend to anyone
it was written and directed by tate taylor
the help is an entertaining funny touching and moving film that keeps your attention the whole way through
it opens up our minds and takes us back to that time period of the civil rights movement
the movie takes place in the south where the whites are upper class
the actors did a phenomenal job with portraying their characters
one of the main characters played by viola davis is a maid to a white family
but as the movie goes along a viewer soon realizes that the term maid becomes irrelevant
the maids are more like nannies than anything else
not only do they cook and clean but they also raise the children in these families like they are one of their own
i definitely recommend it to anyone the whole production team produced a great film and you really felt as if you were taken back to that time period
the help was much better than i expected
the acting is what makes this film so touching and believable
would have loved to have seen more scenes and more about constatine
this period piece really looks the period
early 60s
kudos to the art direction
while all the ladies do an outstanding job with their roles its jessica chastain as a marilyn monroe ditz character who really shines
see her in the debt and then this
youd never know its the same actress
the new meryl streep
for all those who compare this and all movies based on novels this is a movie
not the book
any movie adapted from a book is just a condensed readers digest version of said title
no way can any movie include everything that the book entails
take peyton place
the movie is much better than the book even with many characters and actions left out
when i first saw the trailer for this movie i was hooked but before i wanted to see the movie i read the book which is a good read
and i saw the film and wasnt disappointed and its pretty close to the book
the acting in this film is excellent octavia spencer viola davis emma stone jessica chastain bryce dallas howard allison janney and sissy spacek all deserve a big awards for this film and personally spencer and davis deserve their oscar and golden globes for their performances
in the end this film made me laugh at some parts and almost cry and and also had some serious issues
its one of the best films of 2011
see it
let me start with telling how much i enjoyed the book it was funny informative and touching
just like the movie
tate taylor did a very good job in both directing and the screenplay
emma stone was a good choice and of course the oscar nominated voila davis did a spectacular job
davis is a great actress no one could argue with that
to my surprise jessica chastain and octavia spencer performed amazingly
chastain really showed us in this movie that she is versatile she was able to make us sympathize with her as a vulnerable wife in the tree of life opposite brad pit in this movie she showed us she can also play the sexy southern naive wife
also to my surprise spencer shocked me that she can combine both good acting and being funny it will be after this movie that octavia spencer will be in movies that could show us more of her talent
watch out for the oscars some of the ladies in this movie may be competing against each other at academy awards in 2012
this cast was first off awesome and i was just pleasantly surprised that it was as good as it was
i must find the book and read it
talk about courage and friendship what an understatement
i couldnt imagine living back when people had such small minds but thats how it was
this movie was touching and very real with a no hold back on feelings and the actors portraying them
back to bryce was amazingly cunning and bitchy while emma was the sweetest but stood her ground
sissy was hilarious in her small role that had a massive impact
viola davis drew me in and took me along for her ride of heartbreak and triumph
oooohh dont forget octavia spencer she was amazing
what a great story to show how the world has changed and continues to do so
went to this movie at the request of my wife and am not sorry i did
i recommend it to anyone
one of the best movies that addresses racism realistically  you know not everyone was evil while some were evil
much like the real world
the movie was for the most part non confrontational while accurately demonstrating a dark time in history
and shining the light on a person or group can make a difference and pride in ones self isnt a bad thing
the movie is well over two hours but keeps your interest the whole way
the movie takes you through several emotions and is very entertaining
go see this movie
i really wanted to love the movie as much as i loved the book
unfortunately the movie fell short of the book by quite a bit
while i did enjoy watching it i found that some of the story lines as well as the depth of some of the characters especially elizabeth lefolt suffered from the necessity of shortening the story to fit it into a 2 hour and 17 minutes movie
the acting of all main characters was solid with my favorites being minnie aibeleen and mrs
walters
it is an entertaining movie to watch but it does not measure up to the book
what made the movie fun to watch that one cannot experience reading the book was the soundtrack and the gorgeous cars
