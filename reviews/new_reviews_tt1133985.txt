they say that if youve seen one superhero movie youve seen them all
thats not entirely true but if every superhero movie were like green lantern then it would be true
green lantern is your typical superhero movie so if youve seen quite a few superhero movies like i have youll know whats ahead
this is the problem with green lantern its too predictable and does nothing new to make it stand out from the crowd
thats not necessarily a bad thing though but its not a good thing either
there are 3 good things in this movie
one peter sarsgaard as hector hammond is delightfully hammy and fun to watch
two the sfx are cool and what they do with the green lantern ring is also cool and parallaxs design suits its evilness
third the fight between hal and parallax is the best scene in the movie
other than those things its average
if youve never seen a superhero movie andor are a green lantern fan this movie is worth seeing
everyone else should see xmen first class
dont listen to the negative remarks
this is a great movie
ive been a long time green lantern fan and the story line is a great adaptation from the comics
yeah there are little things about the acting and writing but they are overshadowed by the excellent story
this movie is well worth your time and money
the origins and background are spot on
i was glad the movie was built around the green lantern corp
it is important to know that there is more than one green lantern
they did a really good job of showing hals personality
my wife even liked this movie
there is not dull moment
the momentum of the story keeps you from being bored
all i can say is that i was extremely impressed with this film
based on the trailers i was expecting this film to be mediocre i was wrong
in my opinion for a superhero film to work it all narrows down to special effects and the acting
for this movie both are great
this movie may not have been as good as xmen first class or the dark knight but it is an above average superhero movie
ryan reynolds is good as always and mark strong delivered a strong performance as well
this movie is heavy on special effects and they are spectacular
the dialogue is nothing new but dont expect it to be excellent given the fact that its a superhero movie
overall this movie was very well done and i liked it a whole lot more than i thought it would
hopefully this may be the first of many green lantern movies because this has the potential to become a great movie franchise
i know a lot of people didnt like green lantern but i dont know why
it was a fun movie with a good solid lead in ryan reynolds
it was not as dark as the dark knight or v for vendetta but that is not the nature of green lantern
the special effects were good and the casting was fine
tim robbins was well cast as hammond as was peter sarsgaard as hector hammond
kudos to mark strong as sinestro
i do hope they do a sequel with him as sinestro was one of my favourite villains
all up it was a solid film and one i enjoyed immensely
pity some people were disappointed but to be honest i dont know what they were expecting as the film stayed reasonably true to the character and the tone of the comic books
this film is a highly underrated masterpiece fast paced fun and true to the comic
the cast is almost right though they should have used somebody more serious for the lead than ryan reynolds sam worthington perhaps
blake lively makes a sexy helpless heroine and peter sarsgaard does a fine job as a creepy bad guy albeit one covered in makeup
all in all this deserves to be up there with superman ii dark knight and the first two spidermans
i really do hope theyll ignore the critics and box office revenue to make a second one as i feel one of the reasons its flopped is because many people who have watched it had never read the comic beforehand meaning it was harder to pick up some parts of the plot
green lantern is a great film it so didnt deserve the critical thrashing that it got i loved it not the best film of the year but non the less great
the performances were ok mark strong as sinestro was a fantastic as ever his performance reminded me of his performance in sherlock holmes as lord blackwood which is a great thing ryan renyolds did better than expected as hal jordan but peter sarsgaard as hector hammond was down right awful whenever he was on screen it detracted from the experience and which is why i cant give this film any more than 810 im just glad he dies so he cant be in the next one
oh and by the way if you stay after the film has finished there is an extra bit which strongly hints towards a sequel so watch out for that
i do not understand the various bad reviews on rotten tomato
i took my family and they all loved it and so did everyone else in the theater  a loud applause confirmed that at the end of the movie
filled with much more action than the great xmen first class i felt that green lantern delivered in a great way
not to mention this is one film that actually works great in 3d
personally i loved the film and hope that people will start to go to the movies without checking various reviews before hand
if you like ryan reynolds or if your a die hard green lantern geoff johns reader like myself you will love this movie
i gave it a 910
very entertaining not over the top easy to follow great special effects and the usual occasional humor from ryan reynolds
defiantly a great summer film
critics are way to harsh on this film
trust me give it a chance
according to rotten tomato mr
poppers penguins is worth going to see over green lantern
give me a break lol come on
take your family to a great summer action film
do yourself a favor and go see green lantern
i have been reading the comic for over 40 years and i was blown away by this
i understand that they cant make the movie exactly like the comic and i am fine with that
i want to say that the entire cast was superb except for the part of hector hammond the growing forehead was just a bit too nasty for me
mark strong as sinestro was a perfect choice
ryan reynolds was also superbly cast
i think that the special effects for the movie were done very well and i applaud the movie makers for making the aliens seem very lifelike
too many times they seem to get lazy with this or give the aliens very poor makeup
do not go in with a closed mind on this
give it a chance and i believe you will be well rewarded
i like the concept for this movie and thoroughly applaud the effort
the movie is great
i have seen almost every movie  you name itnot just super hero flicks and i can say for sure this movie still feels a fun filled ride with something new to offer in cgi aspect
i dont understand what people are complaining about  its a superhero movie for heavens sake  the hero is supposed to win
whats clicha about it
please dont listen to critics and some sheeps who feel criticising everything makes them a superior voice
shame on them they are the very reason that such a worthy movie is being discarded without even being given a try
go watch this movie
if u dont want to miss on something just because others said so
nice strange and new
ironic image of super heroes and interesting metamorphose of evil
few slices of love story and an adorable character
greenintelligent childish and fragile with an unhappy childhood hal jordan is perfect icon of our time
behind him rockstar green lantern a kind of elvis presley or bored charming prince
few fight scenesa museum inauguration a surprising victory and question of life sense
a frankenstein creature
the error
in final the clothes of charming are perfect for new hero of town
movie ad usum delphini like every cartoon tale about values and entertainmentgreen lantern is more
game with rules and reflection of few ordinary crisis
modelation of old definitions and replacement of marginal character
and birth of a very different hero far from any superman or batman but relative of their
it is not insignificant fact
the critics can go to hell
theres no way this film deserved the slagging off it got from the critics
it was fun it was exciting and i was damn proud to see hal up on screen ryan reynolds did a great job of playing gl and mark strong was even better as sinestro
hector hammond was suitably creepy and parallax whilst completely different from the comics was nicely translated to the screen
the cgi is nowhere near as bad as people make out tomar re and kilowog being prime examples although the guardians did look a tad ropey however but thats a small problem that can be solved in the sequel
i must have blinked and missed the john stewartguy gardner cameos but not the extra bit at the end of the first set of credits
if youre wondering whether or not to go and see this ignore the critics and make up your own mind
it was brilliant
now a sequel please
featuring that other corps
ryan reynolds as an allamerican superhero couldve worked if it wasnt for the terrible script and useless attempts to charm the audience with goofy humor and stereotype lines
if youre really into the comics world you might give this movie a chance
otherwise stay clear
its not worth spending 150 minutes of your time on such utter crap
the acting is not the worst but the storyline and all the clicha makes it hard to watch
youll find yourself waiting for the end or wanting to fall asleep
it might just make the worst movie of the year
a total disappointment for any superheromovielover and especially for those who dont even love this genre
i saw this movie yesterday and ill admit i expected more but what can you expect from a superhero movie
the special effects were great but where one of the reasons why it flopped
300 million for a budget is just too much
also for once the girl actually noticed who green lanterns secret identity was not like other superhero movies
owa was great peter skasgaard was good and scary john hurt was mindblowingly good as always as for ryan reynolds he doesnt make a bad gl
sorry this is a short review and my first so sorry
but since this imdb restriction of 10 lines is just annoying i will continue
martin campbell good have done a better job on this for surelook at casino royal and this and i think you will get my point but i think he did just fine
oh the plot was better than the average gl comic i read some really awful ones
10 lines yet
i guess not
im surprised by the average score this movie has gotten and so i must add to its legend in the hope that they do a follow up one day
ive watched it five times now  once at the theater once as a hired dvd and three times from the bought dvd
if you are a connoisseur of scifi and comictomovie this definitely belongs in the collection
id have given it a ten but i never give a ten to anything
bought the original comic when it first came out thats how old i amand wish my mother didnt throw out my whole collection of original first editions two suitcases worth forty years ago
id be worth a lot more than i am now if she hadnt
if you havent seen this one i strongly suggest you do
after the whole alien scene and we finally get to the humans and ryan reynolds part we see that he is really just a regular guy thats a cocky pilot
he isnt the easiest person to be around but he is good at what he does and tries to be the best and be different
once he gets the ring i feel like this is the start of trying to find out who he actually is and the something that is in him that even he cant see
i really like the idea of the fear and how they showed that
its as if it means something more and then if you fall into the trip of this fear and enjoy it too much its going to take you over and you will eventually die to the fear
it holds you back from what you know is right and your will is sucked right out of you and you succumb to its power
there is always going to be fear in the world as we see from the very end of the movie after the credits and even tempting the idea of fear will take you over faster than you realize
having the will power and faith power is always going to win over fear and death
amazing film definitely the best superhero film in the last years
an excellent use of visual effects and the main character with great attitude just a good movie thumbs up
although there are changes to the story are minor adjustments that help the continuity of the script
the key lines of the main character makes you understand the philosophy of the hero
despite the lukewarm reception from critics consider this film is far superior to what is described and even what to expect after watching the trailers
it shows that enthusiasm goes beyond the fear which makes these teachings to the level of yoda himself
since the beginning of the movie shows agile and witty giving us an opportunity to recognize the background of each character
for connoisseurs of the green lantern comic will be a joy to see the conformation of oa and the deployment of power and charm of the green lanterns
what i loved about this movie is that it was like the superhero movies of my youth 19902000
sure it was predictable and cheesy but thats exactly what i wanted
but also its smart where i wanted it to be and had a lot of important messages for the upcoming generation
carol was not fooled by the eye mask for example and reacted convincingly to the situation and hectors comment on how its unfair for him to get the job with the alien when there are people more qualified than him and that have waited their whole lives for an opportunity like that is something that wouldnt have happened just a few years ago
the movie introduced all the important characters and laid out all the points important for the story
im really looking forward to the sequel
all these reviews are saying it is really bad but its actually a pretty good movie
there is fighting the whole time and its not like a marvel movie where the fighting doesnt start until the last half hour
it is very time consuming and fun to watch
it is a great movie for 10 or 12 year olds who are into scifi and fantasy
i thought this was going to be an awful move when my son wanted to watch it but i have to say i was impressed
dont listen to the other bad reviews
the reason why i say its pretty good is because some parts were not well written similar to disney movies but that was only 3 or 4 scenes and i dont understand all the negative reviews
though i generally consider martin campbell as a potent director this one lacks direction and also dives into awkwardness several times
all this peaking into an intellectual deadzone at a finale while of course  swimming in screensaver cgi
as a personal opinion i might add though producerraped greenlantern felt more like a movie then i expected
its not good but to be fair it also isnt the worst superhero movie ever created
i contribute this fact to ryan reynolds who  surprisingly  is not the weak spot of this flick and considering the little hes given to work with actually does a good job adding an emotional dimension to the movie
after marvels latest concept work i am also grateful for any kind of action scene and especially ones featuring some kind of imagination and choreography
510
i have put off seeing this movie for quite a while thinking it was terrible and because i knew nothing about green lantern
i read about them on wikipedia and i guess that made me want to see it more
overall the movie wasnt as bad as i thought it would be
as with most movies that feature aliens it had its cheesy parts
however it wasnt overdone in my opinion
ryan reynolds was fine in the role
it was funny to see all the things he created with the ring like a chainsaw those big guns toward the end and turning a helicopter into a race car
i would look forward to a sequel as there is plenty of action i want to see out of these characters
the costume was pretty cool on green lantern
my kids 17 19 and i were happily surprised that this was a much better movie than we had been led to believe
the acting decent to very good from all
the special effects great especially in 3d and the story line was able to be followed by those who had no idea whowhat gl wasis
and thats the way the movie should be made
not everyone is a gl fan with a working knowledge of gl lore and facts
they need to fill in the story to inform people of the gl history while keeping the action up and storyline moving
in our opinion they were able to do this
we all agreed that if gl2 comes out we hope the cast will remain the same
and we will not only go see it but bring friends
not the best of reviews if youre looking for what happened in the movie but i couldnt let all those negative reviews go unchallenged
just home from watching the green lantern and i have to say i was really impressed
the always impressive ryan reynolds was great in the lead role of hal jordan who has been chosen as the new green lantern
this is an effects heavy movie but they are jaw dropping and some of the action sequences are totally amazing the plots not hard to follow i cant understand how this film is being so heavily criticized
right from the start of the film we are taking on a real rollercoaster ride given an in depth explanation of the green lantern corps and what they stand for
the fantastic mark strong gives great support as usual and it was nice to see angela bassett in a small part
totally recommended and i hope its not the last we see of the green lantern
ryan reynolds sucked in comic book movies blade trinity and xmen origins wolverine
this time in the green lantern he did a really good job
critics have been giving this movie negative reviews even rotten tomatoes started off giving the movie 23
i believe that the critics should watch the movie again and take back everything they said about the movie the first time
this movie has pretty good humor very cool special effects im guessing that it will be nominated for an oscar the action is pretty cool its climax was pretty good even though i expected to see more but it was still decent
im sure that the comic book fans wont be disappointed with ryan reynolds playing the green lantern
its rare that a movie surpasses my expectations but this one did
as perhaps one of the lessknown lesspopular superheroes green lanterns origins added a lot to the story and the noble theme to his mission endears the audience and perhaps strikes a chord when the battle between fear and will is articulated throughout the movie
blake lively of traveling pants fame does an outstanding job of being the beauty and brains while still being the vulnerable maiden in distress
the personal struggles of the novice superhero strike a chord with most every viewer and keep you rooting for him until the end
the graphics are a bit cartoonish at times but this is a superhero action movie so anything goes
the almost unlimited powers possessed by the green lantern keep you guessing during the intense conflicts with the bad guys both of which are reaaal bad
very enjoyable and my 23 yr old son who watched it with me was very impressed also  hes usually very particular about the movies he watches
fun and entertaining
the theatrical cut of green lantern is far better than many people may lead you to believe
the movie is all at once a science fiction horror action and romance adventure with terrific special effects and a great score to boot
while the insecure masses wrote it off with broad strokes fearing it as some kind of threat to the marvel universe the more astute viewer will recognize the brilliance of this magical genre blender
the film delivers wit and high concept science fiction that succeeds at capturing the magical weirdness of green lantern without much compromise in an effort to make the concept consumable on a grand scale
part star wars part exorcist green lantern dares to be different in an exciting way that will be appreciated by anyone unafraid to try something new
the dull lantern when i first saw the trailers to this movie it looked unimpressive nor exciting so i waited for the dvd and i am glad i did
the movie was just dull
first ryan reynolds could have played the hero if they gave him more direction but i never really cared for him during the movie
his suit was just awful
seriously a cgi suit looked extremely fake and looked more like someone taped a bunch of lights to his suit
the worst part was the effects
for a 200 million budget you think they would have had better effects
but the worst thing about the movie is that it was dull and boring
i could never really pay attention because it felt like the script was terrible and acting was terrible at well
plus with the special effects being bad but not laughably bad it was tough to get through
deadpool was right
do not make your suits cgi
overall 410
bad and painful to watch but there were a few scenes that were fun and generally the rest of the green lanterns were pretty fun to watch
its a superhero movie not an oscarwinning drama
it is what it is
so going in to see this movie i expected the typical introtothesuperhero routine that all superhero movies must endure  for fans of the green lantern a fair amount of the storyline is of course unnecessary but tolerable  for newcomers to the lantern scene these details are a requirement particularly for sequels
beyond the intro and background component the movie was a great for what it was having a decent storyline reasonable casting excellent sfx and an adrenalinefilled final battle
the writers did leave a few angles untapped as well opening several opportunities for future lantern movies that i look forward to
and as usual the superhero gets the girl but hey
it is what it is
definitely worth watching
i entered this movie with very low expectations since most reviews bashed it calling it noisy predictable and pointless
wouldnt have happened if it were labeled marvel comics
it offers a lighter story some warm humor and visible cgi effects
the action scenes arent dragged at all and i found a nice balance between character development story and special effects
but its labeled dc and after christopher nolan set higher standards with his outstanding batman films critics and possibly even hardcore fans tend to be overly critical of any other projects
this is a movie about a guy who basically receives a magic ring that gives him the power of flight and the ability to create any object of his desire through willpower so enjoy it for what it is a decent entertaining flick that would have fitted the marvel studios universe very well with the green lantern eventually joining the avengers

for a superhero scifi film was great also very also very cool also enjoyed how the lanterns are similar to the jedi though the protect each sector of the milky way galaxy also great performance from renyolds as hal jordan also enjoyed the story of him overcoming also loved the visuals
music by james newton howardthe last airbender amazing cinematography by dion beebechicago costume design by ngailia dickison lord of the rings and direction by martin campbell007 casnio royale  the best green lantern film for now
810
its not the best super hero movie in the world
but its entertaining and it occasionally made me smile
ryan reynolds as the green lantern was a good choice
he does a good job in playing the bit lazy pilot hal jordan
blake lively looks stunning the gossip girl star is turning into a real filmactress
i think we are gonna see a lot more of her
i certainly hope so
the makeup is very well done but some cgi aliens are very ugly and look fake and very computer generated
story wise there are some funny moments the action scenes characters its all there
peter sarsgaard does a great job only i think that the story of the bad guy should have been better
he is very easily defeated and there is not a real thread of all people in the world dying
and why didnt they kill him in the first place
the music score is good and i left the theater with a good feeling
i give this movie a 6910 not a real 7
this movie was really boring for me seems like it didnt have enough action in it im not gonna tell exactly what happened in the movie because i dont want to spoil it but if you watch the cartoon movie made byi think wb you will actually know whats gonna happen its almost scene for scene with one difference the cartoon actually shows more and is more developed
im a big comic book fan but this movie just didnt do it for me maybe it was because it was in 3d and within the first hour i was bored and after that i was just counting the minutes till it was over but one thing that would help the movie and im warning you do not watch the cartoon movie before going to see this if you want to watch it do it after the live action movie i believe thats mostly why i didnt like it because i had recently watched the cartoon movie
sorry if this offended you and you thought the movie was the best of the year
i have always been a fan of marlvel comics and the superheroes and i first met green lantern when i watched justice league
although hes not one of my favorite superheroes i like his powers very much
i both expected and wanted to see more green light action in this movie more creativity and longer action scenes
i also think they put a little bit too much faith in ryan reinolds bringing the movie home giving him too much screen time
i wanted to see more conflicts with relationships and friends not just with blake lively
it also seemed a little bit unrealistic that the greatest threat to the corps was defeated by a single untrained human
that the whole space and all the other green lanterns just gave up on this human and just stood and watched as he singlehanded took down the creature that they feared the most
maybe if they made the movie longer they could have dealt with the things missing in my opinion
well green lantern is as disappointing as they get for superhero adaptations mind you its not as bad as say batman and robin
but its just kind of bland average movie directed by the guy who directed goldeneye and casino royale of all things two of the best james bond movies and he makes one of the most disappoint superhero movies i have ever seen
ryan reynolds is like acidic poison to most superhero movies anyway this is the guy who poisoned blade trinity and xmen origins wolverine
and he drags this promising superhero movie down to through the gutter i mean i was disappointed by amazing spiderman but not as badly as this film
i mean i know they cant all be batman and christopher nolan but you can at least be as good as captain america or thor or iron man or the incredible hulk but green lantern cant
its so mediocre that it cant even get over the every mild manner superhero movies like these
and it is a failure to watch
okay first of all ive never even heard of green lantern before this movie so i may not have a good comparison of what it should be
i will give my opinion on the movie however
not the best movie in the world but it isnt the worst either
thought that ryan reynolds and blake lively were cute together and like any other super hero film its going to be predictable
to be honest not a lot of action happened and it wasnt all that thrilling
if thats what you wanted your better off will some other super hero
that being said the plot wasnt bad good graphics and i would watch it again
blake lively is better off in gossip girl i dont think she can pass as someone being overly smart like her character carol is
i like her and all but i think she could have put more effort into the role
ryan reynolds seemed to enjoy the film i sort of get that vibe from all of his work and i think he proved himself capbable of being a green lantern
this movie has been getting a bad rep from so many
so many people complain about too much time being spent on building characters but this is the first green lantern movie of this generation so lets cut them some slack
one thing you gotta love is when he cant full his love interest with a simple little mask
that alone scores bonus points
then once the foundation has been laid and any true comic book movie fan knows not to leave til after the credits the sequel has been set starting with the new villain on the lantern home planet this will be huge
my only disappointment would be waiting and not getting the anticipated sequel
definitely worth the money going to an evening show but buy the large popcorn instead of seeing this in 3d
i will say that i was so excited for this movie to come out and i was expecting so much out of it that it was just a little bit less than i expected but i still loved it
i have heard some people say that ryan renolds didnt play hal jordan well i disagree i thought he did great but i like him as an actor anyway so that could just be me
if i would change anything in this movie i would make the final fight a little longer
but it was still a cool final fight i loved this movie especially all of the cool gadgets he used
i recommend this movie to just about any super hero fans because i think that you wont be disappointed
come on people you saw the trailer you knew how cheesy it was going to be
just watch the trailer and youll see what i mean
i mean the villain is a doctor with an oversized forehead
ive never seen that before
you have the ability to overcome fear
wow
what brilliant writing
blake lively is eye candy but seriously shes such a dead actress
i came into the theatre knowing that this movie might suck and in fact i was fairly satisfied
it was cheesy and ill keep saying that and i think it was meant to be that way
but i can see where the negativity may be coming from
it doesnt choose to balance
at one end you have mark strong as a really good sinestro and the other end you have
all the other stuff
its still watchable there wont be any point in time where you feel like leaving
dont know why folks are dogging the flick
its good
not great dark knight x2 iron man but not hulk first one either
development is not really slow
ryan is much cooler than wimpy tobey mcguire
it is witty and the folks act like real people
come onyou find out you have super powers arent you going to gloat at least a little bit
there could have been more to itbetter development of eo guardians etc
but we didnt go to the movies to watch star wars rejects fight
we came here to see gl kick some booty and entertain us
do yourself and us a favor
see it
the 2nd will be even better because we wont have to spend as much time on introducing the characters
my husband and i just came back from watching the movie in 2 d here in ipswich
i am a big comics fan
my husband isnt but he thought on the whole the film was pretty good
we both thought it was slow moving in the first half
the portrayal of hal did annoy me at first after all he wasnt that irresponsible at the start in the silver age comics
overall the themes were developed well and i liked how the movie followed the comics fairly faithfully
i just wish the producers had given credit to the green lantern comics original artist gil kane and the original writer john broome
i did not like how the movie set up the sequel already
being a dc fan since i was a child it pains me to see such a beloved character be portrayed in such a bad way
the acting is godawful and the stupid cheesy lines serve absolutely no benefit to the film
ill admit blake lively played a good carol ferris but ryan reynolds played a terrible hal jordan that throughout most of the movie is beyond dramatic and everything is so
cartoonish
parallax was a stupid choice of a villain and the lanterns along with the guardians looked like shriveled up unappealing aliens
this whole movie was really aimed at little kids
your kids will love it youll probably snooze through it
do yourself a favor and dont watch this movie
i think the problem maybe that even in green lanterns heyday he was not the most popular comic hero
the real problem is this movie is too much like a comic and doesnt appeal to nonfans its not just the the green thing
being a green lantern fan of the golden age and hal jordan since the 70s my own view is ryan reynolds comes off as a nigh perfect hal jordan and the there is not much wrong with this movie i think there is just a lot of nitpicking because green lantern isnt thor or the avengers
im a fan of marvel since way back when but also dc you antidc types need to get a grip
this movie was easily one of the best comic to movie projects ever if what you want is to see a comic on the big screen not some bloated hollywood farce
i opted for the 3d version and viewed this movie with my wife son amp daughter in law
im an avid movie goer and do admit im not a critic
when i pay 13 dollars for a movie i want to enjoy myself and typically do unless there is a bad plot or unnecessary filth
ryan reynolds was perfect in the lead role
he seems to bring the right mix of a
aweshuckswhome
megabuttkicker to the part
his interaction with friends after he has the ring is hilarious
blake lively was very believable in the role of ace pilot corporate exec and love interest
didnt really know who she was before but shes very hot and talented
peter sarsgaard was a great creepy bad guy in this movie
its hard to recognize him but the voice and mannerisms come through
other high end actors play smaller parts which make this a must see
i never even picked up a green lantern comic book as a kid but picked right up all the plot points
how about a green lantern ii and while youre at it toss in a new van wilder
let me say this green lantern is the first movie of a series
that being said they introduced everyone and got a good story with it
they introduced the core the villains and his family and friends plus i think they added a little teaser as well but i may have been mistaken
thought the acting was done well and the visual affects were fun
i wish they would have done more fight scenes but what was done was very enjoyable
introducing of kilowog john stewart tomarre and of course sinestro make future movies a high chance of happening
i never thought ryan reynolds would have made a good hal jordan but he pulls it off very well adding his own flair to it makes the old stuff shirt hal jordan that i remember reading makes him a lot more likable
blake lively doesnt add anything but she also doesnt take anything away from the performance
now mark strongs performance was very well the look in his eyes makes me believe that he may turn one day i cant wait to see that
i would put this in my top 10 comic book movies but be prepared for a sequel
i thought this movie was pretty good
if i had read the reviewers i might not have seen it because they latched on some items and all seemed to be repeating each other
there was an exposition at the beginning that the reviewers seemed to hate but it lasted only about 30 seconds i dont see what the big deal was
there was a lot of action and the graphics were quite good
the 3d was great there werent any 3d thrill shots instead the 3d just made everything look a little more real
while i liked the movie and my younger daughters liked it as well my wife did not  she fell to sleep
so perhaps its not for everyone
but id rate this the second best superhero movie this year after xmen first class
contrary to what many professional critics have to say about it green lantern is an enjoyable superhero movie but one that doesnt quite live up to its potential
my biggest concern was ryan reynolds casting as hal jordan and i was pleasantly surprised in this movie
he is a little jokey but certainly not too much as to detract from the character
the parts of the movie that are not on earth are great from the opening scene to the lanterns home world oa
mark strong as sinestro is quite good and peter sarsgaard as hector hammond is also good
while this movie does have flaws mainly being some editing of scenes that seem to end to quickly and the main villain isnt too villainous
plus the final fight is a bit too short
all in all though the movies strengths make up for its flaws
i think the main reason that critics have hammered the movies is that thor and xman have come before and were both excellent so this movie had a lot to live up to
also dc fans will love dr
amanda wallers cameo
this film is the most unthoughtful dreary and horrific piece of illogical nonsense nothing makes sense  it looks like something they are trying to bribe you with
we know its crap so we will stick lots of these special effects that look awful to win you over
well you didnt
it was terrible the only people that seem to like this are comic book fans who always start with i read this comic 20 years ago  irrelevance
just because there is a comic book about the green lantern doesnt make the film any better or save it in any way
its a disaster zone no where near a 6 whoever gave it that are dreaming it isnt worth a single mark
director should be hanging himself for this film
did the people involve actually sit in a premier and say wow yeaa that was great
fools
i dont know why people expect greatness from comic book movies
by nature comics are generally fun and fantastical and thats the way i like the movies
the green lantern was right along that plane think fantastic four not dark knight
i loved the characters with their subtlety and genuine presences
the interactions were very well done
and with so little time to tell so much of a story i felt that the little nuances gave good insight to back story and developed character when there just wasnt time to get too deeply into it
as a whole the film is bursting with fantasy space travel mindbending energy powered manifestations and has the ability to poke fun at its inherent comic book cheese
the humor is light you are not getting van wilder but that plays well into hals personal journey and the relationship he has with carol
in short i thoroughly enjoyed it and will be on the lookout for sequels
where do i start
okay lets start with the acting since most people think the actor makes the movie instead of the movie making the actor
blake lively please make me understand how this person is even allowed in film
she can not act and she certainly is not enough eye candy samantha fox to warrant making me suffer through two hours of her bad acting and misshaped facial ticks
i love ryan reynolds in everything but feel that he over cheesified the character
the movie itself wasnt a total waste but is reminiscent of the first hulk
great actor playing the hulk but the movie was inferior
same thing with green lantern the cgi wasnt exactly on par with what we are used to seeing in the theaters and therefore i do not recommend that you go spend twenty something for your time and money not so well spent
i did not like the movie
because i think it only was a hollywood clicha and nothing beyond it
i mean i have seen a super hero who saves the world a thousand times and this one was no different
i think hollywood immediately needs new ideas
although names and costumes of the superheros change the main theme always stays the same
i do not know how long will they be able to make such kinds of movies but they should immediately revolutionize their ideas
if you ask me i would say it did not worth my time and i would not suggest it to any of my friends
watch it and see it for yourself
of course i appreciate their effort
it is not easy to make a movie
but if you are going to make a movie at least make a new one
i thought green lantern was an ok movie
but i do not feel it was as good as it could have been
i thought ryan reynolds played a decent hal jordan mark strong was a great sinesto and killowog was great too
the scenes on oa is were i thought this move really worked
i think they should have focused more of the movie there
the scenes on earth were a little distracting
do think that they relied too much on cgi and would have been better off using so real costumes for the charters that being said i would still recommend this film to people who like comic book movies and action films
other wise i would say skip this film it isnt work you time
when i first saw this film i was quit young so to me it was perfect
going back and watching again i can see why people slag it of but come on its not that bad
as a die hard fan of all dc and marvel comics the film was true to the comics so it still is a good film
the film could have been better if perhaps green lantern went to alien worlds aside from oaas people tend to forget sector 2814 is not just earth
also i think the choice of villains was poor as much as i love parallax he shouldnt have been the first villain and hector hammond was a joke
i think a more suitable villain would have been black hand the manhunters or some alien gang with qwardian weapons which could lead nicely into a sequel with the sinestro corps
apart from that casting was good story could have been a lot better but not to shabby
as comicgenre film this is surprisingly solid
it is wellacted and has good character development
i found this film to be more entertaining and less predictable than this years crop from marvel although i did enjoy the blonde god of thunder
ye other critics need not to forget this is still based on a comic lest ye be too critical
it will be interesting to see if the proposed sequel will make it to production
if so they better find someone who can create a stronger script like paul haggis
the latest caped crusader films took comic based films to the next level where chris columbus delivered 9 to10 star films
by the poor reaction and general panning by critics early on last summer i went in to watching green lantern with low expectations for a dvd watch
i kept waiting for it to get awful and employ my trusty fastforward button on the remote but it never really did
it was a fairly good entertaining movie
not as good as thor or even captain american and granted the alienevil being was mostly clichad and unintersting but i liked the back story pretty well especially the green lantern origin planetary development
some of the effects especially with the fighter jets were less than stunning and the romance was not really there spoiler however the green lantern effects were pretty well done and i loved the weird assortment of alien green lanterns
all and all the movie is worth a watch as satisfactory
