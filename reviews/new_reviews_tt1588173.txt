this movie was great
i brought my friends and they thought it was going to be lame but they ended up loving it just as much as i did
go see this movie its adorable
i loved how its dark and gory in a cute way
this movie is funny suspenseful a little bit of a horror and romantic its the perfect date movie
i dont get scared easily but this movie made me jump a few times
the whole movie i was entertained
i was very impressed with the way the makeup and hair team were able to make the zombies so realistic
r was very easy to relate with and this movie has a little bit of everything for everyone
i suggest going even if your a bit skeptic about it
go out and see this movie
when i was going to see this movie i was thinking that it gonna be another teen movie about a girl thats discover the natural identity of her boyfriend but it wasnt like this it was so much better with alternative focus and interesting events this movie comes with a brand new type of history a very well produced time line that will keep you with your eyes opened until the last second its simply awesome great for family adaptable for all ages and will touch even the youngest and the oldest person that goes to see it its not a reflexive movie that will be in your head for a long time but its a huge font of entertainment i recommend it for all the people in the world
of course this movie has a lot of existing elements that make it a little boring to see but its a great film for a saturday night to see with your friends
thanks all of you and sorry about my english im from other country
this movie was a lot of fun to watch
it is a twist on the zombie genre unlike anything you have ever seen
there is nothing too offensive or gory in this  the creators kept it clean and not too scary for a fullon zombie flick
there are your typical shot to the head to kill the zombies but those quick scenes are nothing compared to watching 10 minutes of the walking dead or the like
i am always concerned because i have seen so many movies over the years where the creators did not know how to properly end the story
so many movies are great the first hour and then end poorly
i thought this had one of the best endings i have ever seen
enjoy
yes
it is another vampire love story movie but guess what
theres better humor and of course the point where its definitely a unique type of story
the part of the movie that makes it more interesting is they made it to the way comedylovevampire gore and most of all action scenes to were they should be placed at the right moment
although its the typical zombies eat human who would ever thought of why not making a romeo and juliet zombie kinda movie
its pure genius better yet
props to the person who wrote it
this definitely makes that overrated twilight series sucks more after watching this
i would really recommend watching it
first zombie with white teeth
because if theres one thing the human flesh eating undead care about its dental hygiene
im in the first 37 mins of this movie and i can only ask myself why i wasted my time seeing it free so not my money
and what is hollywoods obsession with trying to make young ladies like me fall in love with zombies werewolves and vampires
are they just setting us up to lower our expectations about all men
choose between an animal the undead or the actual dead
honestly im watching this movie as a parody because i cannot see how it can be addressed otherwise
i will not address the plethora of faults in every scene and in the plot because my fellow reviewers have done it justice
skip this movie
to my friends who are making me watch this unironically we might have to reconsider our relationship
my mom was the one who wanted to watch this
i didnt really want to i thought itd be cheesy and not my kind of my movie
but hey
it ended up being of my favorites
i loved that this movie had it all action romance thriller comedy etc
it wasnt a chick flick and it wasnt a movie girls would roll their eyes over because of the action
i loved it because i was so engrossed in the film
during the actionthriller scenes i was at the end of my seat hoping everything would turn out okay
during the comedy scenes i was falling back laughing at what had just happened
during the romance scenes i was tearing up and even thinking of how much i love my boyfriend
i believe any movie that can encompass that many emotions into a couple hours is a movie worth watching
being a big fan of walking dead television series my review for warm bodies is undoubtedly positively biased
it was a good watch with several good laughs
it also has a nice to see some originality
indeed id rate the movie between a 6 and 7  closer to 7
young lead nicholas hoult does a good job with his linedelivery and zombiness
the movie is especially witty and clever in its initial third or so
beautiful young teresa palmer is up to the test to be the lead love interest
she is a bit tom boyish the right amount so
on the lesser side john malkovich has a bit role maybe not even needed  part of the weaker side of the story involving human fighters
worth a watch especially for zombie fans
warm bodies marketing campaign probably hurt it cuz you couldnt tell if it was a romantic comedy with zombies or a zombie movie with comedy
but we finally watched it and i thought it was very clever and funny
hoult amp palmer were terrific
the opening monologue was hilarious and immediately showed how funny sharing the inner thoughts of a zombie would be
loved that john malkovich was the militaristic leader
havent liked most of the other films jonathan levine has made but this was very well done
romeo amp juliet with a bite
they satirized everything from makeover montages sidekicks zombie folklore etc
and the music used throughout was great
bravo
hoult has really grown up since being the little kid in about a boy
i feel like most people missed the connection between this movie and the classic romeo and juliet play
obviously all the names r julie perry m and the plot with opposing families give this away
the real difference is that instead of dying together in the name of love they become alive together
with r being a zombie his coming to life is literal but even julie who was sad and lonely in this postapocalyptic world finds herself at the end because of r
this movie is the untragic comedic zombie romance version of romeo and juliet
i think if they would have advertised it more so in this way people would have understood it better and probably enjoyed it more
as for the movie itself the effects were good
music was fun
kept me interested the whole time
just a fun zombie romance for people who are tired of the same old stuff
a movie with the potential of creating a new genre with the maincharacter being an actual zombie
which could have given some very needed depth to the hackneyed groaning creatures we all know and love
however sadly the movie ends up just being another romantic flick with supernatural elements for teenagers
i also feel like the zombies are very loosely defined can they smell human flesh
can they communicate with each other
how and when do they become bonies
even though the movie sometimes tries to be selfcritical and even make fun of the genre as a whole i think just because you know your movie is bad it does not become better
i loved the concept but hated the implementation
loved it from start to finish great acting all throughits a totally different take on the whole zombie genre
its about zombies changing and thinking instead of zombies being the bad ones and getting killed nicholas holt did a great job definitely going to recommend this movie to friendsfamily etc anyone who rates this movie bad is wrong watch it its a feel good romanticcomedy loved it
i am going to watch this again cause thought it was great it was awesome 910 best romantic comedy ive seen in a while all films out now are just alright but when i saw this i knew i was going to love it give it a go it was great
i watched it on good quality too wish i saw this in cinema wouldve been more amazing john malokovich did a great job and so did the lead girl never seen her in anything before dont want to write any spoilers so better leave it at that overall feel good movie lovely romance and comedy leaves u smiling at the end lovely movie
i rented this film because of the trailer
im not a zombie fan in fact this is the first zombie film ive seen but the trailer was funny and i thought why not
i totally enjoyed this film
its a sweet well acted little gem
analeigh tipton is brilliant
i will be looking for more of her work in the future
im not sure that this film will please die hard zombie fans
not much gore really and it is more of a love story but it is amusing down right funny in places and the characters are all likable
r is not only charming and handsome the inside of his plane is fabulous a set thats little bit of paradise for quirky stuff mongers like me
so overall i certainly recommend this film with the caveat that it is subtle
if you want buckets of blood a lot of violence amazing cg gore and wild over the top laughs this probably is not for you which is fine because i highly recommend it to just about everyone else
a zombie finds love in the shape of a victims girlfriend and feels something stirring
underneath the smart alec jokes grim setting and zombie frolics what you have here is basically a morality play that proves the old adage that love conquers all
the film starts off in familiar zombie apocalypse territory with hordes of the reanimated shuffling around an airport then we meet hoults r a zombie clearly struggling with his new found place in things
the most refreshing part of the film is not the zombies and the land of the deadesque situation but the blossoming love story between the leads which is handled brilliantly and sets up the ending very well
all in all a good romcom that plays on its strengths but will probably annoy the hell out of hard bitten heh zombie fans
what can i say if you are a zombie fan then this is a must and even if you not you probably be pleasantly surprised
finally an original zombie movie with a different plot to the normal run or get eaten and then more running
acting and special affects were great what can i say i loved every minute of it and one of the first zombie love stories you ever watch
as well as being really funny it gives you a different perspective on what it could be like to really be a zombie an area which hasnt been explored yet which is why i am so excited about it and is as action packed and gory as most of the other zombie flicks
watch and enjoy
loved it its funny and the story is really good
made something different from zombies and i loved it
defo would watch it again
i thought the actors were brilliant and the story line was well thought out it was quirky but a little bit scary at the same time
all in all i think its prob one of my favorite zombie movies and i do love that genre
it was different but it worked it really did
trust me  watch it and you wont be disappointed
i had never heard of it before we decided to watch it but im really glad we decided to
from watching the trailer we thought it could have been a trailer kinda good movie but no it was brilliant didnt wanna stop watching it
well i had this movie with me since days and hadnt seen itand for some reasons preferred other movies over this and saw this when i had none more to see and must say i liked the movie a lot the starting was good and different and shows u the world from zombie perspective  the concept of airport occupationbits of zombie comic dialogues and everyone walking abouts was something we dont normally see in regular zombie movies
the screenplay is simply wonderful and nicholas hoult has one justice to his character
the soundtracks used throughout the movie makes you appreciate and enjoy the situation even more its really different and cute in a way and i wouldnt mind seeing it again some day soon
give it a try and you will love it
im a guy that loves his zombie flicks
a few of my favs are romeros zombie franchise shaun of the dead dead alive planet terror and zombieland
it could be argued that this movie is the zombie twilight in a way it is but its actually done very well
the acting is good and the characters are likable
it has a few cheesy and funny moments such as r telling julie to act like a zombie so the others wont eat her
our male protagonist is a zombie named r
he cant remember his name or what happened before the apocalypse
he lives at an airport with his other zombie friends
on the prowl for human flesh r runs into a beautiful girl named julie
he begins to fall in love with her and it slowly makes him human again
their relationship is very sweet and adorable
their new friendship is soon threatened by the skeletal zombies called bonies
the humans and the zombies must team up together to rid the world of the real monsters
if you love zombies and love stories id definitely recommend warm bodies
to paraphrase the oft moaned female lament he couldnt keep it up
zombie film as told from a detached wry dryly humorous soul
hmm do zombies even have souls
pointedly funny satirical contrast of disconnected vs dead
brilliant flash of the zombie recollection of happy disconnected humanity lurching their ways eyes glued to cellphones and similar devices
thirty minutes on love enters the narrative and the overall edge wilts
movie turns romantic then preachy
rom com at least in this movie does not equate to razor honed satire
the story gets mushy
for zombie gourmands very few unhappy meals
a zombie horrordramaromance
really
sounds cool
was it
in all honesty i didnt believe it could become my favorite movie of 2013 but it did
the scenes the sets the dialogue the acting the plot it actually had a romeo and juliet plot with highly spiritual themes the truly frightening scenes
brilliant
still no matter how well made the movie was over the top great not because of all the reasons listed but because of the score
the music was perfect blended into every scene and was truly meaningful
zombies communicating their feelings to living humans through old records was brilliant and the rest of the score amazingly relevant at every scene
this was the final piece of the puzzle that planted this movie in my mind enough to watch it over and over
the hollywood elite will never give it the credit it deserves but it was better than any of the golden globe winners
i am a big fan of zombie movies
this was a cute movie however a bit slow the romance between the two heroes of the movie was dragged out too long and made the movie a bit slow and kind of boring
i think they should have shortened the scenes on the plane where the zombie r is living and added in a little bit more action
howeverthere were some exciting parts where they are battling the zombies
funny parts too which are cute
i think it may have also needed a bit more history of the characters
the parts with john malkovich were really good because john malkovich is just awesome
nice movie to rent on a saturday night but not in the same league with resident evil zombie movies
however this movie is a bit more heartwarming rather than bleak there is hope for the zombies
well i watched this film about a month ago and its interesting how it shows you how the zombies feel and not the humans for a change
its a love story combined with a horror comedy its different funny and you really should watch it if you havent already
its good that they still eat humans but they also still have feelings and i really liked the idea of a zombie eating a human brain and then they could see the memorys and everything that person has been through
its a great storyline with good makeup and you can tell the director has put lots of effort into this film
i would rate it 9 out of 10 because of the storyline and the acting is good too
this movie is pretty good would probably not watch it again but its a good one view time filler kind of movie
the story is okay i guess the moral of the story is that anyone can be redeemed from an evil past
some of the acting is pretty inconsistent
i was just expecting more comedy and maybe better acting
i think the overall story is pretty good and the 3 or 4 times there was a funny part it was really funny
i think the trailers make it seem a little more hilarious than it actually is
and the trailers are cut in a way that are not accurate in the movie
the best part of the movie is the guy who plays marcus
pretty hilarious and one of the few with consistent acting in his progression from zombie to
you will see
to keep it shorti love this movie
the reference to our zombielike society makes this comedy deeper than youd like to think at first
the soundtrack is great
the plot is simple but its touching
it makes me think about whether or not we can change as human beings
i have lived a zombielike life myself and i dont think i am the only one
losing contact with my body my feelings
so to me this movie is about waking up and it serves a much greater purpose
so goddamn good its a funny and somewhat ironic movie as well
the main characters do a good job
the only downside i can think of is that the movie seems too filtered sometimes
it would be good to see everyone looking more real
but it doesnt kill the overall impression
check it out
the movie uses forbidden love between two persons who present two completely different worlds which is not a new method but love with zombie that is insane
recently ghosts vampires and beasts have been noticeable as wonderful lovers in chick flicks
nobody would think zombie would stand out or fit in as such sweet attentive warm lover
zombies in warm bodies are far from their relatives in the walking dead which people have been familiar with
zombie r aka the narrator for example is a very goodlooking insightful lovable braineating creature
the horror and romantic implements tremendously parallel throughout the movie
the love story of r and julie is very interesting
the movie is funny and cute not a bash of romance but full of optimism and actually clever
teenagers swoon over twilight you should watch this
its an interesting retake on the classic romeo and juliette
did anyone notice the similarity
rromeo juliejuliet
two enemy clans
humans n the zombies
nice one though
the fight in the end was good
rs inner voice is the most funniest thing in the movie
great innovation
loved the movie
a must watch its an interesting retake on the classic romeo and juliette
did anyone notice the similarity
rromeo juliejuliet
two enemy clans
humans n the zombies
nice one though
the fight in the end was good
rs inner voice is the most funniest thing in the movie
great innovation
loved the movie
a must watch
i felt that this movie was a great movie it had parts that didnt make sense to us as people who know what a zombie is or does
as you watch it you slowly your mind starts to accept whats going on and you find yourself encouraging r silently
you want him to succeed
i found myself in certain points nodding my head in approval of the things that were going on and hoping for a full change willing him to not relapse into zombie mode
this isnt the walking dead
know that before you go and see it
walk in with an open mind and you wont be disappointed
to the cast of this movie
great job
bravo
i love this movie and i will be buying this movie when it hits stores
i am surprised at the people on here saying they wanted to walk out of the theatre part way through the movie
i dont know maybe some folks are so used to having someone else do their thinking for them theyve forgotten how to and this movie does require you to think a little
the basic premise of the movie was pretty clear in the trailers so it wasnt to hard to work out what the movie was about really
it makes me think of the parents who took their kids to see jurassic park years ago and then complained that it was scary ridiculous
also i agree with previous posts on here saying if you walked out part way through your comments are not valid thats like walking into a restaurant smelling the cooking food then leaving and declaring it inedible
when i first heard about this film it didnt really appeal but a friend watched it and told me how good it was so i gave it a go and im really glad i did
its such an original story a zombie love flick
whod have though it
its not even a spoof although it does have quite a few funny moments it does actually take itself quite seriously the story really draws you in and you find yourself actually caring and rooting for r zombie lead character
ive never really been a fan of nicholas hoult i guess i still picture him as that annoying little kid in about a boy but he plays this part really well and comes across as i know this sounds daft but a really adorable zombie
you can kinda compare this to twilight there are a few twilightesque moments in there terasa palmer even looks like a blonde bella but to be honest its no bad thing and if your a twilight fan you should give this a go its just as good if not more so just for its originality
i like zombie movies with some humor
this had a ton of it
best zombie movie since shawn of the dead
the entire cast was fantastic
palmer is a doll
could not keep my eyes off her
great movie over all
great new direction for the zombie genre
you should see it
you wont want to miss it
so entertaining
you will laugh
you will cry
i mean it
should not be missed
i need more lines in my review i know
but this is all i have to say
still need more lines
no more to say here
you can stop reading
just see the movie
i will have to recite something if this is not enough
o
k
four score and seven years ago
our fore fathers brought forth
not a great zombie movie
a type of unusual kind of movie you could watch it just one time
plotthe plot was not well designed
keep some zombies keep some humans make some romance
this was the whole idea of the movie
the movie was not at all scary
of course you would find the boonieszombies who have eaten their own skinlook good
it is also not good in comedy
all you get is a new subject of a zombie romancing with human
the most negative of all is every thing was going very easily and fast like a zombie entering a human territoryzombies converting into human in just one night
the cast was also ok it just only can be a time passnothing else
so i listened to acaciaash23 and was disillusioned
i wasnt taken on a journey just the airport and a plane and some halls and 2 houses
i think there wasnt a story to be told
nothing in the film stuck with me
i was disappointed cause the trailer looked good but the script was so far off from what i imagined it to be
hmm i also disliked 5050 because the girlfriend seemed unrealistic and the humour wasnt my style and i found kyle to be another stock character
so some similarities there and 5050 also did really well and spoke to the majority
i wouldnt compare this movie to the twilight series i loved every minute of that dermo
first thing to note is that i hate love movies so it seems strange i was watching this
it was because of my current dave franco movie marathon okay
so blah blah blah blah blah i watched this and dang it was good
this film actually has some positive messages for people having problems with life and stuff as by the end of the film r changes back into a human and stays with julie
the comedy tone balanced with zombies action and romance was also very well done by jonathan levine the director
its still sweet enough to be a love movie scary enough to be a zombie movie hilarious enough to be a comedy and exciting enough to be an action flicklike film xd
to be honest i wasnt expecting much from this film given how the storyline read on the cover i didnt really believe it would be my my kind of thing but being a fan of zombie movies in general i thought i would give it a go
it turned out to be a great movie a great watch and very enjoyable from start to finish not what i expected from zombie but still great
it was very funny in places with an odd and very dark humour also scary and quite jumpy from time to time and it has to be said the strangest storyline ever
i love the way it gave an alternative view on zombies giving them personalty
the character r was played extremely well by nicholas hoult you just love him from the start and root for him until the end brain munching and all
highly recommended and a must see
let me just say that i typically dont like zomcoms for the simple reason that most of them just arent that funny
additionally the idea of a romance between a person and a zombie fills me with revulsion
having said that i fully expected to be bored to tears or completely disgusted with this particular film
i was pleasantly surprised
essentially r nicholas hoult is a zombie who ambles alongday in and day outadoing what zombies typically do
then one day he and a number of other zombies stumble upon a group of humans and while he is chowing down on one happens to see a beautiful woman named julie teresa palmer who is surrounded and totally vulnerable
this strikes a strange impulse in his brain to protect her and lead her to a safe location
what follows is a story that is both funny and cute without getting too morbid or syrupy
be that as it may judging from some of the other reviews my opinion is not shared by everybody
to each his own
in any case i didnt think this film was too bad and i rate it as slightly above average
i got interested in watching this movie because of the accidental trailer playing after i watched another movie trailer
the trailer was funnily inviting i was gonna watched hurt locker but then i decided to try this instead
it was interesting very different from other zombie movies
first few minutes was interesting its funny or rather tragic to be hearing zombies thoughts
i have to admit the first half hour after the first ten minutes of the movie was kinda slow paced and i was starting to dozed off but i was so curious with the ending of the movie so i kept watching
a very refreshing break from the gory zombies on the walking dead
going to recommend this to friends for sure
after watching this movie i was keen to log on to imdb to write up my review but now that i have seen so many reviews on here that basically cover most of what i wanted to say ill try and keep it brief
my expectation was not high as i dont particularly like the lead actor nicholas hoult however a wry smile appeared on my face within a moment or two of the movie starting
zombie movies are ten a penny and we all pretty much know what to expect
this is a little off the beaten track and it doesnt take very long to work out its direction however i found that this didnt distract me from the movie and settled in nicely to see how it would progress
no spoilers here but suffice to say movies are all about entertainment and this one entertained me thoroughly
i enjoyed this immensely while some of the special effects could have been better the direction was thoughtful and visuals not overly dark
for an offbeat zombie this is a watcher even if you dont wish to own it
miss is and miss out
when i first heard about this film my immediate thoughts were oh no not another zombieapocalypse film
and my god theres not even a real hollywoodstar attached to this film
how will this ever work
when i heard it would be a love story i became even more skeptical
so naturally i had very low expectations of this film
it was however quite funny and genuinely entertaining to me
this doesnt make it a good movie
it is filled with clichas and does feel a little predictable especially towards the ending
there are a few references to different films or stories notably one to romeo and juliet
this is the kind of movie that will not win any prices nor does it deserve any but that is excellent to fill an empty afternoon or evening
this is for a large part due to its rather creative premise a zombie lovestory
all the other things in the movie were on par but none clearly excelled
lesson learned zombielove stories can work
okay
just finished warm bodies
it wasnt until the balcony scene that we really put it together
and even all the scenes before actually got way better in our minds immediately
so julie juliet r romeo and his best friend m mercutio
we get it
that actually made it better because at first we werent lovin it
but now i can give it at least 3 stars and even 4 for that connection and the performances of all did i mention john malkovich
so a good solid 4 for netflix and 7 or 8 on imdb
too much time on my hands
well yes but so what
and the soundtrack rocked 80s  cory hart gnr roy orbison bob dylan and some indie stuff
just watch it already
funny i was going to watch cloud atlas as a transformational movie and then watch this as entertainment
i decided to go straight to the entertainment and i think it had a great and healing message and i had fun too
i love seeing nick hoult
he did a great job
even john malkovich seemed normalish
its a romance so it is a movie about love and unconditional love and going for it with your heart even when you dont one
i liked that the cg stuff wasnt overdone so the movie had an organic feel
this added to the realism in the movie
so many movies now days dont integrate their cg well and it ends up looking cartoon like where it should not
all in all a very enjoyable movie
i really liked this one
in most zombie movies the zombies are bad and a representation of evil and have to be cured by some magical potion
here zombies are represented in the beginning as bad but then they start to change by themselves with their will which is what struck me
it is a movie that shows that change must come from the inside and that it is always possible
and also that the strongest changing force is love
the movies love story is beautiful because it is not pushed unrealistic and badly paced
at the end it makes sense that she loves him
the theme of the movie is not shoved in your face
julies dad was what i thought the movie would fail with
i expected him to be stuck up unwilling to accept to the degree of being ridiculous but he wasnt
it was a pleasant surprise as him not understanding went only so far and it didnt ruin the movie
i was touched by rs willing to change
great music perfect pacing of the story
at times it is a little predictable but in a good manner because what you expect to happen must happen
overall a very good movie
you know what
this isnt an academy award winner but neither is it disappointing
its just rather nice and quite fun
and when you see the leads
any decent film watcher will tell you this couple are future stars
they are lovely in something so silly yet so rather sweetly entertaining that i wouldnt dare bother a criticism
i raise a glass to two future stars
two very warm and enjoyable bodies indeed
you dont need the academy or the split up into cinematography script plot etc etc etc for this one
just enjoy it and shut up
its like watching future potential academy awards in their infancy
this pair have it
and good luck to them
when i first heard the premise of warm bodies i thought that it could be a serious flop
however i was pleasantly surprised to find that my initial thoughts were completely wrong
this film has a refreshing plot that is really quite different than anything else i have seen
not only is it quirky and extremely funny it places but it also carries a great message of openmindedness and acceptance
it has a romantic storyline that keeps the viewer rooting for the two lead roles the entire movie who both happen to have great chemistry together
they keep the romance quite lively hardy har har
strange as it feels at first you find yourself hoping the zombie gets his girl
i found warm bodies to be very entertaining and quite charming
i didnt have high hopes
its not that it wasnt an interesting concept in the premise but its the low budget please dont let this be twilight aspect of it
i was surprised at the amount of heart the film had
my first problem with the film is that it had a lot of plot holes
meaning unanswered and inexplainable gaps in logical storytelling
however because of the dark comedy mix genre i didnt take this to heart
the film is free minded and is more about personal interactions and gestures than dialogue or plot
although its mostly about the humor it does take itself a bit seriously at times which works sometimes but not every time in execution
it took me until the balcony scene to realize what r stands for so i guess i wasnt looking too hard before hand
my main concern was trying to grasp what the difference between the bonies and the corpses were
we never really get a detailed answer and that hurt the film for me
even though i liked it overall i totally can see how someone would outright hate it
nicolas hoult did a good job hope to see him in more projects
whats wrong with me
i just want to connect why cant i connect with people
oh right
its because im dead
r hoult is a zombie a very depressed zombie looking for meaning in his life
after him and a group out looking for food find a pack of young adults they begin to feast
when r eats someone he sees his memories then changes his mind and saves his girlfriend julie palmer
the two begin a relationship that may change the world forever
this is a very funny movie that just seemed to run out of steam a little over halfway through
the movie is very much worth watching and actually turns out very sweet if not a little too perfect
the only real problem is that after awhile i started to lose interest a little and seemed to really drag toward the end
i still recommend this movie but its not as good as zombieland or shaun of the dead
overall very funny movie but just couldnt maintain the beginning excitement the entire way
i give it a b
on the face of it warm bodies is a very interesting film one part zombieaction movie one part comedyromance and one part whimsical science fiction
in practice it isnt quite as interesting as it sounds because each of three elements is actually quite generic even though theyre cleverly interspersed
overall the film has a nice mood although veering heavily towards the sentimental supported by the kind of folkie soundtrack that seems to be derigour in a certain sort of movie in spite of the genrebending think garden state and you wont be too far out
and if it seems strange to summarise a zombie flick as pleasant viewing in this case its correct call
now im not usually that type of person who likes watching a lot of horror based films
but this film has definitely outdone itself in my opinion
the plot was brilliant and not as clicha as i thought it would be
i actually stumbled upon this movie as my friend suggested it for me after i had just watched 10 things i hate about you
it was so outstanding and the actors mostly r and julie have done an amazing job portraying their characters
was teary in some parts when this film wasnt all that sad so you know that i was really into it definitely recommend this movie to anyone whos looking to a nice approximately 2hr good horror film mind you it isnt as scary the only things that look the scariest are the bonies to be honest
dozens of movies amp tv shows have been made on zombies where every movie has one single agenda that is survival of the humans
warm bodies  however follows a zombies survival and exhume
both lead actors have justified their respective roles however at times i was imagining kristen stewart playing the role of teresa palmer no offense to fan girls but they both act very same
from the plot line this may seem like a zombie version of twilight but as it turned out to be it not and boy am i glad to say that
i just hope jonathan levine feels the same way and not planning a sequel or something because that would suck and ruin a perfect ending
camera work is average but direction and story telling is good  all in all a good flick to watch at night even with your girlfriend
i decided to watch this one weekend afternoon because its received decent reviews and was recommended to me by a coworker
i was very disappointed
if it wasnt for the last portion of the movie i would have given it a 310 but the ending somewhat redeemed it
however the fact remains that the first 34 was very boring and cheesy
it felt like they were trying too hard to create something different and funny
what resulted was not what i had hoped for
there was so much error in logic what logic there can be in a zombie type movie
it just didnt make any sort of sense
throughout the movie i kept hoping for it to improve increase suspense or at least keep me interested
unfortunately it did not
i would classify this as a b level horror film meets chick flick
not something i would recommended unless your only other option is watching something tyler perry created
may contain spoilers when i went to the cinema with my friends i kept thinking about how many other things i could be doing at that time instead of going to that ridiculous movie
when the movie started i was thinking brilliant how long is this movie again
but as the movie progressed and i got familiar with the story line i began to enjoy it
i was really impressed with what they had done
i loved how it was shakespeare related especially the part when r goes to julies balconyromeo and juliet r and julie
this is a great romance film for couples and a great suspenseful horror movie for friends
if you are one of those people thinking this movie is lame and not worth your time i would greatly suggest giving this movie a chance
i have heard that the book is much darker and gruesome so i am going to have to find that book
anyway great movie great cast just a brilliant movie
