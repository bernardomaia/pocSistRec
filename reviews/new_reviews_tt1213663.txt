i thought this movie was mediocre at best
i laughed out loud a few timesas did the rest of the audience but other than that i found it boring and actually nodded off twice
one of the girls sitting in front of me stated well it wasnt a bad movie but it wasnt that good either which i thought summed it up pretty well
the biggest shock was that it had a 7
9 imdb rating which normally indicates a potentially great movie in any categoryespecially a comedy
anything above a 7 tends to consistently be what i consider a good movie
i give it a 5
5 or maybe 6
there were several other movies in the same theater with lower imdb ratings that in retrospect i wished i had spent my time and money on
i kept waiting for it to be funny
what you get is st
elmos fire with robots 4 grown up friends and 1 stuck in the past and the end of the world as we know it
except not entirely
as a buddy movie it barely connects
as science fiction its not imaginative
it wasnt a complete loss though
because i saw it at cinemark and i had purchased the refillable cups and popcorn tubs earlier this year the wife and i got two large drinks and two med popcorns for a total of 6
sadly that was the highlight of the film
just as i waited for the butler to even remotely connected to reality for two guns to be anything other that an insulting caricature of texans and gangster squad to be anything other than gun play i waited in vain for the worlds end to get really funny
it didnt even get more than slightly humorous
the cornetto series continues with nothing short of what youd expect from wright pegg and frost
delivering top laughs with great action and a little bit of romance to suit all audiences
the films visual style is quite appealing
the only downside to this film some may see is that the gore is not traditional being robots
the style of violence in shaun of the dead and hot fuzz shine through with just a bit of a blue tint
the characters are just plain lovable and hilarious in their own ways
most of the laughs in this film came straight from dialogue of characters rather than visuals
all in all i thoroughly enjoyed this film a fun comedy with nothing to pick on whatsoever a top film just like the others
i had great expectations of this film however it was mediocre at best and like several other reviews it did not live up to the hype
7
4 usually means a good movie to be had
unfortunately not in this case dont get me wrong i laughed on several occasions but nowhere near enough to warrant it up there with the best of the comedies
basically storyline started off introducing the characters and the film looked promising and the chance to relive the youth for one night with a 12 pub pub crawl
after the initial meet up with the blanks it just got daft and lost the plot a bit with fewer laughs as the film went on
not the gangs finest hour but i suppose they cant make top films every time and lets be honest it wasnt in the same league as hot fuzz
is the coke they serve in the writers rooms in the uk just boric acid and baby powder
or what
are the winters that long and grey
in what damp bog did anyone think to try and make this empty wad of mud and sticks attempt to stand and walk on its own
bleeecccchhh
from a hyper scattershot beginning of gratuitous sonnyboy backstory it quickly builds to
the same joke over and over and over until
out of left field it becomes
oh
wow
i suppose you could call it a reach but its more like the opposite
flat one liners obvious setups and sooo much filler and fight scenes with things with no face and
omg what a stitch mismatched body parts and moving awkwardly
on top of that they even made a straight face attempt at a sequel or something at the end what was that
gary and the four blanks out for action
i just dont understand how crap like this gets made
british films and i am using here a purely british term films instead of more common to my ears word movies are a weird flock
strange breed
when youre watching a contemporary british film like hot fuzz or shaun of the dead or this one you will most certainly expect all the usual things they love to add to their works in greater quantity  profanities galore crazy tempo terrible and very quick change of genre from horror to comedy to thriller to drama and back again
and what is on top of it all nothing is being taken seriously or deep
this film is funny actors are good paddy martin simon and pierce all do good job but then almost 2 hours of this film render more we can chew or swallow
then after some time the film gets on nerves and starts getting very noisy tiring and draggy
googoo and ploddy too
then you only wish it were over as soon as possible
honestly i found the film amusing and some jokes cool that is why i gave it 5 and then i did not get the main point of the work and will surely never come back to watch it at all times
if your idea of a good film is to take a potentially good idea add a cast with zero chemistry a throughly unfunny and annoying lead character and a terrible script then this might be the one for you
the opening few minutes are both humorous and engaging but unfortunately thats about it
soon the film starts to happen and the only thing the viewer can do is try to work out how it manages to be so bad
i know humour is subjective but in comedic terms this was like watching an emu trying to fly
unfortunately if you are paying to watch this you might not be so philosophical
the main reason the film refuses to be funny is that it seems like the cast bar pegg play their roles in a pretty straight way which really doesnt do anything for the greater comedic good
i have absolutely no idea how this horrendous movie got such high rating both from imdb and rotten tomatoes
the only thing good about the movie was the epilogue because i knew the movie had almost ended
the movie is totally senseless the plot is totally meaningless
believe me there are a lot better movies out there
dont think that i only like those boring movies with good plot
i like entertaining movies in general
this movie was so bad that i felt responsible to veer other people from watching it yes this is the first time i have reviewed a bad movie
if you want to watch something new and light try watching the hot tub time machine or we are the millers or horrible bosses or the interview or zombieland or shawn of the dead or ted
honestly anything would be better than this movie
it wasnt hilarious nor was it probing and overly imaginative
it was fun and entertaining and thats exactly what i expected out of it
it became a little too overthetop and almost huh
what
when trying to explain itself in the last fifteen minutes but even that wasnt enough to dampen the spirit of the overall experience
i was happy with the movie and recommend it especially if youre going to see it with a group of friends a trust me a there are dozens of scenes you and your friends will absolutely relate to and start elbowing each other over
good enough for anyone in their late teens and older
teens will have something to look forward to a and those of us past our thirties will get embarrassed reliving the same stunts we used to pull or associating with friends just like some of those guys
if you seen the other two movies in the socalled cornetto trilogy shaun of the dead amp hot fuzz then you already know what to expect from the worlds end
like the others it is funny and full of unexpected and crazy twists and turns
the story follows five friends who decide to reunite and finish the pub crawl they were not able to complete 20 years ago
everything is going fine and then all hell breaks loose
you know youre probably in for a wild and fun ride and that is exactly what you get
simon pegg and nick frost kind of switch roles from their previous movies frost is the one that has it together and pegg doesnt
it works well and they still maintain their great humor and wit
the supporting cast is equally funny with eddie marsan being a highlight
the movie if full of great one liners and some absolutely hilarious moment
if you liked shaun of the dead and hot fuzz or if you just like wild and fun movies then youll like the worlds end
it is funny clever and a hell of a ride
it is hard to believe that the same minds who wrote such clever stories as spaced and shawn of the dead could also write the worlds end
it was so slow and boring
and there was hardly any wittiness about it
instead of fun perceptive vocabulary we are bombarded with one mundane foul word after another actually is mostly the same one over and over
really
simon pegg and company are so smart why do they lean more and more to the mainstream banal crudeness
theyre better than that
we know they are
weve seen it
weve heard it
and the storyline this time was very very flat and moved at a snails pace
usually they have characters that we care about and back stories that add flavor and the action clicks along
the worlds end came out flat flat flat
maybe simon is slowly being taken over movie by movie by robots
though the movie does start out a bit slowly it is never boring
simon pegg plays his typical washed out loser on a quest to reunite the old gang from high school and relive the best night of his life the golden mile which is a pub crawl through twelve pubs in his sleepy town
when they get there they discover their town has been taken over by robots filled with blue junk and their new quest is to survive the night in order to leave in the morning
the chemistry between the actors is pitch perfect and though the movie could run this risk of becoming brainless and the characters flat their personal traumas and sometimes very deep flaws keep them grounded in reality
the ending though perhaps not expected was amazing
if you already like nick frost and simon pegg this is a definite mustsee but even if you arent a huge fan or havent even heard of them this movie is worth a shot
i loved shaun of the dead enjoyed hot fuzz and went to the cinema expecting something good from these collaborators
but the film turned out to be such a buzz kill
the film does not live up to its hype or its cast with many of the characters feeling onedimensional and underdeveloped which is such a shame as the actors are some of my favourites and very talented
i could deal with the unlikely plot but the ending was just stupid and rushed
the jokes were forced and only one man laughed once through the entire film
all my friends and i left the cinema deflated
the one positive i would say is that the special effects were good
apart from that i was bitterly let down
the worlds end is one of the funniest wittiest and just all out actionpacked movie
every character grows on you more and more as they are very relatable and very deep
the humor in it is incredibly well written as it is quickwitted hilarious and most importantly used at the right time
the action in this movie is very comedic but it doesnt mean it cant have some awesome super violent fight scenes
to me this is the perfect balance a great comedy that has some depth and when things go down things will go down
overall i believe this movie isnt for everyone as it is a very different type of comedy however if you do enjoy the other blood and ice cream movies shaun of the dead and hot fuzz you will have a ton of fun with this movie
as a huge simon pegg and nick frost fan this film is honestly my favourite movie they have been in so far
the movie is great and i was non stop laughing all the way through
the movie is cheeky which for me makes it appeal more
if youre a big simon and nick fan like myself you would very much enjoy this movie
the ending was brilliant made me laugh the most
its a proper mans movie but still enjoyable for anyone
its really great to see nick frost play a more serious character for most of the film
its film i can watch over and over again and not get bored
as a more of a horror movie fanatic you seriously cannot beat a bit of simon pegg and nick frost
from the guys that brought you shaun of the dead and hot fuzz comes the worlds end
five friends reunite to recreate the epic pub crawl they attempted as teenagers but they soon realize that newton haven has been taken over by robots full of blue stuff and mayhem fence jumping and hilarity ensues
i havent laughed this hard in a long time this is literally the funniest movie ive ever seen in my whole life the laughs never stop they just keep on coming simon pegg and nick frost are always hysterical together and they always have a blast lol i highly recommend this to fans of british humor and simon pegg and nick frost youll have a blast watching and youll laugh your ass off the entire time edgar wright has such a great sense of humor lol
im a big fan of pegg and frost but this film seems to be treading old ground
there is no real chemistry between the five friends it all feels a bit constipated
pegg fails to deliver as the swashbuckling failure hes always better as the anti hero
you get the feeling there wont be any surprises and there arent any
the introduction of the robots lacked wow factor and just added a cheap zombie element
the confrontation with the alien entity at the end was a piece incredible naffness
of all the characters nick frost comes out on top he lifts this film from being poor to something just about reasonable
i had high hopes for this film and save for one or two genuinely funny moments it was a bit of a letdown
youd be advised to wait for the dvd release its not worth investing in the bluray version
i must confess with personal affection towards british comedians in hollywood movies
in my opinion simon pegg who broke into mainstream long ago nick frost his partner in crime and the newest hobbit  martin freeman are simply incredible i love seeing all of them wherever they act so i was looking forward for this one
and got a bit disappointed
there are some funny monologues but the roles were a bit off  especially simons
i just cant really receive him as a funnycool leader of the gang that is locked on his own mission so that felt a bit wrong
another thing is the plot  could have been better
the ending simply isnt good enough
in conclusion worth to watch if you really have nothing else to do
the final film in the three flavours cornetto trilogy is the most mature and maybe even the best
hot fuzz is still the funniest shaun of the dead is still the most original but i think the worlds end may be my favorite
this movie which is about a simple pub crawl has a very epic scale
by the end of this film it has switched from being a wacky comedy into being a scifi action thriller though it still provides plenty of laughs
the storys structure is very similar to shaun of the deads which starts slowly but gradually builds until the massive climax
this is by far the funniest film of this year and my personal favorite
its a great wrapup to what is now my favorite movie trilogy of all time
go see it
those hoping for another shaun of the dead will be disappointed but this one fares much better than hot fuzz
not to say any of them are bad at all
this one centers on a group of friends reuniting to do a legnday pub crawl they couldnt accomplish in their younger years
but upon returning they discover the town has been overrun with alien robots
many laughs ensue as well as touching on thoughtful emotionally resonant themes like friendship growing up and discovering ourselves
it really is a mostly great film almost perfectly engaging until a strange drawn out secondary finale unfitting the material and its direction
still its a solid flick that boasts more laughs than most of the films this year
the second best comedy of the year behund this is the end
55
the worlds end
is not the best of edgar wrights cornetto trilogy i just thought id get that out of the way
however just like shaun of the dead and hot fuzz it does have an undeniable charm to it and its also known for blending two genres quite well together
the cast includes the usual suspects nick frost and simon pegg as well as comedy greats like martin freeman eddie marsan and strangely enough paddy considine and everyones favorite gone girl rosamund pike
the story is basically a pub crawl that eventually leads into
an alien invasion
now this is what i dont like about the worlds end
whereas zombies and wicker manthe village style stories arent something you see that often today but aliens have been done to death every decade over
also its got to be said the ending is far too bleak for my liking but the worlds end does maintain the level of originality and well placed humour that edgar wright is known for
think of village of the damned and the stepford wives and this is what you get but this movie has great comedy lines funny
simon pegg does a wonderful job as does the rest of the cast but he stands out in my opinion
good storyline and scenario
i enjoyed the hell out of shaun of the dead that is a classic
watch this movie closely there are quotes and scenes to snicker at
love it
and this requirement of 10 lines is crazy
so i will fulfill the rules
watch this movie and enjoy and again a combination of stepford wives and village
i think i met the 10 line rule
let me try again
good funny movie
this should be ten lines
post it
75 released nearly 10 years after the instant classic shaun of the dead the trio wright pegg and frost show no sign of losing their way with this very enjoyable funny imaginative comedy hit
this is perhaps as strong as their break out movie although i dont think it comes close to being a better funnier film
the characters are finely crafted and well observed with plenty of heart in there along side the sharp writing and strong comic performances
but on a down side the ending just isnt as good as the rest of the film as it just goes a little too far within in its already stretched reality
they clearly have a lot more money to play with now than they did before and i just hope that the big money factor does not get in the way of good comedy in their next film together
100 bottles of beer take one down and pass it around and there will be 99 bottles of beer on the wall
if i continued with the remaining 99 verses of this famous english drinking song this comment might become slightly more repetitious than the latest from shaun of the dead namely the worlds end
if you already have seen both the trailer for this flick and the feature itself you honestly should ask yourself what did you gain by paying to view the entire movie after watching the trailer for free
what did cowriter simon pegg really have in mindstand by me meets stepford wives
as funny as it may be to see one person revealed as an automaton as in say alien does the joke really improve when the whole town except for three is in on it
the primary teehee behind the worlds end seems to be that english people spend their evening hours so snookered that apes could take over the planet and it would take them weeks to notice if ever
well if your british empire had shrunk down of half an island not unlike haiti you might drink too
this movie is terrible
i wasted my time watching it
from the beginning it seemed pointless
a loser gathering back his old friends in order to participate in a beer marathon
afterwards it becomes much worse  with aliens taking over the place and transforming humans into robots and dispose the human bodies
i do not know if there was even one funny joke in the movie
if it served its purpose as a black comedy lets say
i truly want to say how awful it was
of course i have watched even worse movies in my life
but this is not the point
the whole thing was not watchable boring not funny bad scenario bad acting and overall it was weird to watch
the main actor was terrible too
if he was not so antipathetic  maybe the whole film would be a lot easier to watch
not the funniest of the cornetto trilogy but possibly the best
this one is so brilliantly written that i am very very impressed
gary king simon pegg is a middle aged man who refuses to grow up the only thing for him is the next drink he wants to be free to do what he wants any old time
he urges his friends for a one final pub crawl a pub crawl of twelve pubs that ends at the one called the worlds end
the analogy between an alcoholic and mankind is a brilliant one
gary king cannot stop drinking even though he knows it will lead him to his destruction
the robots are actually aliens from other worlds trying to save this one but gary and the boys know better they just want to keep the party going
its nice to finally see a movie whith such strong message and such powerful imagery
it addresses some of the most fatal issues of the world today we know we are going the wrong way but somehow we just keep on going
not even aliens from outer space can stop us
the blood and ice cream trilogy the worlds end was what i had less expectations  more ended up being my favorite of the trilogy  the film is very good even with a very slow start  the film too surprises when the 5 friends finds out why people so acting strangely  the film turns and is very good the special effects are good  the cast is excellent  the actors have excellent chemistry simon pegg  nick frost  martin freeman  paddy considine  eddie marsan rosamund pink  pierce brosnan  all excellent  about the last 30 minutes are great  you discover all have revelations  not wait a plot twist do not come to this the film is also funny more is not the comedy to die of laughter  and the script is very good the worlds end is the best of the trilogy blood and ice cream is great fun and has a great chemistry of the actors

if you liked shaun of the dead and hot fuzz this will definitely be one for you
a good fun comedy mix in some action and a few twists and turns and it had me laughing throughout
i would definitely recommend this film to someone looking for an easy to watch comedy
pegg is constantly delivering witty one liners and the supporting cast play their roles excellently
frost taking a slightly different role to his usual dufus sidekick in sotd and hf but playing it expertly
i watched this film
as per pegg and co have managed to create another funny and exciting dramatic comedy that keeps you wanting more
looking forward to another film from this cast
hilariously mixing two unassumingly fitting ingredients a pub crawl and an apocalyptic alien overthrow
brilliantly directed adding the same momentary shots as previously seen in shaun of the dead and hot fuzz
although simon pegg and nick frost switch roles in the worlds end their characters being the opposite the previous films in this trilogy where simon pegg is the somewhat more sensible nick frost the lesser of this characteristic the roles are played perfectly
the fact that for more than half of this film the main protagonists are heavily intoxicated therefore being incapable of noting the almost blatantly obvious facts that are in need of being explained multiple times contrary to many others views is not tedious or even boring but quite the opposite
one star was dropped in my rating for the lack of acting prowess not equaling simon pegg and nick frost from the other main characters
this aspect of the film was rather disappointing
but aside from that this film the last in the cornetto trilogy was a great way to conclude this franchise
the worlds end gets off to a slow start so slow in fact that i mistook it for a pubcrawl comedy instead of what it turned out to be
the bathroom brawl caught me by surprise
it reminded me of the overthetop barroom brawl in from dusk to dawn it comes out of nowhere after a carefully crafted first half that promises more than the second half delivers
once any notion of subtlety is abandoned the movie devolves into routine unfunny action and special effects sequences that only serve to undermine the setup
its dr
who by way of invasion of the body snatchers with a bit of pink floyds high hopes thrown in for good measure
i must admit that i loved the ending after listening to peggs drunken ramblings the alien leader gives up on any notion of helping the human race with the classic f it
the ending made the whole thing worth it
personally i never had any expectations while going into the movie
it has the same old back drop of aliens dropping and invading the earth and same stuff
but to be honest what makes it different is simon pegthe guy carries the entire movie on his shoulder as an arrogant aka spout kid who refuses not to grow up
so if you love watching himwhich i do
then go for this one
besides it does not have anything new to offer in this one
i mean we have seen better movies than this one
if you totally free this weekend then i may say go and grab a popcorn and watch this one
only for simon fans
or else just try sating away from it
the worlds end doesnt measure up to the first two particularly in its writing
while i was entertained by it throughout it rarely gave me proper laughs
simon pegg as gary king the middleaged man who still thinks hes a teenager was often especially in the early parts of the movie a bit more annoying than funny with his teenage antics
while the rest of the more grown up crew often came out as dull once again especially early on in the movie
also the level of drunkenness on the characters seemed pretty inconsistent
it looked like they jumped from drunk back to sober and drunk again in a few minutes
nevertheless i found the worlds end to be a satisfying conclusion with just enough for me to enjoy it
whats a bit sad though is how the best parts of this movie are probably the fight scenes
great cast  very indulgent and mr pegg is lucky to get finance for such average stuff
buy dusk til dawn it kicks its ass
i found myself writing this review while watching the film which says it all
simon please do something original
soundtrack may actually be the best part
kinda feel i wasted 4 quid on virgin

i am a big fan of both shaun of the dead and hot fuzz and was hoping for something similar
sadly this wasnt a patch on those comedy classics and despite a few moments was a real disappointment
while shaun and hot were parodies of genre classics this didnt have anything to pivot off and as a result felt aimless
sure there were hints of invasion of the body snatchers or even the stepford wives but not enough to impact the narrative
i guess this makes the film more original  and i didnt think this was a bad film  but it just wasnt as good as its brother films and consequently was a missed opportunity
simon pegg nick frost and edgar wright completed the three flavors cornetto trilogy with the worlds end featuring pegg as a boorish man who gathers some college buddies to do a pub crawl that they hadnt completed earlier
only to discover that they might be humanitys best hope for survival
i had never heard of pegg frost and wright before shaun of the dead came out but theyve proved to be a very capable team every step of the way
my favorite of their collaborations is paul which is actually not part of the cornetto trilogy
nonetheless this movie is a really fun one
its all about living ones life to the fullest with a lot of surprises
the end subtly looks at the risk of excessive reliance on technology
but mostly its an excuse to party
youre sure to love it
in a way this movie is quite different to the other two that comprise the cornetto trilogy
in another its the same ol edgar wright we know and love
the worlds end is not your average dumb comedy although for the untrained eye it may look so
twe is wright at his best combining his mastership of vfx and choreography his thorough knowledge of the source material which he doesnt shy to throw over your face over and over again and the great writing partnership that he has achieved with simon pegg way for over a decade
this comingofagescifisocial satire mashup comedy may not appeal to everyoneit may even make some wright fans raise an eyebrow but if you allow yourself to digest all the things that this movie accomplishes you will not only acknowledge this film as a worthy member of the blood amp ice cream trilogy but youll witness the birth of a cult comedy for the years to come
having said that hot fuzz is still my favorite
i watched the film as some friends asked me to join them they recommended it as a film similar to shaun of the dead which i liked
but afterwards i would say it was a big disappointment
the beginning introducing you to the characters was ok
in the middle part the story was told quite quick  and there the film could have ended for me
the rest was kind of boring
the end was a bit surprising but in no way exciting
i even do not know as what i would describe the genre
i would say a tiny bit of action some way trash very low level sci fi not to take serious in any way but also not to laugh about a lot a bit funny but not enough to call it a comedy
i recommend you to spend the money for another film or bread which would maybe give you more enjoyment
so if you enjoy long running humor and drunk britains your gonna love this movie it is really different and i have read some bad reviews on this movie but to really understand and appreciate the humor u have to pay attention and know how to listen for running jokes great film and my personal rating witch i give for all my movies is 7
910
0 good film for anyone to enjoy and another great production by simon pegg and edgar wright im kneo and this is my first review of many more to come so keep an eye out for real and precise ratings from a man whos read over 1000 books and seen probably even more movies so until next time
this is kneo saying i am the one
the worlds end 2013  simon pegg nick frost martin freeman paddy considine eddie marsan rosamund pike pierce brosnan
epic laughs ensue in this funny and fastpaced comedy about five childhood friends reunited to relive their youth by another attempt at a pub crawl to end all pub crawls literally when they discover their sleepy old hometown is being taken over by supernatural beings
the comedy team of pegg and frost with their collaborator edgar wright continue their unofficial trilogy with great fun and spirits of all types in this frenetic mix of comedy and scifi
belly up to the bar for belly laughs
i am a huge fan of the previous films shaun of the dead and hot fuzz however there seemed to be something missing from this movie
like its predecessors this movie circles around humor and camaraderie but the story feels really lackluster for some reason
maybe its the random gory stuff that you dont generally see in comedies thats missing which was in the previous films or nick frost and simon pegg swapping roles nick generally plays the jackass simon plays serious guy
the role swap really changed the vibe of what i was expecting from this movie but it still worked out
this is definitely my least favorite in the trilogy but its still worth a watch if your a fan of the previous films
i have to admit if the final third of the films comes into its own then im the fool for turning off before then
a cast riddled with stars and funnymen alike comes across as several actor friends producing a script during a night on the booze and just not rereading it the following morning
martin freeman shame on you for going through with it
the hot fuzz element of the film catches the imagination of the viewer until the film just does not improve
surely actors of this fame cant just be cashing in on the publics allegiance to the cast
bizarrely rubbish and not at all rubbish in a funny way
makes dawn of the dead look like a blockbuster
we all know that hollywood has some standard movies so here is another one
this one is funny but not enough forced sooooo too much as sf
sorry but id skip another like this one next time
the characters are weak the story is even more weak nothing new under the movies scene
everything was just easy to be foreseen
what a waste of time
not to say about the low quality of the special effects
anyhow i consider astonishing the difference between the imdb rate and the quality of the movie  id say its at least embarrassing
my advice is not wasting your time with it because is childish useless as points of view and for sure
so much overrated
simon pegg is obviously a talented writerdirector and there are some excellent foundations and many people around his age will empathize with many of the themes in this film
buried underneath the hollywood production style is a funny film
i am not quite sure whether edgar wright is to blame for the ridiculousness that the film descends into but unless you are a fan of constant and ludicrous fighting scenes and vacuous characterizations you will quickly get increasingly bored by this film
the special affects offer a colorful lighting display and i guess the plot offers some intrigue
however with such great actors looking totally disgusted by their scripts you must conclude that the simon pegg ego show just dominated everything from inception onward and the other actors just gritted their teeth and thought of the money to get them through it before returning to their proper acting careers
nobody will watch this film twice
this was by far the worst movie ever created in the history of human kind
seeing a 7
1 score on imdb made me think that the movie would be enjoyable but oh my god i was so wrong
it cannot be unseen
after seeing this movie i think that i have lost my ability to rate a movie because everything will seem good when i compare it to this
now i need 10 lines of text
i dont want to write 10 lines about this
i just want to forget
please
now something to fill the 10 lines
the idea of the movie is bad the action is bad there is 0 comedy in the movie
40 million dollars to create this movie is just like setting it on fire
why would you do that
better donate to charity
10 lines
cmon
there i did it
thanks
i was looking forward to a 4 film
it was advertised as such in our tv guide
generally that means it should be pretty good and others thought so too
unfortunately not the case for this one it was absolute rubbish
the initial idea was good enough and im sure a great story could have been made from it but was then ruined with the appearance of so called aliens trying to take over like so many have in the past
a complete waste of the talented cast in my opinion
im sure the good review came off the back of the film paul
i really enjoyed that film and it was a laugh out loud job
not this though by a long shot i kid you not
give it a miss
