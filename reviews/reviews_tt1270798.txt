"\nXmen: First Class is simply fantastic. Strong emotion and explosive\naction. The acting is top notch. Delivery from every actor is at it's\nbest, more so from Mystique, Beast, Xavier and Magneto. <br><br>The story is more character based than action, however the action\nsequences are still superb. Personally i'd have liked to of seen it\nbeing a 15 and have a more adult but it wasn't a big issue. Also some\nmore background story from the bad super's would have been good but\nagain this wasn't too much of an issue and would leave some nice room\nfor upcoming xmen movies. <br><br>I don't want to say too much but to break it down... Go see this film\nno matter what you are into. There is something for everyone. 9/10 easy\n"
"\nOf the original trilogy, the first X-Men movie still rates the\nbest.....until now.<br><br>This prequel is an absolute stunner - from storyboard, script, mutant\ncharacters, pace, cinematography, Foley FX, VFX....you get the picture.\nIn fact, the subtitle for this movie could also be X-Men: Origins. The\npoignant beginnings of Magneto and Mystique are recounted, as well as\nthe extraordinary powers of Professor X. Yes, indeed! The good\nprofessor had plenty of goodies (and hair) in his formative years at\nOxford University.....^^ <br><br>I cannot wait to see X-Men prequel II and III, 3D or not.\n"
"\n8.2 out of 10?...seriously? the first x men was OK...the second was\nbad...the third was a bag full of puke...wolverine origins was a\nrape....but this one is worst than any of the other x men movies.<br><br>What's wrong with this pile of garbage? 1- Professor X and Mystique are\nrelated? WTF 2-Alex Summers and not Scott? Why? Scott Summers is one of\nthe original X Men, not Alex 3-Where is Angel? I mean Warren Kenneth\nWorthington III not that little butterfly girl.<br><br>4- Where is Iceman? 5- Where is Marvel Girl? What a silly plot.\nHollywood can't make good movies anymore. They take a good source and\njust violated the fans with some stupid adaptation.<br><br>What's with the romantic relation between Beast and Mystique? Where\nthat came from? Mystique mated with Azazel and that's where\nNightcrawler comes from.<br><br>Stupid movie. I have no idea why the rating is so high.<br><br>The Wolverine cameo was kind of cool though.\n"
"\nusually I am not a fan of marvel comics, but i made an exception for\nthis one :) If you followed the comic book series, it uses similarities\nfrom the comics to the movie. And we also get a cameo appearance from\nHugh Jackman(Wolverine). I may have not noticed the infamous stan lee\nappearance that he always makes in the movies that deal with his\ncomics. But I am sure it was there. I think its a great movie for ages\n5 to adult. It has history, very mild violence, some comedy, drama, and\nromance. All the elements to live up to the X-Men franchise. It is not\nat all disappointing if you have knowledge of the other movies or the\ncomic book series. That is the only flaw I see. It is definitely a\ntribute to the fans of X-Men. Personally I am a DC comic books fan, but\nif you are a comic fan or just a fan of the movie series your in for a\ntreat :) but if you have no knowledge of either of those things you\nwill be disappointed.\n"
"\nOK so first off why make this movie after they made X Men Origins\nWolverine? Am I the only one that noticed Professor X walking towards\nthe end of X Men Origins Wolverine? At the end of this film they showed\nhim getting shot and being wheeled around in a wheel chair.<br><br>I am thoroughly disappointed with Stan Lee and his decision to make\nthis god awful film. And I am appalled at how many fans like this film.\nIf you want to support the X Men stick to the comics at least they have\nan excuse for messing up the story line by adding whole series and they\nend up being a dream or something. Like when Wolverine dies my favorite\ncomic by far. Look I cant tell you what to do but before you waste your\nmoney on this terrible film think about how upsetting I must be to\nwrite this review. I LOVE X Men but not the movies. If you are a true\nfan you will skip this film and not believe the reviews by other people\nwho are probably getting payed to write them.\n"
"\nThe Movie is simply fantastic. Strong emotion and explosive action. The\nacting is top notch. Delivery from every actor is at it's best, more so\nfrom Mystique, Beast, Xavier and Magneto. What I also like about First\nClass is that the movie takes place in the past (the sixties) and uses\nhistorical events (the Cuba crisis and the Cold War) to make its point.\nErik claims that no matter how many times mutants save the world,\nnormal people will always see them as enemies. Professor X still wants\nto believe in the good of the people. With that message the foundation\nis laid for X-Men 1-3.<br><br>Overall, this isn't a bad movie, it's a good movie! It's a fun\nBlockbuster Summer action film to enjoy with your friends. See the\nmovie!\n"
"\nX-men: First Class 88<br><br>This movie is great! I loved it even more after every time I watch it.\nStory is superb, acting and the choice of cast is perfect, music is\nawesome. Matthew Vaughan's sense of storytelling in this new chapter of\nthe X-men series is wonderful. It is a great way to introduce basically\nnew characters in a new chapter of their lives that we have never seen.\nIt has a good sense of mood, with a fun atmosphere. The overall style\nto the film is great, with good set pieces and clothing to fit in with\nthe 1960s time period. It is possible to have an X-men film without\nHugh Jackman's Wolverine for over a minute. With a good b-plot, good\nmusic, fun,smart storytelling, Vaughan's new X-men characters will be\nbeloved!\n"
"\nWell I'm a fan of X-Men - not in a fanboy way - I've read a few comics,\ngrew up watching their cartoons - so generally am quite forgiving even\nof the more mediocre x-men films. This film however for me just dropped\nthe ball. The guy playing Xavier was simply awful, not only a bad actor\nbut unpleasantly smug too - a smugness that seeped into the tone of the\nwhole film. Also the film felt strangely low budget and well... grey..\nlacking panache.<br><br>Overall I found it baffling how an X-men film could be so dreary and\nleft me wondering why the film was even made as it seemed to lack any\npassion or creativity.\n"
"\nI believe most people understand the concept of the x-men by now. If\nyou have seen the previous 3 x-men, you will definitely say this blows\nthem away completely.<br><br>I have got to say, I found the previous 3 x-men films really boring.\nThis prequel definitely has the edge and the director got it right! It\nfollows how the x-men started and who these two main characters are.<br><br>The female characters are really sexy! Really sexy! I can't believe the\ncleavage in this film. Where did they find these characters.<br><br>This is a definite watchable film.<br><br>Anyway, without boring people - please watch it! It is on the same\nwavelength of batman alike. Very nice and good film at it's best!\n"
"\n7.9 hahahahhahaha<br><br>story: sucks actors: are ,wait are they actors at all?..i am not so\nsure here special effects: embarrassing ,jesus what a joke<br><br>do not watch this movie!! you will be forever grateful.<br><br>and btw thanks a lot for manipulating the IMDb grading system.it's near\nuseless by now imho.<br><br>10 lines: OK here we ago again then: story: sucks actors: are ,wait are\nthey actors at all?..i am not so sure here special effects:\nembarrassing ,jesus what a joke o not watch this movie!! you will be\nforever grateful.<br><br>and btw thanks a lot for manipulating the IMDb grading system.it's near\nuseless by now imho.\n"
"\nWorst movie I have EVER seen! I see all these reviews saying that the\nmovie was excellent. I bet all those are from multiple accounts of the\ndirector of the movie( no idea what his name is). There is absolutely\nno way that so many people think that this movie was any good. I refuse\nto believe so many brain washed people have watched this movie! Oh my\nGod it was so bad: The action was TERRIBLE: butterfly chasing a\nscreaming ginger LOL! Full of Clichés ! TERRIBLE Awful please add score\n0/10! Wow i have to write 10 lines to complete this review. There is\nreally nothing to say about such a bad movie, so i will repeat myself.\nThere is really nothing to say about such a bad movie, so i will repeat\nmyself. There is really nothing to say about such a bad movie, so i\nwill repeat myself. There is really nothing to say about such a bad\nmovie, so i will repeat myself.\n"
"\nI've seen all the X-Men movies and I wasn't sure if I would have liked\nthis one, too. I didn't like James McAvoy that much and I feared that\nthis movie could prove a letdown. I was wrong. The movie is great, well\ndirected, CGI good to watch without being more important than the movie\nitself and - most of all - the acting was really good. McAvoy and\nFassbender were great in depicting Xavier and Erik. Their emotions look\nreal, not acted, their chemistry great. And the other characters work\nwell, too, villains and good guys. I liked also the Bondesque style of\nthe part during the 60s. Drama and humour are well mixed and they give\ndepth to a good action movie. Just a last line: Magneto is right in\ndistrusting humans.\n"
"\nI am a fan of Marvel in general and I loved all the previous X-Men\nfilms so I expected to enjoy this film anyway and had quite high\nexpectations. It did not disappoint and is in fact my favourite film of\nthe franchise. This is saying something considering the fact that\nWolverine is my favourite X-Men character -although he does feature\nwith an amusing cameo.<br><br>One of the things I loved about this film was seeing the origins of\nmany characters and seeing how relationships formed and developed. It\nwas interesting to see the contrast in this film from the main three,\nparticularly regarding Professor X and Magneto.<br><br>The fact that this film is a prequel to the main films means that\nanybody could watch it and understand the story line. I definitely\nrecommend this film to anyone and I think that those who would not\nnormally watch this genre of film may be pleasantly surprised.\n"
"\nTotally agree with the review by wally_greeneyes_dee (posted in June).\nThis movie did not stay true to any of the characters of X-Men at all,\nin any fashion.<br><br>If you go into the movie knowing anything about the X-Men and their\nrelationships going forward, nothing in this movie parallels. Professor\nXavier is not as controlled and stoic, but more of a loose cannon. None\nof the characters act in any resemblance to their comic-book persona.<br><br>The dialogue is cheesy (although we can allow for some of that, being\nbased on comic characters). It is hard to explain in detail everything\nthat is exactly off about this movie, but overall it is just wrong in\nso many ways that at the end you feel very let down.\n"
"\nWell, where to begin. Unfortunately I read the X-Men comics in the\n1960's, and this doesn't reflect the style of those stories.<br><br>Why is that Hollywood film makers, think that they can change\neverything into what they want it to be. What was so bad about the\noriginal comic stories that they have to be re-written into something\nthat changes the essence of the whole experience.<br><br>Where were the original X-Men, Cyclops, Iceman, Angel etc and do we\nreally need the relationships changing this radically. This type of\nalteration is unforgivable. Go and see Kenneth Branagh, and get him to\nmake the thing properly.<br><br>I haven't really any complaints about the acting, as everyone did a\ngood job. As a film for anyone unfamiliar with the early X-men comics I\nsuppose it could pass for a reasonable superhero film. It's just really\nsad that this chance to make an excellent origin film has now probably\ngone for good. <br><br>I won't be rushing to watch the next one. Poor job, must try harder !\n"
"\nForget everything you have seen in other prequels - this may well be\nthe film of the series (Even without Wolverine). It is certainly a\ngroup effort and it is superb.<br><br>Every scene and every actor delivers a deeply satisfying film that\nperfectly prequels and expands the X Men series.<br><br>For this reviewer, this was easily the best film of the series so far -\nthe script has real purpose and drive - and the action doesn't kick in\ntoo soon - we get tons of back story and character development,\nsomething of a rarity in action summer blockbusters.<br><br>All in all, probably will not best Transformers or Pirates at the box\noffice, but it certainly deserves to - hugely better than expected -\nand a good film all over.\n"
"\nIt has been a long time since I enjoyed a movie that much! If one looks\nat it as the reboot part of what it is and looks at it separate from\nthe other movies it's even easier to love. The inconsistencies bothered\nme a little the first time I watched it, but only at the back of mind.\nBy the time I got home I already wanted to see it again, and by the\ntime I got back to the theater to watch it again this weekend I had\ndecided to accept it fully for what it was and I enjoyed it even more.\nI had nothing else to do that day and watched two other movies I had\nnever seen before but re-watching First Class was still the highlight\nof my day. On top of all that, through this movie I've discovered quite\nthe love for James McAvoy. ;) I've spent all week finding and watching\neverything else he's ever been in! <br><br>To make a long story a little less long, they would be crazy not to\nmake a sequel to this movie!\n"
"\nAfter already creating four X-Men movies making a fifth one may be\nconsidered pushing it but instead X-Men: First Class came as a fresh\nsurprise with a new perspective. For all not new to the X-Men this\nmovie is a nice surprise as the plot look away from the classic 'human\nhatred towards mutants' story to a more mature and balanced story.\nrather than build up from the fame of the previous X-Men it starts\nfresh and allows the laymen audience to better understand the X-Men\nworld and the characters.<br><br>The best thing about X-Men: First Class is the fabulous manner in which\nthe characters are introduced and developed. the audience may feel a\nbit lost in the beginning but the film quickly unravels. James McAvoy\ndoes a fantastic job of portraying Charles Xaviar with his casual charm\nand trusting voice. Michael Fassbender also provide the perfect\ncontrast portraying Magneto as the mysterious character he is. that\ncombined with a great cast make this movie an enjoyable and\nentertaining experience.\n"
"\nI tend to approach prequels with caution. Caprica is seriously lacking\nas are many others. Without dragging things out, this film has a first\nrate cast and engaging storyline. Something I believe the other X Men\nfilms lacked. They were all good films with amazing actors, the third\nfilm being a bit weak but they were all character stuff and wafer thin\nstory lines. This has plots, ideas and many gap fillers of Mutants'\nintroduction into society and provides a wonderful sub plot staged\naround a very significant part of American history. The script, action\nand characters are all excellent and so many idiots are watching this\non download or computer screens. Do so at your own peril as this is one\nfor the big screen. Restored a lot of faith in Marvel movies.... Oh,\nand I have a whole new respect for Kevin Bacon after seeing this!!\n"
"\nHaving previously seen the three X-Men films not to mention read the\ncomics during the Chris Claremont '80s, I had a big interest in seeing\nthis depiction of the beginnings of the team of hero mutants as founded\nby one Charles Xavier. That said, the real exciting action doesn't go\ninto high gear until near the end but by then there is real compelling\ndrama concerning the main characters of the later known Professor X\n(James McAvoy) and his initial friend-turned-nemesis Magneto (Michael\nFassbender). They along with Kevin Bacon as someone Magneto wants\nvengeance against-Sebastian Shaw-make the film truly worth seeing and\nbrings this entry down to earth whenever things seem to take a\ndirection that I'm not sure of. Having said that, the director Matthew\nVaughn is one who takes care to make sure the other mutant characters\ndon't get too much short shrift so on that note, X-Men: First Class\ncomes highly recommended.\n"
"\nI went in expecting, you know, just another X-men movie, with nothing\nreally exceptional or different happening. What I saw was the best\nX-Men movie to date. All the actors played their parts well and\nbelievably, there was a lot of action in it, and it was just an all\naround enjoyable movie. There were very few cheesy or useless parts in\nit. <br><br>When you watch this movie you are able to feel each character... their\nmotivations, etc. Whether they are a \"good\" or \"bad\" character. In\nfact, the lines between the good and the bad are a little bit blurred\nin this movie, which makes it seem more realistic. Different characters\nhave different motivations, which may be beneficial to one group while\ndetrimental to another. Overall, it was a great movie and I hope it\ndoes well.\n"
"\nI am really surprised that so many people liked this movie. I found it\nquite boring. Maybe they thought it was a good idea to cast Kevin Bacon\nas a psycho ex Nazi mutant scientist but I think it was really, really\na bad idea. The two leads were okay but for the most part the story was\njust so, so and really didn't help define the characters at all. In\nfact some of Erik (ultimately Magneto's) actions are inconsistent to\nwhat he should have done with all of his power. Again the character of\nCharles Xavier is a weakling who is way too emotional about his friends\nto be effective as a leader. The comic book Xavier has always been\nbetter than anything they have put on screen, small or large.\n"
"\nWhen X-Men: First Class came out, I didn't care too much because I\nwasn't really into the X-Men franchise. But since a lot of people were\nsaying it was a great comic-book movie, I decided to watch this film.\nBoy, this movie was excellent.<br><br>What make's this film excellent is the story. I like how it show's what\nProfessor X and Magneto looked like when they were young and creating\nthe Mutan Academy. It also has some great performances from James\nMcAvoy as Professor X, Michael Fassbender as Magneto, and Kevin Bacon\nas the villain, Sebastian Shaw.<br><br>The film also has some great action and interesting character's like\nAzazel, Mystique, Emma Frost, and Darwin.<br><br>Overall, if you're a fan of X-Men or someone that enjoy's comic-book\nmovies, this movie is definitely worth watching.\n"
"\nWow, this 'heroines' needs to wear some sexy dress to use their powers\n(exposing their body parts like prostitutes), if not their power (which\nthey got from nowhere) isn't working. I have seen bunch of positive\nreviews from blinked people, who watched the movie just for see the\nsexuality or 'fake actions/stunts' (it is fake, because they don't\ndescribe how they taking those powers correctly) at them.<br><br>Of course, I have watched many movies similar to this movie (which\nincludes movies like Fantastic Four, Harry Potter and many other\nblockbusters), but they clearly explained how they gets the powers.<br><br>Finally, if I can rate this 'piece of junk' also known as 'top #1 worst\nmovie of all time', lower than 1 star, I would do that.<br><br>So 1/10 stars. My advice to the production team of this 'movie' (as\nthey calls) get examples from other great creative productions (like\nsome examples I described above) and GROW UP!\n"
"\nThis movie is unquestionably the best so far in the year of 2011! I\nwent with really high expectations to watch this movie and boy could I\nhave been any happier to see how it turned out! This movie is so\nfreakin awesome that my back bones chilled a couple of times at its\nmajestic awesomeness. It's just superbly made, extremely captivating\nacting, above all my wildest expectations. to say that I almost cried a\nfew times, at the beauty of the footage is to say a lot, considering\nthat: a) i never cry in movies b) this is no drama I don't wanna spoil\nany bit of this masterpiece to nobody therefore I am done for today.\nJust BRILLIANT 10 stars, because there aren't any more stars to give,\notherwise I would have given it an 100 for sure.\n"
"\nIt's a complete terrible tedious rubbish of a movie. All positive\nreviews here are fake! The story was very boring. The SR-71 Blackbird\naircraft should only have one or, rarely, two seats, and it is not\nhollow inside. The submarine had a way too large interior for its size,\nnot to mention its interior was completely unrealistic. The scene with\nthe missiles at the end was embarrassing to watch. I'm not sure why\nthere are so many positive reviews. One might begin to wonder whether\nsomebody is manipulating the system. And how could this movie possibly\nhave an 8.0 rating? I no longer trust IMDb and its ratings. IMDb has\nbecome corrupt, unfortunately. I demand that IMDb does something to fix\nthis.\n"
"\nI avoided this for years s. Thinking it was going to be naff. But no.\nIt's great fun!! It's got a cool 60s bond vibe. Fassbender is going all\nout bond in this. Jennifer Lawrence is adorable! Emma Frost is like a\nlater day Farrah Fawcett It's measured. It's well paced. It's cool.\nIt's sexy It's almost as good as the first X Men film. It just lacks\ngood old Wolverine. But the performances here are great. If like me,\nyou had your doubts, forget them. Sit back and enjoy this. We need more\n60s themed super hero movies lol.I'm looking forward to watching the\nsequel already. It's reaffirmed my love of X-Men films. After the\nWolverine movies ruined them a bit.\n"
"\nThis movie is by far one of the best X-men movies. The plot twist is\nvery intriguing where it has Wolverine (Huge Jackson) going back into\nthe past in order to alter the future. Also in the movie, the X-men\nface an enemy like never before which forces Professor X and Magneto to\nwork together. <br><br>This is the type of movie where you have to watch from start to end\nbecause the director, Bryan Singer, is always throwing little hints and\nflashbacks that connect all of the previous X-men movies with this one.\nYou won't need to watch all the previous movies in order to understand\nthis one; however I would suggest watching the previous movie\nX-Men:First Class (2011) because that movie is most directly tied to\nthis one.<br><br>Overall, this is a great movie that is very enjoyable no matter if you\nread the comic books or not.\n"
"\nX-Men: First Class was directed by Matthew Vaughn (Kick Ass) and\nproduced by Bryan Singer (X2: X-Men United). It stars Michael\nFassbender, James McAvoy, Jennifer Lawrence, with Kevin Bacon and\nNicholas Hoult. It is a prequel to the original X-Men films and\nintroduces new actors to us. Set in the early 1960's, it has a very\nrefreshing tone to the X-Men franchise. <br><br>I didn't expect much out of First Class because at the time, I wasn't\nmuch of a \"X-Men\" type guy. This is the movie that made me an X-Men\nfan. Bryan Singer did do a good job with the first two X-Men, but\nVaughn did better with First Class. I wasn't excited for this movie\nbecause of the failure of X-Men: The Last Stand and X-Men Origins:\nWolverine. I am know pumped up for X- Men: Days of Future Past coming\nin May 2014.\n"
"\nX-Men: First Class is a fantastic movie with an extremely well\ndeveloped storyline with an outstanding cast and great\ncharacters.Prequels are always hard things to do,and I didn't enjoy the\nmajority of prequels i've seen,I wasn't sure about a prequel to an\nalready troubled franchise (with X-Men: the Last Stand and X-Men\nOrigins: Wolverine),but it was fantastic and the cast is just as good\nif not better than the original X-Men cast,every actor suits their\ncharacters very well and it is very interesting to see how they all\ndeveloped in to Professor X,Magneto,Mystique,etc.X-Men:First Class is a\ntop notch superhero movie and prequel that fans of the first two X-Men\nwill definitely be pleased with.<br><br>A young Magneto and Professor X recruit a group of mutants to save the\nworld from an evil scientists plans to start a third world war.<br><br>Best Performance: Michael Fassbender\n"
"\nTake everything that was excellent about the first trilogy and put\nthose ingredients in the hands of someone who knows exactly what they\nare doing with the comic book genre, then sit back and enjoy the\nresults. Superb entertainment delivered by Matthew Vaughn of Kick-ass\nfame, directing an engaging and dynamic cast. James McAvoy and Michael\nFassbender are entirely convincing at Xavier and Lehnsherr, and they\nhave strong support throughout a well-constructed story from both\nA-listers and up-and-coming young stars alike. Jennifer Lawrence is\nagain worthy of great plaudits essaying the troubled Mystique and\nJanuary Jones is the screen equivalent of super glue to the eyeballs.\nKevin Bacon has no trouble convincing as the personification of evil\nand the action hinges around his hideous masterplan, which is\nstraightforward in its scope, but as usual with X-men it's the personal\nrelationships where most of the real fireworks are flying. Great stuff\n- essential viewing for hero fans.\n"
"\nX-Men: First Class, to a lot of fans, was gonna either make or break\nthe film series for them after they were disappointed by X-Men 3 and\nX-Men Origins: Wolverine. Me, I'm not a big fan of the X-Men, and I\nnever have been.<br><br>This movie, however, was enough to make me interested. X-Men: First\nClass is an origin story for the X-Men, obviously, but the internal\nconflict in it makes it soar above other superhero movies. Charles\n(played by James McAvoy, who was great) and Erik (played by Michael\nFassbender, who is fantastic in everything he's in) are both mutants,\nleading a team of other mutants - but at the same time, their personal\nphilosophies differ so greatly that it gives a lot of tension to the\nfilm.<br><br>The performances in this film are all great - Jennifer Lawrence, Kevin\nBacon, and Nicholas Hoult all stood out to me especially. The movie has\ngreat action and great dialogue as well. However, I thought certain\nmoments were rushed, leading to some either awkward moments or really\nabrupt ones.<br><br>Overall, definitely see X-Men: First Class! I give it a 9.\n"
"\nI've never been a big fan of the X-Men movies, but this is really a\nspectacular film.<br><br>The time period fit more to this kind of story than the others, as\ncomics were a much bigger thing in the '60s, so it kind of felt right.\nIt just worked. The acting was great, the action was pretty exciting,\nand the story was investing. I must say, the ending felt just a bit\nanticlimactic in comparison to the rest of the movie, but there was\nplenty of tension in it, and there's a moment that will make you\nshiver.<br><br>This is a fun, emotional movie. One about friendship, betrayal,\nacceptance, and going separate ways. It's not for everyone, but you'll\nprobably enjoy yourself.\n"
"\nAfter three X-Men films and a pretty poor origins story attempt for\nWolverine in a film of the same name, i might be forgiven for feeling a\nlittle underwhelmed by the prospect of sitting down for over two hours\nand watching another reboot of a popular comic book franchise. Turns\nout, contrary to my expectations, i had a great time. This is an\norigins story that attempts to entertain you rather than bog you down\nwith exposition. The film is surprisingly light on it's feet and has\nmany fun action set pieces as well as some eye catching sets and sexy\nperformances. Michael Fassbender shines for the good guys as Magneto\nwhile Kevin Bacon seems to be having the best time of his career in his\nrole as a bad guy. My only disappointment was the performance of James\nMcAvoy, i found his character hard to believe and more importantly,\nhard to like. Something just seemed a little forced. Full credit must\ngo to Matthew Vaughn for pulling this off. I was a huge fan of Kick Ass\nand if it weren't for how much i loved that film, i may never have\ntried this. I'm glad i did.\n"
"\nWhen I watched this film, I honestly expected it to be a load of\ncodswallop. Seriously, another X-Men movie - and a prequel, no less! I\nwent in with low expectations. But this film was pure awesome. Special\neffects are top notch, dialogue is intelligent, sequences are engaging,\naction is awesome, characters are very believable, the soundtrack is\nbrilliant (it kept rolling through my head for months) and the list\ngoes on. Fassbender's Magneto has some really good acting and very\nquotable quotes, while Xavier is pure coolness. The other mutants are\nalso likable and there isn't really anything to complain about in this\nfilm as far as I can see,<br><br>Very possibly the best X-Men film.\n"
"\nFirst of all I will tell that this movie was awesome when I watched it\nI really felt that I should watch it again and again and I had also\nwatched its sequel days if the future past which was also good.<br><br>I started to like x men from thus movie until I had watched x men the\nlast stand which was really disgusting unbalanced film.<br><br>The action was superb no doubt but the story was also not boring this\nflicks have to be made the acting was good the direction by Mathew\nVaughn was also good.<br><br>I will say that this movie was overall good and there is no negative\npoint I founded in this movie.\n"
"\nSo, i have watched « XMEN: DOFP » the morning in theater and i was\nlucky to watch this one on TV the evening after. <br><br>For me, none of them is better as the two aren't truly « comics\nadaptation » but rather pale inspirations. <br><br>Both used name of characters, certain famous moments of X-men history\n(especially uncanny #150) and then, they cook their own soup. Here, the\nHellfire Club becomes a sort of Specter or fit for for « Austin Powers\n» and the X-Men get tangled in international crisis. This first class\nhas rather boring teammates (Havok, Banshee, Mystique, \"angel\nSalvadore\"?,\"Darwin\"?, \"Riptide\"?). <br><br>If the sets are however visually stunning, the power of this movie is\nto have found an incredible young Magnus with Fassbender. As Ridely\nScott has noticed in « Prometheus », this actor is just great as he\nreally acts old school!\n"
"\nthis movie is totally a disappointment. It's just full of cliché! a\nnuclear war between Russia and USA which is ignited with treacherous\nand deceptive act of bad x-men is going to happen and good x-men want\nto prevent it. bad x-men hope by this war they destroy the rule of\nhuman race and instead they shall rule the world. all x-men have kind\nof stupid ability which may be attractive for kids and teenagers. the\ncharacters don't have any profound disposition and traits and they are\njust plain with simple ambitions. they don't communicate with audience\nas they should and don't make any sympathetic thought and feeling\nthrough the viewer. there isn't any exiting part in this movie despite\nthe fact that the director had wanted to bring some surprise by stupid\ntreason of some characters to each other!\n"
"\nThis x-men movie was the most stupid i ever see.OK,first x-men was like\nWOAU! and i like it.Next was OK but with every series to come the movie\nbecame strange and boring and not so credible.<br><br>And this...this 8.0 IMDb rating, let it go at that!I think this movie\ndon't deserve either 2.0 and the high rating is only for support and\nadvertising.Really, somebody believe in this pitiful characters?You\nhave wings, you have power of read minds, you shoot with fire, you\nbrake glass with power of the sound...very,very inapt.If this people\nliving on the world, now, the crisis won't touch us.Really.Or...because\nthey are between us is this craziness on the Earth? Better believe in\naliens than x-men.Yeah...<br><br>Finally...the most bad movie x-men i ever seen.\n"
"\nBefore i saw this movie i rated Wolverine Origins the worst adaptation\never, but now i must say this is even worst!!!<br><br>For a movie and forgetting the X-men official universe, its actually a\npretty good movie, but as an adaptation its terrible...<br><br>I'm a big fan of this kind of movies so i must say it's not bad in it's\ncategory. It as good plot, good actors and decent special effects. But\ni'm a bigger X-men fan... And i am very disappointed with the way the\nwriters converted my favorite Marvel franchise to the big screen.<br><br>If you are a X-men fan then i guess you will be as disappointed as me\nwhen you see this movie, whoever if you are not a X-men fan or comic\nbook reader and this type of movies is your thing then i think you myth\nenjoy it and like it.\n"
"\nFirst off, let me start by saying I had no intention of seeing this\nmovie but after seeing the positive reviews on here I decided to give\nit a try and boy am I glad I did!<br><br>The movie is a delight from beginning to end. Perfectly cast,\nbrilliantly paced with great humor and lovely surprises thrown in for\ngood measure. All the actors were great and truly brought the\ncharacters to life. They captured their essence and watching their\nstories unfold was very entertaining.<br><br>The entire team behind this movie deserves a standing ovation for\npulling off a reboot to the franchise so flawlessly.<br><br>Any comic book fan is bound to enjoy it. Enough reading, go see it if\nyou haven't already. It's time well spent!\n"
"\nMatthew Vaughn started to shine as a new star on Hollywood's dimly lit\nsky with Kick Ass. So I was keen on watching this new X-Men prequel,\nbut sadly it was everything what Kick Ass was not. The worst casting\never made for a superhero movie. Imagine Mystique as a fat faced\nyoungster, or Toad in a red costume, looking like a B movie action\nhero.<br><br>Poorly written dialogues, 15 year old Visual Effects reminding me of a\nlow budget movie, nonexistent action sequences and a meaningless story\nmakes this a painful experience, you never want to experience again in\nyour life. This is the absolute low end of the X-Men franchise.\n"
"\nAlongside Days of Future's Past these are the best X-Men films with\ngreat music score. All of the characters are given a role and not just\nLogan, the Professor and Magneto. Seeing Beast is excellent as he is\nfinally given more screen time. This movie gets the X- Men done\ncorrectly. Each of the team brought together are allowed to develop.\nThe villain is not the most important part of the story and so does not\ntake away from what is a story ultimately about the X-Men team. Using\ntheir powers to solve problems and actually showing scenes in which the\nX-Men are coming to terms with their abilities. Their actually shown as\nmutants with human frailties.\n"
"\nThis is a great movie. The first 4 X men movie were good movies. This\nis better. This movie has a lot of action. It has great acting. It has\na great story line. It should have gone to the Oscars. 7.8 is a good\nratting. But this is such a great film the 7.8 is underrating it.\nWolverine is better. X men day of future past is also better. X men\napocalypse is also better. But still a great movie. I give it 9 out of\n10. This is a very good movie. See it. It is a prequel. And has far has\ntime goes. This is the first one. Great movie. Most of the time If the\nfirst four movie are good the fifth one is going to be good. See this\nmovie. It is a great movie. It is one of the best action movies from\n2011. See it. It is a must see.\n"
"\nHistory is Fun. And Mixing Real History with Fantasy is more fun!! But\nremember this philosophy of we are the good guys and they are the bad\none is bad. There a Video on YouTube that Bill Clinton asks Americans\nfor forgiveness because CIA tested new drugs and equipment on Citizens!\nAnd more USA keep doing this tests in Humans, immigrants without\ndocuments. Frisks, not Christians!! Another issue in about Nazi\nDeutschland. Why did only east of Deutschland the Nazi were BAD? Where\nare the Concentration Nazi Camps to kill people on France?? On Italy?\nRemember Hitler was Catholic!! A good Christian!! But one more time\nX-men did a great movie!!\n"
"\nThis is indeed a very great movie in the X-Men movie franchise. We get\nto see Magneto's tragic past and lots of other X-Men character origins\nin this too. The main villain in this who was of course a Nazi was the\none that took everything from Magneto in that concentration camp in\nPoland. We also take a look at Professor Charles Xavier with hair in\nthis and boy does he look good with hair. We also see him having a love\ninterest in this which is also really cool. This movie contains a lot\nof action and it takes place during 1962 the year of the Cuban Missile\nCrisis when the Soviet Union was shipping nuclear missiles to Cuba\nuntil President John F. Kennedy ordered a navy blockade around Cuba to\nstop the missiles from being shipped in. The early 1960's is also the\ntime when the X-Men were introduced along with the Hulk, Fantastic 4\nand Spider-Man. This movie is truly amazing. Enough said.\n"
"\nAfter the abysmal X-Men Origins: Wolverine and the middling X-Men: The\nLast Stand, this mutant superhero franchise was in need of a reboot to\nrestore its dominance for 20th Century Fox. Along comes X-Men: First\nClass and in celebration of the closing of this new X-Men trilogy, I\nwanted to revisit the two movies that lead up to X-Men: Apocalypse with\nthe story of Magneto and Professor Xavier.<br><br>The story begins with Magneto as a child Erik Lensherr as it did in the\nfirst X-Men film. Magneto exhibits his mutant talents of controlling\nmetal and in this version, he is tortured by an evil mutant Sebastian\nShaw played by Kevin Bacon. It is revealed that Shaw can harness\nenergy, especially explosive energy, to make him nearly indestructible\nand very deadly. Magneto grows up to be played by Michael Fassbender\nand seek revenge against his tormentor.<br><br>Check out more of this review and others at swilliky.com\n"
"\nX-Men: First Class goes back to the past before Wolverine, Jean or any\nof the original X-Men group we still have the original characters but\njust some new faces Jennifer Lawrence as Mystique, Michael Fassbender\nas Magneto and nails it and James McAvoy as the Professor. The movie\nshows the tragic past of Magneto and how Charles Xavier lost his feet\nand of course Nicholas Hoult as Beast who does a pretty great job just\nlike everyone else i don't have a problem with this film it's just not\nX-Men without Wolverine although Hugh Jackman has a small funny cameo\nin this movie and it's amazing. I give First Class a 9 out of 10 cause\nit's pretty cool.\n"
"\nPrequels suck right and yeah they do but X men first class don't\nbecause there was care with this film unlike X men origins. There was\ngood direction with this film and some of the best casting choices ever\nmade James McAvoy as Professor Xavier was brilliant but he truly shines\nin Days of future past and what about Micheal Fassbender he shines in\nthis film the most as Magneto, The acting as you guessed is great from\neveryone and the characters are interesting. The script is good and\nseems interesting it moves along perfectly and has some great action in\nthe film as well but what makes this film even better is that it\nfocuses only on Xavier and Eric not Wolverine.<br><br>The plot involves Charles and Eric who make the mansion for the Mutants\nand end up helping the FBI to find and stop Sebastian Shaw. They end up\nfinding him but at the same time have to stop some nukes form hitting\nAmerica.<br><br>The movie is great and the best prequel out there so I highly recommend\nwatching it.\n"
"\nX-Men: First Class aims to start all over again the saga, and director\nMatthew Vaughn hits the film, X-Men First Class can be greater than the\ninner trilogy, the cast is great, Michael Fassbender, James McAvoy,\nJennifer Lawrence, Kevin Bacon and etc, the special effects are great,\nthe Beast and Mystique of makeup are good, the story is very well told,\nthe motivation of Magneto is plausible in terms of fidelity in comics\nthe movie part, especially in training, where the Havok is older than\nthe Cyclops?, Cyclops 16 he was already the leader of the X-Men,\nwhere's Jean Grey, Storm, Iceman, Nightcrawler and others, Mystique is\nnot the original lineup, more fine, at least they will do this in\nX-Men: Apocalypse (I hope), the soundtrack is good, and the action\nscenes are good too, even X-Men not be true in the original formation\n(I do not understand why the Cyclops is so barely tapped the film), the\nfilm was a great start. Note 8.5\n"
"\nThis is a prequel to the X-men saga and fans of the marvel mythology\nuniverse will love it. The special effects are awesome, the plot is\ndecent and its just super fun discovering how all the characters came\nto be. The cast is also like a whose-who of stars, top notch including\nseveral fun cameos and an homage to Patrick Stewarts hair that really\nmade me laugh.<br><br>I loved the bromance between James McAvoy as a young Charles Xavier and\n(Michael Fassbender) who hasn't yet become Magneto, watching them\ndiscover their powers, working together before they became arch\nenemies. I never fully engaged in the whole cold war/nukes storyline\nbut I did enjoy witnessing the formation of the X-Men and discovering\ntheir origins.<br><br>In all honesty this probably deserves a higher rating but its not my\nfavourite movie genre so I couldn't fully appreciate it for what it is.\n09.13\n"
"\nI'm not the biggest X-men fan. I never read the comics, so my knowledge\nof the story only comes from the films. If you look online you'll see\nplenty of fanboys crying because some of the dates in this prequel\ndon't add up in the original trilogy.<br><br>That's probably true, but I didn't notice. I thought, for a prequel -\nwhich, let's face it, is just an excuse to milk a few extra quid out of\nthe franchise's audience - it was actually okay. It did a good job of\nshowing us a backstory that we didn't know, i.e. how Professor X and\nMagneto went from friends to enemies (George Lucas could take note as\nto how to write prequels!). Everything seemed to fit together well and\ntie up all the loose ends. Plus there wasn't too much pointless action\nand the special effects seemed just right (although I just watched\nTransformers 3, so I'm all CGIed out right now!). It felt more like a\nspy film with super powers.<br><br>All in all, good fun. And just be thankful they did cast Kevin Bacon as\nthe villain as opposed to Colin Firth (seriously, he just would have\nkilled the film).\n"
"\n\"X-Men: First Class\" is the prequel of all the X-Men and it shows us\nhow all started with all of these mutants and their own story. In this\nmovie we also watch the United States government requests the help of\nmutants to stop a dictator who is determined to start the world war\nIII.<br><br>I liked this movie because of the plot and because of the\ninterpretations of James McAvoy who plays as Charles Xavier, Michael\nFassbender who plays as Erik Lensherr (Magneto), Kevin Bacon who plays\nas Sebastian Shaw and Jennifer Lawrence who plays as Mystique.<br><br>Finally I have to say to you that I strongly recommend this movie\nbecause with this movie you will understand even better the X-Men\nhistory and how all that happened.\n"
"\nMathew Vaughn directed this second prequel(though fifth entry) in the\nfranchise, set mostly in 1962, where young mutants Charles\nXavier(played by James McAvoy) and Erik Lansherr(played by Michael\nFassbender) are enlisted by the U.S. government to organize fellow\nmutants they locate through the use of the Cerebro, through which\nCharles uses his telepathic powers. Once together, they are attacked by\nevil mutant leader Sebastian Shaw(played by Kevin Bacon) who has a past\nwith Erik(from WWII) that puts them on a collision course that will\ndetermine the future events that turn Erik into Magneto and lead his\nanti-human brotherhood of mutants. Surprisingly good film does a fine\njob filling in the back stories of key X-Men characters, who are well\ncast with younger actors. Lots of big-scale action scenes helped by a\nthoughtful script, and authentic recreation of the early 1960's.\n"
"\nFox decided to reboot the X-Men franchise with new actors as younger\nversions of the familiar roles. This prequel takes place mostly in 1962\nbefore and around the Cuban Missile Crisis. It's a good start\nespecially if the most important part of this exercise is to get good\nyoung actors to refresh the franchise. James McAvoy is the new Charles\nXavier. Jennifer Lawrence is Mystique. Nicholas Hoult is Beast. Michael\nFassbender is Magneto. With them as well as others, the franchise looks\nto be on solid grounds. As for this movie itself, it's a little bit\nslow at times. I think we're suppose to go weak in the knees every time\na new actor for each iconic role is revealed. It's still great to see\nthe new actors in action. They'll probably grow into their roles in the\nnext movie. This is a solid starting point.\n"
"\nDirector Matthew Vaughn, helmed for his Kick-Ass, has done it again.\nWith a brand new set of actors (watch out for the special appearance of\nLogan), Matthew Vaughn has opened a fresh start from the X-Men trilogy.\nThe story is well presented and James McAvoy truly is capable of\nrepresenting Charles Xavier amongst others such as Jennifer Lawrence\n(Winter's Bone) as Raven. The music score is also truly entertaining as\nwell as matches the scenes appropriately. <br><br>However, apart from its minor defects that many will tend to overlook,\nX-Men First Class is huge step forward from its dragging, mediocre &amp;\nstar-studded predecessor trilogy.<br><br>Therefore, don't hesitate to watch this film in the cinema. That is\nmoney well spent.\n"
"\nThis was a very pleasant surprise. After the infamous X3 and X-Men\nOrigins, the X-Men franchise was slowly crumbling. One good movie could\nrejuvenate the franchise; instead we got a fantastic movie. The acting\nstood out, especially Michael Fassbender's performance as a young\nMagneto. I was immediately invested in the story and captivated by the\nprogression of Magneto's character. I thought this was done very well.\nX-Men: First Class is not your typical summer blockbuster; it's got\nmore layers to it. For one, the script is witty and effective. I found\nmyself on the edge of my seat just waiting for the very well written\ndialogue. Another merit this film carries is the amazing soundtrack\ncomposed by Henry Jackman. It was evident that Hans Zimmer had his\nfingerprints all over it, for the music sounded similar to Inception,\nwhich is never a bad thing. Watching all my favorite X-Men characters\nwhen they were young was really cool, and just makes this film all the\nmore special to me. I would rank this film among the greatest\nsuperhero/comic book movies ever made.\n"
"\nX-Men, not exactly the most popular of comic book superheros, have a\nfaithful following; and this flick is about the first assembling of\nyoung mutants and the developing of individual powers as Charles Xavier\nforms his mutant training academy. James McAvoy is Professor X and\nMichael Fassbender is Magneto and both are youthful and reckless. The\nmutants have yet to make themselves public, but when the ruthless\nvillain Sebastian Shaw(Kevin Bacon),in 1962, connives the Russians to\nmove missiles into Cuba, Xavier and Magneto gather the small band of\nmutants as a covert CIA operation to use their powers to stop what\nwould be known as the Cuban Missile Crises. Formidable skills make for\na masterful climax as the world escapes a nuclear Armageddon. I am not\nactually an X-Men fan, but I am a fan of Jennifer Lawrence, who plays\nthe mutant named Raven. Also in the cast: Rose Byrne, Oliver Platt,\nBill Milner, Zoe Kravitz, Jason Fleming and January Jones.\n"
"\nMatthew Vaughn's treatment of the film is controlled, adhering to the\nscript firmly which may create some flaws in the story but not so much\nto lose sight of the crucial Xavier-Magneto bond/rivalry. Yes, McAvoy\nand Fassbender are excellent in their respective roles and carry the\nstory beyond the traditional superhero dilemmas of coping with gifts\nthat pressure and alienate them from the rest of humanity. <br><br>This prequel/reboot is the best thing to happen to the X-Men franchise!\nThe film provides riveting action, powerful drama, and an intelligent\nbackstory to the beloved comic book mutants. The film ventures into\nDark Knight territory with its darker tone and does not disappoint.\nX-Men: First Class is easily the best X-Men film to date!\n"
"\nI absolutely love this film and think its ace however it has really\ndisappointed me in one very big mistake that has been made making this\nfilm. If you notice at the end of the film professor X gets paralysed,\nthen if you watch X-men last stand he is walking with magneeto when\nthey are older. Its such a disappointment that you have failed to make\nthis film fit in well with the others. For me personally it has spoilt\nthe rest of the films and should have had more thought put into how the\nstory would fit in with the others. I am aware that everything else\nfits in but this is such a poor error that should not have been made.\nUntil I noticed this error I really enjoyed First class as I thought\nthe characters where good and the powers they had were pretty cool but\nnow I cant help but dislike this film knowing the massive error you\nhave made.\n"
"\nAfter an OK last X-Men film with some heavy-hitting actors seemingly\nriding into the sunset, Marvel and a new set of cast and director comes\nroaring back in a quite long but not altogether dull \"reboot\" type\nmovie. Especially for the first hour or so of it's runtime, \"X-Men\nFirst Class\" is disjointed and everywhere - it lacks focus and drags\nout it's introduction too long. However, by the 2nd half, the movie has\nsettled down and the characters have mostly come together. The strength\nof the cast, like the older movies, is rightfully with it's 2 leads\nJames McAvoy and Michael Fassbender, especially McAvoy who seems to\nfaithfully represent a young and dashing Xavier. I enjoyed almost every\nscene with him present. Unfortunately though Kevin Bacon's antagonist\nseems more mischievous than truly malevolent so the movie kind of lacks\nan arch-villain. Anyway, there are both worse and better superhero\nmovies out there.\n"
"\nI'm sorry if I'm sexist or something, but Emma Frost in this movie is\nnowhere near as sexy as she is in the comics and cartoons. Also,\nJennifer Lawrence as Mystique was a really poor choice. She just\ndoesn't do it for me. She has this little chubby baby face, the makeup\non here wasn't anywhere near as well done as the first 3 movies, her\nacting wasn't the greatest and, again I'm sorry, but she didn't come\nclose to Rebecca Romijn in the first three movies. Not for makeup, not\nfor acting, not for the action sequences and not for her sexiness. I\nfeel she was a very poor choice for this roll.<br><br>But hey, other than that it was a good movie. Great story, good actors,\nscript and effects were well done. No other complaints about it.<br><br>I loved Logan's small roll in this flick. Perfect.\n"
"\nA revealing prequel to the X-Men saga. Unlike any movie of the trilogy,\nthis one has a decent plot and good characters development. Indeed, it\nallows us to discover how everything unfolded and why the characters\nare in the predicaments that they are in the trilogy. Many of the\ncharacters that we have in the X-men trilogy are replaced by younger\nactors in order to fit the story which is happening in the past. For\ninstance, James McAvoy has taken over Patrick Steward as Professor\nCharles Xavier and Michael Fassbender as a young Magneto. Together they\nboth offer a different and new perspective on the rivalry those two\ncharacters have towards one another. Highly Recommended!\n"
"\nIt was great to watch the origin story of Professor X and Magneto. It\ntook turns in unexpected ways. First of all, The characters and the\nperformances are so good. It was fun to watch these mutants get\ntogether and save the world. X-Men First Class is the the type of movie\nyou could again and again without getting bored. It is my favorite\nX-Men movie and I'm super excited for X-Men Days Of Future Past. The\nbest thing about X- Men movies is there characters. They're so lovable,\nfunny and have a great chemistry and Hugh Jackman's cameo as Wolverine;\nJust speechless. It was so so good. X-Men First Class was a great\nenjoyable fun origin movie. I loved it.\n"
"\nAll these very positive reviews on here must be from people whom didn't\nsee the first X-Men movie because this one pales in comparison. I\nreally liked the first one, but this one was just not that good. The\nactors and characters are not as good and the story line is much\nslower.<br><br>The main plot is how Magneto and Xavier were friends at first and\nworked together but then parted ways as Magento saw their mutations as\na way to dominate humans. They find other mutants in the most boring\nmusical montage. The only redeeming character is the baddie played by\nKevin Bacon. He was a great bad guy.<br><br>FINAL VERDICT: After seeing it, I say skip it.\n"
"\nI didn't enter the movie with high expectations, but must confess to\nenjoying the latest prequel more than many of it's counterparts.<br><br>The film starts with one of the scenes from the original movie and then\nflashes backwards and forwards with the majority of the film based in\n1962.<br><br>Here we find Xavier and Magneto becoming aware of their powers and\nfinding others with special powers. The film is very well scripted and\nin common with the better films in the X series you really feel empathy\nor at least understanding with most of the leading characters. As with\nother prequels you always have a very good idea about what the ultimate\nconclusion will be but it's a great ride getting there and thoroughly\nenjoyable.\n"
"\nI've been looking forward to this movie for quite some time. However, I\nwas rather nervous going into as i'd gone to other reboots/prequels and\nbeen disappointed. The special effects aren't over the top. They don't\nneed to be because the storyline is quite decent. Michael fassbender\nand james mcavoy both shine in this movie. Michael fassbender brings a\nlot of intensity and anfry malevolence to the role and james mcavoy\nadds some youthful charm to professor xavier. My only complaint would\nbe that January jones is just present as eye candy. I also felt that\nnicholas hoult struggled a bit when it came to credibility but maybe\nthats just me.\n"
"\nLike Star Wars and Star Trek, now it's the X-Men turn to get a back\nstory.<br><br>The story takes in place in 1962, a young college student named Charles\nXavier(James McAvoy), before he was known has Professor Xavier, is\nasked by Morina MacTaggert(Rose Byrne) to help figure out an evil\nmutant named Sebastian Shaw(Kevin Bacon) and his crews plan. Charles\nbefriends a troubled mutant named Erik Lennsher(Michael Fassbender),\nbefore he became known has Magneto, He and Charles recruits other\nmutants, but will they all be able to be a step ahead of Shaw? <br><br>An improvement over X-Men:Origins Wolverine. The effects are\nincredible, so are two surprised cameos, by whom I won't say. McAvoy\nand Fassbender give descent performances. So does Kevin Bacon as the\nvillain, he just really gets under your skin. I liked the back story,\nand the 60's setting. A true delight for X-Men fans.\n"
"\nBeing a fan of the original X-Men films, I was really looking forward\nto this. I thought it would be interesting to find out a little bit\nmore about the earlier lives of Charles Xavier and Erik Lensherr.<br><br>I really liked how the story developed and the roles of Charles and\nErik were portrayed fantastically by James McAvoy and Michael\nFassbender respectively. The other (previously unseen) mutants in this\nmovie were also interesting, especially Hank. The cameo from Wolverine\nwas also hilarious.<br><br>The storyline was great and plenty of action to keep you gripped.\nOverall this film was brilliant and I am really looking forward to\n'X-Men: Days of Future Past' now, especially after this one was left on\nsuch a cliffhanger. I think this is definitely as good as the original\ntrilogy of X-Men films, possibly better. This is one that you just have\nto see.<br><br>10/10 -\n"
"\nJust watch x-men first class.What a mind blowing movie it was.As a\nmatter of fact I really was expecting this movie to be good.After all i\nlove x- men franchise.The effects were superb.Amazing actors.Awesome\nstory.What else do we want in a good movie? I ran out of words for this\nmovie !! It was so cool.The best one in the franchise !! I hope the\nsequel will be much more cooler than this one.And what amazing actors\nthey were.Who can say that it was a movie.It seemed like everything was\nreal.But im sad that mystique went to the other side.But it was her\nchoice.And the scene in which erik took the submarine out of the\nsea.That was the best part of the movie.I hope it gets nominated for\nOscar.Because we won't see such a good movie afterwards in 2011.My\nratings 10/10\n"
"\nI really enjoyed this film. Its set in a time when Prof X and Magneto\nwere actually friends! It gives you the back story of the duo and shows\nhow the X-men came to be! <br><br>The good stuff: James and Michael do a fantastic job portraying the\nyoung Prof X and Magneto. The action sequences are fantastic. The\nspecial effects are fantastic. The story is fantastic. It explains how\nsome of the X-men from the other films came to be and answers other\nquestions like why is Prof X in a wheelchair. A great performance from\nKevin Bacon and the entire cast! Also a nice surprise appearance...<br><br>The bad stuff: Not much to be fair! Some of the mutants were a bit\nlame. Also it ended! For fans and new comers alike you should love it!\n"
"\nAm I the only one who thinks this movie was ridiculous and simply bad?\nI mean McAvoy's and Fassbender's performance was awesome but thats not\nenough. Apart from the bad CG and the predictable plot there's a lot in\nthis film that disturbs the overall experience. How about the SR-71\nblackbird for example. You can barely fit two people in there and yet\nhere they are cruising around with 7 people and as if that wasn't\nenough the plane starts hovering in the air like a harrier....\nSERIOUSLY!? I mean Beast might have IMPROVED the thing with his superb\nintellect but THIS? Come on! How about the kid who flies through the\nair with his voice? I think that speaks for itself.<br><br>If you manage not to care about the things I have stated above you're\nin for a decent action movie.\n"
"\nI just came back from the theater and both my wife and i agree that\nthis was an outstanding movie. The storyline was crafted superbly and\nthe characters were well done. The acting was good throughout the\nentire cast, especially the main characters McAvoy and Fassbender mesh\nreally well together. I would highly recommend seeing this movie, even\nif you aren't an X-Men buff. It's entertaining and let's you understand\nthe back story. I'm really hopeful that the box office numbers are high\nand that the studio decides to continue along this story line. The\nactors and actresses fit their roles perfectly and the i could see this\nbecoming a franchise. I'm keeping my fingers crossed for more.\n"
"\nThis Movie is without a doubt THE BEST X-men and THE BEST prequel EVER\nmade!!! and i ma not just making it up as a X-men fan, every thing\nabout this movie was perfect. The acting By James McAvoy nailed his\nrole as Xavier. And i also believe that Jennifer Lawrence was fantastic\nand beautiful.oh and Kevin Bacon... what can you say for Kevin Bacon??\nThe man was outstanding in his role.<br><br>Until now i really wasn't a fan of Superhero films, but this really\nchanged my mind.<br><br>One thing that i wasn't so sure of , was the absence of Logan OR\nWolverine. But 10 Mins into the film i totally forgot about him. <br><br>and Again, the best prequel or possibly the best superhero film so far<br><br>Rating : 10 /10 for sure !!!!\n"
"\nThe story takes place at the past, when Charles Xavier and Erik\nLansherr are young and they team up to prevent the beginning of World\nWar 3 that the evil mutant Sebastian Shaw is planning, in order to\nfulfill his dream, an earth beloging only to mutants. The movie is a\nprequel to the other x men movie series but it's not as good as the\nprevious ones. The story line at the beginning is confusing as it is\nswitching from one place to an other, from past to future. However the\nrest of the story is getting better, and the action scenes are quite\ngood. The performances are good too, especially Fassbender as Magnito.\nSo 5 out of 10, because it is a nice action movie, with some funny\nparts, but it resembles other action movies.\n"
"\nThe X-Men are my favourite heroes from comicdom so I was always a\nlittle worried when they said they would be making films on the\nsubject. Despite not getting the classic X-men I would love to see, I\ncannot fault the films they have made so far and this is no exception.\nFast paced and exciting with a terrific cast (especially Jennifer\nLawrence) this film is a tour-de-force and I cannot wait to see 'Days\nOf Future Past' I realise that several anachronisms have been reported\nfor this film but that is the risk you take when you include factual\nevents in a movie. I, for one, have decided to suspend my willing\ndisbelief on that part. For me, this film is almost as entertaining as\n'Prometheous'\n"
"\nFinally X Men movie thats worth screaming and shouting about. I have\nalways liked the whole idea and explanation about the mutant theory in\nX men films/cartoons. This sense of 'science and fantasy' has an\nadvantage over superhero movies.<br><br>And these great qualities are embedded in this movie. Quality\nstoryline, with some strong mutants that actually are powerful unlike\nthe Wolverine movie(2013). The acting, I must say is fantastic and the\ninclusion of cast such as James McAvoy have been an added bonus. <br><br>There is a good flow of historic past and this film fits nicely with\nwhat we know about current X men characters. It fits perfectly with\nhistoric events.<br><br>SPOILER START My only criticism is the choice of weak mutants by Dr X\nconsidering he can bring together any mutant in the world with his\npowers.but that's a picky point and is made up by the excellent young\nDr. X and Magneto. SPOILER END<br><br>Overall, a good film to put things in perspective.\n"
"\nI have been a fan of many Marvel comics and films over the years. One\nparticular franchise with promise was X-Men. With many different heroes\nand villains within the comic franchise itself, this gives film makers\na lot to work with. As seen with the other instalments, this has been\nreflected through the introduction of new characters including\nvillains, and different plots. X-Men: First Class is a brilliant\ninsight to where it all began, and how the modern day X-Men came to be.\nThis film has everything, action, drama, suspense and even bits of\ncomedy. Coupled with brilliant effects and terrific acting, it is a\ngood film for all audiences. This film is a must see for any Marvel\ncomics fan.\n"
"\nX-Men First Class is one of the best movies of all time. By far. Now I\nhave never (until now) been an X-men Wolverine fan, but this film just\nblew me away.<br><br>Another amazing thing about this movie is the absolutely unbelievable\ncast. It all starts with the star of the movie, Charles Xavier (James\nMcAvoy), who was great, but my favorite was Erik, played by Micheal\nFassbender, who was mind-blowing. And nobody could forget Sebastian\nShaw, played by the great actor Kevin Bacon. I am telling you the\ntruth: I watched this movie at least four times and I will probably\nwatch it again someday. I give this movie an 100 out of 10. <br><br>And I am also telling you: Watch this movie. It is a great kids' movie,\nand good as a whole-family movie to watch.\n"
"\nI do like the motion picture but it is contradictory and conflicting.\nIf you research both comics and the x-men films in the last motion\npicture it demonstrates Charles and Eric aka Professor X and Magnito\ngoing to home of Jean Grey when she was a girl and Charles aka\nProfessor X was walking, where as in the motion picture they have him\nin a wheel chair before he had met both Jean and Scott. In the comics\nand at least shown in one of the films he had met both Jean and Scott\nprior to his accident. The movie itself was very good, and does explain\na few things as to how Raven and Charles met...it is informative but a\nbit contradictory, it does show however Scott aka cyclops and storm in\nthe movie while he is locating mutants.\n"
"\nMatthew Vaughn, who you might know as the director of \"Kick-Ass\", has\ndone a wonderful job rebooting the X-Men franchise. I was incredibly\ncaptivated by the characters and the plot, and I found it perfect that\nit was about the Cold War. Sometimes it's hard to make a prequel\nbecause you might inadvertently create continuity errors, but with this\nmovie, they mostly ignore the previous movies and instead focus on\ntelling a new tale. And it works out great.<br><br>I felt this was decently cast. James McAvoy was a good Charles Xavier,\nbut having his 'sister' be Jennifer Lawrence was a bit strange to me.\n(She's all sorts of perfect by the way.) Kevin Bacon was... interesting\nto say the least. I read that Bryan Cranston was the alternative, and\nnow I kinda wish Cranston had been chosen. The many other mutants were\nfine, with Darwin being my favorite. I'm looking forward to the next\ninstallment.\n"
"\nI am limited by the ratings so only could rate 10/10. What a\nperformance by Michael Fassbender as Magneto. He grew up thinking for a\nrevenge after what happened to his mother in front of his eyes. I love\nHollywood movies because of their creation of villains. Here we see how\na normal boy is transformed into a destructor of human kind. His\nperformance is much better than James Mcavoy as both have powers but\nthen the situation demanded a aggressive character.<br><br>I was thrilled when Erik says I am Frankenstein monster. The final\nbattle between Erik and Shaw should have been more interesting but let\nnot demise the thrilling moment when the coin passed through his brain,\nhe felt everything. After Inglorious bastards Michael Fassbender became\na known face overnight but this movie would be remembered for him in\nfuture.\n"
"\nThe movie is really Awesome!! Enjoyed a lot while watching. The\ndialogues of Charles Xavier (Professor X), in training camp - where in\nthe real powers were bought out from the Mutants, is meaningful and\ntrue. The moral of the real life is explained with mind blowing\nscreenplay, the true and actual powers cannot be realized from anger\nand agony. They are the outcome of concentration and peace of mind. I\nwatched the movie alone by myself, however would like to watch it again\nwith my friends as the movie contains the trilling scenes especially\nwhen the Russian war ship is about to cross the territorial boundary of\nCuba. Good work - Mr.Matthew Vaughn, Mr.Sheldon Turner and Mr.Bryan\nSinger also the entire Team. I appreciate it.\n"
"\nAfter less then spectacular installments in the X-Men series with X-Men\n3 and the Wolverine Origin story the First Class did a great job of\nshowing you how the team started out from scratch. The movie is\nanchored by 2 great leads with Michael Fassbender as Mangeto and James\nMcAvoy as Professor Xavier. In the other movies you see Xavier and\nMagneto on the other side but this is still when the both of them are\nstill working together and shows you what lead them to picking opposite\nsides of the battle. The movie has a good supporting cast also with\nKevin Bacon, Rose Byrne, January Jones, Jennifer Lawrence, Oliver Platt\nand others. Definitely recommend this movie for any comic book movie\nfans or just anyone who wants to see a good movie.\n"
"\nI never read a comic book and when I saw the first X-Men film, I was\nintrigued, but confused. Throughout the trilogy, I always thought I was\nmissing a lot of the story and this is it. First Class is the missing\nlink that will answer questions for the fans of the movie, who don't\nfollow the comics, and it is one blockbuster film that more than lives\nup to its hype. From the special effects to the make-up and finally to\nthe actors this film is amazing. Movies like this never win awards, but\nyou will be hard pressed to find better performances than those of\nJames McAvoy, Kevin Bacon, &amp; Michael Fassbender. The whole cast was\nterrific, the story was fantastic, and the special effects were truly\nout of this world. This is a great film and I'm craving more. I can't\nwait to see what connections the next forty years bring between first\nclass and the trilogy. When it's all said and done, I hope I can watch\nall these films and truly understand the whole story.\n"
"\nAfter the disappointing X-Men Origins: Wolverine, the X-Men saga has\nbeen fully pumped once again with the origins of the friendship of\nCharles Xavier and Erik Lehnsherr. X-Men: First Class is a very stylish\nfilm but still has a brilliant mixture of dark grit and brutality that\nmade X2 such a great success. Michael Fassbender makes a perfect\napproach to Erik, rocking a turtleneck sweater and a great Irish-German\naccent. And James McAvoy's Charles is sophisticated when sober and\nhilariously intelligent when drunk. But the spectacular thing is this-\nthey don't even reflect Ian McKellen and Patrick Stewart. This is one\nfilm that can stand on it's own two feet and make itself it's own\nthing. The supporting cast is also quite brilliant. The star of the\ncareer-boosting Hunger Games, Jennifer Lawrence, is sexy but also sweet\nas Mystique; Lucas Till amazes as Havok; and Lenny Kravitz's daughter\nZoe shines as a hero and villain as Angel. You must see this film. It\ndoesn't really get any better than this in the X saga!\n"
"\nThe vast array of uncanny yet stunningly entertaining mutations of the\nunparalleled members of the \"X-Men: First Class\" assemblage bond\nharmoniously to form a well-balanced strain of sheer enjoyment. The\nsolid performances of both James McAvoy (Charles Xavier) and Michael\nFassbender (Magneto) combine to interweave several moments of\nsentimental resonance that will certainly send the audience trembling\nwith strong emotions. However, the incorporated action sequences follow\nthe typical superhero battle formula comprising gargantuan explosions,\nspontaneous and bland teleportations and the trite levitation of nearly\nany object in the vicinity, which at times induces monotony given the\nrepetitiousness and ridiculousness of these action choreographies. Per\ncontra, the logical storyline smoothly and comprehensively links all\npast X-Men films. Though the action scenes prove to be the weaker gene,\nthe talented performances from both McAvoy and Fassbender most\ndefinitely enmesh to restructure a previously shapeless sequence into a\nrevitalized, cruciform helix.\n"
"\nAfter Matthew Vaughn refused a prior X-Men movie, he finally came and\nmade this one. And it seems like he made the right decision. He had\nmore to say in this, then he would have had in the earlier one. Still\neven as it is, there are of course a few things to be considered\n(timeline-wise) and even I could see and smile about a few nods to\nthings/nods to future happenings.<br><br>It has be said, that this is a stand-alone and has not that much to do\nwith the other X-Men movies. But since I am not that aware of the\ncomics I can only compare it to the other movies. And this is\ndefinitely a very good entry into the series (and ties can still be\nfound, with one particular cameo that was just really funny).<br><br>Apart from the coherent story and nice build up (even if you can see\nwhere it is going and you probably will), the other thing that makes\nthis movie special, are the actors. Top notch casting with some\nheavyweight actors put into the mix. Highly recommended, even if you're\nnot that much into comic movies ...\n"
"\nAt first i thought these movie would fail.. because u know in past few\nyears all the movie which has 4 sequel on it equals total failure.. but\nnot this movie.. this movie has successfully captivated the whole new\nlevel in the X-Men's movie franchise.. after first 2 X-Men movie which\ni could say quite good, the third X-Men: The Last Stand it just so-so\nand flat. so, when i heard they wanna make the 4th sequel of this\nmovie, the first thing that came to my mind: \" well it can be good or\ncan be so-so\" but surprisingly, Director Matthew Vaughn did a great job\nin this movie. this movie it kind a \"back to their roots\" by simply\neasy to understand story, but not a cheesy and boring one (because\nagain in this movie we watched the prequel) and most of all the story\nis very originally from The X-Men's Comic.. so as u could may guess it\nwould make all the X-Men's fans happy.. the standout point in this film\nis an intense action, the great plot and the good act from all the\nactors especially Michael \"Magneto Fassbender which can make sir Ian\nMckellen losing his magnetic power again.. :)\n"
"\nI really wanted to like the movie, as I very much like the franchise so\nfar, but it just did not do it for me. To me it felt like seeing an\nheavily edited version of a film, cut from a 6 hour version. Like we\nwere only shown some highlights here and there, before taking us to the\nfinal scene with the submarine. I liked what I saw, but I felt like\nthere was a lot missing to make the movie \"complete\", in lack of a\nbetter word. It seemed to me that they had the script for a mini\nseries, but had to cut the script to fit a 2 hour movie, so they had to\nleave out the little things that tied the story together. I could\nreally wish for an extended cut of the movie, clocking 3,5 - 4 hours.\nThat would probably make it more interesting to me.\n"
"\nOK, I liked the first X-Men movie of Bryan Singer. But the X-3 and the\nX-Men Origins:Wolverine was bad. So I was hoping for a decent movie\nthis time and it delivers.<br><br>The story is simple. You get to know Charles Xavier and Erik Lensherr\nrelationship since they know each other and the story of what causes\nthe eternal fight of Mutants against Mutants.<br><br>James McAvoy is a magnificent Xavier and Michael Fassbender is a\nawesome Magneto. They scenes are the best of the movie. The rest of the\nactors are good. Nicholas Hoult, Rose Byrne and Jennifer Lawrence gives\ngood acting.<br><br>It has some flaws in the date accuracy and if this movie is a prequel\nfor the other 3 x-men movies it has some flaws.<br><br>Overall, It works, is great and make you forget Brett Ratner movies.\n"
"\nI would give this movie a 10/10 if it would've had some more action, it\nhad a good amount of action, but not enough for me, i need a lot of\naction, and you may disagree, but i thought it needed just a little\nmore.<br><br>Other than that everything about it was great, great story, great cast,\nand the action it had was great.<br><br>Even i loved it! And the only other X-Men movies i have seen is X2,\nwhich was good, and X-Men Origins Woverine, that i thought was AWESOME.<br><br>But that proves that people who aren't fans of the series and people\nwho are fans of the series will love it!<br><br>I thought it was great and i sure hope that you do too.\n"
"\nHonesty, After reading negative comments in the forums, I had to right\na review.<br><br>This was really fun to watch !! Even my wife who isn't an X-men or\nAmerican comic fan loved it. I had two old ladies sitting next to me\nsmiling at the end of it.<br><br>The characters were perfect - especially Xavier and Magneto. I just\nwish that they <br><br>Spoiler down below !!<br><br>left Charles walking for another movie or so<br><br>But The way that it happened was really good - I think I cried out - OH\nno !!<br><br>It didn't bomb - Its was great !!<br><br>I'd like to thank the film makers and the actors for pulling this off !\nIt was a great birthday present<br><br>Looking forward to seeing No 2\n"
"\nI admit I enjoyed it, but there were a few pretty major problems.\nMainly casting, ineffective storytelling plus it didn't add up with the\nother films. For example, why didn't they just cast Kevin Bacon as the\nNazi soldier in the beginning? The two actors looked nothing alike. The\nfilm didn't explain itself clear enough either. Now I realise it's a\n're-boot' not a prequel. But that's just plain ol' lazy. Overall, it\nwas pretty damn entertaining and impressive visually. I really liked\nJames McAvoy and Michael Fassbender's performance. But I don't\nunderstand why Charles had an English accent when born and raised in\nAmerica?\n"
"\nThere was no better way to bring about the evolution of each character\nin X Men.. Credit goes to James and Michael (aka Charles/Erik).. these\ntwo are really a driving force for the entire movie. Besides this Kevin\nas Shaw, Rose as the Cia agent and Raven as Mystique were splendid..\none thing that stands out in this movie is the way they actually\nbrought about the birth of each character and you can then relate it to\nthe X men sequels seen in the past.. the first half of the movie is\ncharacter heavy and focuses more on the script. You are then geared up\nfor the action in the second half...yes i was hoping for a lot more\naction and fight sequences but that nevertheless it did not change my\nviews about the film. Overall i feel the film deserves a 7 or 7.5.. but\nplease don't walk in the cinema expecting the film to be a classic or a\nblockbuster and you will enjoy the film better!!!!\n"
"\na very entertaining film. from start to finish, everything just moves\nsmoothly. this is what i call tight writing in a script. every scene\njust has it's up, down, and perfect transition into the next scene. at\nno point in the movie will your mind be wandering or your attention\nwane. the movie grips you from start to finish. yeah, it has its\nclichés, and tired messages due to the material being used. but really,\nif you're just out wanting to have a good, rolickin' time, then i\nsuggest you watch this movie in a theatre together with your S.O. or\nyour entire family. after the atrociousness that is Wolverine, the\nX-men franchise just got saved by James McAvoy and crew. now, if only\nthey can do even better for the upcoming Gambit spin-off. that film can\nreally use Nolan's genius.\n"
"\nWell,I've just come home from watching X-Men:First Class and to be\ncompletely honest,i'm a very happy man .The film is very impressive\n.The lives of Charles Xavier and Magneto have been perfectly portrayed\nby James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender .The story of the movie is like\na novel .From the impressive beginning in the Nazi concentration camps\nto the superb end showing the birth of the evil side of Magneto is\namazing .I'm sure all the viewers had wondered how the great Professor\nCharles Xavier had ended up in his wheelchair .Well,the answer is a big\nsurprise and its a real treat for the entire audience .You're going to\nhave to watch the movie for it !!!<br><br>The director has proved that even without Wolverine{excluding one\nscene} the series can be a big success .The performance of the entire\ncast is splendid .A must watch for one and all .\n"
"\nI am not an X-man aficionado but the best thing about quality movies is\nyou don't have to be an expert on the subject matter to appreciate the\nquality product being served. This movie was well-done. Good acting.\nInteresting storyline. Great action. I liked that the movie mixed both\nnew and familiar faces. Overall, I think the concept of people with\nsuperhuman powers trying to find their identity neat and intriguing. In\nthis vein, I also think the \"be proud of who you are\" lesson is a good\none for a young audience.<br><br>On the flip side, I will say that I found the movie to be quite violent\nie someone's hand being stabbed, and I wondered how appropriate some of\nthe violence would be for kids, the core audience of the X-men\nfranchise. Another thing I thought was a little too cliché was the\nBlack superhuman being the first to go. That was kind-of cheesy. But\nthese were only minor gripes. Overall, this film is well worth checking\nout.<br><br>8/10\n"
"\nPrequels always do the wonder and do not have the risks of jinxing. So\nmuch that this film marks a reboot rather than the story-telling.<br><br>The cast is superb, though some characters failed to impress. Their\nperformances are good, too. But, the CGI &amp; VFX &amp; the story are what\nwill send your heart racing because everything gels if you've watched\nthe sequel trilogy. One thing still baffles me about Prof. X, maybe\nthey'l clarify it in 2014.<br><br>But, the amount of eagerness that got occupied in my heart during the\nwatch can hardly tell the degree of entertainment it delivered. Hence,\nwith a wonderful music backing a strong screenplay, this is a sure\n8.1/10.<br><br>BOTTOM LINE: Highly Recommended for both followers &amp; newbies.<br><br>Can be watched with a typical Indian family? YES<br><br>Profanity: No | Nudity: Mild | Sex/Porn: No | Foreplay/Mouth-Kiss: Mild\n| Violence: Critical | Gore: Mediocre | Alcohol/Smoking: No | Drugs:\nMild\n"
"\nJust saw this flick and I have to agree with those people postulating\nthat it is one of the best X-men movies - if not THE best. <br><br>It has everything your heart desires: a pretty good story, good action,\nand gorgeous actresses (January Jones for starters!). There is nothing\nin the movie you haven't seen before and here I am referring entirely\nto the action and plot. But I very much liked the fact that the story\nreaches its climax in the Cuban missile crisis showdown; the historical\nreference adds an extra dimension to the film.<br><br>As a total fan boy of the comic it made my heart jump when Sebastian\nShaw and Emma Frost entered the picture. It felt like coming home. <br><br>I also have to mention James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender. But enough\nof that for now - watch the movie and keep an eye on the female cast.\n"
"\nI loved this movie! X-men movies as of late have not been the best, but\nI saw this one and within the first 45 minutes knew that this movie was\na step in the right direction. Its no secret to those who know me of my\nlove for Mystique and Magneto, so to have two amazing actors breath\nlife into my favourite duo was an amazing affirmation from the movie\ntelling me the franchise was in more than good hands. I will go on the\nrecord and say Wolverine is the most overrated X-men in my opinion, and\nrevelled in the fact that he was not the primary focus in this film.\nThe movie lends itself very well to a 60's vibe, and the story is an\norigins story of how Xavier and co created the xmen. Watching the film\nunravel, you realize that Matthew Vaughn the director understands that\naction itself is not enough, that to create characters you really care\nfor stands as the proper motivation for gluing you to the screen. I\nreally cared for all of the characters, and the payoff was the best\nxmen movie so far! Xcellent film :P\n"
"\nI'm a huge x-men and all things comic book fan but the recent trend in\nthe movie industry is to put out butchered comic book movies just to\nmake the big bucks. The x-men series, the hulk and even the batman and\nremake of superman movies attest to that. They all sucked, why you may\nask, well crappy story lines that deviate from the originals, bad\nacting, and shitty cgi action scenes. These movies just seem to kid\noriented which is good for the people collecting the paychecks (bigger\ndemographic = bigger payday) but sucks for true more mature fans who\ncovet a more sophisticated and grittier cinematic presentation. Dark\nKnight was a god send and a true testament to how every adaptation of a\nonce thought \"kid\" genre can make big waves on the big screen. Dark\nKnight set the bar high and is now what we as fans expect to see every\ntime our comic book heroes cross over to a full length live action\nmovie.
