i wish i could recall the last two hours of my life
i really thought this movie would be fun  not good mind you  but fun
a remake of an old classic with an even bigger budget better actors and todays special effects would be worth 8 bucks
plus jessica biel is sexy as hell
i was rewarded for my rare optimism by poor acting seriously the robots were more engaging clicha dialogue at one point the villain actually said darkly go handle it to his henchman and unpredictable plotturns the audience was kept guessing what the hell was going on
and these were all carefully scripted for the sole purpose of getting to the next action sequence  none of which had anything to do with the original movie
the only callback to the original title was the appearance tripletitted hooker
no need to explain how the hell a regular human came to have these mammoth milkmonsters because there are three of them
i should have walked out after they made their fivesecond cameo
i would have been happier
okay a few years ago i rewatched the arnold schwarzeneggerpaul verhoeven version of total recall and gave it 10 stars
so i just now watched the colin farrellkate beckinsalejessica biel version and while i still prefer the previous version this one wasnt so bad either
i mean there are hardly any oneliners that arnold did like that divorce line he gave to sharon stone then but there is still that dangerous edge that the original had that made this a worthy remake to watch
and the ending also provided a different twist than that of the original so that was also a good thing for me
so to make comparisons i still prefer the arnold version but this total recall gets a recommendation from me as well
i have seen the original movie countless times growing up this remake does it great justice
the cast fit well the acting was great and the action and directing of this movie was brilliant
until the very end of which was not the greatest end of movie battle
besides that it was well constructed and if you had seen the original it definitely misleads you to think you know what is going to happen but you dont
it was really well designed to correlate with the original but maintaining its own story line without letting the lines get too crossed
in order to replicate an old classic and maintaining a fresh new story would not be easy
1010 from me
it is a patchwork of movies you have seen before
it has a bourne character whos traveling in floating cars from the fifth element while being chased by an uglier version of robots from irobot
its embarrassing  a futuristic movie where a bad guy wants to replace oppressed workers with robots and thus emerges the resistance oh boy where have i seen this before
memory loss or memory replacement if you want lots of gunfire an individual evading every possible attempt to catch him
did i mention bourne
an inferior version though
while the bourne series and the terminator had a sense of large spaces and time total recall 2012 was filmed almost entirely in buildings and tight spaces  yes its cheaply made
the visual are out of this world
literally
i would be surprised if this movie gets snubbed on set design
whomever was responsible deserves a parade in his name
for the pure viewing of the sets its top notch
no doubt about that
however this movie lacks in story and acting
im still left wondering what the whole purpose was for the takeover
why wait
also travellingthrough the planet should take a little longer than a 20 minute ride
the original was much better in soooo many ways
the main story was about quaid not knowing if his world is a dream or a reality was the whole enchilada
this new version completely missed on making that impact
that was really the key
this 2012 version almost brushed right by that
still
the visual are so awesome that i couldnt give it less than a 7
never went to see it in the cinema though i regret that now
i had bitter thoughts on how it would turn out considering the original was one of the best action scifi films of its time
that said give this a chance and i am sure you will like it
what annoys me is the harmful comments left by many on their thoughts of this film very unjust
yes of course we are entitled to our own opinion its not just a remake i believe it can be a new title in its own right
with fantastic special effects great design the future was well thought out good actingi had never rated beckinsale that much before not a bad script considering what hollywood pumps out each year
the film flew by and anyone that worked on this film did a good job
lose yourself for a good couple of hours and when a part of old recall shows its self it should put a smile on your face
the tear replaced the sweat was even appreciated
i just came back from watching this awful movie and let me just say it was a total waste of time and and insult to the original
no story line and for god sake adding a touch of australia when referring to downunder as a colony would have been a little respectful to the country
the colony felt like hongkong
well what can be expected from some american director who made such hideously mind numbing movie
also i think it was made for kate beckinsale by her husband as in not one scene did she look unattractive despite of the grotesquely never ending action scenes and jessica biel looks not so attractive in most of the scenes
sorry for venting as this movie gave me a massive headache
this is the best scifi movie i have seen in decades
i was blown away by the visuals new interpretation of the plot and brilliant sound score
an amazing movie experience
my brain could scarcely keep up with what my eyes were seeing it was that good
the visuals were on a scale and level of realism that i have not seen in any other scifi movie
the result complete transportation into a dark and complex future
like all great classics the chemistry between the main characters colin jessica amp kate was palpable
im pleased to see these three talented actors take their place in cinema history with this classic film
in this poorly conceived dystopian future that is trying to look like a poormans bastard offspring of minority report interbred with bladerunner failing on both counts to improve on the originals
the veneer of the film look like it was made for tv
paying homage to the original by badly rehashing all the best scenes
i mean cummon in a futuristic world where liftselevators move like something out of the cube they still have a little hatch in the top
poor very poor
some might have thought arnie was too big a character in the original but he pulled it off a whole lot better than this and it has aged gracefully
it didnt need remaking maybe the director crew and cast knew this deep down and their heart just wasnt in it
i did knew this movie is not the same as the original one
though this movie is similar to the original one it would been better if they just used some of the concept and made totally different unrecognizable storyline
this movies storyline is in between the old one and their innovative ideas hence it is like a half remake
it cannot satisfy neither those expecting an extension or an upgrade of the old movie nor the people who would take it as a whole new movie
the negative part of the action sequences is it is tooooo rapid the positive side it is different i would say a new style
it would have been better if they made a half way slow motion
the visuals are fantastic them again this movie also has a higher potential if they tried 3d
there is lot of flaws but it is still a good movie
this film is so boring that my mom left for soap opera while we were watching together
she havent watched the original paul verhoevens film but i have
and i found the plot so predictable that i could even watch it with my eyes closed
thats when i learned that the mood music is absurd and the dialogues are idiotic
all the other aspects of the film are similarly inadequate including acting directing and the fall which endeavours to break all laws of the physics
cgi and background settings are worth a star but you dont surprise anyone with cgi nowadays
although i have managed to sit till the end it wasnt really worth the effort
rewatching the original with arnie is a much better idea
this film gives the same aura as blade runner without harrison ford who as a young man was superb in it
it is a remake of the original 1990 version of total recall with arnold schwarzenegger
i actually stay away from futuristic scifi and horror movies and do not see the need for remakes of these
however colleen farrell is very charismatic with a wonderful screen presence
yet my rule is dont watch these type movies before going to bed
so i am watching it now at 930 am on a very snowy day
i dont particularly enjoy fear and the feeling of helplessness
young people who have not experienced a sense of wartime fear probably crave the excitement of these frightening specialeffectloaded films which make one wonder how anyone is still alive and featuring their current idols such as teenchoice award winner 2004 colleen farrell but he is a very good actor and grows on oldies too
the previews didnt impress me at all so i avoided this in the theaters
on a recent cross country flight this movie was available as a choice so what the hell
the first thing you immediately notice is that colin farrell is hardly a half an arnold
the first movie had an awesome mars setting interesting characters and was a lot of fun
this movie has none of that
the first movie had actual villains to root against
this movie has you looking at your watch
watered down is an understatement when comparing movies
had i not seen the way more memorable 1990 movie i may have rated this slightly higher
maybe
this version is 100 forgettable
watch the original or anything else instead of this dud
maybe the studio thought by just having good looking actors in this movie they hoped to make money
it was hard to follow and moved way too fast
it had too much cg
i like the action but the gun play is much too unrealistic and maybe there should have been much less of it
the movie industry uses guns like they are making a cartoon and that is not the way the real world works
they needed to get there act together on having too much gun play as that is not as the world is and is less likely in the future
i did like the robots but the character development was much too poor
i did like the way that the cars were realistic as the future will have these type of cars
i did not see this movie at the theater and am glad i just bought the dvd instead
it was less entertaining than the earlier version of total recall
i never saw the original total recall i had heard it was a good movie and when i see the trailer for the new one it looked good the story is basically a guy who goes to recall and something goes wrong and we find out hes a spy this part of the movie is fine the rest is just a cgi party and it seems like the whole movie is two people being chased overall its an okay movie with some nice action but i was hoping for more from this film
oh and if you are going to see this film and you have seen the original it is not the same there is no mars just the united federation of britain and australia
and the other thing that is worth a mention kate beckinsale performance is one of the highlights of the movie
absolutely terrible
no story nothing but mere effects
has nothing to do with the original movie by shwartz
taking out few effects from the original doesnt make this weckkk any worth
what the
worthlessssss
i dont know english enough to fill the required 10 lines with swear
sorry guys
i spent money for this s
t
for nothing
so bad
so ugly
how dare hollywood actors subscribe to shooting such a rare piece of s
t
my wife almost fall asleep at the movie theater
why do i have to take this
i want my money back
we paid 20 bucks for this throwingout experience
thanks for nothing the producers the director the actors
oh
so awful
the director seems to have forgotten what made the original an original  a smarmy blend of scifi character development humor and an interesting plot
this new total recall has a wooden at best colin farrell with the wasted talents of ms
beals and beckinsale
the movie had great special effects but contextually were uninteresting
and yes this movie totally tried to ripoff blade runners visuals but without any of the intensity and true creepiness
i was bored most of the time
the plot was 1000 predictable and knowing the 1990 original just made each moment worse
why do directors fall in love with special effect antics
this same disease doomed star wars i and ii
is cgi that much cheaper than good acting
avoid
a total waste of money compared to the original with arnie
the red herrings the original two weeks exploding head decoy and the one and only mutant girl three boobs who looked completely out of place  were just cameos copied from the original in an attempt to placate those of us who loved that version
it didnt
there was no mars no mutants just blank expressions car chases and fights in a wet cluttered set
the chosen story line was very confusing and unclear and i was continually waiting for something interesting to happen
at least the original version was filmed in good lighting clear to watch with a real futuristic extraplanetary scifi tone to it
this remade rubbish looked like storm trooper meets blade runner but with even more rain
if you must do remakes instead of using imagination to create something new then at least do a good job of it
this version grossed millions at box office but i bet few will want to see it twice
the original is still fun to watch a dozen times over  the remake wont be
very disappointed
this is a great movie
i personally have not seen the original total recall movie thus have nothing to compare it to
even so it should be seen as a separate movie
i thought this movie has amazing graphics that literally blew my mind
there was a very original story line and depth to the characters
though one of the characters was quite annoying i felt the movie still deserved a ten
a must see in my book
like i said i dont understand how someone could give this movie such a low rating
if you like scifi or apocalyptic genres then make sure you watch
also as a video game lover i felt as though it had a very video game feel to it which made it all the more enjoyable
first of all i have to give kate beckinsale kudos for being a really great villain
she meets and exceeds sharon stones bad wife
she is just relentless and so sharply homicidal you cannot fault her character for not trying to kill her husband
the same cannot be said for colin farrell
his performance seems lethargic at best liked someone dosed his script with quaaludes
one of the things i like about the original was the humor
they really played the first one as a colorful circus and it was entertaining
except for one shining moment this film has almost no humor
i know that it more exactly matches the p
k
dick story but common give us some one liners
one thing that i will not fault is the special effects
they are excellent from beginning to end
if i only went to see special effects i would give this movie a 10
i was a little disappointed and i think they could have done a lot more
the original total recall is one of my favorite movies
thats why i give this movie a straight 1 out of 10
why so harsh
well the movie has a lot of great effects and action scenes  beautiful and capable actors and a great story
thats why i think it could have been so much more
the whole time i thought im watching a bad copy of i robot with colin farrel replacing will smith  some of the main elements like cars and robots looked too much alike
i think the creators of this movie could have made so much more out of this movie but instead the only thing they made better was the 3 boobs
sorry but that was the greatest disappointment of the year for me
how can they waste all that money on something this bad
grey and brown sets with a blade runner complex
no story just a lot of running around
and then more running around
the former wife just shows up everywhere
yes i know that logic dont apply on this kind of films but some realism is to be expected otherwise it becomes silly
and the acting well its all right but without any memorably appearances
the original with arnie and stone are way better
more good looking more interesting better directed and with some humor and human touch involved
avoid this and see the first one instead
youll be glad you did
well
will all the crybabies please go home
so many ridiculous rants about this movie being different than the original
shut the hl up
its a new film for a new audience
i never saw the original and i really enjoyed this movie
great action lots of scifi built in and enough intrigue to make you want to rewind and look at it again
the leads are awesome and do a great job
good blade runner vibe
i saw it twice about a year apart and im ready to see it again  and i consider myself picky about movies
again  dont let the naysayers with all the exaggeration fool you worst movie ever
i think youll enjoy this if you like the trailer
pathetic attempt at pulling this movie off and getting away with it
im amazed the actors signed up for this movie as there are some well known faces
a lot of scenes are total rip offs of the original movie and so blatantly so and not executed correctly which made it smell of pure cheese and my mind was made up very quickly that it was a cheap rehash which was destined to fail because it was a copy cat of the original which everyone will obviously compare it too
its certain death to do a low quality budget film and expect to get the peoples opinions on your side
makes me wonder if the director of the film even cares about the reviews and is just after a quick buck
bring back quality movies again and lets stop the misery
this movie couldnt possibly be better than the original total recall
seriously
does everything has to have a sequel
this 2012 version didnt live up to its hype but i am not surprised as most sequels or reboots are sub par to their original counterparts
there are exceptions like terminator 1 and 2
back to total recall 2012
the movie was boring
theatre was half empty
nothing else to say about it
not memorable like the first one with arnold
the cgi nowadays is the main focus rather than plot and originality unfortunately
not sure what else to say
it didnt live up to expectations
they should at least renamed it differently
before watching this i had not seen the original so i can not compare
however this movie as a standalone film was a good watch
colin farrell performed very well and so did a few others however that can not be said for all
the story was interesting and seemed easy to read from the start but i soon began to doubt my own predictions for the plot
one thing that i did not like about this film is it seemed to borrow scenes and ideas from other films which really were too obvious and unoriginal
this film did have good cgi and action and brought in some interesting views of the future
i would say this is a good standalone action film which is a good watch if you want to see a bit of futuristic action
only habitable environments left to mankind being the british isles space stations space craft and some place referred to as the colony
who to blame for such a unbelievably stupid plot i guess the producer directors screen writers and the science consultants they consulted with
the united kingdom would have been every bit as contaminated by the chemical warfare as every place else
as always those imbeciles that were responsible for the average rate being somewhere between 6 and 7 have no knowledge of what true cinematographic art is and only bestowed such a high rating to the movie because of the special effects same type of people that stupidly made j
j
abrams version of star trek so popular
49 a largely straitforward remake of a scifi 80s classic that swaps the hardedged dark comicbook sense of humour and violence for action action and more action
this really isnt a bad film and despise featuring a tunnel that goes all the way through the planet its just so very ordinary and forgettable
colin farrell is better than most could have been but unlike his stuntman hes given very little to work with here
his support is fine even if theyre given even less to do than even mr farrell
as a remake this fails to better the arnie hit but as a decent little timepasser that for the most part will mildly entertain throughout and for that reason alone this gets a half decent recommendation from me
if you havent seen the original dont watch this one
if you have seen the original dont watch this one
if you havent seen any scifi movie before watch blade runner or the original total recall
this version has some pretty nice action scenes some famous actors and copies all the nice ideas from the original only to change the funniest smartest scenes from the original
id give it to the creator that it is not very easy to copy a classic like the original one and i even get the idea of trying to copy it because it has been a while since the original has been aired and so younger audience might not know the title but id prefer it if this attempt was anything but boring monotone and very slow in the way the story evolves
assuming that the production cost are about 125  i must admit i think i know about 125 things how to invest this money otherwise
the only reason why i give it two stars and not one is because jessica biel has a sweet body and looks good
there really is not more to say about this movie
im just glad i saw it today on free tv and have saved myself the money to watch it at the theatre 2 years ago

as far as remakes of great movies go it could be worse
it doesnt match the style and creativity of the original film from paul verhoeven
this remake is made by len wiseman the guy behind the underworld movies and live free or die hard
wiseman is not a director i have a great deal of respect for
he believes in throwing as much cgi as possible at the screen with little concern for things like character and story
im also not a fan of his visual style which usually means everything that isnt black is saturated in blue
some of this is because of his cgi obsession
so i have my issues with len wiseman
that being said i have enjoyed some of his movies and i did enjoy this one
while there isnt much about this version thats particularly memorable it is a perfectly watchable scifi action thriller
the acting writing directing and special effects are all adequate
kate beckinsale is the best part
this doesnt compare to the original movie which was a fun thrilling and sometimes wonderfully cheesy masterpiece
but you wont hate it like many crappy remakes
i decided to watch this because i recently saw the original on television just awhile back so it was fresh in my memory
no pun intended
this was a solid action film with scifi elements but i really dont understand why they bothered with the thin layering of total recall over what could otherwise have been a new setting
there was really no need to slap the label on this except for extra press but i can guarantee the same people would have gone to see it had it been called fallen star or something equally different
as a scifi movie it had all the bells and whistles but im getting tired of scifi that doesnt reach very far doesnt try to posit the idea of a world beyond our own
earthbound dystopias are the product of writers who cant fathom that things in the future wont just be the way they are now only flashier
if you went in to see this movie expecting a remake of the arnlod movie then you will be disappointed
however if you wanted to watch an awesome scifi movie with a believable story line  then you are watching a good movie
the movie has been panned by critics who have preconceived notions based on the original movie
the cgi is topclass and the story is more believable than the aliens on mars storyline in the original movie
this movie charts its own path and  id give it a 10 if the story action didnt include so many lives for farrell
cohagen mustve have at least 15 chances to get rid of farrell but he somehow wastes them all only to give farrell one chance which he takes
i seriously think that a remake should be more wellmade
everything was so clichad and intentionally followed a pilot to keep the characters busy throughout the movie
things just followed to each other so well that it was hard to take the movie seriously
i thought the movie would have a deeper story line considering that it is a remake but no the whole movie was about chasing and adrenaline
in addition unrealistic moments regularly appeared each 10 minutes or so making the movie worse
effects and fight scenes were not that good only enough to satisfy easy audience
i dont even know if this movie even deserves a 5 at least some actions were cool unoriginali guess and unpredictable because of its unrealistic and forced pilot
not as good as the original
pg13 means you as a film maker are a coward
r equals balls the 87 total recall is and awesome mindless parade of violence and goofy effects it has nothing to do with philip k
dick but in no way should that be a slight to the writer
the original total recall was a vehicle movie for arnold schwarzenegger and made no pretense as to be anything else
while this movie pretends to be closer to the source material left by philip k
dick its in reality merely a vehicle for computer generated effects
its a bunch of programmers saying look what we can do with computers
film is film if lit well it looks as real as life so far no computer generated image has come close to looking like real stuff
hey when used sparingly when used delicately computer generated images work they add to the illusion of film when used as the majority of the movies images it looks fake
also gun violence and gore kick ass
