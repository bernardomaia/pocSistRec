"\nI was really excited to see this movie when I saw the trailer, because\nI thought it looked hilarious, and I'm a huge fan of Jason Sudeikis and\nI absolutely adore Jennifer Aniston, and I can guarantee that it does\nnot disappoint. It was actually better than I was expecting it to be,\nbecause you don't usually expect much from drug dealing comedies. The\nplot in this was actually pretty clever, and to be honest Will\nPoulter's character Kenny really makes the entire movie. He played it\nso well, and he was perfectly awkward and strange, it was hilarious. It\nwas definitely one of the best comedies I've seen in a while. Sure it\ndid have some corny moments that are unrealistic, but I overall enjoyed\nthe movie.\n"
"\nI have to admit I didn't expect to like this movie as much as I did. I\nlaughed during the whole movie and truly didn't notice how did the time\npass by. For me this is the best American comedy I've seen in the past\ncouple of years. Very well directed, very good cast. The movie is very\ncasual but at the same time so full of content. I can't come up with\nany flaws in it. It was not gooey like you would normally expect.\nJennifer Aniston was just marvelous as always. I also liked Will\nPoulter very well. <br><br>I recommend the film to everyone, not only comedy lovers (I'm surely\nnot one of those).\n"
"\nWent to hate it, left loving it. Great funny \"real\" movie. Starts and\nends like everyone movie, you know it from the beginning, but the\nlaughs and the experiences this gang faces is well don. Not over the\ntop , just laughs and a somewhat sentimental story. Not sure why all\nthe bad reviews, went in with an opened mind and walked Out laughing\nand talking with friends about how much we enjoyed it. I encourage\nanyone in the edge to go catch this film. Good for Jen and good for\nJason, more daughter and this would be great. Kenny almost stole the\nshow... Man has no heart finds family and gains one. Worth watching Do\nit!\n"
"\nWe're the Millers is going to make you laugh. The movie is more\nhilarious than you would think. You will be surprise how creative some\nof those \"stupid\", funny and ridiculous scenes are. The girls are doing\na great job. Emma Roberts as an angry teen with a big mouth and\nJennifer Aniston as a sexy stripper with mother instincts. Loved the\nstripper scenes with Jennifer who looks as hot as ever. Kenny (Will\nPoulter)is just so perfect for the part of virgin, sweet teenage guy\nand of course Jason Sudeikis as David - the drug dealer - is the one\nand only who can pull that character as good as he did. The Millers are\njust the perfect \"family\". They picked just the right people for this\ncomedy. You can expect dirty, funny, sexy, ridiculous! Just go and see\nit so you can have a good summer laugh!\n"
"\nIts supposed to be a funny summer movie and it is. It delivers laugh\nout loud jokes with lots of sexual undertones and overtones. The story-\nline is set up for an off beat road movie; pick up a smidge of Mary\nJane South of the border, down Mexico way and return it to Denver to\npay off a debt to the drug dealer. Jason Sedakis is the drug dealer. He\nassembles a unlikely cast of characters as an ersatz family and off\nthey go to Mexico. Jennifer Anniston plays a stripper, recruited to be\nthe mom, and of course, she ends up in various situations wearing\nskimpy costumes and making penis jokes. What more could you possibly\nwant?The other family members are a nerdy boy and a homeless girl. Both\nof them are hilarious for different reasons, the nebbish kid is\nsincere, honest and of course a willing dupe for all of the drug\ndealers schemes. Tension is added to the film by the appearance of a\ndrug dealer who has been tricked into allowing his product to be sold\nto the wrong dealer and a DEA Agent and family that the Millers happen\nto befriend.\n"
"\nI came into this movie expecting not-too-good things about it, and\nmight I say I was surprised. It involves a drug smuggler who has to run\na job across the Mexican border for a dealer. Knowing he'd look\nsuspicious by himself, he puts together a makeshift \"family\" with three\npeople he's familiar with:his stripper neighbor, a teenage girl\nrunaway, and a horny teenage boy. They fly to Arizona and rent an RV.\nHilarious complications ensue. Despite their characters and\npredicaments, they are shown to think fast on their feet with the bad\nguys sometimes, and the bad guys manage to track them down after they\nget the drugs, and some DEA agents find them and wind up accompanying\nthem on their trip.<br><br>90s songs and allusions pop up during this movie. It was fairly funny\nfrom start to finish, and the main cast works well together. I think\nthis was a great idea for a movie! *** out of ****\n"
"\nNormally I stay away from drug related films, as I don't understand it\nall too much. But seeing as the film had Jason Sudeikis and Jennifer\nAniston in, I thought I'd give it ago. I was surprised to say the\nleast, and impressed because it wasn't what I thought. Will Poulter\ncreated a perfect socially awkward Kenny Miller and Jason Sudeikis\nreally kicked it up a gear. I found it hilarious from start to finish,\nas the plot unveiled the storyline became clearer. It was honestly a\ngreat movie, and I found myself laughing 85% of the time, with a great\ncast but simple enough storyline, the film delivered on many levels.\nMust see movie, even if you just watch Jennifer Aniston.\n"
"\nThis movie had a lot of very great actors and actresses who is so funny\nI almost laughed my a*s off #SPOILERALERT I personally think the\nfunniest moment was in the wan when they listened to \"waterfalls\" and\nKenny (\"Will Poutler\") rap along with the music #SPOILEROVER. This\nmovie is defiantly one I can watch again and again. Take my advice and\nwatch it if you haven't already watched it. \"Jennifer Aniston\" showed\nsome really great and funny acting with the whole (maybe #SPOILERALERT)\nstriper thing (#SPOILEROVER) and the whole concept of the movie is just\nplane genius the way it takes all these different kind off problems and\njust stack them on top of each other is awesome. This movie is kind of\nin that category that can't be said or written with words you know\n(hopefully). I think that this movie is something you shouldn't live\nwithout haven't seen (Hope i'm not being to dramatic) so see it. Have A\nGood Time Watching This Movie Says Ida&lt;3.\n"
"\nDefinitely a film which belongs under the must watch section. so funny\nhad me in stitches its witty,clever, funny, excitable. if you love\ncomedy films then this is just the film for you. A well matched /\nunmatched family forced to do something to keep their heads a float.\nGreat name for a great film. Seen this so many times now.Just cant stop\nwatching it. It has just become one of my favourite films of all time.\nPerfect for any audience over the age of say 15 due to the drug nature\nin this film. anything with Jennifer Aniston is worth a watch in my\neyes even if it was rubbish which it wasn't. 10 out of 10 from me. as\npreviously described 'so dumb yet so funny' i agree completely. you\nwill be surprised about how much you will laugh at this real film. its\na bit like real life in so many ways but so funnier.\n"
"\nThis movie was hilarious.. Me and my fiancé think it is a great family\nmovie especially if you like to smile and giggle a little bit. It has a\nweird twist to it but it is very funny. I think every one should watch\nthis movie. Give it a shot and watch it, It will definitely make you\ncackle. Hope you like it as much as we did. Me and my boyfriend look\nfor movies on IMDb.com that are rated but we both like romantic\ncomedies. So, The true love stories are my favorites. This movie is\nkind of a weird way to say you begin to love someone but it is totally\nworth the watch or at least that is what I would say. So, Don't wait a\nminute longer watch this movie and see what you think of it.\n"
"\nFour stars sounds right for this film, which I just saw last night. 1\nstar being 'unbearably bad and difficult to sit through', and 10 being\n'so good it changed my life', this movie was bearable to sit through,\nnot painfully bad, but well... predictable and brainless.<br><br>The good news, I saw it in the right frame of mind- not in the mood to\nthink. Cliché characters, unoriginal jokes, and predictable story\nnotwithstanding, the pull of the movie were the four main stars,\nespecially Jason Sudeikis. I haven't followed him in SNL but every\nother role I've seen of his: \"30 Rock\", \"Portlandia\", and a few other\nappearances here and there- the guy is funny and charismatic. I think\nJen Aniston is also good.<br><br>So whatever- I can't recommend it unless you're tired, drunk, stoned,\nor suffering from a severe brain injury; otherwise, you could do worse.<br><br>PS The \"bloopers\" at the end looked fake to me.\n"
"\nNo one will say this review helped them. I am absolutely astounded it\ngets as many stars and allocades as it does. \"Best comedy\"???? Please.\nThis gratuitous profanity ridden (No, I'm not offended; it's just not\nnecessary) piece of crap is not worth the bytes it takes to store.<br><br>Sure, you'll get some sophomoric laughs. Who wouldn't laugh if a nerdy\nkid got bitten by a spider so his right testicle swelled up to the size\nof a tennis ball, and he dropped his pants and showed everyone how\nlittle endowed he was. I mean, Hardy! Har! Har! That's just so funny!!!\nHurry and put it on YouTube cause it'll get a million hits! Ha ha ha ha\nha! Or how about the sex-starved housewife who actually (This was\nreally hard!) touched another woman's breasts! WOW! That is just so\nrisqué! Seriously, you thought this was a good movie? Really? Good\nLord.\n"
"\nFor all Jennifer Aniston fans out there, here is an amazing comedy\ndrama movie with a great storyline. The direction is amazing as it\ncharacter development is at a proper pace. A drug dealer makes a fake\nfamily to transfer drugs from Mexico all the way to his hometown. It is\none of those movies which make you feel delighted. For people who loved\nFRIENDS, there is a surprise at the end of movie. But do watch the\nwhole movie before jumping to the end. It is amazing to see that\nJennifer Aniston despite being over 45 is still amazingly gorgeous. It\nis one of her most popular movies and is one of those movies where she\nplays a leading role unlike Horrible Bosses.\n"
"\nAfter watching the trailers I thought it's just gonna be a forgettable,\ntry-hard and cliché movie. I never thought I'd watch it but my friends\nwere raving about it so I thought I'd give it a go.<br><br>Boy was I wrong! I LOVED it: it was fresh, engaging,sweet without being\nschmaltzy and genuinely funny. Often I was laughing out loud like at\nthe weed baby and Will Poulter rapping \"Waterfalls\". Jason Sudiekis,\nJenifer Aniston, Emma Roberts and Will Poulter all acted wonderfully\nand their chemistry was key in this movies awesomeness. I just loved\nthe warmth of the family bonding and the romance seemed natural and not\nforced. Don't listen to critics or trailers and watch this great movie\nto see what I mean!!\n"
"\nA film that sadly is typical of the American Pie genre, but about 10\nyears late to the table. The chemistry between the leads borders on\nmilk and lemons......Jennifer, with a great body on show for 44, is\nthere only for the eye candy. The Mexicans are again heavily\nstereotyped, which will do nothing for either country, but continue to\npropagate the problem. The sexual under and overtones do not add to the\nfilm in any way and it just grates on the teeth after a while.<br><br>I won't even go into the film content. Better dig out your copy of the\noriginal American pie or ANY other one of this genre, which I can\nassure you has been made infinitely better!\n"
"\nIf you've seen enough movies you know exactly how this is going to end\na few minutes in, so the fun is watching how they work the plot towards\nthat conclusion. <br><br>It's an enjoyable movie with humor that sometimes made me cringe and\nother times laugh out loud. Jason S. is typecast in this role, but he\nhas good screen chemistry with Jennifer A. The two kids play their\nroles well, the boy maybe too well. <br><br>If you like sexually charged humor, or want something to tune out with,\nI can recommend it. The biggest compliment I can give it is saying I\nhope they make a sequel.\n"
"\nWe're the Millers was a surprisingly fun and funny movie. Small time\npot dealer played by Jason Sudeikis is robbed of the money he owes to\nhis supplier, so to pay off the debt, the goofy and eccentric supplier\nsends him on a big time smuggling deal into Mexico. As cover, Sudeikis\nconvinces stripper/neighbor Rose (Jennifer Aniston) to pose as his\nwife, runaway Casey (Emma Roberts) as their daughter, and young\nneighbor Kenny (Will Poulter) as their son-- and together they become\nthe uber-American family, the Millers. Naturally, the situations and\npeople they run into going and returning ensure nothing goes according\nto plan. There were lots of chuckle-out-loud moments (not so many full\nblown belly laughs), and it moved along at a pretty fast clip. The\nperformances were all outstanding, especially Sudeikis. Loved watching\nhim! Parents: some sexually suggestive scenes won't be appropriate for\nkids, or you'll have some 'splainin to do. All in all, a real fun film.\n"
"\nAs far as comedies go this is certainly one of the best I've watched\nover the last few months. It is an interesting combination of\ncharacters which work really well together. You've got the drug dealer,\nthe geek, the stripper and the runaway (who in my opinion is more of a\nrebel than anything else).<br><br>The story itself isn't the strongest element of this movie, however in\nmy opinion Jason Sudeikis, Jennifer Aniston and Will Poulter all\ndeliver a really great performance.<br><br>As funny as Ed Helms is in 'The Hangover' I feel the script didn't\nreally allow for his character to emerge as much.<br><br>Overall I really enjoyed watching this movie and I recommend it to\nanyone looking for a good laugh.\n"
"\nI actually enjoyed this movie and being an Old Hollywood and 80s fan\nthis is saying a lot.<br><br>I was surprised to find it was actually a thought out story, most\ncomedies are just made for 'laughs' with absolutely no story line, but\nthis one actually has one and is GENUINELY laugh out loud hilarious.<br><br>Jennifer Aniston is always fun to watch and Jason Sudeikes is forever a\nriot and joy on screen. The kids in the movie were also great in their\nroles.<br><br>All in all.. all i have to say is WORTH IT WORTH IT WORTH IT. good\nlaugh out loud comedy<br><br>p.s ;) stay for the bloopers.\n"
"\nDepending on your sense of humour will depend on how much you enjoy\nthis film! Personally, I loved it! This very amusing comedy had me\nlaughing from the beginning all the way to the end! I noticed most\npeople in the reviews don't seem massively impressed as in some respect\nit is some what silly and dumb, I personally disagree with these\ncomments and would happily recommend this film to any of my friends!\nIts a great laugh. Must say better to watch with people who also find\nthing amusing as once one person gets going laughing it makes the whole\nthing more enjoyable!<br><br>Don't want to give anything away. All I'm going to say is go watch it!\nThe millers are a awesome family!<br><br>Awesome film, would happily watch it again!\n"
"\nThe comedic writing for this movie was weak to say the least, with a\nfew funny lines and then fillers. The movie was so jam packed with\nstupid clichés, the ditzy Mother who has lesbian fantasies, the DEA\nagent with the good heart, the kids who just want a normal family. All\ntired old junk used countless times before.<br><br>Jason Sudeikis is not a lead actor either. He has 2 facial expressions.\nJennifer Aniston once again proves what a useless unfunny actress she\nreally is. Her only redeeming quality is her body which is shown\ngratuitously. Neither of these two have enough screen presence to carry\na comedy. I was very disappointed, trailers are so deceiving.\n"
"\nI watched this movie on network TV and therefore experienced a lot of\nf-word bleeps and genitals blurred but it was still an enjoyable\nseveral hours.<br><br>Jason Sudeikis and Jennifer Aniston were hilarious as \"the parents\" and\nWill Poulter and Emma Roberts were spot-on as \"the children.\" Nick\nOfferman, Kathryn Hahn, and Molly Quinn are perfect as the Fitzgeralds.\nHollywood is always smart to get its casting just right and then let\nthe actors run with the parts - and that happens in this movie.<br><br>The premise is clever and calculated to keep you laughing from start to\nfinish. If you want a movie to enjoyably pass a few hours but don't\nwant to have to think too critically about character motivation and\nplot logistics, then you can't go wrong with \"We're the Millers.\"\n"
"\n'We're the Millers' has got to be one of the funniest and most\nentertaining films I've seen in a long time. It makes for a refreshing\nchange from the generic, politically correct garbage that is becoming\nincreasingly difficult to avoid. At last, a comedy film that takes\nrisks and doesn't go out of its way to avoid offending people.<br><br>Everything about this film is just plain silly. The plot is absurd, the\ncharacters are ridiculous, but it all contributes to a very funny,\nhighly entertaining movie. Jason Sudeikis puts in one of the funniest\nperformances I've seen from any actor in a comedy film. His facial\nexpressions alone are enough to crack you up.<br><br>I didn't like the look of this film when it came out, but it proved to\nbe a real hit. 'We're the Millers' is one of the funniest movies I've\nseen in a long time, and one I'm sure to revisit.\n"
"\nOK seriously, nobody would ever believe that Jennifer Aniston is a\nstripper. She is the most generic person ever and doesn't have a\nnatural bad-ass bone in her body. Thankfully for most of the movie she\nplays a Susie bakes a lot homemaker which suits her to a tee. Aside\nfrom her the casting is perfect and makes the movie. Will Poulter is\nespecially fantastic as Kenny the naive virgin son. He steals the scene\nregularly and adds some necessary morality.<br><br>I was incredibly impressed with how funny the movie really is. From the\ntrailer it looks like it might be a little lame but surprisingly it's\nlaugh out loud funny with a hint of perversion. There are definitely\nsome grossly disgusting to watch moments but they are done very well\nand only add value to the movie. Overall We're the Millers is a great\nfilm that delivers many laughs.\n"
"\nWhat can you say about a film that has Jennifer Aniston doning lingerie\nand showing off that magnificent body. Not only is she amazing her\ncomedic talent is down right raunchy and funny from the get go. The\nplot of this film is generic as it is drug deals gone wrong but the\ncomedic performances of Aniston, Sudekis, Poulter and Roberts just\nmakes the entire ensemble fascinating. I don't think I laughed that\nhard in quite awhile. Ed Helms brings a funny bad guy overture and the\nstoryline of running into other campers is just hilarious as the\ndialouge moves between them. If you want a comedic relief and a couple\nhours of non stop laughter then this is the film for you\n"
"\nDavid Burke (Jason Sudeikis) is a small-time pot dealer whose client\nincludes chefs and soccer moms, but no kids-after all, he has his\nscruples. So what could go wrong? Plenty. Preferring to keep a low\nprofile for obvious reasons, he learns the hard way that no good deed\ngoes unpunished when he tries to help out some local teens and winds up\ngetting jumped by a trio of gutter punks. Stealing his stash and his\ncash, they leave him in major debt to his supplier, Brad (Ed Helms). In\norder to wipe the slate clean-and maintain a clean bill of health-David\nmust now become a big-time drug smuggler by bringing Brad's latest\nshipment in from Mexico. Twisting the arms of his neighbors, cynical\nstripper Rose (Jennifer Aniston) and wannabe customer Kenny (Will\nPoulter), and the tatted-and-pierced streetwise teen Casey (Emma\nRoberts), he devises a foolproof plan. One fake wife, two pretend kids\nand a huge, shiny RV later, the \"Millers\" are headed south of the\nborder for a Fourth of July weekend that is sure to end with a bang.\n"
"\nThough let me make clear that I only did watch the version that was\nshown in cinemas. So no extended version as of yet for me. But even in\nthe cinemas, there were some very funny bits after the credits rolled\n(stay tuned for a ... tune, that will make you smile and maybe even\ncry, like one of the main characters here did).<br><br>The movie itself is really entertaining and funny, if you let yourself\nenjoy it. Some people didn't expect anything and were pleasantly\nsurprised, some expected too much and were disappointed. But even the\ncinema version might is not kid friendly. One kid that is onto drugs\nhas some of the funniest lines, just because they are so simple. You\nalso have Nick Offerman, who always is good when improvising. Good\ncomedy that might not always hit the spot, but has a great cast to\nsupport it all the way through\n"
"\nThis is a really good film and it is hilariously funny, plus i would\nlike to see a we're the millers 2.

"\nThis movie should win the Oscar for Best Picture. All the actors should\nwin leading and supporting actors and actresses Oscars. The director\nand producers should win their respective Oscars. The credits should\nwin some unspecified Oscar. Nick Offerman's mustache should win the\ncostume design Oscar. The RV should win the set design Oscar. Matthew\nWillig's One Eye and Will Poulter's spider-bitten junk should co-win\nthe make-up Oscar. If \"We're the Millers\" was Obamacare, its website\nwould work and the insurance offered would actually be affordable and\neveryone would have his or her own personal, resident physician, who\nwould administer medical marijuana peddled from the Millers' RV. Can't\nwait for the sequel, \"We Are Still the Millers.\" Did I mention that we\nliked the movie?\n"
"\nA story about a fake family made up of desperate people going to score\na deal. On the way, they meet obstacles then break up and of course\nmake up again. I expected a fun movie. I just didn't expect it to be as\ngood as it was.<br><br>It's funny, there are the requisite gags (but this particular gag is\nawesome funny), the few unexpected twists or surprises were totally\nwelcome. There are a few standout scenes - the kissing scene, the\nbitten-by-a-spider scene, and surprisingly, the sing/rap part was\nreally engaging.<br><br>The acting from the 4 main cast members are good, but personally, I\nfelt the standout actor was Will Poulter. I only knew him from Son of\nRambow and School of Comedy, so while I knew he played the dorky son, I\ndidn't expect him to play the character that well. He truly stole the\nlimelight from his more famous co-stars Jason Sudeikis, Jennifer\nAniston and Emma Roberts. Kudos to him.<br><br>Go watch this. It's not a family movie, but it makes for a great outing\nwith the buds or even an adventurous date.\n"
"\nI love Jen Aniston and her work, but what's happening to her career\nlately is a mystery to me. It is like a conspiracy to put her in the\nworst movies. I have seen bad TV movies that were better than this one.\nMy goodness, why did they even bother? The best word to describe it is\nridiculous. I don't even know where to start with the list of bad: foul\nlanguage galore, which these days some directors I guess think will\nmake their movies better and use it a lot, stupid dialog that will not\ninspire you but make you cringe, the characters are the scum of society\nwhich again these days directors seem to prefer to normal people and\ndedicate tons of movies to, stupid plot. What happened to the good old\nnormal people movies? There's plenty of drama among them too, enough\nfor thousands of movies. Hollywood, I am about to drop you. You are a\ncontinuous disappointment for me as of late.\n"
"\nNot funny at all. The language was so over the top and the double\nentendre's were not natural. I felt embarrassed for Jennifer Aniston\nand the script she had to follow. What ever happened to Movies like\n'Tootsie' and 'What about Bob.' Movies with great acting and a great\ncomedic script; scripts with not all the filth and language. Today's\nscripts are so riddled with bad language you can't even watch them with\nyour children. With people like Seth Rogen pumping out scripts that are\njust filthy and not clever is what Hollywood has become. I'm not saying\nsome language can be used but every other sentence just isn't funny to\nme. It takes no acting skills to mutter filthy language scripts. This\nwas a piece of crap and not funny at all!\n"
"\nI enjoyed watching this movie because it was so funny. It kept me\nlaughing from the beginning to the end. In my opinion all of the\ncharacters matched great. The plot of the story is crazy to think about\nand the characters made the plot even better. The characters fed off\neach other and seemed to make the film even more funny. I couldn't stop\nlaughing. This film was amazing and it was spread out perfectly, it\nmade it seem like the jokes never ended. The author made the comedy pop\nthe whole time and did a great job at making the characters match their\nlines. I would recommend this movie to everyone. I am hoping that they\nmake another movie similar to this one.\n"
"\nWe're the Millers is a comedy that is great to pass the time , I wanted\nto see this movie when it has launched , and I was pleased to see in\ncinemas, worth the ticket, fun enough, the cast has , Jason Sudeikis ,\nJennifer Aniston , a great actress of comedy , Will Pouter that is the\nbest thing in the movie , he's very funny, had moments he made ​​me\nlaugh me enough, Emma Roberts , the funny any less more not compromise\nthe film, Ed Helms , Nick Offerman , Kathryn Hahn , Molly C. Quinn ,\nTomer Sisley , much of this as well , those who so badly in enough to\ncompromise the film, the script is not enough to be good, I found the\nlast act too hasty , and some moments are well unnecessary , We're the\nMillers is a good comedy , very only watch to unwind a little. Note 7.7\n"
"\nOMG! This movie was pure comedy, seriously, the cast was so well\nchosen, it was a different plot, and really good laughs. I always\nwanted to watch this movie, but I was always skipping it, until today.\nNowadays, it's hard to find some good comedies, but this one was\nphenomenal, every character had his moments, and that \"old couple\",\nfreaking awesome, even more sexually dirty than the «Millers».\nSeriously, this movie has real funny moments and characters that\nweren't just thrown in the movie, every character was a good piece to\nthis movie. <br><br>Seriously, this is a must watch, give it a chance, and if you don't\nlike it...well, no harm no foul.\n"
"\nJason Sudakis from Saturday Night Live plays a pot dealer who adopts a\nfamily for smuggling trip to Mexico to pay off a debt when his loot is\nstolen one night. Jennifer Aniston plays Rose, his stripper wife, fully\nclothed and tanned throughout. She will do any film as long as the pay\nis good, I guess. Kenny, the son, always has a fixed wrinkle on his\nforehead nearly to the point of being mongoloid. He has the worst gags\nof anybody, swollen genitals from a tarantula bite only the least of\nthem. Violence and profanity are overdone to the point of not being\nthat funny. Seriously, the cast is too clean goody-two-shoes to\nresemble any of the Millers they are supposed to portray. It feels like\nan extended episode of Saturday Night Live and any comparison to the\nsimilar Chevy Chase Vacation series would be an insult, since those\nfilms had good characters driven to bad ends instead of the reverse.\nJen's strip tease scene the only positive quality I can locate in the\nwhole movie.\n"
"\nIt's been 1 year exactly after it's release. Also I like Emma\nRoberts(she's stunning in every snapshot!). Much better than other\ncomedies! Punchlines were perfect! <br><br>We're The Millers is a crude and sometimes inappropriate comedy movie.\nIn my estimation, it does a great job with the laughs, even if the\nstory does get a bit sappy at the end (as most movies do anyway). I\nrecommend you watch this movie whenever you feel like laughing your ass\noff, provided you're not offended by the content. It will most\ndefinitely please you. Still my favorite of the bunch is Sudeikis, as\nhe always plays these parts right on the money.\n"
"\nThe idea behind this movie is nothing really new. It's a road trip,\nthis time to Mexico. A small time drug dealer, David, owes his\nsupplier. In order to pay the debt, he must deliver a shipment of drugs\nfrom Mexico to the US. He \"hires\" a family to help him to seem less\nsuspicious. They get the drugs then hi-jinx ensues. Of course, they are\nchased, there's some poll dancing, a huge spider, a lesson on kissing.<br><br>All of it was amusing and it was one of Jennifer Aniston's better\ncomedic roles. Kenny was the funniest character, with his naivety and\nshocked that he wasn't getting paid.<br><br>FINAL VERDICT: It was OK, decent for a light weight comedy.\n"
"\nFun and clever little R-rated comedy about a group of four mismatched\npot smugglers posing as a clean-cut middle-class family with, of\ncourse, hilarious consequences. Poulter hits the spot with his take on\nthe Lopes \"Waterfalls\" rap, and Helms is terrific as cannabis-kingpin\nBrad Gurdlinger. Even though the entire cast does a good job, the four\ncore characters seem strangely underdeveloped, leaving the viewer\nsomewhat apathetic towards their conflict. Ironically, no characters\nare seen consuming marijuana. Poulter deservedly received plenty of\nrecognition for his part, including breakthrough/newcomer nominations\nfrom Empire UK and MTV Movie Awards.<br><br>*** (out of four)\n"
"\nThis is a really enjoyable movie from start to finish. There were\nplenty of occasions when I genuinely laughed out loud which is always a\ngood sign.<br><br>None of the acting performances were particularly special. That said,\nthe four central characters were all very different and this worked\nwell as it allowed the writers to create scenes focused on each of them\nand keep things fresh.<br><br>My main criticism is that for a comedy about smuggling drugs from\nMexico, very little of the movie was actually set in Mexico! I think\nthey missed out of quite of lot of mileage in terms of generally just\nmaking the movie more interesting. Instead, most of the scenes were\ncentred in and around RVs. Thankfully the quality of the comedy more\nthan made up for that for the most part.\n"
"\nEasy watching and quite funny! Enjoyed it! A drug dealer needs to\npayoff a dept and enlists the help of two neighbours and a homeless\ngirl to help him traffic drugs from Mexico to the USA. <br><br>This wasn't the most complicated of plots, but still funny and very\nentertaining. <br><br>Jennifer Aniston was her usual funny self and looked amazing in the the\n'stripper shots'.<br><br>This film turns out to be quite heartwarming with a fair amount of\nlaughs. It is only an easy watching comedy so I don't feel that there\nis a huge amount more to say other than I don't regret watching it\nbecause it did made laugh! 6/10!\n"
"\nIf you're looking for a movie that is not funny at all yet tries to\nreproduce the \"how to make a best seller\" formula, and has the overly\ntaken common characters that conform a cliché, you're in the right\nplace.<br><br>Now, for me, this is a 3 out of 10 because it roughly surprised me at\nsome point. The acting is bad; I wasn't able to mimic with any of the\ncharacters and feel what they feel and let myself enjoy the movie. The\nplot is too forced, and so not-possible that it makes me stand in the\n\"Oh yeah, it's never gonna happen but it's just a movie so let's get\nalong and keep watching\" side. Now, I recognize there is people who\nactually likes to watch this kind of movies where what happens is what\nyou expect to happen, so for you who are looking for \"that summer movie\nto watch with a ..\"-wait a minute, No, I do not recommend this movie at\nall. To nobody. There's nothing new in it and there's nothing you're\nmissing. It's such a bad movie it bothers me that it is so famous.\n"
"\nI have been gradually starting to select movies for watching on the\nbasis of directors and/or actors; therefore, I was long hesitant to see\nWe're the Millers as respective names (director + 2 \"older\" stars) have\nnot impressed me much. Luckily, the first 10 minutes or so already\nshowed that I was wrong: the plot was well constructed and smooth,\nsex-related scenes were funny, not banal, characters were elaborated,\nacting was true to nature and distinct; above all, I was surprised to\nsee Jennifer Aniston (as Sarah \"Rose\" O'Reilly) in a new and pleasant\nangle (well, Friends was not a favorite series of mine, mildly\nspeaking). Jason Sudeikis was also \"higher into the air\", and both teen\nactors were not trivial cute-face types. Many ambiguous scenes were\nreally funny, boosted by pleasant chemistry between all the so-called\nfamily members.<br><br>Moreover, in spite of being a \"raw\" comedy, many topics approached were\nquite serious and actual, giving reasons to ponder on and over.\nRecommendable to watch if you like comedies with thrilling elements and\nsophisticated ending.\n"
"\nThis movie was quite funny, it made me laugh quite a lot - even though\nhonestly I was expecting something else, originally friends told me to\ngo and watch it and I hadn't even heard of the tittle but after\nwatching at cinemas, honestly it was totally worth it, this is the kind\nof movies I wouldn't mind buying a ticket for and not the typical\nfailures we get on screen these days. I have to say this movie will\nmake you laugh from the beginning to the end, watch it friends you\nmight pee your pants.<br><br>I have to admit stupidity is included but then again what comedy\ndoesn't?<br><br>I have to admit even after leaving cinemas, I was still laughing till\nmy stomach hurt.\n"
"\nrarely i see such a good movie it was so funny but not this 0815 jokes\nor so at the beginning i thought it would be boring with some funny\nsets but i would guess 10 min after the start i know it will be so much\nfun there are so many difference people in this film and each of them\nhas their own role. also the actors are good, never laughed so much in\na movie. I hope there will be a second part, but i don't think so,\nbecause what should be in the next part? and the female actors are\nreally funny, i would say its just the female actors but a movie is\nlike a teamgame. its not enough that one person is funny it has to fit\nin<br><br>i really recommend it to you\n"
"\nI was not so sure about the title but this movie is beyond awesomeness.\nThe actors, the casting and the plot altogether so awesome. The best\nthing is that it has the HANGOVER guy in it. Emma Roberts along with\nWill Poulter make the best brother-sister duo. Jason and Jeniffer give\nthe movie a A factor. The script is so awesome that i kept laughing the\nentire time 'you know what i'm saying'. I could give this movie a\n200/100 rating. Seriously means i didn't actually get to see the movie\nin the theater but got a copy at my friends house. <br><br>The best thig is that the story keeps on going and doesn't bore you at\nall. The cop in the movie is awesome too. Hats off to the ending.\n"
"\nThis movie was probably one of the most inappropriate ones I've seen in\nages...and I absolutely loved it!!! If your sense of humour doesn't\nstretch to the twisted then perhaps it's not a movie for you and it's\ncertainly not recommended for viewing by younger children. Seeing\nJennifer Anniston as stripper ,Rose O'Reilly, was a highlight after her\nnormally more conservative roles and Jason Sudeikis was hilarious as\nthe immoral drug dealer, David Clark, whose interpretation of a family\nis a somewhat loose interpretation.<br><br>The entire cast was fantastic with one of the funniest moments being a\nbite to their ring-in son, Kenny's nether regions by a Mexican Red\nKneed Tarantula, among other unexpected challenges that come along to\nstop David and the rest of the 'family' from getting their drug payout.\nAll in all this movie has been one of the most entertaining comedies I\nhave seen for a long time.\n"
"\nDon't bring your family to this.<br><br>The fact that the movie makes the DEA look good is idiotic. The U.S.\nGovernment brings in the drugs and allows certain banks to launder\nmoney. Then they put you in prison if you're caught, financing the\nprison system. Some dealers are let go quickly if they aren't the\ncompetition to the Chase Bank group. <br><br>This movie was probably the best Brainwashing Programming (why are they\ncalled T.V. PROGRAMS?) they could come up with since Marijuana is legal\nin Colorado and Maine. <br><br>The stripper did a lousy strip act, probably a copy from an old movie.\nAnd when they get to the border and are ready to search the R.V.,\nIllegal Mexicans mysteriously start running from under their vehicle.\nCORNY! Drugs were legal in the 1930's and Alcohol was illegal. Nobody\nexcept rare screwy people messed with drugs. Advertising of both should\nbe banned. <br><br>Sorry about the ranting but knowing these facts makes the movie even\nworse.\n"
"\nI watched this movie today and as a woman who is married to a man with\nno arms and therefore has 2 hooks for hands I am horrified that you\nwould make a dig at people like him in the movie. Why even talk about a\nman with hooks for hands entering a strip club? So what if they do? The\ncomment had nothing at all to do with the movie so why have it in the\nmovie? It wasn't even funny! That scene should be removed!<br><br>I nearly walked out of the movie but didn't. Wish now that I had. The\nrest of the movie was poor very adult jokes and although at times I\nlaughed it was predictable and a waste of my time.<br><br>I think an apology re the disabled dig should be issued.\n"
"\nLet's say you can buy into a nearly fifty year old Jennifer Aniston as\na stripper.Maybe you can even buy a forty year old Jason Sudeikis as\nthe hip drug dealer who dresses like a Dave Matthews fan.Then you can\nprobably buy that when they pretend to be a family their kids are\nalmost thirty.They go from ridiculous parodies of old people trying to\nbe cool to actual old people with very old children.I guess that makes\nsense in some other dimension.While the premise and plot are very thin,\nthere are some good jokes in here.There's a stripper with a tattoo over\nher box that says \"Boner Garage\".That's comedy gold.Ed Helms is\nhilarious as usual and Nick Offerman is very disappointing as usual.The\nworst thing about this movie is the very long and totally unnecessary\ncampground scene.It has nothing to do with the story and turned a good\n90 minute comedy into a two hour test of your movie watching ability.I\nguess what I'm trying to say is that this movie is very average.If you\nnever see it you have two hours to watch something else.If you do see\nit, you probably won't be angry.\n"
"\nFunny story. I went to a free preview for this movie when it first came\nout and watched something like 30 or 40 minutes of it before walking\nout. The movie was boring but I gave it a real chance because it was\nsetting up the pieces and plot and etc. Then Tomer Sisley came on the\nscreen as the main bad guy and he was so dull and so flat. He looked\nalmost bored to be there, in other words it was awful acting. So based\nmainly on the main bad guy's performance, I walked out. Anyway, fast\nforward to just 2 hours ago. This movie was on TV and there was\nliterally nothing else to watch so I put it on and started watching it\naround the time I walk out on it 3 years earlier. The movie did get\nfunnier and wasn't as bad as I thought it was going to be. It wasn't\nany good but not totally bad. I'm just tripping on how one awful\nperformance can kill a movie for you. The idea behind the movie is\nfunny enough and I'm sure if they do make a sequel to it, they'll have\na different villain.\n"
"\nI watched \"we are the millers\" last night and I must say it was awesome\nI had watched the hangover series so I decided to watch another\nHollywood Comedy flick and I must say I was not disappointed.<br><br>The movie was awesome and every actor in this movie deserves a kudos!!!\nEvery one has done a great job in this movie.<br><br>The actors have done a great job and the story was bit different so as\nComedy which I liked the most and it has also showed some family\nfeelings though they were not family but I liked it.<br><br>Overall a fun movie, and a must watch.after hangover I will rate this\nmovie and after this there comes \"Ted\". And this is also a bit\nUnforgettable movie.\n"
"\nHorrible Bosses is a great movie and also stars Jennifer Aniston and\nJason Sudeikis who in this play Rose O'Reilly and David Clark. David is\na drug dealer who makes a family all with interesting characteristics\n(of course) which is really funny and at times a but cringe-worthy but\ngreat all the while. Funny plot twists keep you on the edge of your\nseat and the way characters deal with that is very amusing. I went in\nto this film thinking it will be an alright comedy film but as it turns\nout i laughed hard throughout.<br><br>To summarize this is a great light-hearted comedy that is great to\nwatch and have some fun with.\n"
"\nthis movie is one of my favorite movies. i like it because it is really\nfunny. my favorite part of the movie is when at the end when they buy a\nhouse and he is in the backyard watering the plants. i give this movie\na 9 out of 10 because the main idea and everything is hilarious. my\nfavorite actor is kenny he is the odd one out of the group and he does\na lot of funny things. like he would be the one to get his balls bit by\na big spider. also when they get stopped by the cop and they tell kenny\nto be the one to give what the guy wants and the cop is gay. so this\nmovie was just a movie they if you want to laugh then you should watch\nit. one of my most favorite movies\n"

"\nA movie trying to prove that dysfunction may be the functional societal\nnorm clearly runs out of steam as it progresses.<br><br>When a drug dealer is hired to get drugs, he brings along people at\nrandom to make it appear that he is a family man. The group includes\nfalse wife Jennifer Aniston, a stripper, a run-away daughter to serve\nas his daughter and a neighbor's son, who has been abandoned by his\nmother.<br><br>The film is devoted to the adventures of the group trying to get the\ndrugs. This proves to be far more dangerous than they had ever\nimagined. Meetings include seeing a supposedly conventional family with\nthe wife having lesbian like tendencies.<br><br>It is interesting in that along the way, this group actually starts to\nact like a family, in caring for one another.\n"
"\nwas really excited to see this movie when I saw the trailer, because I\nthought it looked hilarious, and I'm a huge fan of Jason Sudeikis and I\nabsolutely adore Jennifer Aniston, and I can guarantee that it does not\ndisappoint. It was actually better than I was expecting it to be,\nbecause you don't usually expect much from drug dealing comedies. The\nplot in this was actually pretty clever, and to be honest Will\nPoulter's character Kenny really makes the entire movie. He played it\nso well, and he was perfectly awkward and strange, it was hilarious. It\nwas definitely one of the best comedies I've seen in a while. Sure it\ndid have some corny moments that are unrealistic, but I overall enjoyed\nthe movie\n"
"\nWe're The Millers blends forms of comedy into one, as the film works\nfor several reasons. Although predictable, it is entertaining, and some\nof the comedic jokes do work well. The chemistry is there as we see the\ncast come together as one family towards the end. What works in the\nmovie is its offensive and raunchy comedy, a type of comedy that most\noften just goes horribly wrong. The entire cast is simply fantastic at\nmaking the gross out stuff work and even better at delivering the site\ngags. Sudeikis is obviously the core of the group, but it's Poulter who\nsteals the show as the half-witted fake son with a heart of gold.\nAnniston and Roberts are both fine on screen. Anniston as well plays\nher part convincingly to some extent.\n"
"\nI was surprised how much the movie affected me. I actually walked away\nwith a good feeling inside! We're the Millers balances crude humor with\na legitimate good story about people's innate need of socialization. It\nliterally spins RV on its head. The story was actually decent and\npretty well written to a certain extent. The only thing was the humor\nis crude. However, keeping in mind who is in the movie, I didn't find\nthis surprising. I would recommend watching this with friends and\nmaybe, if they are old enough, family members. I would also consider\nwatch it on a Friday night. Overall, a generous 6 out respect for the\nmessage and the plot.\n"
"\nSaw it on HBO, not the type of movie I'd go to see. That said, despite\nexpectations to the contrary, I rather enjoyed the movie. The fake\nfamily construct offered a lot of good comedic twists. Jason Sudeikis\nis already a comedic force to be reckoned with, and has the added plus\nof being a naturally endearing character, just like Anniston. Sudeikis\nis going to go beyond Adam Sandler, Steve Carrell, Seth Rogen. He's got\nleading man good looks and a brilliant comedic flair and a delivery\nlike Vince Vaughn, Bradley Cooper, Ben Stiller, and Paul Rudd, and\ngiven the right material could go very far. And he will be able to\ncrossover into dramatic roles as well. So even with some predictable\nplot turns the movie was still able to bring some originality without\nstretching credulity too far. I cringed at the spider scene, because it\nis SUCH a played out routine--I'm surprised they don't have a\nretirement home for Tarantulas. And the fake family dynamics was just\nsmarmy enough to make it work and make it endearing.\n"
"\nIf I could, I would give this movie a 0 out of 10. It was unbelievably\nstupid and had a stupid plot. A pot dealer who creates a fake family as\npart of his plan to move a lot of weed across countries? Had the\nstupidest part in the history of movies -- a tarantula chomping on an\n18-year-old's testicles, and he drops his pants and shows everyone in\nhis fake family. HARDEE-HAR-HAR. (Notice the sarcasm?) Actually, It was\ndisturbing to see stuff like that. I mean, come on! Sean Anders can be\nfunnier than this, like in Daddy's Home which is one of the funniest\nmovies I've ever seen. Actually, probably the most. But this piece of\ncrap is the worst movie of all time. Do not believe when your friends\ntell you that this is hilarious, because i can almost guarantee you\nwill be totally disappointed with this. This is by far, the worst movie\nI have ever seen.\n"
"\nSurprisingly this movie is extremely funny and gets funnier as it goes\nalong. It's well written and original with a combination of funny\nsituations and one liners. The characters are endearing. Unlike the\ncomedies these days which rely on excessive crudeness, this one\ndoesn't. Yet the jokes are current enough especially the Border jokes.<br><br>The cast of the fake family smuggling drugs is terrific. Jennifer\nAniston has cornered many of the best comedies of recent years and she\ndeserves it. She still is very slim enough to pull off the stripper\nrole tastefully. Jason Sudeikis is suited to his role as drug dealer -\nbrings to mind an updated Chevy Chase in the National Lampoon movies.\nEmma Roberts is also well cast as the sulky runaway. Will Poulter as\nthe 18 year old virgin has such a comically hilarious face. He has some\nof the funniest scenes. Supporting cast is good too.<br><br>Really good comedies are few and far between maybe one or two a year -\ngo see it in the cinema.\n"
"\nThis is one of those movies that tries really hard at being\nfunny....but it's not. It is loaded with profanity that does not quiet\nrole right with the actors and that is said in a way that is\nreminiscent of a second grader trying to boost their tough guy image\nwith excessive swearing.<br><br>The story line is very clichéd and weak. This is the sort of movie you\nonly show your friends if you secretly hate them. Its the same old\ntheme; a goof-ball owes a drug dealer money, he pays the dealer back\nbuy moving drugs and runs into several unplanned obstacles, in the end\nthe good guys win, goof-ball gets off debt free and falls in love with\nthe beautiful side kick.<br><br>Overall the unnecessary overuse of profanity and nude men dampen the\nmovie when they are put in to try and add some humour. This all\ncontributes to make this movie an unfortunate epic fail.\n"
"\nThe idiocy and stupidity within essentially every scene of the movie\ngives comedy a bad name. I can't imagine this appealing to anyone over\n18 with at least 1,000 brain cells. The content is typical of playing\nto the lowest common denominator (obvious sexual inferences, using the\n\"F\" word as many times as possible, drugs, etc.). It's just not a funny\nmovie. The content is as if four students from a high school class were\nassigned the task of writing a script for a movie. If this is what\nJennifer Aniston has stooped to in order to save a career that has\nessentially sucked since she left Friends, well, there's nowhere to go\nbut up. Ironically, even though it is written to appeal to teenagers,\nthe content of the movie is VERY adult. I wouldn't let my 12 or 16 yr\nold daughters anywhere near this film.\n"
"\nAfter being robbed, pot dealer David (Jason Sudeikis) is forced by his\nboss (Ed Helms) to go to Mexico to pick up a load of marijuana. In\norder to improve his odds of making it past the border, David asks the\nbroke stripper Rose (Jennifer Aniston), hopelessly naive neighbor kid\n(Will Poulter) and homeless girl (Emma Roberts) to join him and pretend\nthey're on a family holiday.<br><br>The 4 strangers have a fun road trip and grow to become a family unit.\nThis is yet another inappropriate road trip movie. There are some\nhilarious moments and the group has fun chemistry. My only minor\ncomplaint is that Jennifer Aniston is more MILF than enjeunue. Yet\nshe's being played as a next hot thing. It reminded me of Demi Moore in\nStriptease. Is Aniston doing a striptease truly that big of a deal\nanymore? If they didn't play it up so much, it'd work out a lot better.\n"
"\nWhere to start? This movie is hilarious. It was made to be a comedy and\nthat's exactly what it is. Ed Helms is the drug lord and he just ads\nthat special something. Their is a virgin, a stripper, a runaway, and a\ndrug dealer but somehow the film makes us care about them. Nick\nOfferman - \"Ron Swanson\" from the show \"Parks and Rec\" is in it and he\nis awesome. That guy needs to be in more projects. Anyways, this movie\nis one of those that you can watch over and over and still enjoy it.<br><br>Dislikes: Emma Roberts character - Casey, is boring. She doesn't find\nher character in this film, sorry. All the other characters learn\nsomething. They evolve. I just don't see that with her. I don't think\nit is her acting because I usually like her a lot. I think it was how\nher character was written in to the story. Their arguing gets a tad\ntiresome as well. That's it.\n"
"\n\"We're the Millers\" is a comedy movie which has to do with a\ntransportation of a big cargo of weed into the U.S.A from Mexico. This\ndifficult job assumes to do a simple pot dealer (Jason Sudeikis).<br><br>To achieve this ask help from a stripper (Jennifer Aniston), a homeless\nwoman (Emma Roberts) and a little \"stupid\" boy (Will Poulter) to look\nlike a normal family and pass the borders unnoticed.<br><br>Jennifer Aniston makes a really great work in this film and I would say\na really different from all the other movies she played. An also good\ninterpretations made by Jason Sudeikis and Emma Roberts.<br><br>\"We're the Millers\" is a nice comedy movie that it will make you laugh\nand spend congenially your time!\n"
"\nJust watched this movie with my movie theatre-working friend. When the\npremise is of a drug dealer being assigned to smuggle many pounds of\nthe stuff across Mexico with a pretend family of a stripper and two\nhomeless teens, no way was this going to get a rating lower than \"R\"\nespecially when the \"siblings\" are a boy and girl and the boy ends up\nkissing both his \"sister\" and \"mother\"! Jason Sudeikis and Jennifer\nAniston provide plenty of laughs as the \"parental units\" along with\nmuch of the supporting cast of which includes another couple with a\nteen daughter of which the father is a law officer! The whole movie was\nboth raunchy and a little heartwarming with likable characters\nthroughout. And, yes, it was funny enough for me and my friend. So on\nthat note, I recommend We're the Millers.\n"
"\nThis is one of the funniest movies I have seen in years. Initially I\nwent out of curiosity since I live near where most of the film was\nshot, Wilmington, NC. We walked down town one evening and saw Jennifer\nAnniston as she was filming the hotel lobby scene on Front Street. You\nwill have a great time laughing as the plot comes together. several one\nliners keep coming back feeding off each other. The writers did a great\njob keeping us entertained from the beginning to the end. I read the\nother reviews and they are dead on. It's not often that so many people\nof different ages can agree on what humor really is. Don't leave the\ntheater when the credits start, remain seated for out takes!\n"
"\nRude, dumb, predictable and without any creativeness. All the jokes are\nflat, with much cursing. Most of them are sex oriented but with a very\ncheap feel. Very immature.<br><br>I can't say it was a total disaster, and It made me smile here and\nthere, but not to laugh. I must also admit that people around me were\nactually laughing, though most of them were teenagers while I'm at my\nearly thirties.<br><br>My thing is smart unpredictable comedies. I loved the original\n'Couplings', which is abundant with funny sex jokes with very mature\nfeel. I guess this is just not my type of a movie.\n"
"\nI was really looking forward to seeing this after the 7.2 rating on\nIMDb, and also being a fan of Horrible Bosses that had both Jason\nSudeikis and Jen Anniston. I'm always keen for a quality mindless\ncomedy to have a laugh and not think for a couple of hours, but this\njust didn't do it. THe script was predictable and seemed forced, the\njokes weren't that funny (apart from a few), and the two lead\ncharacters were boring and annoying. JS character was just annoying and\nnot funny, and JA character was tired, we've seen it before many times.\nThese guys just going through the motions. The two younger characters\nwere pretty good, but Ed Helms support character I just didn't buy\neither, mis-cast in my opinion. I did laugh a couple of times early on\nin the movie but I then left about 2/3 through as it became hard work\nand i prefer to have that time enjoying some fresh air rather than\nwaiting for the movie to end being all too aware that I was not\nenjoying it. Wait for the DVD.\n"
"\nWe went not expecting an intelligent comedy, and it wasn't, but it WAS\nfunny! It was laugh out loud funny. I would recommend it over The Heat,\nwhich felt like they forced the laughs. In this movie, the situation is\nof course bizarre, and the whole premise was dumb, but who cares if it\nmakes you laugh?! They really cast the whole family well, especially\nKenny, who does a great job as the virgin dork. I never thought I would\nsee a movie where Jennifer Aniston looked just right as a 40 something\nmother, but she does in the film. Ed Helms was probably the only one\nwho looked out of sorts in the movie, that was a bit too much of \" Hey\nlet's place a really unlikely guy in this part\"...We were really\nworried how they would have them end up together as a family without\nmaking it sappy, but it was handled pretty well. And if you go, stay\nfor the outtakes, especially the very last one when the family\nserenades one of the cast members, that was fun.\n"
"\nI can't believe how good this was - I was not expecting it to be so\nfunny. It was kind of a hybrid between Half-baked and Little Miss\nSunshine, but not exactly - shared some of the same comedic elements.\nEntire cast was stellar and by the end of the movie you truly grow\nattached to them. I would like to see a sequel because I enjoyed these\ncharacters so much. There was never a dull moment in it, either - pace\nkeeps flowing with one table-turning event after another. Starts off as\na \"fake\" family, as the movie describes, but not only do we grow to\ncare about the characters - they grow to care about each other. It's\nnot sappy at all, though - it's very funny and a feel-good movie.\n"
"\nThe story of this movie is complex and simple at the same time. There\nare many moments throughout this movie that the story puts the\ncharacters in situations that makes you think 'there's no getting out\nof this one'. Every actor is this movie did exceptionally well making\nit feel very authentic, original and made up on the spot. They really\nkept you in suspense. Acting within Acting, amazing! As intense as this\nmovie gets, it has its funny moments to balance it out. And I'm not\ntalking a little chuckle, you will be there laughing for ages, some of\nthe jokes and moments are that funny.<br><br>This is a must watch and one of my all time favorites\n"
"\nBefore watching, it seemed like a mediocre comedy, but then I was\nlaughing so hard, and the story kept me following along. Thankfully the\npreview clips were only the tip of this comedy iceberg. <br><br>Jason Sudeikis has the perfect timing (wink-wink) that keeps delivering\nthe punchlines right on time. Jennifer Aniston is a familiar face from\nmany hits that brings an appreciated smidge of sincerity along with\nmany other talents of hers to the unique situations this haphazard\nbunch finds themselves in. Although this fake family isn't connected by\nblood, there's a lot that a completely dysfunctional family can teach\nus who are. By the end you'll be wishing certain parts had been\nexpanded more, so I hope that once this gets the ratings it deserves\nwe'll be seeing these characters again.\n"
"\nJason Sudeikis and Jennifer Aniston play a drug dealer and exotic\ndancer who pose as suburban parents of teenagers to smuggle in drugs\nfrom Mexico. The film includes two awkward teenagers. Emma Roberts and\nWill Poulter play Casey and Kenny. The cast is first rate and the\nwriting is above average. I enjoy watching Ed Helms as the boss. Luis\nGuzman deserved better in his small role. Kathryn Hahn and Will\nOffernan play another couple on vacation. This vacation movie reminds\nme of the National Lampoon's Vacation more so. Despite them playing a\nfamily on the road, they clicked well together. They take a plane from\nDenver to Tuscon and then rent a massive RV to Mexico. The direction is\npretty good. The film has some slow moments but it's worth watching.\nJennifer Aniston can pull off as an exotic dancer than her normal girl\nnext door appearance.\n"
"\nSmall-time drug dealer Dave is forced to smuggle a large quantity of\ndrugs into the USA from Mexico. In order to provide a convincing false\nidentity by masquerading as a normal holidaying family in a camper van,\nhe recruits stripper Rose as his wife, and homeless teen Casey and\nidiot neighbour Kenny as his children. The problem is that none of the\nfour is ideally suited to playing the part of a normal family member\nand, when they get involved with another holidaying family whose Dad is\na Drug Enforcement Agency operative, things get a little tricky.<br><br>This film - which features a lot of bad language which may, or may not,\nhave a bearing on your enjoyment, is morally questionable but quite\nlikable nevertheless. There is some enjoyable dialogue, a good plot,\nnice character development arcs, and good playing by the principals,\nWill Poulter especially.<br><br>I enjoyed this.\n"
"\nThe humor in this movie is quite vulgar and simple, but again adequate\nfor the situations in which the characters are placed throughout the\nfilm. Since the main and only goal is to make us laugh loudly, this\nmovie succeed ad it. In addition to the funny dialogue, the main\ncarriers of the humor in the movie are the characters themselves, who\nare sufficiently well designed and developed to be hilarious. Acting in\nthe film is quite good. \"We're the Millers\" has far exceeded my\nexpectations. The movie can be characterized as a very funny comedy\nthat is worth your time and attention. I recommend this movie to\neveryone who wants a good laugh. I was impressed and happy to see that\ngood comedy movies still exist.\n"
"\nWe're the millers is a funny film with sweet warm hearted moments. It\nalso features great performances by all the actors, including Jennifer\nAniston, Jason Sudeikus, Emma Stone, and Will Poulter. The movie has a\nvery funny script with great dialogue between all the characters. The\nchemistry with the cast works well too, awesome casting choices here!\nThis movie was a good surprise, I didn't think it was going to be that\ngreat going into it, but it was in my opinion. It's definitely not for\nthe entire family obviously, a lot of frequent profanity, and sexual\nhumor, but it does work well with the script and plot. The content\nisn't too crude or crass, it works well with the movie. Jennifer\nAniston really shined in this movie, she gave the most credible and\nnotable performance in my opinion. And the couple that the millers come\ninto contact with had the best and funniest moments in the film!\nHilarious scenes with them! 8/10 for we're the millers!\n"
"\nEntertaining comedy. Builds well and I liked the ending. Jason S. seems\nto be doing an 80s Bill Murray type of thing, and it stands out from\nthe post-irony stuff that seems to be the norm. Anniston is miscast,\nbut there were lots of great cameos and smaller roles. Ed Helms with\nhis orca was a highlight, and Scotty P was memorable--his outtakes had\nme wanting more. I'm glad there are still some R-rated comedies being\nmade that are making money, because a lot of the PG ones feel too\nrestrained. I think after this movie and Wedding Crashers, we can\nconsider any Fisher and Faber projects something to look forward too.\nHere's hoping for more.\n"
"\nI am quite surprised as I bet are about 77% of the people that bet this\nrace. I say 77% because apparently 23% gave this a 10 out of 10 which I\nfind absolutely ridiculous. For a comedy like this it did have an\ninteresting plot and it isn't a movie you would expect to get a 7.1 on\nIMDb because it's an unusual and sometimes difficult to watch movie,\nbut with its subtlety with witty one line remarks makes it a quite\nfunny movie. Also, with its dozens of somewhat sexual moments I found\nit quite weird as I have and will say time and time again. <br><br>We're the Millers definitely had its fair share of swearing and about\ntwenty other movies shares. Every minute you can hear a \"shit\" or\n\"fuck\" which usually didn't add comedic effect it was more annoying\nthan anything. All in all just remember to not watch this movie with\nyour family, keep your penis away from tarantulas and don't practice\nkissing with your \"mom\" and \"sister\".

"\nI like \"dumb\" comedies sometime, such as \"Bad Grandpa\", and I had high\nhopes for this one, based on the description and some acquaintances\nrecommendations. But unfortunately, despite some funny moments early\non, for me the laughs were few and far between. Jennifer Aniston was\nlargely wasted in her role, and the casual graphic sex talk got old\nafter a while. The highlights, as another reviewer noted, were the\nouttakes during the credits, and the \"cute\" moments with Kenny (Will\nPoulter), whose eyebrows are rather unique. Too many of the supporting\ncast were caricatures, especially the bad guys, be they the killers or\nthe one who gave Sudeikis the job of bringing the drugs back to Denver\nfrom Mexico. The humor should come from the situations and the script,\nnot from silly overacting and mugging. Not awful, but it should have\nbeen funnier, and about 15 minutes shorter.\n"
"\nI'm not really into movies that are based on drug dealing, stripping\netc but I quite enjoyed this one. If you want to lay back for a little\nover 100minutes and not have to think too much, just have a good little\nlaugh with the family, then this is the film for you. I have to admit\nthat I like Jennifer Aniston in almost anything she does, be it funny,\nsometimes dull &amp; awkward, this is one of her more comical moments. I\nalso enjoyed Kenny's performance- Aniston's \"adopted\" son; he added a\ntouch of reality, teenage awkwardness, &amp; funny bits into the film,\nespecially with the teaching him to kiss &amp; spider scenarios. Needless\nto say my teenage daughters really enjoyed it, a lot more than me but\nit was pretty good for it's kind.\n"
"\nUnbelievable ... really nothing works. You hear the grinding brains of\nthe scriptwriters getting their next line out for the sake of the\nmoney. Only clichés are coming out. Everything is over the top:\ncriminals, the camper, the super boss with a orka. etc etc. It is all\nnot funny! And the characters are phony. Even when something is a\ncomedy things got to be believable and they are not. What a waste of\nmoney and of not such a bad outline, spoiled by people who did not have\ntheir day or year. It makes me so angry that people can waste my time\nand money. And yes it is true like other wrote about this movie ...\ntheir is something sad under all this sitcom full of cynicism: a bunch\nof people who are so failed n life ... failed to be happy .. to be\nfunny.\n"
"\n\"We're the Millers\" attract the interest even from the movie poster. A\nneighborhood drug dealer, David, is forced to deliver a huge amount of\ndrugs from Mexico across the borders. In order to not attract attention\nto himself, he creates a fake family as to appear that they are on\nfamily holiday. Clever idea for a movie, especially of this type, and\nvery creative. It's actually very funny, with clever lines and great\nperformances. Even the supporting roles are very good. The story\ndoesn't get boring all through the end and the twists are many.\nHowever, sometimes the humor is a little rough, but that can easily be\noverlooked. All in all a great film for a comedy, even though the\nromance is a little bit weak and maybe unnecessary.\n"
"\nThis film will keep a smile on your face from start to finish! It uses\nthe same techniques as Wild Hogs and The Hangover films. I watched the\nextended version and there wasn't a scene that was wasted. The\nstoryline flows nicely, the characters are believable, and all of them\nare well developed. Combining elements of slapstick, farce, and wit,\nthe film never has a slow or dull spot. There is a good balance between\nthe main characters and the acting is well above average. There will\nundoubtedly be sequels. Even the credits contained a nicely done honor\nto Anniston! Not for the kiddies due to extensive use of profanity.\nRent it, buy it, go see it, you will love it!\n"
"\nAs most people i saw the previews, tough it could be funny, so i rented\nit and i was extremely surprise that it was just so damn awesome ! The\nconcept itself ain't something totally new, but the actors play there\ncharacter just so well you really feel for them, care for them and want\nto see them grow together. The movie is just paced well enough to be a\ngood balance between an adult comedy and a teen comedy, sometimes you\ncan laugh at the silly joke, other time you can really relate to what\nthose guys are going trough even tough the situation itself is\nsomething that is hardly possible. Its hard to explain with words\nreally, but this movie is really among my top 10 movies of 2013 and\nprobably in my top 3 comedies of 2013 as well. I would highly recommend\nit.\n"

"\nSpoilers Not the funniest movie, I ever saw. This movie is good, but\nnot outstanding, except that, you know the ending all along and are\nstill pretty happy to see it. The ending is a reaffirmation of the love\nand mark of a real family and it makes this movie worth while. Some\nmight say the ending is corny, but I still like it. As the movie and\nthe comedy roll on, and Jennifer Aniston gets to play still another\nwoman who is not the main love focus but somehow through the plot,\nbecomes the loved one, we get the affirmation we wait for. The family\nbegins to bond, to care, to show they are really a very functional and\nunstoppable group when united. We know that its coming, and we wait for\nit. We hope for it. It happens. The magic of Hollywood takes over and\nwe get the very functional loving family made out of people who could\nnot have cared less about each other in the beginning. Of course, like\nother movies that do similar feel good things, we get the almost\nobvious but still a little surprising reason they will remain a loving\nfamily at the end.\n"
"\nGreetings from Lithuania.<br><br>\"We're the Millers\" is definitely the best comedy of this year, and i\nliked the \"Heat\". I'm not the fan of Jennifer Aniston, but she's quite\ngood in this one. Many things work in this comedy, and i laughed very\nhard - and that is a rate thing. Jason Sudeikis (who's last name is\nLithuania'n)is very good in this one, actually, everyone involved in\nthis flick did a strong job. One thing i really liked about this\ncomedy, that jokes aren't unnatural (hope you know what i mean), they\nare very natural and that's why they work an are funny. Overall, this\nis a very good R rated comedy. Beware - it's really R.\n"
"\nThis is a lighthearted and funny road-trip movie with a fair share of\nlaughs, likable characters and strong comic performances. Its almost an\nunique growth story of a man that has grown tired of his miserable life\nand finds something worth fighting for. You know where the plot's\ngoing, but it's still fun getting there. The interaction between the\nfour main leads is great. It's a little too raunchy to be a movie for\nall the family and there are a few gross-out moments and some of it is\nclichéd, but it does go beyond your average comedy. Jennifer Aniston\ngives a great performance, but casting her as a stripper is a bit\nunconvincing, but anyway let's face it, she's hot!\n"
"\nYear 2013 had it's fair share of comedy movies but a lot of them very\nboring and not funny at all. \"We're the Millers\" was, in my opinion,\none of the best comedy movies of the year. It was very funny and\nexciting !!!! I originally wanted to see this movie because of the\nJennifer Aniston scene (who wouldn't !!!) but it certainly got my\nattention with it's original story and it's funny characters. Jason\nSudeikis does a excellent job in this role with it's well known humor\nfrom movies like \"Horrible Bosses\" or \"Hall Pass\" and the other\ncharacters rise to the challenge. I laughed a lot that's for sure (not\nto mention that the stripping scene didn't let down) . So per total I\ngive it a hard 9 and a place in my movies collection. A movie worth\nseeing !!!\n"
"\nI saw the trailers and knew the story line. But was still very\nsurprised about just how much I enjoyed this movie. The cast all worked\nso well together when I thought it might seem strained. Don't get me\nwrong the story is simple enough and you don't have each characters\nbackground explained too much. But please believe me it all works. Now\nthe main thing - it's seriously funny. A movie that you can think of\ncertain scenes afterwards with a smile. I won't mention any of these\nbut I am sure you will know these when you watch this film. Now my\npersonal favourite Jennifer Anniston, it's so nice to see her in not a\nrom com, at last. Sorry to be so shallow but I just loved her\nstripping!!\n"
"\nAn easy movie for easy entertainment! You can't go wrong choosing this\none for fun and laughs.<br><br>This comedy adventure doesn't offer anything new many other comedy\nadventure films haven't shown before. But the acting is good and the\nstory flows quickly. Best of all it will keep your attention!<br><br>Many unlikely situation get this make believe family in some dangerous\nhot spots - which always twist into their favor. The daughters\nboyfriend at the carnival/RV camp is the funniest - in my opinion. That\nis not to say there aren't plenty of other chuckles and laughs along\nthe way.<br><br>An easy movie to take in.\n"
"\nThey are cute, the van and all. Jennifer Aniston is a star like always,\nwhat a body, eh? In the real life in the USA there are no people like\nthis in the real life, they are mostly in jail, so it is nice to\nrelease them for a movie plot for a change, less they are the actors.\nMovie for fun and a laugh, my favorite part is when they cheated\nAniston with a song in the bloopers. What a face she had! Sunday\nafternoon film to take the kids to...I would love to write more about\nthis film but I do not have anything to add. IDMB should rethink their\nminimum 10 line policy, since I do not have anything to add how will I\nfill 10 lines?\n"
"\nSaw this movie without much expectations. It turned out to be pretty\ngood. The plot is not special, but the actors do their parts well.\nJennifer Aniston, along with rest of the crew does a good job. Dave is\na pot dealer who has fallen into trouble because he got robbed. He has\nto repay his boss. His boss devises a scheme to get his money back and\nget extra money and drugs. He asks Dave to smuggle drugs across the\nMexican border. Dave hires a wife and 2 kids to act as his family,\nrents an RV to smuggle the drugs. The following journey is hilarious\nand their encounters with another family is also good to watch. This is\na kind of movie you would want to watch with friends on a weekend. It\nis just entertainment and nothing else.\n"
"\nI really liked this film normally these sort of comedies are not my\nsort of thing. I hate the lavatorial humour of some films. Jennifer\nAniston is always watchable and it was nice to see one of our English\nactors (will Poulter) doing a good job in American film. I loved the\nother couple in the plot they were just as funny as the main\ncharacters. I laughed out loud a lot and i have recommended it to\nfriends. would be good to watch with a crowd. A lot of swearing so make\nsure there are no young ones around if you watch it at home. Silly plot\nat times and not very accurate but certainly made a couple of hours fly\nby.\n"
"\nAt first, when seeing the contrast between the press ratings and the\npublic ratings, one wonders if the professionals snubbed a bit too much\nthe movie as they did with 21 Jump Street, who has a similar rating\ndistribution. And indeed, you realize that We're The Millers is far\nmuch better than the critics tried to convince us. The concept is\nsimple but strong and leads to the immediate adhesion of the viewer.\nThe dialogues are incisive and the gags, based on quid pro quos and\nother situational comedy, are for the most part very funny. Still, one\ncould regret a slight slow-down towards after the \"family\" gets the RV\nback at the garage, which is a bit unfortunate since the rest is so\ndynamic, but it's minor and ultimately, the movie turns out to be a\nvery good surprise.\n"
"\nProbably one of the funniest movies I have seen in 2013. The premise as\nJason Sudeikis as a drug dealer with not a bad heart is pretty good.\nJennifer Aniston looks, and acts and fits the role as the stripper with\na good heart, The two kids are funny. I have to admit I was very\nsympathetic with the boy because he came across so sweet in the movie\nyou just can't help feeling for him . The chemistry between Jennifer\nAniston and Jason was pretty good, I bought it completely. I think that\nif you are looking for a funny movie to watch not an Oscar winning\nMeryl Streep performance than this is a movie for you!. It has funny\nacting not overly funny which at times its not funny example Jennifer\nAniston's one of her last movies I saw from her I did not like\n\"Wanderlust\" suffice to say that I am a fan of her's and Paul Rudd that\nmovie was def not funny, at least in a conventional way, this movie on\nthe other hand is different is not so raw and its literally funny it\ndoesn't come across forced in any way at least for me two thumbs up!\n"
"\nI hadn't seen a good comedy in a long time and they seemed to be\ngetting hard to find. We're the Millers is the best I've seen in a\nwhile!<br><br>It's a good film with a basic plot that doesn't require much thought.\nSit back, relax and laugh. The story is by no means fantastic but\ncomedies don't need the killer story-line anyway. Full of frequent\nlaughs and the occasional brilliant line.<br><br>The cast were well selected for their roles and they play off of each\nother brilliantly. Will Poulter (Kenny) is especially good and adds a\nlot to the humour in the film. Nice feel good comedy and perfect to\nwatch with a few friends for a good laugh. Worth a watch!! (7/10)\n"
"\nThe trailers looked good. Early buzz about the movie said it was\ndisappointing. I relied on the buzz because I'm not a huge Sudeikis fan\nand Aniston has been hit and miss in her projects.<br><br>The film had its funny moments and some colorful characters. The movie\nshows that the world of drug dealing and smuggling is a dangerous\nworld, but then turned that into a long gag. Yeah, it's a comedy, but\nthe attitude that Sudeikis displayed was that yeah, bad things are\nhappening and some people were probably killed, but I'm a hip little\ndealer who is cooler than everyone else. That recurring attitude just\nadded a little stink to what was an enjoyable movie. Aniston was okay,\nbut the character was pretty cliché. Standouts were William\nPouter(funny, funny), Matthew Willig as One-Eye, Emma Roberts, and\nMolly Quinn. Laura-Leigh was quite funny in a short role as a\nmoral-less stripper.<br><br>The closing shot had me wondering if the \"Millers\" epiphany was\nvaporous. The whole ending was a bit trite.\n"
"\nVery funny movie and full of clever and subtle jokes and remarks. The\nactors and their acting suits the characters really well. In my\nopinion, the story was okay but it could be better. Several plot lines\nor happenings in the movie didn't feel right and sometimes ridiculous.\nLike the evolution of the stripper throughout the film: to me it really\nfelt scripted. But I didn't watch the film to really pay attention to\nthe story, my intention was to laugh and the makers really succeeded.\nThe (okay but not fantastic) story brought forth some unforgettable\nmoments. I also liked that each character was explored or \"had\nsomething\". You didn't feel that one character was just there to be\nthere, you know? Each character brought their moments and background\nand by doing so, claimed to be essential for the plot and fun. <br><br>Overall I would recommend this movie for a cozy night in front of the\nTV with some friends or partner, with the intention to have a laugh. Be\nsure to be okay with jokes about drugs &amp; sex and some profanity (as\nseen in the trailer).\n"
"\nWell not an Oscar winning movie, but that's about the only pun I can\nmake on this movie if I try hard. Other than that a very light, fun-\npacked, refreshing, and end-2-end entertainer. For me this was a lot of\nfun to watch and takes me back to the fun I had watching 'Something\nabout Mary', though nothing like it either. Also the movie is with a\nsurprisingly amazing cast of actors and actresses (whom I hardly knew\nbefore the movie, except Rose). Everyone's character was very fittingly\nchosen and played, even the Fitzgeralds' and Scottie P. The storyline\nis also perfect for a light and fun-filled comedy, nothing too serious\nyet still not too loose. <br><br>Overall fulfills my purpose of watching a movie any given Friday, I am\nsure it will yours too. So go for it before the count of 3!\n"
