i was honestly expecting a lot more given the multiple nominations for awards
i really thought this movie was overdone and could have been pared down by at least 45 minutes
in the end it was just a glorified we killed bin laden pseudodocumentary
the character relationships never developed and seemed empty
and i didnt really find the main actress very believable or that great
scenes of shooting dead bodies also were probably a bit too much  overall this movie seemed overly nationalistic and simplistic without delivering much in the way of content
i thought hurt locker was a significantly better movie
again i am somewhat surprised at the number of award nominations this movie received
i was a crewchief assigned to the group that lifted the seals to abbatobad
i will not make claims i am associated with the mission because i wasnt
nonetheless this movie disappointed me to the point i fell asleep at the 1 hour mark
without going into a rant i would hope everyone understands the actual events
maya didnt sacrifice anything she did find ubl but was well compensated financially the entire time she was looking
the basis of this movie is her work finding ubl which makes my stomach turn
its so easy to sit behind a keyboard and act like you are changing the world
her line in the movie to kill bin laden for me will resonate until my death
i can promise you ubl wasnt killed for maya and it is pretty obvious that once he was found the true heroes were summoned
her remarks in the movie about you guys showing up with your facial hair and dip is so disullionist it should be edited
she is a coward and her glorification in this movie sickens me
wasted time
a lot of wasted time
cold war style propaganda that i thought was supposed to end decades ago
overrated movie by overrated director
there was absolutely nothing of the story i could catch in first hour maybe hour and half if not the whole two
i dont really understand why this was created
maybe if the main actress was dennis rodman
maybe if there was chuck norris in the seal team
maybe if there was at least 15 of the facts accurate and im talking about facts that are just known about this manhunt
maybe if there was a team of transformers or comic cartoon heroes supporting this action
maybe if somewhere in pakistan charlie chaplin fell into sewer because of some banana
then maybe it would have 2 stars from me
this should have been good i really wanted it to be good
at the very least it should have been interesting
unfortunately it took 2
5 hours to tell 45 minutes worth of story
this film needed some serious editing too many scenes seemed forced out of place or just thrown in with little explanation or necessity
for example why include the scene asking maya about being recruited to the cia right after high school then drop the topic saying she cant explain why it didnt do anything to move the story along and left me wondering what was that about
i mean would the answer to why she was recruited make her motives and obsessions more understandable
what was the viewer supposed to take away from that conversation
skip watching this one in the theater if you must watch it out of curiosity wait until it comes out on dvd or cable then at least youre only losing your time and not a handful of hard earned cash
like many other people who gave this movie a bad review we expected much more
i have not found a bad review that i did not agree with
just read them all lump them together and you have my opinion of this oscar nominated overly long load of crap
bad editing
bad acting
the mumbling dialogue at the beginning should have given me the clue that this was going to be bad from the start
spoiler i found it insulting to my intelligence in the scene when the soldiers put their fingers to their lips and just say shush to the children who have just witnessed their parents being shot to death
i guess they want us to think that moslems treat the death of their parents much as the equivalent of one of their favorite toys being broken
my wife called it violence porn
i dont find the depiction of violence for no good reason exciting and worthy of praise
i am aware that there are many others who do
maybe that is where the good reviews come from
do not watch this it was a complete waste of time if your looking for something better i suggest watching the seal team 6 movie which is based on the same concept of this movie
this movie is long boring and such a waste of time i never write reviews but this movie was so bad i had to let everyone know not to watch it
terrible just terrible
the plot is so slow the acting isnt good at all
the characters portrayed in this doesnt seem as accurate as they should be as the characters make senseless decisions
if i was a cia operative im sure i would be much more intelligent than the people portrayed in this movie
i was actually happy when one of the operatives got blown up because this movie was just terrible
i think this movie has shown the reality of usa
they not even try to fool the people but they also show that they are innocent and are doing right thing while they themselves are evil inside
i saw this whole operation from my home
there were lots of gun fires and blasts for like 510 minutes
the bird didnt crash by itself
it was shot down
i went there and even saw the ashes few days later
the place is called abbottabad and its not 45 minutes drive from islamabad
i have a 1500 cc honda civic and it takes me at least 2 hours
we speak urdu not arabic
as about this operation i think its only a drama to show the people that usa has done it finally
foolish americans can believe their government if they want to otherwise they should seek out for the truth on their own
because thats all i can say to you nothing that looks right is actually right
it is twisted world esp since zionists have gotten power over usa
this movie could have hit a lot of audience and they might be praising it but oscar
puff
no way
i can make a better movie if i have money
given the probable falseflag nature of 911 as a justification for new predatory imperialism in the middle east and subversion of the constitution at home it is likely that osama bin laden did not exist
thus the film is at best propaganda and possibly pure falsehood  certainly not art
if he existed as a spokesperson he is easily replaced
if he was an actual person wielding power there is an endless line of thugs to replace him
my guess is that he was a fictional character played by an actor
if the government were forthright they would have provided reasonably believable proof that the dead man  if there was one  at least looked like the actor in the videos
this movie is awesome
after seeing this movie and sadly having to watch django i do not for any reason see the logic in how the director did not get an oscar nod
tarantino gets one for the waste of three hours of a humans life
i know there is a code of honor that was broken by the seal team member who wrote the book that this movie is based on but i think that telling the story gave the american people a true insight into the take down on how the countries most wanted person came to justice
the only thing i would have liked to have seen was president obamas formal address to the united states citizens that bin laden had been killed
that would have been awesome
i have added a spoiler alert for those who have yet to see the film and do not know anything about what happened from the news at the time
well i have finally seen this on dvd and was a little disappointed actually
the story lead in and characters were too sketchy it clearly wasnt a drama documentary but seemed unwilling to commit at the human interest level either
the bizarre handling of the doctor assassin seems to reinforce the impression of the contemporary news coverage  what were they doing re security
and the stupidity of the chap driving around in the same distinctive white car and using the same mobile phone ditto
what would be really interesting is an analysis of whether it ought to have taken them that long to locate him  and did the cia really lose interest and leave it to one keen agent and a few henchmen
the actual raid was well done though  in fact the seals developed their characters far more in the last 30mins than the others had in the previous couple of hours
oh and john barrowmans brief appearance was a bit distracting
being very truthful i have watched another worst movietotally wrongly depicted pakistan
in fact i can prove that this movie has been shot in india instead of pakistan
producer even didnt do a very basic homework for this movie for the culture of pakistan
we dont speak arabic not all the men wear a big turbine not all the women wear a shuttlecock burqa
urdu is our national language
and last but not the least our sign boards on the roads are in urdu or english not in hindi
please stop showing this worst picture of our country
everyone knows who is behind the anarchy and chaos in pakistan
and we have the best intelligence and army we dont need foreign forces to carry on operations in our country
really a worst production ever
holy cow
i thought the hurt locker was bad but this is even worse
since we all know what happened to ubl i would rather see a documentary on the subject
this is hollywood tripe creating fictitious characters that are totally unbelievable
ok
i will accept that since its a fictitious movie based on a real event
but my god it is dang boring and slow and not entertaining at all
during the climatic scene all i saw was a dark screen for 20 minutes with glimpses of light
i suffered through 2 hours of dreariness to end up watching darkness
like argo this was a very much overrated movie
argo was also based on a real event with a known outcome but it at least had a bit of suspense at its climatic scene for entertainment value
i dont know what the point of this movie is except to waste 2
5 hours of your time
zero dark thirty
not sure why it is titled that but anyway it is the chronicle of the decadelong hunt for alqaeda terrorist leader osama bin laden after the 911 attacks in 2001 and his death at the hands of the american military in may 2011
from the word go the movie takes you to the hunt importance and desperation of it
here the lead character maya played by terrific jessica chastain fights fire with ice but in few scenes her outburst gives you the goosebumps in this thrilling chase
in last hour or so where they believe that they have located their man movie converts into the one of the most thrilling and realistic missions showcased on celluloid
on the flip side i kept waiting for some back story of maya to know why she is like that
even though i felt that they just got lucky in finding osama bin laden and some sequences were over simplified there is no denying because of this movie i was able to experience the most important manhunt of recent times
dont miss it
agree with the other reviews cant understand why the academy award and nominations
waste of time
now i have add lines and all i can say more of the same was excited to see available on pay per view
is in screen right now so must be awful for me to sign up and review while the movie is still playing
now will copy and paste above so meet the criteria to tell you this is useless waste of time and has no depth what so ever
oh the movie ended as useless as it begins cia operative getting on a plane and crying
i am crying too as i spent the money to watch this useless movie and was so looking forward to it
well one more line and i get to complete my review and hope this helps someone save 2 hours of watching a disjointed boring movie about how the seal team got bin laden
ciao
one of the worst pieces of propaganda i have ever seen
torture does not work and lowers the us and by association my country canada to the level of the taliban
its not news that the socalled enhanced interrogation techniques employed by the us did not and do not work
we knew this before 911 and that is why the us didnt employ torture
the us senate report confirms this past week that the cia lied about torture and what was gleaned from detainees
we know now as a matter of record that torture did not lead to bin laden
we also know that whatever info they did get on bin laden was obtained before torture was employed
we also know that when field operatives in the cia said a detainee had no more to give langley told them to keep torturing them
this movie should be boycotted
as a movie this film was long and painfully boring
it felt fictitious but not in any fun drama or action movie kind of way
i had to watch it in three different sitting as the bile that i would taste in my mouth from watching this propaganda piece was almost too much to stomach
i am a big fan of several kathryn bigelowdirected movies including the hurt locker and blue steel
zero dark thirty was a letdown
clearly the hollywood hype machine strikes again
after watching this movie i cannot for the life of me fathom how it could be considered for movie of the year
there is very little suspense and the characters were very one dimensional
alternatively the hurt locker literally had me on the edge of my seat but zero dark thirty seemed unnecessarily long and slow to develop
seeing lincoln and zero dark thirty in the same week i have to say that lincoln was a far superior movie and is definitely worthy of movie of the year
zero dark thirty is not a bad movie but it is no the hurt locker and it is far from oscarworthy
after seeing the obl movie that national geographic hyped and was extremely poor i had hoped this would be much better
i was wrong
yes more money was spent on this movie with better actors director script
editing etc
however the movie is nowhere near as factual as claimed
wrong equipment adding characters fattening the story with trivial embellishment creating situations that never happened changing the story to what they want it to be just ruined this movie
obl was taken to a carrier in the arabian sea proved to be obl then he was buried in the arabian sea
there is more inventive people and scenes in this movie however over time it has proved to be more accurate than the other movie
yes it is better
i hate to be so contrary to the hype we are hearing and the oscar tap but i was not impressed nor even that entertained
in fact i had just commented to my companion movie goer that the lead character had not been very impressive when she finally had some acting to perform
the scene where she gave the station chief an ultimatum
the rest of the story was choppy and not cohesive and as much as i was pumped when the actual take down occurred i was not pumped at all in the movies take down
at any rate as much as some seem to appreciate this movie i on the other hand would not recommend spending the money to see it
argo was much better
all the technical aspects were on point dialogue tension pace directing editing etc
but do you really expect an audience to believe that for twelve years the hunt for bin laden was successful solely because an angry obsessivecompulsive bitter sexless patriot who gulps down with reckless abandon the moronic empty rhetoric justifying this crusade through sheer determination faith inner strength belief outlasted outclassed out focused harangued harassed disrespected her superiors in the version of a one woman army triumphs against good and evil
purlease
every person around her was incompetent
lazy
disinterested
this woman had no relatable qualities at all perhaps except for her queasy stomach early on in the presence of torture
at least bigelow left that part in
apart from that she just scowled yelled and threw fits
but thats ok
in the pursuit to show strong female protagonists it doesnt matter about the content because youll get token kudos anyway
the hunt for osama bin laden
quit a thrill
an homeland extended experience
but to be honest only patrick joel edgerton maya jessica chastian and foremost the excellent sound engineering kept me watching
i do not see why kathryn bigelow director stretched out some scenes to the limit of boredom and why the abottabad landing and the action to find osama with so many impossible dark shots
this movie 2
37 could have been at least an hour shorter
this momentum in usaal qaida history would have been far better served by a filmmaker like clint eastwood
5 out of 10 for the movie but a 2 for bigelow
zero dark thirty is good movie  i expected a little more  so that also yes it is a good film direction kathryn bigelow  oscar winner for best actress  here she is well  can make an excellent performance of jessica chastain the cast is very good jason clarke  joel edgerton  jennifer ehle  mark strong  edgar ramirez  kyle chandler  chris pratt  much of this good i found the long film what it is not bad  plus the script in my opinion was well dragged the picture is good  the film has a good pace  even if at times it is a little slow  i think just 2 hours enough series film zero dark thirty is a good movie  not enough to be the best film 2012 more is advisable  especially for the great performance of jessica chastain
note 7
8
on the edge of my seat the first 45mins but lost interest after
i think this movie is more about mayas jessica chastain role coming to terms with her own femininity and sexuality than what the original story was planned or wanted us to think
is this really a film about tracking down bin laden or more about lets make a movie with a strong female lead
maybe just poor character development and an overlong stretched out story line made me just turn it off
this one is not what i expected
it could have been done better with an emphasizes on plot and others too in the movie and less on maya
does she take on a strong female lead
i think that was intended but poor acting and no character development on this one
another one of those cookie cutter movies that just goes nowhere but tries to sell itself on the 911 tragedy
i believed that it was a terrible idea to make this film and even after having watched and thoroughly enjoyed it still believe albeit to a lesser degree it might not have been the best idea
certain things dont need to be publicized
however the movie itself is terrific
it doesnt matter that all the details may not have been completely accurate
the point was to make a movie about how bin laden was captured and they managed to do it well
every element is well executed and chastain really made a name for herself and definitely a fan with her performance
i really felt like i was part of all the operations taking place
and the level of pride and patriotism evoked is an achievement in itself
not only that my heart was pumping throughout and especially towards the end
i would highly recommend this to anyone and would gladly watch it a second and even a third time
watched 040504062013 written 08082013
if you a looking for a hardcore action movie about killing osama bin laden you came to the wrong place this movie has action scenes and bombings and also the ending killing oasma bin laden which lasts about 30 min but most of it is other things but i dont want to give to much away
even when theres not action its not bad though and when there is action its great too
so either way its great
the ending was the best part of the movie to me getting to see oasma bin laden get shot in the head twice well
was awesome and it was a great scene
overall it was an amazing movie and should be seen
but the torturing scene is a bit gruesome so
not everyone needs to see this
this was a pretty good film
while everyone liked the raid in abbottabad i found the buildup the chase to be very entertaining
kudos to jessica chastain with whom i was unfamiliar
there is a lot of comment about the portrayal of torture leading to leads on bin laden and terrorist attacks in general
i use the scare quotes to differentiate the techniques that the cia used from real torture such as that practiced by say arab despots or american indian tribes in the 18th and 19th centuries
people say that torture will not get you real information but they do not come to it cold
they extract information that can be checked or that they already know in order to judge the veracity of the terrorist in question
as it happened most of the detainees had a mindset that they must resist up to a point but beyond that they generally sang
as for the moral aspect this was strictly done to gain information and was not punitive in nature
anyway the film is worth seeing
in its category it is amongst the best even though it is difficult to watch and has no shortage of violence abuse and neglect
as another reviewer stated zero dark thirty is the type of film that needs good writing to work because its about a long process mainly done by people sitting at desks
many scenes do not feel believable
but great performances help to enhance this amazing story
this is one of those movies that the cast isnt only in for the paycheck
all the characters struggle against a system that has perpetuated falsehoods and there are verbal fisticuffs back and forth
there are slow spots but to me the movie is too good to dismiss based on them
first off this is a hollywood movie and not something you should count as a history lesson
folks are thinking that it is true because there was some discontent with our government over some scenesbut those were the scenes that were showing the cia torturing suspects
in this liberal society god forbid americans know that you have to become dark to fight evil
to the movie it is extremely long and boring
this movie is as dull as k19
it lacks the tension and suspense that a movie of this supposed quality needed
compare it to argo and you will see a third rate movie when shown sidebyside with ben afflecks film
the direction is slow and yawn as much as it was with her previous films
the acting is decent but there is not one single performance that would be an oscar nominated performance
i still remember the article that questioned how this movie was given an oscar nomination when it was still in the editing processbut like its false claims to real it purchased its false claim to an oscar
movie zero dark thirty was a real eye catcher but that is it
movie had very less to offer and its plots were stretched
nothing aggressive nothing new
movie got its fame in an obvious manner but no special execution on directors part was seen
the script lacked nearly in every aspect
there were only some touches of thriller
even execution of drama was a bit narcissistic
actors on the other hand were equally terrible maybe because the whole production of the movie was a confusion between a partial documentary or of something more
movie rolled just because of some life in the script and due to its circumstantial fame
could and should have been a lot better
zero dark thirty 2012 jessica chastain
the story of the 10 year pursuit of osama ben laden and the woman who was obsessed with finding and bringing him down
naval special warfare development group devgru or seal team 6 and the operation to go in and get him is the most emotional part of the film
the matteroffact way the men get ready and load up and go in and find and kill the terrorist made me sob
cant help it  they were so young and so well trained
no heroics  just another job to do
bigelow the director has done another marvelous job showing our men in action
we may not agree with the politics but the guys doing the job are great
me
im glad they got the sob
the torture scenes are made to seem like just another day at the office
which is probably about what it is like after the decision was made to do it
ageold question  does the end justify the means
810
i couldnt follow this any better than i could the hurt locker
it was way too slow and long and the conversationsmeetings were too hard to understand who and what they were talking about
i even had subtitles turned on wish it had made more sense but unfortunately it didnt
what is zero dark thirty supposed to represent
anyway i am sure there are plenty of fans of this movie out there
but i am not one of them and this movie wasnt for me
hoping for a better offering from kathryn bigelow in the future after not understanding her last two films
would like to see something thats more to the point and adrenaline pumping like an 80s movie like point break which had a simple story
there is little sympathy for the characters not even the good guys
poorly constructed film and rather disjointed
in order to accept that there is some merit in torture to get information to protect our country one must be able to get into the heads of the characters and understand why they do what they do
in zero dark thirty the characters are muddy often vague and lacking any social redeemable qualities
they are not likable interesting or sympathetichow can we possible like them or even understand them and their motivation
in addition to the poorly defined characters the movie is choppy and poorly edited
it is often confusing and spotty
needless to say while i watched the full film i wish i had spent my time with another
i am seriously disappointed to say the least
aside from average acting and unrealistic situations the story has no continuity and is mildly boring at times
from the fact that 911 as much as we dont want to believe it is an inside job plus including the background of a long hunt the longer  the better americans had a long enough time and under terrorist danger enough money to build several bases all over the middle east and that was the real plan
obl was a real person but aside from that the entire dangerous man alive is a fairytale
i see a movie as just one more unconvincing try to fabricate the truth
at the end it is a very forgettable make believe propaganda
it could be seen as a fact for someone who was not alive at the time and didnt see what happen on that day in 2001
this is what happens when you encourage bad effort
the team of bigelow and boal was showered with praise for the horrible the hurt locker
now the inept team is back with an effort thats equally bad if not worse
told in a documentary style this is basically the story of investigative journalism which can be riveting if done right as in all the presidents men
boals script however is so excruciatingly boring that this one is painful to sit through
bigelow does not help matters with her drab direction
the film is nothing more than a series of meetings interviews and torture scenes
even the finale where the force makes its way through bin ladens compound fails to be compelling
i have not seen a worse movie in a long time
this is a unique combination of boredom as it is 2 and half hours long with poor pace and cut
bad moviemaking full of clichas and bad ripoffs there is not a single good actor to find in the whole long film and i mean really not a single one
the leading lady is absolutely unable to play and the lesser roles are packed with second grade tv series actors who look laughable in a serious movie
but what disturbed me most was the lack of any taste morality or at least an opinion
the first part of the movie is packed with pretty graphical examples of torture by cia and us army mostly on kidnapped people in black prison sites all around the world
in the movie it goes without even mentioning if this is ok legal or even productive as the suspects even in this movie tend to lie even more under duress
so the question that remained unanswered for me after seeing this movie is in what sense is the us actually better than alkaida when they are both using the same methods to win a war
i thing tis movies is just to show us that osama bin laden had been killed but in reality he is not killed and he was supposed to be the cia agent and made by america and they just captured him as they do not want to kill him as he must be the alone to have a large information and and had become the serious threat for the us government and this all has been done with the help of rothschild i
e
all on the script of the rothschild not by the us government as they want all the banks to be work under the rothschild and now only 3 countries have been left and they are north koreacuba and iran
us also have started to get them under the rothschild central bank
kathryn bigelow is certainly one of the most meticulous filmmakers in history
and she does not take sides but leaves judgment to the viewer
this movies depicts that the cia and al khaida in essence share exactly the same moral values  that is to say none at all jessica chastain is absolutely superb as the truly despicable fanatic cia agent desperate for success
i find violence against women lower than low but this maya could actually make me change my mind
the rest of the cast is on par as well
the movie has some flaws as to the accuracy of the country settings but all in all is certainly very recommendable
i read that the original script was written about the decade long search and failed manhunt of osama bin laden but was completely re written months before filming began once american forces had found and killed him
in hindsight this is really lucky because i felt the film really picked up pace once the pakistan fortress was introduced and especially during the half hour long night raid
jessica chastain gives another great performance as the strong and smart cia operative whos ten year work was the backbone of finally hunting down the worlds most wanted man
other roles are played well enough but it really rests on chastains shoulders
the movie was released at the perfect time following the true events that took place
im glad that they didnt release this a year earlier or i feel it would have felt unfinished ala zodiac
one of 4 movies when i saw it i wanted to kill all americans
the worst thing that most of all stuff was true
in real life it was worse than in movie
i just think they allowed whemselves way too much
i donate anybody who show them that they are not centre of the world
you cant say anybody  live like that live like that
if people in east want to live different so ok
and not bin laden started the war
america all the time was dictating the rules for pakistan afganistan
bin laden just strong leader who sayed no and he have my respect
one person who said no for all u
s
a
after that u
s started invasion killing everybody bla bla bla and so on
but for me winner is bin laden
need more strong persons like him
i think the movie has a very good composition
it starts with 711 and ends 10 years later where osama binladen gets killed
i like how they showed us everything in the movie every way they tortured the terrorists and how they used their technology to catch all the high ranks al qaeda members
its a very good movie that has a good acting instead of just making a documentary
its very exciting because of its composition and how they act exactly like how it happened in real life
the movie makes you feel all kind of angry feelings and sad feelings because its a very good acting
if you didnt know anything about al qaeda and terrorism this would have been just like a very exciting movie thats how i like it
you get a lot of knowledge and you actually like to watch this movie
the zero dark thirty is a good movie because it sets everything in a different kind of view
the movie definitely raise a lot of ethical questions like is it okay that cia torture terrorists or friends of terrorists to get information out of them
maybe even information thats not really relevant when they first figure them out
it make us see the terrorists view of the whole thing and instead of a sad movie like movies about the twin towers its a harsh movie that take it in the roots
weve given the movie 9 out of 10 stars because its a great movie and make you think of a lot of different things and force you to actually have an opinion
when this movie released there was so much hype about it and all that
then with all the nominations for the oscars made me really wanna watch this and when i finally got around to watch i was disappointed
the acting was so artificial at times
the scenes that were meant to get your heart pumping faster were not doing there jobs
i was just going through the motions
some scenes were so clichad
the dialogues so banal and trite
overall i felt that it was a let down
i dont know if it was the hype or over expectations
but this movie was a let down in every way i went in expecting to see a fast paced thriller about one the greatest events of our generation and came out disappointed
it is amazingly well done
but it is not entertaining and not particularly gripping because we already know the ending
there is almost zero human element in this movie and without that i am not interested
i think the movie that comes closest to this in concept is bridge on the river kwai
now that was involving and entertaining
bigelow
who cares its all technical
i wasnt really bored but i was looking at my watch a lot
does jessica chastain really have much to do as an actor here
it must be great to get in an important movie but there is really little character to establish
the hype for this one is over but if anyone ever asks me in the future if i would recommend it
not on your life
i was really looking forward to this movie after seeing the previews and reading some of the nominations it was receiving
however the movie itself was dull for the first 34 of the film
the story revolved around a single person working on finding obl which made it very boring
its funny because ive also seen the movie seal team six the raid on osama bin laden which is a lower budget film than this one yet had much more explanation as to how they found osama and how they knew it was him
not to mention a better side story and more action
despite being the bigger box office film i would suggest watching the seal team six film over this one anyday
im very surprised by all the horrible reviews 1 star
as i thought it was well made interesting and entertaining
its certainly no hurt locker but its far from bad in my opinion
one of the few things that really bugged me were the horrible american accents
i kept trying to figure out whether the character of dan was supposed to be from the us or not
seemed weird for him not to be but he sure didnt sound like he was
and the national security head stephen dillane didnt even try to sound american
can someone in that post be british
a strangely big and distracting detail for bigelow to miss
but i thought all else was good to very good especially chastain
no disrespect to the actual participants in the real story but i found it hard to believe that at the end of the film the same amount of navy sealsunshaven amp long haired
that were in two helicopters were picked up with much contraband and a body by one helicopter in addition was maya really returned to the us by an air force c5 galaxy alone
lastly was the f bomb really needed as much as it was used
lets remember poetic license has its limits
lastly the extreme darknessno pun intendedmade it very hard to view the invasion of the bin laden compound
i think the lighting director could have done better so the viewer would be able to comprehend the action
i think the hurt locker was a much better film
for nonamericans this is one brain washing movie
really really poor
and amount of the violence way the characters are build is upsetting
and about their propaganda that theres a question at the end of movie or that theres a story that covers both sides well there isnt
american propaganda movie
just like argo
i mean i dont understand how these americans works
they introduce the all thing as it is as it should be introduced but then at the end of movie you end up wondering ok whose crazy here
they came to this countries invaded them stole their resources and stuff and then act like what the hell is going on
why these people hate us attack us etc
and i say these is one of that kind of movies
and im very frustrated that i watched this movie
this is all politics and it is lame
to be falling by the wayside after all the ruckus in the press about the socalled torture scenes
i saw a movie a couple of years ago with samuel l
jackson or laurence fishburne in which they pretend to be a terrorist torturer but actually are in this cia sound stage in new jersey
they cut off at least four fingers from this terrorist sympathizer before whacking him
to get bin laden you would think that just four fingers would a childs play compared to what the detainees actually would be willing to give up before they spilled the beans
but in zero dark thirty all the help lady needs to do is have one of her buddies pour a little water into this guys mouth and hes blabbing away like a brook
golly this is a desert for crying out loud
guys would be saying thank you for a little extra water in real life
so just what was all the hullabaloo about
if evil folks are going to go around blowing up skyscrapers and jets full of people they should feel theyre getting off easy if the price of being captured is anything less than four fingers
the film itself was so boring to me
and the people in it always do so evil things
and they still do
people are getting nobel price just for killing innocent people
rage is always wrong and so is this film
what do you think a good movie makes
say is was all alike
and what is cool
just to say it is all because of a good reason
it is so sad
i do not understand why this film has such a positive feedback in the us
without a judge they are killing men
there is nothing ok about it
it is like a documentation that makes it even worse
so for me as a german guy
i hate what i have seen in this film
and i hate what i hear at the radio and on the tv
at this time americans are flying over foreign countrys and killing people the do not even know
the are killing children and other people which are not in warfare
what is it
in this era where hollywood is considered to be the penultimate platform for making a movie that is considered to be a subtle and profound art the film waar has astounded me to a great extent
im a big fan of hollywood movies but when a below average movie like zero dark thirty gets critically acclaimed all over the worldgets an oscar and on the contrary top 1k voters vote waar an average of 2
4 it literally confuses me
waar depicts the most enduring problem of that country terrorism
script is immaculately written fighting mechanics and physics are impressive and the acting is astoundingly very good that puts the viewer into the very heart of the plot
waar should deserve much more than an applaud
i would recommend everyone to watch this movie with an unbiased opinion
way to go pakistani cinema
ill give this 210 for according to others the film was fairly well made
but its balony
theres absolutely zero proof that osamausamah bin laden was even alive in 2011 much less killed by us forces that year
theres also zero proof that he had anything to do with the attacks of 911 and some washington people even say that he was involved with the 1993 wtc bombing which he had nothing to do with though the fbi most certainly did and even the nyt reported this
this film clearly has been intended to give a boost to propaganda propaganda of deceptiondeceit
its only suitable for the fan boys and girls who like to believe andor promote lies about the real world
have your feast dining on a bed of lies
zero dark thirty is a film with no real substance
as almost everyone knows what the outcome will be it being the biggest news story in many years some attempt could have been made to address the issues surrounding what may well be a very important moment in history
such as why muslim terrorists are willing to go to such extreme lengths to attack western targets and why america would go to such lengths to get one man
more importantly it was a very lopsided one dimensional view of what is a very complex story
the unsubtle insinuation that torture especially water boarding helped capture bin laden and is therefore acceptable is disgusting
over and above all this there is still the burning question of whether a nation that promulgates liberty and justice served these ideals in any way by shooting a man essentially in cold blood and dumping his body at sea instead of bringing him to trial
plus the fact that the the film gives the impression that maya the lead character was the only person really after bin laden makes it a dreadful movie
