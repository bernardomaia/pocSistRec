i really loved monsters inc but this movie failed to meet expectations
yes it offers a little back story on two of the most memorable characters of all time but i was not attached to them like i was during the first movie
the best scenes are at the end when roz makes an appearance
mike and sully are great characters but in the first one you had some minor characters who made the movie much more charming roz boo etc
and i just didnt find myself growing any attachment to mikes college nerd buddies
a good movie and maybe would be much more entertaining to someone who hasnt seen the first little kids would giggle at the monsters im sure but this movie misses the mark
i just prepared for something more all these times after monsters company
it supposed to be a monsters world with some unique characteristics that tell the whole story beyond human thingsbut unfortunately monsters university wasnt a good second tale about themalso with many goofs about the background of mike and sullivan which my 7 years daughter also noticed it
but making joke about some old fashion universities legitimationsome crazy honored clubs and circles arent bad at all
somehow the whole story lowered as some teens movies about going to college and hell of being a freshman
i just hope nobody suggest it as oscar nominated animation of year
this movie brings back the characters we loved from the previous one and gives us a nice throwback to their beginnings
typical collegelaughs and situations that can be extremely related to reality makes both kids and adults enjoy and laugh from the very first minute to the end
a very g rated approach to college life sytle with the bullyjuggies the studying guy pretty girls outcasts goths amongst many others
pixar really never fails to amaze me
like in their previous movies every little detail is thought and applied form the main characters to the background settings of the movie
an absolute gosee
oh and parents dont go and throw your children to the movies you might as well enjoy it
its always been said that second parts are never good
however pixar is an exception to the rule
first with toy story 2 and toy story 3 both moving stories from the point of view of children and adults
realizing how hard is to grow up
now with monsters university they take you to a world full of fantasy where mike wazowski is the perfect metaphor of a person who follows his dreams and even exceeds his own expectations
trying to become a professional scarer he finds his way to become the best coach at monsters university
a touching movie that teaches you that if you never learn to be scare you will never learn to be brave
now
on to the review
the story of the origin of the friendship between oneeyed mike wazowski and the blue furred james p
sullivan in their freshman year at monsters university
this film has homages to all the classic college comedy movies and as it doesnt hold out on laughs for the kids and adults it has a great amount of heart
questions of what the future holds and if our dreams are as possible as we hope they are
punches arent pulled on these questions which is why it isnt just some animated movie to take the kids to see
now
on to the review
the story of the origin of the friendship between oneeyed mike wazowski and the blue furred james p
sullivan in their freshman year at monsters university
this film has homages to all the classic college comedy movies and as it doesnt hold out on laughs for the kids and adults it has a great amount of heart
questions of what the future holds and if our dreams are as possible as we hope they are
punches arent pulled on these questions which is why it isnt just some animated movie to take the kids to see
the first monsters inc film came out when i was 10 having this film come out in 2013 with me going to university feels so right and is proof that these films are made for adults as well as kids
the film itself is a great story of the friendship between the impeccable duo mike and sully when they werent on good terms with each other although we know what the outcome is the journey throughout the movie of these 2 characters is great to witness
although the film never really captures what university life is like and never really relying on funny material from that scenario it instead creates a funny cast of memorable monsters
although it isnt as good as the first film monsters university is a great nostalgic throwback to my childhood
just like toy story 3 and most likely the eagerly anticipated finding dory
i couldnt wait for this movie to come out
ive been watching the trailers for so long it was great to finally go
i went with two 8 year olds and it didnt disappoint
didnt hear a peep out of either of them
held their attention from start to finish
mine too
great story with characters we already love
no there is no boo
remember this is a prequel
everyone asks that questionit was great to see how sully and mike came to be friends
also how some rivalries were begun
gives a true college feel for animated monsters
lol
the new characters are great i hope we can look forward to a trilogy from monsters
i think this is one for all ages to enjoy
humor for all
a summer time must see movie
i watched this movie last night and loved it
its probably my favorite movie and i watch lots of movies but i usually say that every movie is my favorite moviethis movie beats them all
i only watched monsters inc
about two weeks ago probably because i was born in the year that movie came out s obviously i didnt see it
but monsters university really made me want to have another movie like it
its about mike wizowskis dream of being a scarer and he goes to mumonsters university to learn
but he gets kicked out of the scare program like james sulivan they dont like each other yet
mike forms a scare team for the scare games which included monsters that youd never think would make it so he could get back in the scare program he made a deal
im not going to say anymorei know this kind of spoiled it because you have to watch it yourself
its the best
so if youre thinking of which movie to watch but youre unsure choose this movie because you will be pleased
lt3
i like the monsters university but it should not be considered as monsters inc
2 considering im sure everyone agrees monsters inc
2 should consist on what happens after sully opens boos door in the first monsters inc
seriously pixar ends the movie like that makes everyone want to know and expect there to be a sequel and then they say its coming and its not even a sequel to the first movie
the only thing i am very disappointed in pixar about doing
toy story at least has a following story of what happens next and cars but what about the whole monsters inc
instead of going back in time and calling it monseters inc
2 why not make an actual monsters inc
2
and leave monsters university as just that
the first one hour of the movie is full of clicha and seems very childish
when i saw the twistit became interesting and i started to like it
this movie is full of clicha and forced humor but doesnt make it dull to the end
mikes intellect impressed me when they scare police in the room
mikes teammates provide most of the humor and puncheswhich i liked very much
one thing which may be embarrassing to even grown ups when grand pa get engaged and he babbles some dialogs about brotherhusband
most strong point of the movie is its story line which amazingly keeps the flow of movie impressively
best thing about the hollywood writers these days are that they squeeze lot of content in less duration say 130 or 140
so the verdict is some parts may sound silly but overall its a lite entertainment which can be enjoyed by everyone
cute inoffensive family fare its nice to get back in touch with two of my favorite pixar characters but this film is so light airy and spacious i couldnt help wondering if we all might have been better served by a short featurette
most of the returning secondary cast is relegated to brief cameos  particularly steve buscemis serpentine villain randall who pops in and out in a set of very brief flashes  and their replacements generally play one note at best
in its heart monsters u is dying to mimic the kind of campusfriendly formula perfected by animal house and revenge of the nerds but its kneecapped by a much younger target audience and the cast feels almost universally shoehorned into unfamiliar terrain
it enjoys some lively moments and a few solid laughs plus the banter between goodman and crystal is as sharp as ever but the scope feels much much smaller than the preceding monsters inc
and the story never really shifts out of first gear
monsters university is a pretty decent movie but it lacks a lot of the charm the first film had
i think a lot of that has to do with how original the story was initially and how that unique element is lost a bit in further iterations
i think boo provided a lot of the charm in the first movie as well
it wasnt so obvious until watching a movie without her
obviously mike and sully were both great but the competition with which the film is built upon feels a little weak
i know its a childrens movie but thats kind of the problem
while monsters inc
was a film that the adults could appreciate this one is more of a pure kiddy flick
its still entertaining to a certain extent but without a lot of the depth from the first one its ultimately just a fun kids movie and not much more
i have a 9 year old daughter and when this came out in the theater she didnt want to see it because she thought monsters were scary
well needless to say i got her to watch the first one at home and then she wouldnt stop talking about seeing university
she was confused at first because this takes place before the original but once i explained things to her she understood and loved the rest of the movie
i loved it too not only because i saw how happy my daughter was but because it was a great prequil to the original i saw
i give this a full thumbs up
i would recommend you take your kids to see this or buy the video when it comes out because its worth it
if not to let your children enjoy but to have in your collection
i love pixar and one of my favorite movies is monsters inc
so i was really looking forward to it
it didnt quite measure up to the original but it is still an enjoyable film
the only thing i didnt like was that it was an unoriginal story it was essentially revenge of the nerds with monsters
that kind of disappointed me
pixar has succeeded because of their fantastic storytelling and that definitely was the worst part
other than that it was funny and heartwarming things that normally see from pixar
billy crystal and john goodman were great with the voice work
i certainly find it better that brave and cars 2 so its a step in the right direction for pixar after 2 decent attempts
i give it a solid 810
i feared pixar had finally spoiled their creative touch and had come down with a terrible case of sequelitis
but then i actual saw monsters university
this film is a joy to experience from beginning to end
its utterly gorgeous on a technical level sure but it also transcends the various clichas that could have been with such a touched on premise
the result is a special film that more than does the terrific monsters inc justice
a really thrilling prequel always funny and exciting that takes the clichad premise of overcoming our own limits and turns it into endless fun  and it will leave you sure that pixar is finally back on track after its two previous weak forgettable entries
this is an unique idea to transform monsters to be something educated
how human can be their objective of learning and the biggest dream to award the scariest monster ever
viewers perhaps find the different filming between monsters university and monsters inc
monsters university is more dramatic
kids can lost the original story because of boring conversations on the middle but the colorful screen and the humorous quotations help kids to imagine what coming next and what is the ending becoming to
the ending is simply mysterious because some characters are mentally developed not only mike the one eye
mike is the trigger to present the genuine of each characters beside him
the good characters become vanished and the evil characters replace the main roles
the ideology that cartoon is always happyending perhaps cant stand in monsters university because monsters university delivers the new pop ideology
kids you should learn from the monsters
i am definitely not the type of person would bug without any reason
in fact im pretty kindhearted when it comes to rating movies
i absolutely loved cars 2
much more then cars
brave was amazing as well
i didnt hate it
but unfortunatelyi cant do that with mu
now it feels like pixar lost its magic
the movie was very simple
i do like simple things but not in animated movies
the whole movie was spent on just a stupid game
pixars movies had something we could learnsomething we could talk
there was a scene alwayswhere it felt like everythings going to fall apartand then there would be that motivational scenewhere the main leads would muster up the courage and do once again
obviously i missed boo
another thing what i think is necessarythat there should be a female lead along with the male in every animation
dont get me wrong but almost every movie with both leads have been very successful
among their groupnot a single was a woman
a woman character definitely add up excitement to a movie
sorry folksbut this didnt work for me
it had been years since i watched monsters inc
so i wasnt sure how id react to watching this prequel
it actually is quite funny in spots but the drama of mike trying so hard to fulfill his dreams and how sully often fails to life up to his family reputation permeates most of the film
still i had a good enough time watching this and also hearing steve buscemi again as one of the college students was a hoot to listen to
oh and i recognized another of the voices as that of a murray brother but i thought it was brian doylemurray and not joel
and yes billy crystal and john goodman are once again charming enough as the lead voices here
so in summary monsters university is a good enough followup to its previous predecessor
i would first like to say that i liked the original monsters inc
i would give it a 7
5
this one is a 2
there is no plot
they go back to when they are in school together and have scare competitions
mike wazowski is not scary and is trying so find himself and the goodmans character is from a long line of stuck up my s dont stink monsters
big surprise they team up and learn some stuff along the way
you can fill in the predictable blanks yourself
geniuses mustve sat up all night dreaming this one up
monsters university is to monsters inc as american pieband camp is to american pie
a cheap knockoff of the original
the only thing that saves it from being a 1 is the voice acting
goodman and crystal are good at what they do
but i dont know how they signed up for this
not that your kids will hate it for sure
but you will
maybe because we know already from monsters inc
that mike and sulley go on to work as a team on the scare floor of the powerful energy company there is little drama in the conflict this prequel establishes
that would be less of a problem if the film were nonstop funny but the humor in monsters university is sadly lacking
in the past when pixar films have fallen short on the story level theyve been jampacked with business and jokes  like maters confrontation with a bidet in the underwhelming cars 2  and breathtaking visual artistry
with monsters university its possible that audiences may begin taking pixars continued stateoftheart technical mastery for granted people arent as easily impressed if they dont care about what theyre watching
my boyfriend and i went to see this earlier today and i would have to say its a pretty good movie
i definitely recommend this to anybody who enjoyed the first monsters inc
movie
good for any age group
i was 6 when the first movie came out so i would have to say it was a good idea to make a movie based on college because i am starting my freshman year in college this fall
i heard a few little kids say after the movie that they were scared but i remember the fear i kind of had for the first movie so its nothing too serious
there were lots of giggles and laughs in the theater for the most part of the movie
its definitely a must see movie for disney and pixar fans
in my opinion university monster is better than monsters  inc  i found it more fun and funny the new characters are very nice  i liked to see how mike and sully met the monsters game times are very good  especially in race and the library  the soundtrack is good the final moments are great  them trying to scare the police  the last game also scares  this was the liveliest i most enjoyed  i do not understand why the critics and much of the public was so negative with this liveliest  the voice work again is very competent  i believe in the near future will have a direct continuation of monsters  inc  i hope so university monster would be second in my top 3 of pixar  is great fun and has very funny moments  its great to see this pair of monsters back

what drives the film is a story about friendship
although we assume the ending of the film the plot is not at all predictable
the movie is full of humor and interesting characters who easily create sympathy in the viewer as well as numerous representations of emotions that even the relatively evil monsters make real favorites
it has a lot of references that are related to real life and the people who have the same or similar viewpoints and problems because even the monsters are afraid of the real world
when all is summed up this is a great movie which was not on the same level as legendary toy story trilogy project or walle
its funny interesting and full of emotions
i recommend that you first watch monster inc
then monster university for a better understanding
there was a time when whichever film pixar made it never failed to impress me
that time has sadly passed
cars was the first disappointment
cars 2 just sucked
luckily these were the exceptions
toy story 3 walle amp brave were all excellent
the problem with monster u is that its just a plain and simple highschool movie but with monsters duh
so a real cookie cutter story
the animation is gorgeous but it has gotten to a point where cartoonlike characters look as good as they are ever going to look if you dont want them to look photorealistic
great for kids i guess but adults do make up a large part of the pixar audience and story wise i feel a bit cheated
very funny movie every family will enjoy
has a lot of reference to monsters inc and before sully or even randal was even a scarer
this is set when sully and mike just met in uni and shows how sully was trying to be cool and how mike became friends after being enemies
this movie has good surprises i still think monsters inc is better this movie also fits in some puzzles pieces from monsters inc
there are places for improvement of this film but i think pixar has done a good job in making this film there are some sad bit like mike gets expelled from the uni but i like the ending and how its done when mike and sully get a job as a monster inc mail monsters then to scarers plus you also find out why randal hates sully and mike
this is a good film and it is worth watching with friends and family
monsters university is the sequel i
e
prequel to the first movie monsters inc
it is a very good and funny movie for children and for adults also
i recommend to watch the first monsters movie first because this one will be so much funnier when you connect the dots
i dont think anyone can dislike this movie and you definitely wont regret watching it
it has humor funny scenes a story and it gives great message about friendship
the only thing i didnt like about this movie is that i already predicted some of the upcoming scenes
but maybe thats just me
any way the ending did surprised me in the best way
so dont waste time reading all reviews call a friendmake popcorn and get ready to laugh out loud
i had serious worries after seeing the previews honestly they were not good
but my kids wanted to see it so i went along
it was much better than i expected
i liked the back story of mike and sully billy crystal really makes the movie
most of it was fairly predictable but rarely have i seen a childrens movie that is not
at the end people in the audience were clapping my only criticism is when mike and sully were not reinstated into the school of scaring at the end it would have made sense that the dean did this for them but it all works out for them as they go on to work for monsters inc
thus making us all remember the first movie in this series monsters inc
pixar seemed to be back on track after a dud of a movie in brave
hopefully the planes movie will be good as well
it was a very well made sequel which makes us understand how the comic duo of monsters that scare children
with great joy and excitement own of the university these two characters come in dozens of adventures together
the dream of the green monster was entering the university
sullivan being a popular monster and micke a nerd manage to join by one goal in common as both are expelled from the university
embarks on the adventures of this pair of friends who can surprise laugh and make the public if excite
give the congrats to pixar because it is not easy to make a sequel as good or better than the first movie
film for the whole family enjoy
im not a big fan of the pixar movies  ive not seen them all and dont plan to and i outright hate the incredibles for examples
having said that i liked this one
it is definitely an ok movie for a onetime watch and is more interesting and well animated than the original one
to be honest i never got the appeal of monsters inc
and why it was considered one if not the best pixar films
what more could be said about university
it is very pretty and beautifully animated but for pixar is not an achievement
it complements the universe of monsters with new parts of the world  but not beyond anything outlined in inc
sometimes it is a desperately short flight of imagination and poetry but sometimes it takes the original most banal clichas
monsters university
this is the best animated film i have watched in dis year
brilliant film made by pixar studios
there last flcks were quite disappointed but monsters university was just awesome
u will love it
engaged the plot from starting till the end
the story is well written and portrayed in a different way
mike character is very awesome intellgentclever
the way he lead the team was terrific
scare games are awesome
i dun know when i have seen these type of flicks ill get excited and ill inovle in it
many funny characters introduced in this film
had fun while watching them
scenes between mike and suly were too good
very good dialogues written for them
i love animated films and i loved monsters university to the core
this year best film so far i can say
do watch it
like most cartoon sequels monsters university a followup to monsters inc
plows more existing ruts than new territory
helen mirren is added to the cast as a counterpart for hogwarts new principal after dumbledore was ousted in a nazi coup dolores umbridge
apparently imelda stauntonwho played umbridge in harry potter and the order of the phoenixwas unavailable to voice her monsters clone dean hardscrabble so queen elizabeth iii mean mirren took over in her stead
this being aimed at a younger audience than the potter series the threat of expulsion is about as serious of a menace as hardscrabble can pose there are no monster hands dripping blood from compulsory writing assignments here
the final test of the monster decathlon smacks somewhat as a parallel to the climax of harry potter and the goblet of fire as an ostensibly academic situation becomes a foray into the threatening adult world
unlike in the potter storyline no students die for real here however everyone has a h
e
a
type outcome
what a great movie
disney finally did a movie right
what a great message to send out especially to the school age children that will get it
glad to have taken our small children who are ages 3 and 5
definitely cute enough for the small kids to see it
some scary parts here and there  hoping my kids will still go to bed and sleep ok tonight  but not terribly scary
i am so happy to finally see a movie sending out good messages for the kids that will get it
very funny for the adult entertainment
would go see it again
the whole message is to never give up on your dreams no matter how many people how much they put you down use your smarts to get ahead and a great emphasis on teamwork
good work pixar disney
monsters university 2013 voices of  billy crystal john goodman steve buscemi helen mirren peter sohn joel murray sean hayes dave foley charlie day alfred molina tyler labine nathan fillion aubrey plaza bobby moynihan noah johnston julia sweeney bonnie hunt john krasinski bill hader beth behrs bob peterson john ratzenberger frank oz superb prequel to the pixardisney classic with the origin story of how dynamic duo mike wazowski and james p
sulley sullivan crystal and goodman reunited feels so good met in college as competitive rival students aspiring to be scarers and eventually bffs with a ragtag motley crew of coeds and frat rats to boot
funny frenetic and wonderfully animated thanks to the warmhearted and looselimbed direction by dan scanlon who collaborated on the well constructed screenplay by robert l
baird and daniel gerson
newcomer sweeney as the overly sweet mom of one of the duos classmates steals the show but the true star is the eye candy colored universe of the merry monsters
one of the years best
this movie is one of the pixar
the story is the past of monsters inc
sulley and mike are best friends
but in the past they were rival
mike enters monsters university
in the university monsters learn the way of surprising children
mike always studies it very hard
however sulley is also a student of the university
he is the best student of the university
there are no person who win sulley
mike tries to win sulley
but he cant win him
however they are cooperated about a plan
they fail the plan and are expelled from the university but their hardness is considered and said they can enter the university
like these this story led our think importance of friends
we cant do everything live alone so we should prize your friends
if you have rivals they become friends finally
i will admit to being nervous about this film because monsters inc
is one of my favourite animated films of all time and i didnt want this film to be bad like i believe the past few have been
luckily this film is great not as good as the original but great none the less
this prequel to the original is based showing a younger mike and sulley in university and how they go from enemies to best friends
the main positive for this film is its heart there are scenes that will hit you where you live and make u feel even more love for these two characters
but also these side characters who i thought would just be an annoyance turn out to eventually be almost as important as these two guys and they grow on you
with the great animation twists and turns and colours that will stand out provide this film with a great coming of age story for two characters
however it does slow down a bit at times and gets a bit boring but then a nostalgic moment hits you and makes you laugh
this is a great film hopefully leading to more great pixar films
many of the disney efforts of the past several years have been hampered by too much filler in the story line they have at best an 80 minute tale but they stretch it 110 instead nemo being a good example
this has a much tighter plot largely focusing on the college experience of mike and sully
this has all been done before in one fashion or another but the story moves along pleasantly enough to a fair conclusion
billy crystal and john goodman fill their roles as well as in the original and in fact this is a better story than the first one the exception rather than the rule for sequels
i particularly liked the short played before this movie the blue umbrella
its hard to review a pixar movie
the benchmark is set too high that you dont expect anything but the best
mu suffers from the same kind of expectations that pixar fans carry with them
no doubt movie is nicely built college rivalry story with some funny moments some heart rendering moments
but this is not enough for pixar fans
movie has conventional treatment and very few funny moments in first half
most of the fun is generated by how monsters carry themselves as if they are humans
second half is much stronger with supporting characters providing lots of fun movie not following the usual underdogs story pattern and lead characters getting enough screen time alone
at the end you wont be able to say that it is the incredibles or up in the series of pixar movies but it is definitely brave or monsters inc
ok
can someone explain to me pleaz
disney is like a school to kids
what are they trying to tell children from this movie
is it a form of di caprios inception
and why they are promoting ghosts and horror to children
and telling themyes dont sleep
monstersi will come to u
wow
whats happening
should kids watch that movie
and what would happen after they do
i dint find any worthy message for a child
its like they want to misdirection the minds
its like presenting posion in some beautiful dish
we should watch those kind of movies that talk bout ghosts and monsters before letting our kids watch it
