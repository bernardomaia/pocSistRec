"\nI thought the movie was awesome.<br><br>The main secret that the makers of the movie left out was where did the\nsupernatural power come from. The question was asked throughout the\nmovie and even in the end it was brought up again. I feel like for many\nthis was a big problem, but for me I felt it left good curiosity.<br><br>The overall movie was filmed well. I thought it was going to be a\nregular story about someone who becomes a here etc. However the movie\nwas formed off of realistic scenarios. Scenerios mixed with the science\nfiction elements made the movie bring a sense of realness.<br><br>Something I liked about the movie is the emotion brought out in each\ncharacter with the gained super power. I feel like each person watching\nthe movie could at least relate to one of them.<br><br>To sum it up, awesome movie and great actors.\n"
"\nI had actually had quite high hopes of Chronicle but what a\ndisappointment. What made things worse is that I am not a fan of\nHandcam films like this which makes it even worse.<br><br>Technically very polished from a special effects view although there\nwere not many in the film, the story itself is a real let down and\nultimately one can guess whats going to happen next, right up to the\nend, all very predictable.<br><br>Soundtrack wise nothing to write home about, the actors screaming\noccasionally only made things worse.<br><br>All in all a really terrible film with little depth and if there are\nany hidden meanings? well hardly worth the effort trying to read them.\n"
"\nThis is the worst film I have seen in ages. The premise looked\npromising but the film they made was just so unbelievably bad. If you\nthink you'd like nearly 2 hours of extra-shaky hand-cam footage,\nspectacularly annoying idiots yelling at each other, and repetitive\nspecial effects with lots of stuff breaking, then this is the film for\nyou. The three main characters are dumb beyond belief and it's\nimpossible to sympathize with any of them. There is no explanation as\nto how the super powers came about and the characters don't spend one\nmoment thinking about how they could change their lives or anyone\nelse's lives for the better. They just do a bunch of dumb things and\nthen they do a bunch of even dumber things. Do yourself a favour and\nwatch anything else. I cannot believe how high the ratings are for this\npiece of garbage!\n"
"\nFound footage is now a business model exclusively and this horrible\nthing makes it extremely obvious. Whole plot devices are crafted merely\nas an alibi for cameras being around in the most implausible situations\nto accidentally set up a perfect OTS shot. Being limited in telling a\nstory, when everything needs to fit into a situation with some kind of\ncamera around, the directors elegant solution of course is to convert\n85% of the unimaginative dialog into exposition, spoon-feeding you the\ntwo dimensional, infantile melodrama, leaving 10% to explain the camera\npresence in some way and adding 5% of irritating bull crap that I guess\nthe writers thought modern teenagers would say when behaving naturally.\nThey wouldn't. For action there is no time.\n"
"\nThis Movie is a complete waste of time and money .. I went to a couple\nof dreadful movies such as \" open water \" and \" Jumper \" but this movie\nwas the best of beating them in all kinds of awfulness .. and for that\na friend of mine just couldn't stand watching it and just went out the\ntheater going for \" Sherlock Holmes 2 \" which was running in the\ntheater beside us although it was his SECOND TIME watching it !!<br><br>I Admit that the visual effects was good comparing it to other bad\ngraphic movies but unfortunately it wasn't applied with a better story\n.. the action and the thrill in the last half an hour was COMPLETELY\nruined by the shaky hand camera and the bizarre pauses and skipped\nscenes were so Annoying . <br><br>I Just need a 0 or .5 rating star in IMDb to give it to movies like\nthis one<br><br>For God Sake .. DON'T WATCH THIS AWFUL MOVIE !!\n"
"\nAs a lot of the other reviewers, I went into this movie with mediocre\nexpectations and not only did the movie meet them but exceeded them\nvery high. This is one of the best movies I have seen in awhile. The\nfirst 40 minutes makes it out to be a teen-buddy movie then in the\nsecond half it does a complete 180 that you do not see coming at all. I\nwas on the edge of my seat throughout the second half. Special effects\nwere very impressive as a lot of it looks very real. Also very strong\nperformances by some new fresh face actors, especially the ones that\nplayed Matt and Andrew. I see them having a bright future in\nHollyweird. Overall, I recommend to see in theater. 8/10\n"
"\nChronicle is the Blair Witch Project of the super hero flicks.<br><br>The good. Surprising. Funny. Immersive.<br><br>The actors. Dane DeHaan, Alex Russell, and Michael B. Jordan who play\nthe main characters give us a very good performance. You really get\ninto the mood of those guys goofing around, it's crazy. DeHaan, who\nplayed the troubled kid, is even excellent. Nice ending.<br><br>The bad. At some point, the hand-held camera premise got a bit\nconstrictive and they had to find an other camera totting character,\nthe blogger. That was one too many, and you loose the intimate feeling\nof the group.<br><br>The ugly. When they couldn't keep the hand-held camera premise anymore,\nthey shifted to include CC camera. There's even a shot done from a\npoint of view where there's no \"naturally occurring\" camera.<br><br>The result. Really worth the seeing, just don't expect perfection.\n"
"\nMatt is a regular popular guy. Steve is a regular guy. Andrew is a\nregular nerd. Their friendship is a little weird to understand in the\nbeginning, since they're not that similar to each other. One night\nthey're heading to a party and one of them falls in a hole. The other\ntwo fellas go down together, and in that hole something gives them\nstrong powers, which allow them to do anything they feel like doing. As\nthe film goes, Andrew starts abusing of his power and hurting people\nfor no reason. Matt and Steve try to calm him down, but they never\nsucceed. Acting is very good from the three main actors, with no\nexception. The whole story is VERY entertaining and interesting,\nprobably helped by a strong directing and a beautiful photography\ndirecting. The only thing that doesn't let me give this a higher rating\nis the saturated use of domestic camera-- not that I find this a bad\nchoice, but too many movies used this tactics recently.\n"
"\nWhat if some normal (American) guys get superpowers? Will they be\nheroes? Well, according to \"Chronicle\" not necessarily! This\n\"Cloverfield\" style movie is very entertaining and it raises some\nquestions about our times. And one sort of understands the guy who goes\nmad instead of using his powers for good. Bullying, abusive father, a\nsick medical system that does not grant his sick mother the help she\nneeds because of money issues.... Something to think about behind all\nthe noise and entertainment. The actors were great and talented, and\nthat made \"Chronicle\" in any case fun to watch. Good work... even if it\nis not always logical...\n"
"\nI loved the story of the film, and I thought that most of the acting\nwas believable, though Andrew's father's acting in some scenes wasn't\ngreat. I also felt disappointed as I'm afraid the trailer does reveal\nsome of the end scenes, so if you want to sea the film, don't watch the\ntrailer.<br><br>The film was filmed with a home camcorder, which I have to admit I had\nto get used to, however after a while it was fine. The film also did\nseem to drag on a bit, however it wasn't too bad.<br><br>I thought that overall the film had lots of heart, and was a big\nimprovement on these blockbusters which lack decent acting.\n"
"\nFound Footage done right<br><br>By now I'm sure we have all had our heads done in by the found footage\ncraze, spearheaded by the ever growing popular Paranormal Activity\nfranchise, which I consider to be some of the most uneventful pieces of\ncinema today. With Chronicle we get something that I have craved for in\na movie shot with hand held cameras: an actual story with interesting\nand complicated characters. All of our protagonists are regular people\nwho, in the midst of acquiring powers, must find out how to deal with\nthem and how it will affect everyone around them. The talent involved\nin the film is great, with all of the leads playing their roles\nsuperbly. Not only does this help the movie in its overall quality, but\nalso allows for the audience to connect to the characters they're\nseeing on screen. Although the style continues to bother me, the found\nfootage style has finally showcased its full potential with this\nfantastic film. If only there were more just like it.<br><br>Rating 8/10\n"
"\nI stumbled across this title when I was looking through the On Demand\nlibrary for a movie I haven't seen yet. I was encouraged by the\npositive reviews on IMDb, and they turned out to be right on target.<br><br>Chronicle compellingly explores how \"real\" teenagers might react to\nunexpectedly receiving extraordinary powers. Although I recognized none\nof the three young leads (or any of the supporting cast, for that\nmatter), each actor brought depth and humanity to his role and we\nshould see more of Dane DeHaan (Andrew) and Alex Russell (Matt)in the\nnear future. <br><br>The teens acquire their new skills early in the film, and the first\nhour is spent establishing their characters and relationships. Each one\ndeals with the abilities differently, and the movie grows increasingly\ndark and suspenseful as they unsuccessfully attempt to set moral\nguidelines for their conduct. I was literally on the edge of my seat\nduring the last 20 minutes as the fragile framework snapped.<br><br>Definitely recommend, you will not be disappointed.\n"
"\nFirst off bravo to Josh Trank and Mark Landis, this movie really hits a\nhome-run. The story of this movie really shows and tells about a\nproblem that is actually on the rise today such as the tragic Columbine\nshooting. Being a highschool student myself, popularity and the\npressures to fit in definitely has a toll on teens. Dane DeHaan did an\noutstanding job as Andrew Detmer, really showing the struggles of a\nneglected highschool teen, abused by his alcoholic father, and trying\nto help his dying mother. Alex Russell and Michael B. Jordan also did\nan excellent job playing the roles Matt Garetty and Steve Montgomery.<br><br>I have never really liked the first person camera perspective, but this\nmovie really did a good job with it. And once Andrew starts to float\nthe camera around to include himself in the recordings that made the\nperspective even cooler. I'm not going to spoil it for anyone who has\nnot watched the movie, but this is definitely a must-watch. Story,\nactors, plot, effects, and technicality are fantastic.\n"
"\nThis film is a good film. I was bored some parts of the concept. Like a\nbook, you can't judge it by it's cover. With a movie, don't judge it by\nit's trailer, and I fell for that... a little. The trailer looks good,\nand after all, these teenage boys did great acting, but what mattered\nwas the story. Besides the acting, all powers were cool, but I still\nthink it's a 7, If you read this review, don't fall for others. The\nmovie was good, not bad, not great.<br><br>After all, Chronicle was a folded piece of paper with good, not\namazing, but definitely not bad drawings on it. I hoped you people like\nthis review.\n"
"\nThis has to be one of the most stunning science fiction films I've\nwatched in a while (not since Donnie Darko) and one of the best\ncommentaries regarding pacifism and the abuse of power that has surely\nbeen made. The abuse of the vulnerable is not always handled very\nsympathetically, but in this case the total transformation it causes is\nseamless and one finds oneself egging them on for vengeance in the\nfirst instance and saying 'oh no, don't do that' in the next. There is\nplenty left unexplained and to think about afterward, which is often\nthe downfall of some stories. The references to previous science\nfiction films are endless, but handled in a completely unique way and\nthe special effects don't ever get in the way. Nice one Josh.\n"
"\nhow is a movie made to be? is it the pure density of action or fear? or\nthe purity of the movie itself. I've come to find myself in the\nposition where there is not much to say about a movie once you watch\nit. you saw it, great. but there are the ones that come in to play that\nall you want to do is hit the play button over and over again.\nchronicle was a very unusual type of film listing on not what people\nusually find in a movie. but the purity of a movie comes from the very\nfeeling, the soul content of a movie, the pure influence. chronicle was\na very strange movie in which along with the views of the camera (as\nshown the boy was filming in the movie). but it really did show the\nview point of it all. the teen, the people, everyone else. overall,\nchronicle is a rare treasure to find in a movie, and i am hoping very\nmuch for more\n"
"\nI was lucky enough to go to an advanced showing of Chronicle last week,\nand I didn't even have to pay. The movie follows the lives of Andrew\n(Dane DaHaan), his cousin Matt (Alex Russell), and their friend Steve\n(Michael B. Jordan) after they obtain telekinesis. It's a found film,\nso the camera work is a little shaky in the beginning, but the plot\nmore than makes up for that. The acting was also much better than\nexpected, especially considering the fact that these three are\nrelatively unknown. It's pretty easy to feel for the characters, so\nit's possible to see why they--especially Andrew--do what they do\nthroughout the movie. The special effects weren't the greatest. Some\nthings definitely looked like they were hanging on a string, but others\nwere better. All in all, it was an excellent film. I would definitely\nsee it again, and I'd even pay this time.\n"
"\nThis is a superhero movie done right. Film comes out of nowhere and\nwill definitely end up being one of the best of 2012. Great\nperformances. The actor that plays Andrew is one to watch. Extremely\nrelatable kid and if you're gone thru the same thing, the very raw\nscenes with his abusive father will hit close to home. The CGI is\nfantastic for a $15M production. A very interesting twist on the\nsuperhero genre that is fun for the first half and then becomes very\ndark with a third act that is so absolutely bonkers, it would Katsuhiro\nOtomo (Akira) proud. For a 80- minute movie they could've took their\ntime and fleshed out some characters a bit more but that's irrelevant.\nWithout question one of the most innovative, entertaining films I've\nseen in years. Go see it!\n"
"\nk special effects seamless, filming terrible, dialog terrible, its like\nthe Blair witch project without the flair (not that it had any) don't\nwaste your time watching movies like this, you want to watch a film of\nyour friends doing stupid stuff go outside and film it yourself it will\nturn out better than this movie. The plot about the abused high school\nkid who decides to film everything is not bad if it were a serious\nmovie about bullying shown in schools, this seems like another attempt\nto make a really cheap movie and steal as much cash from people as\npossible, (although some special effects are OK, the whole flight scene\nwas a waste of time)and yes the special effects would have cost a penny\nor two, it still seems like any first year film student could have\nthrown it together.\n"
"\nWhile i'm usually a big fan of lower budget film, Chronicle is\ndefinitely not one of them. <br><br>Its just random scenes thrown together for the hell of it (spoilers\nfrom here) then the 'loser' character gets a chick, then he gets sick\n(on her) and he goes psychotic. Its just plain rubbish. They bounce of\nwalls and fly around in circles and its all over. No meaning, no\njourney, very little in the way of story telling. The only thing this\nfilm has going for it is the CGI probably where 11 of the 12 million\nbudget went.<br><br>Chronicle for me (you might feel different and that's OK) is a film\nabout nothing.\n"
"\nFor me, herky-jerky first-person camera-work is unwatchable. I recall\nseeing it before, but I do not understand why any movie would feature\nit. Maybe for a few minutes. Hand-held cameras have been around for\ndecades, so it is not new technology. Maybe it is fun to watch if the\nviewer is doing lots of drugs. The ability for practically anyone to\nfilm stuff is somewhat new, but I do not understand why that would make\nit a good tool for a movie. And then there are periodic short skips in\nthe movie. Perhaps it is expressive in some way, like how to be\nannoying as possible while making a movie. Too weird IMO.\n"
"\nEvery now and then, a movie comes along with unknown actors and a low\nbudget, but then turns out to be far better than you'd ever believe.\nThis is such a movie. The acting is first rate, the plot intriguing,\nand the characters develop well as the plot unfolds. There are even\nsome mind-blowing special effects that are quite well done.<br><br>It's about three teenagers who discover they have developed\nsuperpowers. The three have distinct personalities, and handle their\nnew abilities in different ways. The story moves from teenage\nawkwardness to wonder, then spirals tragically out of control, with\nsome spectacular CGI along the way.<br><br>The acting by the three leads is very natural and convincing. Andrew's\nfather on the other hand was truly monstrous; so bad some may find it\nstrains credulity. Unfortunately though, there are real people like\nthat out there; if you find the father's character unbelievable just\nthank your lucky stars.<br><br>I'll give this movie 9/10 because it exceeded expectations so\nspectacularly. So...why is this movie not more well known?\n"
"\nI'm normally not a big fan of the handycam filming technique. In the\nbeginning it was all new and okay but personally I think they should\nstop that technique. It doesn't do movies any good. Not that Chronicle\nis a bad movie though. It's definitely something else then the usual\nsuperhero movies that we see so much lately. Here three kids get\ntelekinetic super powers after discovering a strange thing underground.\nWhat starts as a bit of fun quickly escalates in catastrophes. The\nstory is easy to follow. It's different then the usual action heroes\nthat use their powers to fight evil. The actors are all quite young and\nare not bad. Thinking about what they do with their powers makes me\nrealize that I would probably try the same things. But it's all\nfiction. So all in all it's an entertaining movie to watch.\n"
"\nIt was a supernatural movie. It was also a self-filmed movie by a group\nof teenagers. I liked the whole idea of the movie. It gave us lessons\nof humanity and how we should deal with our desires toward things.\nOften time people get over-desiring of what they want, using any ways.\nI think it's definitely fine to follow your dreams and to challenge\nyourself, but not when the method you use is against morals. I don't\nagree their way of using the power but it was a good lesson. If there\nare somewhere we can all become powerful, i wouldn't do it. because it\nis really a risk of relationships and lives. i didn't like the choices\nthey made but the fact that it was a well set up movie.\n"
"\n9.5/10<br><br>I personally love this kind of movie which has first person view\nthrough out the movie. I feel like it makes me feel like I'm in the\nmovie and actually seeing what's going on. I think this movie have done\na great job on that. This movie, even though the whole movie was about\nsomeone filming, it didn't look like a work of an amateur. I liked how\nthey involved all those security camera and other people's camera as\npart of the movie. I liked the character change in this movie too. The\nactors have fair skills of acting. The story was kind of predictable.\nHowever, I think the cinematography had covered all those imperfection\nof this movie. I believe this to be one of my favorite and the best (in\nmy opinion) movie that I watched until now. I really liked the\ncinematography and all that.\n"
"\nSo many movies consist of a band of unlikely people who are brought\ntogether by something intense - it's also common nowadays for films to\nbe about teenagers acquiring powers. However, Chronicle is a new twist\non the cliché. The way of filming is already the first obvious twist as\nit is shot in \"found footage\" style. The added fact that the camera is\nsupposedly moved by the boys mind is even more interesting. Not only\ndid the cinematography bring a fresh take on such a common basic story,\nthe actual plot in it's entirety really added a boost of something new.\nI can't say too much as I don't want to spoil the movie, but I would\nhighly recommend this movie to somebody who's interested in \"found\nfootage\" style of films and films that defy the clichés.\n"
"\nIt's not just the characters that are teens in this movie, it looks\nlike the writer and director are teens too. And I really wanted to like\nthis because it had a bullied kid get superpowers, but about 50 minutes\nin I got really annoyed that it still wasn't getting to anything that\ncould be called \"the good part\" and I started skipping forward. Only to\nfind that there is no good part. It's just a teenage wet dream of what\ngetting superpowers would be like. Even the pathetic attempts at\ndramatism and creating a philosophical core are cringe-worthy at best.<br><br>Just a waste of time, another IMDb score out of whack sending me on a\nwild goose chase.\n"
"\nChronicle is yet another found footage film about three guys who obtain\nsuperpowers.<br><br>Andrew,Steve and Matt are at a party when they discover a hole in the\nthe ground.They venture inside it and find a alien type of thing.They\nall think its cool until the thing starts making noises and starts to\nattack them.The three wake up with superpowers and decide to record\neverything they do with Andrews camera.They all think its funny and\ngreat until a redneck starts beeping the horn at them and Andrew pushes\nthe car of the road and into a lake.After that Andrew brings out his\ndark side and starts terrorizing the city.Its up to Steve and Matt to\nstop him before he destroys everything.<br><br>The special effects are OK but not Oscar worthy.The plot is good and\nthe ending was a big surprise.Overall Chronicle is a good found footage\nmovie thats worth seven out of ten.\n"
"\nThe film has a lot of qualities, which is not easy for a kids with\nspecial powers hand-held camera movie. It starts a lot like the Misfits\nshow, with three random teens getting telekinetic powers from a crystal\nlike thing in an underground tunnel, follows them around while they\ndiscover and experiment with their powers in ridiculous ways, then ends\nwith the inevitable conclusion in situations where weak people get lots\nof power.<br><br>The actors play well (although I am not sure Dane DeHaan will ever be\nable to get the role of a normal person any time soon), the special\neffects are subtle, but very well done, and the film captures the\nemotions of those involved perfectly, ranging from inadequacy, moving\nthrough camaraderie and pure joy and ending with despair.<br><br>A really good sci-fi film, one that not only is a well done movie, but\nalso makes a good point. And if you think it is a little boring at the\nbeginning, bare with it; it will be worth it.\n"
"\nThe benefit of the found footage genre, and one that director Josh\nTrank exploits here to the absolute limit of the envelope, is that\nwhere special effects and CGI look cheesy on a big budget they look\nimpressive and expensive on a small one. Wobbly angles, quick cut-aways\nas the action explodes and vague, indistinct long shots combine well.\nThe photo-realism of the hand held camera juxtaposed with the kind of\njaw-dropping FX once the sole reserve of James Cameron really make\nChronicle a movie worth watching.<br><br>Unfortunately the story is nothing new, nor complex in its execution.\nAkira did it better and with more pathos, atmosphere and originality\nback in the early 90s. It's a new spin on an old idea, but brings the\nconcept to a new audience, which is never a bad thing. It doesn't\ndeliver in terms of depth but the shallow fun to be had before things\nescalate to apocalyptic levels is certainly and undeniably\nentertaining.<br><br>A sequel would be interesting, if not compulsory.\n"
"\nThis film uses the device of \"young kids YouTube every aspect of their\nlives\" to tell the story of three teens who gain super powers after\nencountering a mysterious object in a cave. They develop the ability to\nfly, move things with their minds and become invulnerable to bullets.<br><br>Okay, to start with, they use the very tired convention that was\nstarted with \"The Blair Witch Project\", and continued with films like\nCloverfield and Quarantine. Here it works a little better because they\nshow the film comes from a number of sources, not just what the\ncharacter themselves were filming.<br><br>The film centers around the character of Drew, who has the alcoholic\nfather and the dying mother. So you understand when he finally loses\nit. The character of his cousin and their friend Steve are less\ndeveloped, and that's the film's weakness, I think.\n"
"\nUsing just a video camera, High School outcast, Andrew, documents the\nevents surrounding a recent discovery. In the woods, he and his friends\ndiscovered something unexplainable, something that gives them\nsupernatural powers. What I loved about this film, is unlike, many many\nothers, these kids didn't take these powers and become superheroes,\ninstead they did what any real life teenager would do and use them for\npranks, popularity, and various other things. Also unlike similar\n\"camcorder\" films, it wasn't jumpy or choppy and it was quite easy to\nfollow. The first hour of this film was amazing, unfortunately it did\ngo downhill at the end. The whole film was done in a realistic fashion,\nmaking science fiction seem possible, until the end, when all hell\nbreaks loose and it honestly just destroyed the whole thing for me. It\nwas such a strong start, but such an awful ending. Most of the cast\nwere newcomers and were very good, the story was also very solid, but\nthis film needs a much better ending if it wants to be considered a\nclassic.\n"
"\nChronicle: 8.9/10 Advertised as just another \"lost footage\" flick,\nChronicle proves to be anything but. With a surprisingly deep story of\nthree teens who are granted telekinesis powers, one starts to lose\ncontrol with his dying mother, abusive father, and harsh school life\nbeginning to break him down to his last nerve. The director created\ninteresting ways of filming the footage (such as moving the cameras\nwith their powers, using the \"bystanders'\" footage, and even footage\nfrom security cameras in buildings) putting a whole new twist on the\ngrowing genre. The story itself is also great, as the boys harness\ntheir powers after coming into contact with an alien-like object buried\nbeneath the earth. The biggest aspect of this film is that it feels\nreal, unlike \"Paranormal Activity\" and \"Apollo 18,\" which can seem just\nsilly at parts. But \"Chronicle's\" cast of characters show superb acting\nskills and I found myself feeling for every one of them. Altogether,\nthese elements craft a tremendous movie that seems to take a giant step\nin the right direction for the genre.\n"
"\n\"Chronicle\", directed by Josh Trunk, runs a brisk 90-some minutes, and\nit feels pretty quick too. (spoilers)The filmmakers in this movie have\nsucceeded in growing a palpable feeling of foreboding. There is\ndefinitely ominous signs thrown in all over the place - probably too\nmuch foreshadowing actually. Anyway, pretty much from the get-go you\ncan guess that things are not going to be nice and cheery to end the\nfilm. However, I greatly underestimated the magnitude of the explosion\nof aggression and violence that lit up the climax of this movie - quite\njolting. It was pretty well done technically and the young men who\nstarred (Dane Dehann, Alex Russell, and Michael Jordan) all did solid\njobs for the movie. I especially liked Russell as the peace-maker,\nbig-brother. Definitely worth a watch, and one of the better movies\nlately in early 2012.\n"
"\nat first when i heard about chronicle it sounded good until i heard\nabout the whole film being footage from a camera. as soon as it came on\nDVD i thought i would buy it just to see what it was like. at the start\nof the movie i thought it wasn't going to be that good but once they\nstarted using there powers i started to really like the film. the\nending was brilliant and so was the camera footage that they use\nthroughout the film. i would recommend this movie to anyone who likes\nsuper hero movies and to anyone who likes thrillers because it feels\nlike a thriller. plus the effects are amazing especially the flight\nseqeunces in which they are in the air.\n"
"\nThis is an entertaining and engaging movie. Do not let the \"shaky cam\"\nor hand-held cam discourage you from watching this movie because it is\nonly like that for the very beginning. It does not detract from this\nmovie at all. Anyways, The characters are young adults who happen to\nstumble upon super powers. The movie does a good job of keeping pace\nwith the boys as they learn to use their newly acquired abilities. My\nfavorite character was the main character because he is a socially\nawkward boy with a poor relationship with his family and friends. He\ngrows and changes as the story progresses and that's where things\nbecome really interesting. I feel like I can relate to the main\nprotagonist because he begins to feel resentful towards people once he\nbecomes more powerful. While this movie succeeds in many places\n(football scene in the sky and the car crushing scene) the ending was a\nbit unfortunate and lacked closure. Nevertheless it was an excellent\nfilm and deserves your attention.\n"
"\nHaving glanced at the description for this film, i excitedly watched\nthe trailer, only to have the excitement crushed. \"Oh no, this looks\nlike cloverfield\" i thought. <br><br>Doesn't anyone record films properly anymore...<br><br>Having watched this, outside of the cinema, it isn't all that bad. The\nplot is compelling, the characters and their actors are compelling, and\nthe development of the lads powers, make the scifi nerd in me want to\nfist pump.<br><br>However, camcorder style cinematics are terrible, both generally and\nspecifically. It is just awful, its like walking around with tunnel\nvision.<br><br>This could have been done in normal cinematic style and work frankly be\na lot better, and i'd have scored it higher.<br><br>But hey, at least it wasn't as bad as clover-field. Thank Christ.\n"
"\nI have to admit to being pleasantly surprised at the quality of\n\"Chronicle.\" As soon as I read that it was another \"found footage\"\nmovie, I was ready to dismiss it. Glad that I didn't. It's the best of\nthe genre, way better than \"Paranormal Activity\" or \"Cloverfield\" (and\nlet's not even mention \"Blair Witch\"). For starters, there's none of\nthe nauseating \"camera shaking\" meant to remind you that an amateur is\nfilming. (Don't we go to movies to see PROFESSIONAL camera work?\nOtherwise I'll watch my family's old home movies from trips to Europe!)\nAnd the acting is really quite superb - you nod your head and say,\nyeah, that's exactly how today's teens would act in these\ncircumstances. <br><br>There are some exquisitely done special effects, probably nothing\nground-breaking, but a couple of \"how'd they do that\" moments. And\nthere is welcome departure from some worn-out movie clichés. <br><br>All in all, two thumbs up. <br><br>And don't be surprised if there's a \"Chronicle II.\"\n"
"\nThis is a great movie. It shows the truth behind power, and how it can\neffect certain people. Now a days movies and stories that have super\nheroes show two sides to gaining power, becoming a good superhero or a\nbad supervillan. They don't show the actual struggle of fighting a\npower that is stronger than the human who gained it. This movie does\nshow that. they don't put on a mask and start fighting crime, they do\nwhat anyone their age would do. Use it for pranks and messing with\npeople. They use the powers in a more realistic way, its probably the\nsame way I would react. Then the film turns and shows how the power\naffects Andrew. He turns into a crazy power house, killing anyone\nbecause he can. Someone with his background would end up the same way.\nHe could not handle all that power and he let it overtake him. This\nfilm tells the story perfectly. The acting was great and so was the\neffects. The scene where they fly through the clouds took my breath\naway, it looked so real. This is a good movie for any sci-fi fan, or\nsuperhero fan. I strongly recommend it.\n"
"\nChronicle is nicely directed by Josh Trank, and well written by Max\nLandis and Trank (story with Landis).<br><br>The actors, which include Alex Russell, Michael B. Jordan and Michael\nKelly give a nice turn in this movie. <br><br>3 high school students make an interesting discovery, which gives them\nsome unusual powers that they can't possibly understand. As they try to\nlearn to master these new posers and use them to their liking, their\nlives move toward a darker.<br><br>There are some choices made with camera moves that are interesting.<br><br>Overall, the movie kept my interest and there were only a couple of\ntimes where I looked at the time. And the ending is pretty interesting\nas well.<br><br>This should receive some commercial success, given that apparently it\nwas made for a very low budget.\n"
"\nThe reason why this movie is one of my favorite is because it's the\nsame style with District 9. It is not easy to express the sf super\npower movie the way like that, but this one made it. A young director's\ncreative idea had became well made movie. But of course, it is not well\nmade than District 9, Chronicle is he's first movie ever made. I gave\n9/10 but actually, 8/10 is enough. the reason why I gave 1 more score\nis because it was he's first movie, but he had made so good. CG was so\ngreat and story was 9/10 i guess. A normal teenagers gets a super power\nis simple story, but all the detail of life, super power, how they\nthink is really good. Also, the movie has a feel that it is a normal\nteenager's home video. I like this movie and yes, it is well made to me\nI guess. I didn't got bored when I was watch this film. So I strongly\nrecommend this movie, Chronicle.\n"
"\nSaw the trailer and went to see this with my daughter. I really enjoyed\nit as it made the hairs on the back of my neck stand up. Its pure\nfantasy and you have to be able to watch without judging the fact that\na lot of what you are seeing is a bit ridiculous, take it for what it\nis, a fantasy film. It has so many emotions in it and the scenario is\nexcellent. Really made me think. It has guilt, hatred, sadness, fun,\nconfusion and a lot more. One minute i was smiling and laughing and\nliterally the next I felt a tear in my eye. My only reason for not\ngiving it a ten is that I thought it was too short. Especially the last\n30 minutes seem to be rushed and I left the cinema wanting more. If you\nare able to let your imagination run wild, don't miss this!\n"
"\nI generally enjoyed the overall story in which teens get powers and we\nget to see how they use them and how it changes them. Not amazing, but\ninteresting and many good scenes, especially in the last 15 minutes.\nHowever, the movie loses a rating point or two by the contrived \"found\ncamera\" gimmick. It really makes no sense, no one would video tape\ntheir lives like they show in the film. By trying to squeeze the movie\ninto this structure, I think the movie lost out on what could have been\nbetter character development and frankly better cinematography.\nSometimes the movie was a bit hard to watch or simply awkward because\nthey had to fit everything into this gimmick. It made more sense in\nmovies like Blair Witch and Paranormal. I give this 6.5 to 7.0 stars\nwhich means cleanly above average, but certainly not an elite movie\nwhich would merit an 8.0+. With normal storytelling and a bit more\ncharacter development (which would also mean a move more than 1:30\nhours), this could have been GREAT.\n"
"\nWhen I first saw the trailer for this movie, it looked sweet but I\ndidn't think they would be able to make an entire film about it.\nHowever, i was pleasantly surprised when I got out of this movie.\nNormally I don't like \"found footage\" films because I never really buy\nthe fact that they are video taping everything. In this film it gave a\nback story as to why there was a camera, at some points, the characters\neven remarked about why the camera was there. As i'm sure everyone\nknows the story is about 3 teenage boys who get superpowers, and one of\nthem seems to be a little more mischievous than the others. Andrew has\na pretty messed up home life and that leads to him abusing his powers.\nThe characters could have been developed a little better, but not much\nto complain about. The plot was very interesting, and got me pretty\nemotionally invested. Overall, i was very surprised at how entertaining\nit was and i would definitely recommend this movie to anyone who is\nlooking to have a good time. Perfect movie to go see with your friends\non a Friday or Saturday night. 8/10 Solid movie\n"
"\nI would say this is the worst movie I've ever seen, but unfortunately,\nI've seen Paranormal Activity (or at least half of it, before running\nout of the room puking). Yes, it is a good documentary movie in the\nsense that the cam-holder at least knows what a camera actually is\n(that's a first).But other than that, the plot was horrible (The ever\nclichéd story line of the unpopular nerd getting unfathomable super\npowers and wreaking havoc, or simply, a total rip off of Carrie),the\ncharacters did not have any unique personality that you would want to\nroot for, and the story did not follow any specified pattern or focused\non one character,but just drifted from one character to the next (like\nmy mood throughout the movie). So yeah. A pretty bad movie. the 2 I\ngave it was for the good acting (in a terrible plot) and for the\nsomewhat moving ending.\n"
"\nAs the film starts, as with most found-footage films, we gain an\nunderstanding of the characters. Here, we see that the protagonist is\nshy, and bullied, and weak, and we sympathise with him. But, as soon as\nthings get interesting, we forget nearly all that.<br><br>As the teens start experimenting with their powers, we find it fun and\nintriguing. As each one is revealed, we get more excited and more\ninterested. Unfortunately, though, after the first act things get a\nlittle tiresome and uninteresting. During this period, I was tempted to\ngive it a seven.<br><br>But, the final act seriously packs a hell of a punch, and by the end, I\nwanted to give it a 10. The inventive methods of cinematography are\ndazzling, the effects are good and it is totally unpredictable and\npacks many emotional punches. You'll leave feeling thrilled and\ninspired, guaranteed.<br><br>8.7/10\n"
"\nThis one was supposed to be a sleeper hit,but has it achieved the\ndesired effect? honestly I'm not sure. The opening is that of a typical\nAmerican teen movie and will definitely appeal to audiences in this age\ngroup. Before you know it you're lost in the crazy action of cameras\nand boys exploring their childhood fantasy of flying. I enjoyed the\nmodest amount of action this movie provided,especially Andrew a\ndepressed and unpredictable character.In fact,Chronicle could have out\nperformed most big budget films if the camera was used more smartly to\ncapture some of the shots that we didn't get to see.Watch it yourself\nto see what I mean. Overall not a bad one beside I went to see it.\n"
"\nWhat a complete and utter bag of hammers.<br><br>I'm starting to think that this found footage cobblers is the most\nannoying type of film making out there. It gives an excuse to lower\nstandards, jump from scene to scene without any rhyme or reason and the\nacting always seems weak and improvised to me.<br><br>I watched the whole thing but honestly started to tune out after 20\nminutes. It just wasn't worth the effort.<br><br>I was hoping for so much more and it didn't deliver. Maybe it's just\nme. There seems to be a lot I decent reviews out there and critics\nseemed to think it was decent. I just happen to think it was a gimmick\nfilm. The annoying thing is I find the premise cool and would like to\nsee it revisited properly.\n"
"\nThis review is both from me (mom) and from my 14 year old son. We both\nenjoyed the movie and thought it was intense but with an interesting\nmessage.<br><br>My 12-yr old daughter didn't make it past the first 7 minutes so any\npreteens who feel the emotions very deeply may not be able to handle\nwhat happens in the movie or the relationship between Andrew and his\nfather, mother, or some of the school bullies later on.<br><br>The movie goes into some deep emotions and you ride the roller-coaster\nwith the main character Andrew: you feel sorry for him, hate the mean\npeople surrounding him, rejoice when he has friends, laugh at the\n'learn the powers' antics, and are bewildered and upset when he abuses\nhis new-found powers.<br><br>We were truly surprised at the ending and my son wanted any future teen\nviewers to know that it is a good movie with a good message but it is\nsad. As a parent, I'd want someone to know the same things.<br><br>I'd recommend for 13 yrs + unless said teen is like my daughter and not\nable to handle the bullying and parental situations.\n"
"\nThis was a really good film.<br><br>however i was not sure on how it was filmed (if you understand what i\nmean) and i really didn't understand why Steve had to die??? and we\nweren't really told how he died sort of thing, flash of lighting then\nnext thing the films at his furnal.<br><br>and i didn't like the way how thingy (forgot his name) died, seriously,\nlike a sheskabob-_- but over all in my opion it was a brilliant film\njut the odd things here and there that i didn't like but you get that\nin all types of films :)<br><br>sorry for the bad spelling, i can't spell very well :(\n"
"\nThe plot for The Chronicle will be fairly familiar to many. Three\nteenagers unexpectedly gain superpowers after a chance encounter. The\nstory follows the trio as they come to terms with their new found\npowers and the impact it has on their lives.<br><br>Now it is a familiar plot-line, but the film is very well done. It is\ndifficult not to feel empathy with the characters. This is mainly\nbecause their reactions are very similar to those that you'd expect to\nhave yourself in a similar situation.<br><br>The three leads Dane DeHaan, Alex Russell and Michael B Jordan all put\nin good performances and the film fairly flies along. Apparently the\nbudget was quite low for the film, but you certainly wouldn't think\nthat as the Special Effects are very good. A very entertaining film.\n"
"\nI have seen teen films, superhero films and the rest: this absorbed the\nbest from that genre and some of the worst features and turned them\ninto an absorbing film that blended fantasy and reality. The part of\nthe film where the boys discover their super powers is sort of\nbelievable and the kind of stunts they pull - teenage. <br><br>The story arc of the main character is a little more predictable -\nthink the \"little corporal\" or Col Gadaffi; but you wonder why films\nlike this cannot show people rising above their circumstances rather\nthan being consumed by them - know your place! I think a person who\nexpects power and respect from others is more likely to get megalomania\nwhen he gets more of it and not understand limits, than one for whom it\nis a new experience - think bankers bonuses! <br><br>That said, the way the film was pulled together was excellent and the\ngrey rainy feel added to the dark brooding nature of the story. Some\nplot holes (editing?) but this is film I would recommend to anyone -\nits brilliant.\n"
"\nWhy do people watch stuff like this? Basically nothing happens, no\ndevelopment, nothing, just some kids playing around with some cool\npowers and 10 minutes at the end of a little story development. And\ndon't you think this Paranormal activity style of cameras is getting\ntoo much now? The movie would have been a 4 if not for it. I wish I\nhadn't seen this as it is clearly just for dumb teenagers.<br><br>Special effects are not great, cinematography, there isn't one, music,\nnot good at all, story, beyond awful, acting is not too bad, but not\ngood either. I just find it funny that everyone just happens to be\nfilming everything, don't you think is a little unrealistic? Could have\nbeen more believable in the 80's. Nowadays nobody walks around with\ncameras.\n"
"\nbefore i begin my review, i must say i like every genre, but especially\nfantasy and sci-fi. i started this movie with an open mind, but after\nabout 15 minutes i got bored. here are a few reasons why:<br><br>1) the script is just badly written. there is no real story line in\nthis movie, everything that is gonna happen, you already know\nbefore-hand. the black guy (me no racist!) dies without knowing how he\ndied, just lame. a good script is born with a lot more attention to\ndetail then this movie has.<br><br>2) the special effects are lame. especially when they begin to fight\neach other. i know they are tough, but to crash into solid concrete and\nstill they keep fighting like they never hit the damn thing.<br><br>3) the end, it was so predictable that even my 11 year old niece got\nhave gotten that.<br><br>If you wanna watch it, just know you wont get the 1,5 hours back of\nyour life!\n"
"\nThe whole film is shot using the same camera technique as Cloverfield,\nintentionally amateurish, disjointed with annoying camera shake during\nthe action scenes. Initially, the dialogue is fast paced but the\ncharacters are 2 dimensional so I found little to care about in any of\nthem. They do acquire some depth eventually but the pace of the plot is\nso slow that for the first 30 minutes I didn't feel any buy-in to the\nstory which is too long in my opinion. Eventually the special effects\nare well executed and the film kind of redeems itself but then it's\nover and I was left feeling a little cheated. Shame as the trailers are\ngreat and I was expecting a great film however, I would say it's\nmediocre at best.\n"
"\nBlair With Project meets I am number 4 ... but worse.<br><br>It has the action mockumentary genre and although the CGI is good\nnothing is going to save this film from a complete trash rating. I am\nsurprised to see it get 7.4 on IMDb ... if your over 13 years old and\nhave rated this film 7.4 your likely financially involved in the film.<br><br>They try to make it like Push and Jumper with the intention of\ndifferentiation by doing the cam corder footage thing, although it only\ngives you the swirly camera headache a few times the lead actor; who\nplays a socially inept half-wit; gave me a headache the whole movie.<br><br>complete waste of 2 hours of my life, this from a guy who thought push\nand jumper were pretty decent films.<br><br>ONCE AGAIM IF YOUR AN ADULT LOOKING FOR AN ACTION FILM - DO NOT HIRE !\n"
"\nI don't understand.. there are documentaries and there are entertaining\nfilms.. why create a separate genre of crappy \"self shot\" documentaries\nthat are neither documentaries nor a proper movie in itself !<br><br>I have absolutely nothing to comment on it the film. It does not\nqualify even as a Sci- Fi because it gives no explanation for the\nstrangest crap happening for a hour or so !<br><br>Its a wastage of time.. Like the characters in the film continue to say\nthat filming everything all the time might become a little cliché, the\nfilm does exactly that ! I am surprised they did not shoot the\ncharacters using the Loo too ! (They Dint miss anything else.. )\n"
"\nI went to an advanced screening of this on Wednesday and it was one of\nthe most abysmal things I've ever seen and anyone who showers it with\npraise never deserves to watch another film ever again.<br><br>I actually felt like I was dying when watching it.<br><br>I think my brain was on the verge of melting and pouring out of my ear.<br><br>They actually managed to succeed in making a potentially interesting\nconcept of acquired telekinesis completely boring by placing it within\nthe most banal characters imaginable.<br><br>Everyone was detestable and the dialogue was truly mind-numbingly\nbland.<br><br>A lot of people will love it, but such people are ridiculous.\n"
"\nI like the people with super powers idea but, for me to like a movie I\nneed to relate to or identify with the characters in the film. I saw\nthe movie and found myself waiting for something that never came.<br><br>The characters in this movie are kind of based on Greek Gods, and had a\nhuge amount of potential to inspire as well as entertain the audience\nbut, as I watched the movie play out, I was only entertained by the\nsuper abilities of the writers and directors to form yet another movie\nthat requires sequels to make the movie work.<br><br>Something like selling someone a car without an engine while the buyer\nwas unaware of the intentions of the seller to sell them the missing\nengine later for more profit.<br><br>I like my movies like I like my cars, well made, whole and complete.\nThis movie fails to deliver.\n"
"\nI don't see how any body can give this movie anything below an 8 for\nthe simple fact the special effects were awesome! The script was\nrealistic and I'm tired of seeing the haters bashing the movie and\ncalling it cheap. It's one of the best movies of the year hands down.\nPeople are complaining about the nose bleeds significance. They said\ntheir power is like a muscle you can break it if you stretch it too far\npast the limit you've strengthened it. The black guy moved the car\nearly in the movie and he bled profusely as punishment comparing his\nface to a period. Andrew became strong as hell because throughout the\nmovie he was working the muscle just by having the camera above his\nhead 24-7 even when he slept. So, think about the movie before you give\nit a 5 because the script of a teenager. Andrew recorded it it's\nsupposed to be like that.\n"
"\nI felt that the trailer was very misleading. I thought it was going to\nfocus on the guy they made crash into the water. The movie was so slow\nand pointless. And the part at the end where his friend makes the spear\ngo through him, give me a break the police had every opportunity to\nshoot him. The so-called special effects were weak and looked stupid. I\ncan't believe the good reviews this movie is getting. I don't get it,\nit was stupid and weak and I couldn't wait for it to be over so I could\ngo home! Lol. I agree with all the other bad reviews! I should have\nwent to see the movie with the Rock, it couldn't have been worse! Wow\nOK I can't post until I write ten lines on how awful this movie was!\n"
"\nThis film sucks big time, the best parts are shown on the trailer, two\nhours of my life I will never get back.<br><br>The idea behind the story is fairly original, but not really explored\nin enough depth, the acting is a bit wooden, the script is dire, I got\nbored half way through and the POV camera work has been done to death\nand far better than this.<br><br>If there is any film you are in two minds about seeing this year, if\nthis is one of them, do your self a favour and make it this one. I cant\nbelieve that some reviewers have given this film high marks, still each\nto their own I suppose.\n"
"\nThis one completely fell under the radar, for me at least. It was\nreleased in '12 and here I just finished watching it with my son in\n'16. Normally if a movie eludes me like that, it's most likely because\nit's really not worth watching...not the case here!<br><br>All of the key elements of a film are executed very well - good story,\nwell written script, great cast who all delivered solid roles. The\neffects for their powers was done in a very realistic believable way.<br><br>I'm not sure if this is based on a book or anything, but expect to see\nat least a sequel, and it has the potential to become a solid trilogy.\nSo if you're like me, and you missed this one when it came out, give it\na watch. You won't be disappointed.\n"
"\nI enjoyed this movie. The concept of three teenagers getting powers\ncould go in a lot of different directions, so I thought it might be\nhard to explore all the possibilities in the length of one movie. By\nthe end, I was satisfied. Three high school boys find a cave with\nglowing crystals, and the next day they begin developing powers. For a\nwhile, they just play around and pull pranks. However, one of the boys\nis picked on by classmates and abused by an alcoholic dad, and\neventually turns his anger outward. He eventually becomes so dangerous,\nthe other kid with powers has to turn on him to stop the rampage. It\nwas a pretty epic finale. The found footage aspect of the film was its\nweakest part. I think that was because it was inconsistent. I enjoy the\nhand-held cam effect most of the time, usually because the films that\nemploy them are well written enough that they would be good however\nthey were done. In this movie, the effect distracts from the story.\nEspecially since the scenes sometime look hand-held and sometimes look\ntraditionally filmed. A fun watch.\n"
"\nThe twenty-something teens seemed authentic - they actually acted like\nteenagers - a rarity. The use of the camcorder - sort of a candid\nchronicle of what's happening - went over very well. The emergence of\ntheir superpowers and their mastery of it fit into the teenage\nreactions you would expect. I think it was an intelligent film - it\nmade you think and it seemed real. When one of the teens, who had a\ntraumatic home life, begins to unravel, everything accelerates into a\ntragedy. It was genuinely scary because it seemed so natural. Every\nsingle one of the characters seemed authentic and I believe this film\nachieved groundbreaking realism in that regard. It's one of those\nmovies that holds your interest and makes you cringe. It drags you into\nit....when everything spins out of control, it retains its edge....it's\ngenuinely terrifying.\n"
"\nI did enjoy the movie, and am impressed with what special effects they\ncan come up with on a \"low\" budget nowadays. <br><br>Some quibbles: <br><br>Anyone who has seen Akira knows that this is more than an homage, it is\na ripoff. <br><br>Why have a lead character that looks exactly like Leonardo DeCaprio?<br><br>\"High schoolers\" that look as old as college grads. The extras at the\nwelcome party looked like the right age.<br><br>How can they gain these powers and not at least make a joke about being\na Jedi?<br><br>Good guy pushes the rules. They didn't see Spider-Man either? They\ncould have mentioned the part about great power and responsibility.<br><br>Why make it a found-footage film? To create it, sources had to be\npulled not only from the lead's cam, but a hastily inserted and\nextraneous female video vlogger, and news and security footage. It\nshould have just been presented as a straightforward documentary.<br><br>Still, an OK way to pass 90 minutes. Not a buy, though.\n"
"\nI'm usually divided by superpower movies. I've never read comic books,\nbut I like the idea of being different from society. Chronicle rides\nthis line with excellent finesse and skill. I loved the lack of a\ntraditional exposition, with the movie instead diving straight into the\nmain trio learning how to use their powers. Dane DeHaan's family\ndynamic was fantastic, Michael B. Jordan's personable characteristics\nwere much-needed, and Alex Russell's overall resolve really brought the\nmovie full circle. Really the only complaint I have is that it was on\nthe short side. I would watch the 2.5 hour director's cut if there was\none.\n"
"\nChronicle was a nice ride of superhero/alien and the the story of three\nkids who possessed it. Some really cool and dark concept presented by\nthe young moviemaker. Chronicle not just a 12 million doller indie\nmovie but it has every thing to wow about. Stunning visual, videotaping\nstyle of movie (like paranormal activity and jackass but still better)\nand so much better special effect then what we seeing now-a-days so\ncalled \"blockbuster movie\". It has the nice taste of 'next new thing'\nof movie making. story and screenplay is really top-notch. I am\nrecommending everyone to watch this movie just to get a different taste\nin movie.\n"
"\nIt's really something people were thinking about. What would you do, if\nyou were in that position? What would really happen with you and your\nfriends? And other questions, that haven't been really answered by\nother similar themed movies. Of course doing so here, makes this\nvulnerable to some slower and more boring scenes, that need to be\nplaced in there, to see the progression.<br><br>Plus for all the trying it does, it is kind of predictable. Does that\ntake anything away from the movies impact? I don't think so. So it is\ncliché at times (in a common sense world that is), but the actors are\ndoing a great job. Plus it does a neat thing with the found footage\nthing, that could only be done here and still \"make sense\".<br><br>Watch it, if you're tired of other movies pretending to know what would\nhappen, but be aware that you might think that the other movies are\ndoing a better job, because they're not trying to depict \"reality\"\n"
"\nThis is an example of a movie fine balanced between banality and\npretentiousness, which takes extreme skill. Excellent direction, very\ngood acting (that's how you cast actors!), truly perfect editing and\nunbelievable sfx (considering their purpose in this movie). There's\nonly one thing that I don't like here and it's the cliffhanger at the\nend, leaving some space for sequel(s). I guess that's what producers\ndictate, blackmailing artists. Otherwise, this could be perfectly\nrounded movie with \"a head and a tail\". <br><br>Although it my appear so, this is not a sci-fi, but a story of\nrelationships and circumstances. It stars rather slow but when it\nstarts to run it does not stop until the very end, keeping your\nattention with abundance of details carefully put together.<br><br>Highly recommended not only to people who just want to see a good movie\n(at last) but also to think about \"what would happen if...\". Have fun\nand go for this one.\n"
"\nThe whole time this movie was coming out I was wondering whether or not\nI should actullay go watch it on the big screen or not of course im an\nidiot and didn't. When I got around to watching it I wished I saw it in\ntheatres. It was much better then I thought it was going to be.<br><br>This movie is about 2 cousins and a friend who go off into the woods\nand find some weird object. This object gives them mind powers and they\nhave to try to figh the urges to use the powers for bad.<br><br>This movie was pretty damn good. Much better then I thought it was\ngoing to be. The acting was great from the entire cast. Now this is a\nlow budget movie so the special effects are of course below par but\nbesides that this movie is awesome.<br><br>I never even knew it was shot from a hand cam style. Though it was a\npleasant surprise because it made the movie work even better then it\nwould have otherwise.\n"

"\nChronicle is one of those films you wish you made. It's so simple yet\nso clever, so well made yet made on such a low budget.

"\nFound-footage genre has already fast becoming a fading gimmick, even\nthough many Hollywood filmmakers are still milking the trend since it's\ncheap to make and it's often profitable (e.g. PARANORMAL ACTIVITY\nseries). But not so for CHRONICLE -- a unique and exciting blend of\nfound-footage concept mixes with superhero genre. Yup, how come nobody\nthought of that earlier? No doubt both director Josh Trank (who\npreviously helmed a few episodes in the short-lived TV series called\nThe Kill Point) and writer Max Landis (yup, he's the son of the\nlegendary John Landis) knows well how to have fun with the genre\nmishmash, while successfully raises an all-important question that\nmakes this movie so compulsively watchable: What happens if someone\ngranted a superpower but ends up abusing it for the wrong reason? It\nalso helps when Landis's screenplay offers considerable logic that\nmakes this superhero genre all the more involving.<br><br>Full review at\nhttp://caseymoviemania.blogspot.com/2012/02/chronicle-2012.html\n"
"\nFrom a certain perspective, this is just another super hero movie where\nthe hero and the villain start as friends and become enemies. For me\nthis had a lot more levels than that. I enjoyed the first person mode\nof filming because it made the characters seems more real to me rather\nthan being actors. It helped me to really identify with each of them\ninstead of classifying any of them as either good or bad. Andrew and\nMatt's relationship is a truly interesting one where Andrew is truly\nthe more likable of the two, but as they begin to progress more and\nreact to the power they get from their new abilities, Matt is the one\nwho is more level headed and Andrew begins to go off the deep end. I\nthink for me what really made this film entertaining was the lack of\nsuperhero tights or nicknames or even alter-egos. Just a bunch of\nmisfit teenagers who end up losing control of themselves.\n"
"\nI really wasn't expecting that much from this. Sure it had had some\npositive reviews, but how good could another 84 minute teen movie\nreally be? Well, I couldn't have been more wrong. Chronicle is an\nexcellent piece of film-making that is not only entertaining and very\nwell made for such a low budget, but also has a message, something not\none of these 'Found Footage' films (read: Blair Witch Project,\nCloverfield, etc.) has ever had. It portrays what can happen to people\nwhen they are suddenly given a lot of power, be it political power or\nsuper power, and manages to bring that message across very powerfully\nin just 84 minutes. This is one of the few 'short-n-sweet' films that\nfeels like nothing is skipped, like the story is told perfectly within\nthose 84 minutes, and at the end it just feels like it's done,\ncomplete. <br><br>9/10. A remarkable achievement.\n"
"\nBefore seeing this film, I'd never seen a found-footage type of movie.\nI thought that type of film would be terrible, but ended up becoming a\ngreat film. Without revealing any spoilers, the film is a very good\nachievement by new-coming director, Josh Trank. Although the acting in\nthis film may not be an Oscar worthing, the characters do pull off a\ngood job as their own characters. After seeing this film back in\nFebruary, I had already heard of Josh Trank be interested in directing\nthe \"Fantasic Four\" reboot. If he weren't interested in directing the\nreboot, I would have hoped at the time he would also be interested in\nmaking a sequel to this film, without doing found-footage type of\nfilming. Over all, a very well done film by a new coming director.\nOverall: 8/10\n"
"\nOK the reviews looked great. The previews looked great. I never looked\nhard enough to notice it was a 'found footage\" as they are calling it\nfilm which if I had I would never have rented it. Thankfully I did not\nhave the money to go see this in the theater or I would have been\ndemanding my money back early on and would have been right. There was\nnothing worth watching until about 2/3 of the way into the movie. By\nthen your so drunk from the shaky camera which by the way some times\nyou think \"oh the camera is gone now it's a real movie\" and then Oh\ncrap the jerk got the camera again. At times you wish someone would\nbreak it (and they do try but not well enough) There was no real plot\nthere was no sympathy for any of the actors. there was nothing. I feel\nasleep and missed like 20 minutes of the movie and I am thankful. I did\nnot miss anything really it was all crap. super hero? there were no\nsuper hero's in this movie only super villains and super greed. Super\nheroes would not let their girl friend go with them to fight someone\nthat they know was capable of killing everyone.\n"
"\nFirst trailer I saw for this film I thought it looked awful, like\ntwilight with superheros instead of vampires.<br><br>However this is not just another cheesy 'dark' teen film. Although\nclearly aimed at the same teen market as films like twilight, the\ndepressed teenager that dreams of becoming different through\nsupernatural powers...<br><br>The hand held camera take on the film was OK, although I think they\njust gave up on it towards to the end and started to film what they\nwanted. The script was pretty dodgy in places but it all held together\nOK.<br><br>I just think that although this is the kind of film I'd normally avoid,\nnot being a depressed teenager myself, there was enough different here\nto keep all audiences entertained.<br><br>Worth a view even if you don't like the cheesy trailers.\n"
"\nI thought the concept was really cool. A couple of regular kids find\nthemselves with super- human powers and have to come to terms with this\nnew, amazing, scare reality like only teenagers know how: through\nexperimentation - the good, the bad, the ugly. The plot, I felt, didn't\nknow where it wanted to go. I think whoever wrote the script knew\nhe/she had a great concept, but just couldn't take it to where it\nneeded to go; like 2/3 of the way through, a big chuck of cryptonite\nfell onto the writer's lap. Also, the hand-held camera action... it had\ncredibility for about three scenes... then the reasons for having to\nconstantly film lost all credibility. All up, had huge potential, but a\nfew obvious and major flaws turned it into a bit of a tomato.\n"
"\nSome teenagers wish some get it.Three teenagers after an experience of\nsomething unnatural have acquired some powers &amp; after playing with\ntheir powers they go evil.Andrew has a very creative mind which on\nbecoming evil serves bad as his powers are controlled by his mind .<br><br>Chronicle is a superhero kind ,adventurous movie Chronicle in easy\nwords is one of the greatest \"found footage\" film. Chronicle is a\nthrilling movie with simple, yet great dialogue that comes with a great\nstory.It makes you feel invincible ,like you also are a character in\nthe film with inhuman abilities &amp; who wouldn't want to have\nextraordinary abilities .Well this is your chance to explore your\nabilities.\n"
"\nI loved this movie. Great overall movie. There was comedy, drama,\naction, thriller and everything. I love how the first half was funny\nand friendly. The second half was when you sat on the edge of your\nseat. It was intense and dark. SEE THIS MOVIE everybody. I saw this\nthinking it was going to be awesome. But I was wrong. It was 10 times\nbetter than I expected. My new favorite movie. See this movie with some\nfriends and this will be the perfect movie night. You get to laugh\nthrough this movie and you get to be worried, wondering what will\nhappen next. I always thought levitation was awesome enough but after\nthis movie I have a whole other thought.\n"
"\nChronicle happened to actually be an awesome movie for such a low\nbudget film. It has taken back the dignity of the \"found film\" sub\ngenre back from the Blair Witch Project. The story is basically about a\ngroup of 3 teen's who develop telekinetic powers from an unknown energy\nsource. Andrew decides to film their daily lives with having these new\npowers. While there are really no prominent actors in the movie, the\nmain role Andrew played by Dane DeHaan was so great that I can see him\nhaving a very successful future down the road. The supporting actors\nwhich are his best friends Matt and Steve also provide some much needed\ncomic relief throughout the movie. The scene with them flying is just\nabsolutely awesome and stuck out as one of my favorite parts of the\nmovie. The last 30 minutes of the movie are just absolutely epic with\nthe different changing camera angles throughout the city like cop car\nfootage, mall security footage and various other news reporter cameras.\nThat is really what got me hooked on this movie and why I've been\nrecommending it to everyone I see.\n"
"\nThis film was a pleasant surprise, much better than I expected. The\nstoryline is quick and straight to the point. I like the idea of the\nguys all filming it on their camera, it was a unique way to watch a\nfilm.<br><br>The plot is fairly simple but extremely effective. The 3 main\ncharacters are all played by actors I have never seen before and it\nfelt really fresh, they was all very good. The film had much more\nhumour than I had expected, there was some funny one liners and also\nwhen they got their powers there was some really funny scenes of\ntesting them out etc, really different to anything I have seen before.\nThe special effects in this film were incredible, you just have to see\nit for yourself. It really did look amazing.<br><br>After a twist, the main character starts to lose control and ends up\ncausing absolute carnage, this was just a breathtaking last 10-15\nminutes of action.<br><br>Overall a very enjoyable film, short and straight to the point. I would\nrecommend this film to all.<br><br>9/10.\n"
"\nChronicle  CATCH IT (B+) Found-footage is the new thing captured\nHollywood &amp; audience by storm. The found-footage movies are good but\nsometimes irritating. Nonetheless it defiantly makes simple story more\nreal and fascinating e.g Paranormal Activity. Chronicle is story of\nthree boys getting into a magic hole and getting power of telekinesis.\nIts defiantly sounds cheesy but the found-footage thing makes this\ncheesy story line lot more appealing. The credit goes to Josh Trank and\nMax Landis because it's out and out their imagination and clever\ndirection and story respectively which keeps us hooked to the chair.\nCasting is completely fresh so we don't have any pre conceived notions\nabout the actors. Dane DeHaan is brilliant as misfit kid. Alex Russell\nis a charmer (I saw him in Aussie \"Wasted on Young\" before). Michael B.\nJordan is alright, there is nothing much a black dude does in thrillers\nexcept getting hit first. Ashley Hinshaw is pretty. Overall, Chronicle\nis intriguing, engaging and entertaining. I'm defiantly down for\nSequel.\n"
"\nI liked this movie very much, thought the effects were excellent, and\nthought the acting was awesome. I loved the characters as they were\nvery realistic, and their lives were realistic too. I loved the\noriginality of it, these guys weren't like normal superheroes set to\ndefeat evil, they just normal people who happened to have cool super\npowers. I felt dizzy at times when the camera spun in the parts where\nAndrew fell or was moving.<br><br>I have a full review on my blog:\nhttp://seungsviews.blogspot.com/2012/02/movie-review-chronicle.html<br><br>I would recommend this movie to others.\n"
"\nThe movie is about three boys, gaining superpowers after entering a\ncave. They soon realize that power changes their life drastically. Let\nme start with the good parts. It is actually nice to see the birth of a\nsuperhero, the initial struggle with the power and the way power\nchanges someones life. What made me disappointed was the script and the\nway they did the filming. The found footage style of movie making\nfrustrates me more than super-bad acting since I am not paying to see a\nshaking camera. I hated it since the beginning and I don't see why\npeople insist shooting a whole movie with hand held cameras. Anyways,\nthe script was weak as well. There was nothing you wouldn't expect. To\nmake the long story short, if I had seen this movie on TV, I wouldn't\nwatch it.\n"
"\nI couldn't stand the choppy editing. For example,<br><br>Fight at school, then in dinner, then at Party, then in cave, the\nthrowing a tennis ball with their powers, then at school, and then\nplaying telekinetic Lego! Then at Toys R Us, then in Dinner! Car park,\nHome, Lake, etc, etc there was no transparency or transition between\nany of the scenes, most scenes didn't even relate or make sense with\neach other! Which started to give me a head ache? <br><br>I give it a 3/10 because there was no introduction to the characters\nand an overture to the discovery of their powers, due to the ultra\nheavy editing, once they discover the Unidentified Alien, there in the\nback hard laughing using telekinetic powers! What a waste of $20!\n"
"\nThis movie was just terrible, a negative vote is needed to rate this\nmovie, the problem with doing a \"found footage\" movie, is that the\ncamera work is often not centred or focused, and especially during\naction or fighting sequences, very shaky and lacking a focal point.<br><br>Spoiler: During the movie, how the guys got their \"powers\" is not\nthoroughly explained, they touch a blue glowing rock, it turns red,\nthen they start yelling, the camera guy falls over and the screen goes\nblack. Next scene they are playing around with their powers, as if the\neditors left out a scene where they discover they now have powers and\nwhat may have caused it. This \"magic rock\" gives them powers, yet it is\nnot explained why or how it does this, and after they get their powers,\nthe rock is not mentioned again, as if it really didn't have any\nimportance.<br><br>This is poorly filmed and there are countless mistakes made throughout\nthe film, I do not recommend it to anyone, Not being mean, just telling\nit like it is.\n"
"\nI am not particular for the hand-held camera experience, but after a\nwhile it actually works very well for this movie, it makes it seem a\nbit more realistic and maybe even like a \"real\" super hero footage kind\nof thing :)<br><br>Andrew Detmer played by Dane DeHaan is a very special character, he is\nnot popular and maybe most looked upon as a nerd or even a freak, he\nclearly haven't read a lot of stories about super heroes, at least he\ndoesn't think he has any responsibility, but thinks only power comes\nwith his new found abilities.<br><br>It is interesting to watch, but becomes a bit too much and maybe to\nserious, the first part where they discover their abilities and develop\nthem are great, but it becomes very dark and revengeful. I think some\nof the last scenes are very great with effects and flying things, very\nnicely done, but the power struggles are a bit over the top and just to\nshow off.\n"
"\nThis movie makes me excited for Josh Trank's future projects because\nhis work is unique and surprisingly redeemable. Dane DeHaan delivered a\nstellar performance, which was much needed because of the distractingly\npoor CGI. I was not bothered by the \"found footage\" aspect at all, and\nbelieved that it helped me learn more about Andrew's character as I\ncould see the world from his perspective. The filmaking style also\nenhanced the suspense/horror aspect of the movie. Apart from a rushed\nconclusion, Chronicle was a nice surprise that is definitely worth\nchecking out, especially if you are a fan of sci-fi and superhero\nmovies.\n"
"\nThis awkward blend of several trendy genres has something to say, but\ncan't quite work out the right way to say it. As the meeting point\nbetween superhero origin pictures, found footage compilations and moody\ncoming-of-age stories, it arrives pre-loaded with all manner of\ntripmines and potholes, so numerous that it can't hope to avoid them\nall. It feels hokey and gimmicky, particularly when the action grows\nintense and the plot bends over backwards for an excuse to introduce\nmore hand-held cameras. The cast interactions feel rushed and shallow,\nhurrying past crucial bits of character development to reach the\nprecious prize of a shiny effects shot. And even those, presumably the\nfilm's sizzle, unanimously feel weak and clunky. Chronicle has a point,\nand the ruminations it embraces about the underbellies of each genre\nhave loads of potential. It's just so poorly executed, nearly across\nthe board, that it's tough to focus on what's going on beneath the\nhood. Excellent as a rough sketch or a proof of concept, flat as a\nfinished product.\n"
"\nI give this movie a 10 because I have never in the last 9 years watched\na better movie than this one! There are only 2 movies I absolutely\nloved and they are The Exorcism of Emily and Insidious. And now THIS\none! I totally loved it! You will not regret watching it, trust me!\nChronicle held my attention all of 1 hour and 23 minutes it lasted. I\nam really pleasantly surprised by this movie! As soon as I saw it on\nThe Internet, it cought my attention and I bought it - and I do not\nregret the money that I gave to purchase this movie! I am fascinated! I\nsuggest for you to watching, I guarantee you much entertainment and\nfun! You could even learn something from it!\n"
"\nentertaining nice but it could be better, there is Idea that no matter\nwhat what you do make or what do you have still the opinion of parents\nwill effect you the most , it's very nice movie worth the time but i\nwish it ends in better way using the camera on the way documentary\nfilms was beautiful and smart, making this project a more enjoyable,\ntime was an important factor was not long and boring, but unfortunately\ni still have a big issue with the ending it could be better , and in\nthis movie you don't need to bay a blue-ray version in the end it's not\nbatman or the iron man but for me it's more enjoyable then iron-man if\nyou have time and nothing to watch , watch it\n"
"\nChronicle was perhaps one of the best movies of the rather mediocre\n2012. Superhero movies are at an all time high these days, with\nblockbuster films like Amazing Spider Man, The Dark Knight Rises and\nThe Avengers, but though these films boasted massive budgets and tons\nof explosions and action scenes they lacked the emotional intensity of\nless \"massive\" films like Chronicle. I wouldn't call Chronicle a low\nbudget film, since it had a rather sizable budget of 15 million\ndollars, for me a really low budget film has a budget around 2-4\nmillion dollars. :)<br><br>Highly recommended as the best superhero film of 2012!\n"
"\nGreat movie with great actors. I felt as if I was back in high school\nagain and I shared the coming out story of the jock meeting the nerds\nand having a great time. I certainly hope there will be a follow up\nmovie. I hate films with the shaky found footage effect but this was\ndone in an unabusive method. The only part i didn't quite understand\nwas with them doing these wondrous feats in public and no one saying\nanything as they fly away from the supermarket. I enjoyed the way the\nstory was told and the villain emerging from true pain of death and\nembarrassment. I was hoping for a longer story and ending was cool but\na bit brief. This movie is a great change from the usual super hero\nstory because it wasn't. It was more of a coming of age story about\nthree boys with special abilities. I can see a sequel coming with the\nsame actors coming back. Great movie to see and own.\n"
"\nThe best I can give this film is a meh. Chronicle is another in a long\nline of super power origin stories that has been done to death using\nthe not so clever idea of found footage that is plague upon modern\ncinema. It doesn't help that during the scenes when people are flying\nyou can almost see the crane and harness they are using. Similarly,\nforcing the film to stick with its found footage format really hinders\nthe suspension of disbelief aspect of the film. It's almost like the\ndirector can't wait to have Andrew gain some powers so he can have him\nuse telekinesis to have a camera float above the character for the rest\nof the film. If that is going to be the case why not just shoot this\nwithout the found footage technique? check out our full review at\n3guys1movie.com\n"
"\nA very nice science fiction film that emerges as something different\nand not just the same show of powers with unnecessary fighting. The\nfilm will take you through a way which shows as to what a person will\ndo if they get power. You will feel at all times that  I would have\ndone this or that. The only thing which I never like is the found\nfootage filming. It makes me shout unnecessarily. The situations were\nnicely framed and do gives you a very nice experience. The story\nproperly builds all the characters and in particular the lead\ncharacter, who turns evil as time passed. This film is not like the\nidea that when you get power, you have to save the world and anything\nthat we saw in Green Lantern(AWFUL). It makes you feel what actually\nwould happen when you too will get power. I liked the ending also.\n"
"\nFor his first feature, film Josh Trank impressed the hell out of me.\nThe storyline from this site adequately covers the plot without\nspoiling too much and if you watch the trailer/preview, you will want\nto see; I can tell you now that trailer is not misleading. The fact\nthat the cast does not include well known names did not stop the movie\nfrom making a mark, and the numbers back that up. If you can get passed\nthe hand held camera work that was compulsory but thankfully not\nthroughout, given one main character is chronicling, video journal\nstyle, a period in his life, you will discover a good movie. It has a\ntake on characters with super powers that you've not seen before and\nthat novel perspective makes a difference. The characters are well\ndeveloped, the actors hold their own and are quite believable, there\nare plenty of good special effects and you will not be bored, that's\nfor sure. The pace does not let up, the intrigue builds and it keeps\ngetting better steadily to the end. I sure was impressed and recommend\nit for all these reasons.\n"
"\nThis was quite different for me in that three quarters of the film was\nthe build up, with all the action been cramped into 20 minutes. The\nstory line in general was good, however, there where many scenes where\nI would have liked to have seen a different outcome. My first criticism\nwith regards to this movie is the lack of much expected action adding\nto the fact that all the action was crammed into a short space of time.\nThe second criticism would be the ending. There are many unanswered\nquestions. Although there was no indication for a following sequel,\nthese questions must be answered leading me to believe there may be a\nsequel at some point, probably with a completely different story line\nto the original, but some how linked.\n"
