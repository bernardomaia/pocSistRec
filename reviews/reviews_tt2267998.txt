"\nJust seen the film Gone Girl. <br><br>I really struggled with the book and found it incredulous so never\nfinished it but the film was getting good reviews so I thought I'd give\nit a go.<br><br>What a pile of crap!<br><br>Two and a half hours of my life wasted. The story is just unbelievable.\nNeither character makes you like them or hate them. They are just bland\nand, well, unbelievable. <br><br>By the end I just wanted someone to firebomb the house and kill the\npair of them. I would have stood up and cheered. As it happened it has\na really lame ending.<br><br>A waste of my life. Utter tripe!\n"
"\nActually a good well acted movie till the end. Ben Affleck was\nexcellent and Rosamund Pike had me 100% convinced she was evil\nincarnate. Carrie Coon as Ben's twin sister and Kim Dickens as the lead\ndetective also gave excellent performances. As for the story, I can\ndeal with sad endings where the hero dies like Braveheart, Cool Hand\nLuke, and endless others. When the credits came up on Gone Girl, I\ncould only regret spending over 2 hrs to watch a movie that left me\nthat angry. I would have preferred she had just killed Ben Affleck and\ngotten away with it. Assuming the book had the same ending I would have\nthrown it across the room upon finishing it. I enjoyed the movie up\ntill the end but that completely ruined it for me.\n"
"\nThought this would be a good thriller, but ultimately it was draining\nand depressing. Would think any man who sees this film would never want\nto have sex again......it portrayed woman/women as being monstrous and\nmen as passive, sex-crazed zombies. The story had so many loose ends\nand unbelievable scenes, such as where she returns home covered in\nblood.....then she's at the hospital - there had to be an exam, then\ngiving an interview to detectives, then comes home still covered in\nblood....how much time elapsed during these scenes, and who would allow\nher to drive around, carry on, covered in blood for all that time? With\ngreat emphasis on crass words for women, violent sex scenes, and a\nscore that sounded like a synthesizer importing screeches from an\nairport runway, this was one depressing film. The only place it was\nbelievable was in its depiction of the media and how they revel in\ntragedy and perversion. If this becomes our prime form of entertainment\nwe are in big trouble. Need to watch a pre-1960 film or musical now.\n"
"\nThe first act of the movie is the run-of-the-mill wife gone missing,\nthe husband accused of killing her plot. This is clearly established in\nthe theatrical trailer and may have thrown off some potential viewers.\nTo the people who are familiar with David Fincher's work, this is not\nthe case with Gone Girl.<br><br>Yes, the first act is very ordinary, but the second act uproots\nwhatever ever considered dull about the movie as it takes a rapid turn\ninto thriller stardom, resembling something taken out of a Hitchcock\nmovie. Only a handful directors can completely enhance the movie's\nnarrative through editing, and Fincher is one of them. I know there is\na lot of praise around Rosamund Pike's performance, which makes it easy\nto overlook Ben Affleck. He plays the tired, oblivious and boyish\nreally well. This may be the very reason why he is completely\noverlooked.<br><br>And in a time of sequels, prequels, remakes and biopics, finally a\ncontemporary piece of work! Stellar!\n"
"\nNever again will I trust the Metascore. Big fan of David Fincher, but\nlet me tell you this movie was spectacularly bad. The score was ham\nhanded and clashed with the film itself and I was embarrassed for the\nactors at some points that they had to say the ridiculous lines in the\nterrible script. I felt every single minute of this 149 minute movie.\nAt one point my husband turned to me and whispered \"this is really bad\"\nand we started laughing. Then we started rewriting the story and\nrecasting. For example, Ben Affleck could have played his own twin\nsister and it wouldn't have made the movie any more ridiculous. You\nmight love it. I really, really did not.\n"
"\nGone Girl is directed by the mastermind of David Fincher. Amazingly\nwritten by Gillian Flynn whom wrote the novel the film is based on.\nStarring Ben Affleck as Nick Dunne and Rosamund Pike as Amy Elliot\nDunne. On the day of their 5th wedding anniversary Nick's wife, Amy\ndisappears out of nowhere, and this crazy, intense and haunting journey\nbegins. David Fincher and Gillian Flynn's intelligent storytelling\ntrough out this fantastic journey will keep at the edge of your seat\nfrom start to end. The soundtrack and score is also very intense and\nhaunting, and has huge impact on the film. The performances from all\nthe actors, especially Rosamund Pike are top notch which really helps\nthe element of the realism stand out in this film. <br><br>Gone Girl is easily the best film I have seen this year so far, and I\nhave to give it a 10/10. It is also one of the best films from David\nFincher in my opinion. I strongly advice everyone to go and see Gone\nGirl, it is one thrilling ride.\n"
"\nHaving read the book, it was not an easy feat who will be able to bring\nto life the leading character of the book, which is Amy Dunne. Her\ncharacter is so complex, that Rosamund Pike deserves all awards that\nwill be coming to her. She was able to give Amy the mysterious vibe but\nlikable aura of a socialite New Yorker.<br><br>The score of the film is perfect, as it builds up suspense and the tone\nof the story. Great supporting performance by Ben Affleck, and the\nactress who plays her sister. Great ensemble cast who works together to\ndelivery the dark humor lines in the film.<br><br>This movie will definitely be an instant classic and I cant wait to\nwatch it again!\n"
"\nI wish I could rate this movie with a 0 Maybe the first part, is OK,\nbefore anything happens. When the action starts, you see that the\nacting, the plot, everything starts to go down the drain. I must say\nthat in general the acting is very bad, and there are very stupid\nmoments. Like when the wife returns after killing her ex-boyfriend, she\nis interviewed at the hospital were she arrived covered in blood,\ntelling the story that she was raped. Well nobody cleans all the blood\nof her in the hospital, and she is in a room with at least 10 FBI\nagents that look goofy, a lot of local police, plus husband, lawyer etc\netc. Then she leaves with her husband that was accused of murder and\nthey go home together. Then I walk out, maybe 10-15 minutes before what\nI understand was a awful ending.<br><br>How can IMDb give such a high rating?????\n"
"\nGone Girl had the potential for a great plot and movie, the plot was\ngiven away very early on as you knew he didn't do it because of the bar\nscene with his sister, then I sat there bored with a couple of moments\nof interest. Seemed to have some resemblance to the Lacy Peterson case,\nin other words lost some otherwise originality. So you know what is\ngoing to happen what you didn't know was all the details of why, which\nfound dull, I like more of a traditional mystery/drama. Personally\ndidn't see any academy award acting. The ending was way to far fetched,\njust absolutely unbelievable that 3 law enforcement agency would just\ntake a position of \"Oh Well\", the group grope to interview her was\ntotally unrealistic, I really was wondering if this was such a low\nbudget film they just didn't have enough funds to complete the movie\nand they had to jam multiple plots in a single scene. I think the hype\nthis is getting is why people believe our entire world is contrived, we\ncan't all be crazy. The movie was a loser.\n"
"\nDavid Fincher has done what i thought was the impossible, by making a\nmovie from a book, and it actually being good, i'm even going to say\nbetter than the book, and i don't give that out lightly.<br><br>First off, the use of sound within the film, both diegetic and\nnondiegetic really sell this film to me, it does a great job in\nunnerving us as an audience and its just a little off, if i looked at\nthe score of the film, i wouldn't be surprised if it comprised of\ntritones (For those who don't know, tritones make music sound just that\ntad off), and the synth sorta sound reminds me a lot of Alex Forrest's\nsignature tune from \"Fatal Attraction (1987), Adrian Lyon\"<br><br>The Story is fantastic it really shows the disconnect between people in\nthe modern day, and how the media influences everything so strongly.<br><br>In Summary this movie is a great watch, and if you enjoy the genre, or\njust trying to put together pieces of a metaphorical puzzle you will\nenjoy this movie.\n"
"\nSpoiler Alert -- In a time when we are supposed to be more aware of\nmental illness, along comes this highly-crafted movie with high\nproduction values and a big budget whose whole story is based on the\nmachinations and manipulations of a psychopath. Really, what would\nHollywood do without psychopaths? They might have to come up with an\noriginal story that actually had something to say about life, the state\nof the world, etc. This movie is purely a fiction to waste a few hours,\nit won't make you ponder or reflect on anything, save the bizarre\nending and the inevitable question: why did Nick stay? It doesn't\nmatter. This story has nothing to do with real life.\n"
"\nVERY MINOR SPOILERS BELOW<br><br>The first half of the film is pretty nice: it builds tension, mystery\nand manages to grab the viewer's attention. However the second half\nquickly undoes everything that's been shown earlier.<br><br>What's worse, the second part becomes incredibly implausible, very\ntedious, and lacking any interest because it ventures into so unlikely\nsituations and reactions, you cannot help but wonder why people act\nlike they act. For instance the police, who are very captious in the\nfirst half of the film, later believe everything they're told without\ndoubting. Other people similarly and drastically change their mind and\nwe are not given any reasonable explanation.<br><br>To give the film due credit, it's impeccably played, it has, like many\nother Fincher's films, its very likable palette.<br><br>Probably this film is about all sorts of psychos, at least its lead\ncharacters are. However the film doesn't give a chance to root for any\nof them due to their faults.\n"
"\nSPOILER!!!<br><br>I read the book, I watched the movie, let me tell you something: This\nis the dumbest s***storm they ever tried to sell me as good.<br><br>Just one thing, and it will say it all: Is this good??? NO! I read the\nbook and I thought it was the most unrealistic s**t I ever saw in my\nlife (especially the Amy and the FBI part where they believed\neverything although the whole story was screaming I'M A F****ING LIAR!)\nthe movie was the same... it's a huge disappointment both the book and\nthe movie<br><br>this whole thing is dumb. the girl is clearly a psychopath, they try to\nsell her as mastermind who thinks about EVERYTHING. They try to show\nthe police as stupid bastards who will believe every coincidence just\nbecause the woman was raped\n"
"\nLuckily I watched this soulless piece of crap as part of awards season\nscreenings, which means I didn't pay for it. I cannot believe this is\nthe shooting script they signed off - the amount of plot holes and\ncontinuity gaffes is staggering. I cannot believe that all these highly\ntalented people agreed to be in this hollow piece that uses all of its\n148 minutes to say absolutely nothing. David Fincher is clearly a\ntalented director, in full technical control of the medium, but after\nwatching this, and having watched most of his previous films, I have to\nconclude that his films very often have nothing relevant to say.\nTechnical prowess counts for nothing if the film has no soul, which is\nwhat I think of Gone Girl. I gave it a 4 for the acting, it is the only\naspect worth noting here. The end is absolutely appalling, character\ndevelopment is shallow, and that graphic extended murder scene was\npretty gratuitous, horrid and unnecessary. But what else could I expect\nfrom a director who chose to remake an already perfect film (Girl With\nThe Dragon Tattoo)?\n"
"\nTwisted is all I can say without giving anything away, great movie one\nof my favourites of 2014 ,Big fan of Ben Affleck (Good Will Hunting,The\nTown and Boiler Room)Rosamund Pike only seen her in (Jack Reacher.)And\nis crazy in this one.<br><br>One to watch twice for sure , OK so the ending might make you mad, but\nthe movie will throw you curve ball after curve ball till you get tired\nof presuming who it may be. <br><br>This film is full of thrills chills and suspense, which you wont forget\nafter its of over, it will make your heart beat , it made my wife's for\nsure lol,its not what your think, so get ready for a roller-coaster of\na movie you will like this one.\n"
"\nI really like David Fincher as a Director and some of his previous\nmovies are my favorite (e.g. Seven). Gone girl is a dull movie with\ntotally no surprise or tension. Everything in this movie is so\npredictable. Actually from the very first minutes of the movie you know\nthat the wife is responsible for all what is happening and that she\nfaked it all herself to make the husband look bad - as a revenge for\ntheir unsuccessful marriage. On top of that we have really, really bad,\nfake acting (especially Ben Affleck). The story isn't realistic and\nsometimes behavior of the characters or their actions seem simply\nstupid. The idea for the movie is actually quite interesting and could\nturn into a really great movie. But well... it is what it is\n"
"\nPlease don't waste your time or money on this hyped-up piece of\ngarbage. I don't think I've ever been as disappointed in an ending (not\nthat the beginning and middle were all that great) as I was with this\nstupid, illogical movie. The only spoiler I have is one of the biggest\nplot fails ever... she's escaped her captor by slitting his thread,\nshe's virtually covered with blood, and the hospital simply allows her\nto go home, where she coyly showers it off. Totally amazing that this\nmovie has gotten the positive press and reviews it has received - if\nthis doesn't make you realize how incredible Hollywood hype/marketing\nsystem is at distorting reality, nothing will. I only wish I could give\nit a zero.\n"
"\nAvoid this couple at all costs - they are very toxic. Gone Girl is a\nmisleading title since Amy is not a girl. She used to be a childhood\nstorybook celebrity named Amy but there is nothing girlish like about\nher in this movie. In fact she calls herself the C-word. David Fincher\nhas made some of my favorite movies (Fight Club, Zodiac, etc.) but this\nis not one of my favorites. This movie is all the things I dislike in a\nmovie - tedious, depressing, unlikeable characters, dark photography,\nmoody music, strange casting, smug dialogue. This might work with The\nGirl with the Dragon Tattoo but come to think of it - that was no girl\neither.\n"
"\nI cannot believe how disappointed I was watching this film. Form all of\nthe reviews I thought I was about to see a modern classic. In instead I\nwatched a movie so lacking in common sense that the last hour was\nalmost unwatchable. The plot is very obvious (even the ending). Without\ngiving away any plot lines, it seems that in this film, common sense\nand the trail of evidence does not exist once the real story is\nrevealed. As the last hour of the movie dragged on and on, I was hoping\nfor some redeeming scene that would make everything right or at least\nmake sense. Unfortunately this did not happen. Maybe one of the worst\n\"good\" movies I've ever scene. If this is what people think is good\nplot twists, then the IQ of movie watchers has gone down into the\nsingle digits.\n"
"\nThe most satisfying thing about this movie is writing this review.\nWhilst I'm a firm believer in the adage, \"to each his own,\" and I\ncertainly mean no disrespect to others' opinions, I do worry over\nconsumers' standards that movie-goers are able to say anything\nredeeming about this film. Many other reviewers have nailed the\nstupidity of the plot and the absurdity of most aspects of the\nstoryline so I'll leave that alone. Suffice to say that at the end, I\nfelt as violated as Amy Dunne claimed she was. I can't believe that\nsuch a large group of professionals watched the rushes and felt\nsatisfied with what they'd created. Oh and about the foul language -\nhow did Bogart, Wayne, Heston, Lancaster, Kirk Douglas, Davis and\nCrawford ever make an impact without the filthy language? Oh yeah -\nthey call it acting. I rate myself as reasonably intelligent and I'm no\nprude but I like a bit of subtlety which I believe any true art form\nallows for. This was rank nonsense and I gave myself an uppercut for\nwatching it but am slightly redeemed now.\n"
"\nInsipid. Tepid. Vacuous. The first 30 minutes are the most pretentious\nscript ever written in the history of film making. Please, somebody,\nburn every copy of this film ever distributed.... To try to sit through\nthis film to its uninspired and tired (read: \"lame\") ending challenges\nthe endurance. Okay, let's start with the actors: Ben Affleck has not\nmade a good movie-- i.e. a movie a viewer might be able to sit\nthrough-- since Jay &amp; Silent Bob Strike Back. Who forced/corralled\nRosamund Pike into making this?!? Who willingly makes movies with\nAffleck besides Jennifer Lopez?!?! Really? I was sitting on the couch\nwith my wife for the first 30 minutes of this movie and was forced to\nhit the pause button an physically leave the room for minutes at a time\nduring the first thirty minutes. God help America, Hollywood, acting,\nand movie-making.\n"
"\nThis does contain a spoiler, one that if I would have known I wouldn't\nhave wasted my time or money. I don't like to even watch trailers on\nmovies because I want no preconception of how a movie is going to be.\nThis movie has single handily changed 30+ years of thinking.<br><br>I thought the story was very well written and acted, despite almost\nalways knowing what the twists were going to be until... The pace was\nso slow and could have been compressed into a normal 75-85 minute\nmovie. My guess is that the reason there was no ending was because they\nran out of time for dragging it on like they did.<br><br>When the credits hit the entire audience I was with pretty much let out\na stream of obscenities and we all felt like the\nproducers/directors/studio all just gave us two middle fingers. I could\nhave dealt with the slow pace if they would have just wrapped up the\nmovie.\n"
"\nwell well well thanks a lot for spoiling 150 minutes of my life, i\nstill don't understand why this film is so highly rated. i guess i\nshould not believe in ratings of IMDb anymore , please don't watch this\ntrash its such a waste of time, a girl , to avenge the betrayal gets\nhold of her husband by planting a successful crime scene (that can\nhappen only in movies) and that girl ends up patching up with him\nagain, if this all had to happen then what was the fun of making that\ndirt of 150 mints, so awful ending. those who rated it 10 must be\nbanned for further rating, the most disgusting movie i have seen in my\nlife, and yes what happened to police in the end , they knew she was\ncriminal but they couldn't do anything, wow u think we are buffoons ,\nget a life Mr director and please don't breed, regards!\n"
"\nI'll keep this sweet and simple. Just read any of the other 1/10\ncomments for the synopsis. <br><br>You would be better off spending two and a half hours staring at a wall\nrather than watching this Swiss cheese of a movie. I didn't read the\nbook but if it was as riddled with plot holes as this crap was, I would\nrecommend it only to my mortal enemy.<br><br>What truly made me write this review is the horrible human beings that\nexcept money to write 10/10 comments for garbage like this. And just\nfor your information scabs , if I was the marketing execs paying for\nthose comments, I would expect some stuff a little bit more human and\nas little less Siskel and Ebert.\n"
"\nIf they shortened it down to maybe 1 hour and 45min.It would be worth\ntwo stars.But they didn't! As most Hollywood movies with overpaid\npeople who can't act,they stretch it way beyond way beyond what they\ngot storyline <br><br>I haven't read the book,and after watching the movie I don't want to\neither.<br><br>Rosamund pike does a fairly good job of being a manipulative cunning\nbitch.Bt could just as easy be replaced. And affleck does whatever it's\nhe does.Look stupid I call it,but others referred to it as acting<br><br>There's so many plot holes that I wouldn't know where to begin. Start\nwith all the stuff he supposedly bought,most stores have security cam\nthese days, should be fairly easy too see if he was the one purchasing\nthe items or not\n"
"\nSome of the worst dialog I've ever seen in a movie. Bad story, flat\nacting. The critics who gave this good reviews should find other work.<br><br>I read the book, so I know what the story was supposed to be. This\ndisjointed telling does no credit to the book.<br><br>I can't imagine how the director managed to get such terrible\nperformances out of experienced actors. It's a real credit to bad\ndirecting. The only character who really clicks is the sister. Affleck\nlooks like they already paid him, and he's ready to go home.<br><br>This movie had absolute no emotional impact. The characters were too\nflat and the dialog too unrealistic to have any effect. The storyline\nwas poorly conceived.<br><br>The mostly positive reviews for this movie demonstrate, once again, how\nmost people are not very observant or discerning about what they watch.\n"
"\nThis is by far the worst movie I have ever seen in my entire life - and\nI'm 62 years old and have seen A LOT of movies.<br><br>I failed to see any plot and failed to see the point of even making\nthis into a movie.<br><br>I have read that this movie actually is based on a book. I am not sure\nif they missed something from the book or if it was the director's take\non the book - or what.<br><br>I would hope that the book made more sense and that the person using\nthe book just didn't comprehend it well - or if the book was just as\nbad.<br><br>This has got to be the only movie that I have searched online for \"why\"\n- \"why even bother to put this into a movie\"?<br><br>I admit it was unlike any other movie I have seen in my life - maybe\nthat was the point - to be different. Well they got that right - a\nlittle too different if you ask me.<br><br>Don't waste your time as you will be sadly disappointed you just wasted\nover an hour of your life because the movie is gripping.\n"
"\nQuite honestly, this was one of the best movies I've ever had the\nprivilege of seeing. Not sure why there are so many negative reviews..\nIt seems to me that most of the negative reviewers are trying not to\n\"follow the crowd,\" and seem unique in their unrealistic absolute\nhatred of this film. Everyone is entitled to their opinion.... But\njeez, even if this film isn't your cup of tea, it is incredibly\nentertaining. And this is coming from someone who usually is one of\nthose \"don't follow the crowd\" people. I reluctantly took my girlfriend\nto see it a week after release since she had been begging me since we\nsaw the previews. The theater was entirely sold out, even having been\nout a week at that point, and the entire theater was on the edge of\ntheir seats and gave quite the standing \"O\" at the end. I'm just\nsaying, in my humble opinion, even if you don't like the movie, you\ncertainly won't feel as if you've wasted your time.\n"
"\nNever again will I trust the Metascore. Big fan of David Fincher, but\nlet me tell you this movie was spectacularly bad. The score was ham\nhanded and clashed with the film itself and I was embarrassed for the\nactors at some points that they had to say the ridiculous lines in the\nterrible script.

Then we started rewriting the story and\nrecasting. For example, Ben Affleck could have played his own twin\nsister and it wouldn't have made the movie any more ridiculous. You\nmight love it. I really, really did not.\n"
"\nAfter reading the book I wasn't expecting much (the book is awful too)\nbut I absolutely did not enjoy watching this film. The lead actress was\nterrible and her voice overs were simply annoying. She and Ben affleck\nhad no chemistry what so ever. I didn't enjoy the book but this\nfilm....it actually made the book worse (originally I rated the book a\n2, after this, it's a 1). Save your $10 and Don't SEE IT! First words\nout of my friends mouth when it ended? \"Thanks for that, that's 2 1/2\nhrs of my life I can never get back\" to which I wholeheartedly agreed.<br><br>Apparently to submit a review there is a minimum of 10 lines. As I've\nsaid what I needed to say I am now just taking up space.\n"
"\nI had a pleasant surprise over the last weekend; free HBO Cinamax time!\nSo I caught up on some films I had heard about but haven't seen. This\nwas one of them. I wish I had read other member reviews....I wouldn't\nhave wasted my time. It wasn't the acting. It was the completely\nconvoluted/implausible/mistake-ridden/crappy plot that stunk. REALLY\nbad. It annoys me that supposed \"art\" and \"film\" professionals are so\nwound up in their own little worlds they can't see the terrible stuff\nthey produce. Just read most of the other reviews. Don't they use\n\"focus\" groups or something to get feedback before the release?? If so,\nthe groups must be drinking the same water as the production staff (can\nyou say So Cal??) Glad it was free and the only waste was the 2:27 of\nmy time. Don't bother seeing this.\n"
"\nIn one scene the word \"fucking\" was used over and over and I wonder\nwhere American movies are going to go next, some of the language was\ndisgusting. I had to engage subtitles to understand much of the mumbled\ndialogue, Rosemund Pike has a lovely natural speaking voice what a\nshame to see her speaking like she does in this movie How on earth does\nthis get a good rating? As for the story it is so improbable in parts\nas to be laughable, we used to have some great movies from America but\nthings are gradually getting worse. It seems only money matters in\nHollywood now, thankfully the odd one still pleases but not much to\nlook forward too, I prefer to watch a top British series on TV\n"
"\nReasonable plot development that builds in intensity throughout, with\nstrange and interesting elements added and developed as the movie\nprogresses.....culminating in a crap ending. I don't care about book\ncomparisons because a film should stand on it's own merit. Neil Patrick\nHarris is a bright spot in this whole effort and it surprised me that\nhe was so good. As an actor, unless he's portraying a cigar store\nIndian, Ben Affleck should stick to directing....which he's pretty good\nat. Rosamund Pike was good but it is not an Oscar winning performance.\nOthers in \"cameo\" supporting roles were just OK. It gets pretty intense\nand somewhat gory as the plot unfolds and I found the film to be overly\nlong, unnecessarily.\n"
"\nThis movie reminded me why I seldom attend movies anymore!<br><br>I was excited with anticipation to see this film and I must say I was\nleft feeling extremely disappointed. The acting was sub-par, the\ncharacters weren't believable and the story was far to drawn out and\nbecame almost laughably ridiculous as it evolved. I won't spoil the\nplot but I will say that if you watch this movie and haven't figured it\nout shortly after \"Amy\" goes missing than you should stick to watching\nSponge Bob. Isn't Hollywood capable of producing a captivating film\nanymore? The story was also unbelievable. No way in real life would the\nsuspect not be arrested much sooner giving his highly suspicious\nactivity and behavior. <br><br>Gone Girl = 2 wasted hours gone!\n"
"\nWhat a mess! If the concept of the \"faked murder\" appeals to you, skip\nthis train-wreck and go watch Ashley Judd, Bruce Greenwood and Tommy\nLee Jones do it somewhat well. It's not happening here. The hidden\nbaseline is a parody of what TV \"reality news\" does to shape public\nopinion, most of which is consumed as the truth by the ignorant masses.\nThat I can agree with. Heck, it describes all of politics today. But\nthe story itself is such junk - especially how the cops are complete\nidiots - and this woman's crazy schemes are consumed as truth. My\nfavorite is when the investigators who question her toward the end\n\"hush up\" the cop pointing out the huge holes in her nonsense story,\nbecause of all she's \"been through\". C'mon guys, you can't write better\nthan that?? If you want something suspenseful that will exercise your\nbrain this will completely disappoint you. If it wasn't for some decent\nacting of this garbage script I'd award it zero stars. IMHO.\n"
"\nGood suspense thriller and well worth watching. An ex Irish football\nlegend mentioned this wasn't great so I had low expectations. I think\nhe was wrong now after seeing it.<br><br>It is actually a very smart film, it is good in suspense, story line,\ndoes not go down predictable lines, has the stupidity and smartness of\npeople crafted into it, and as a thriller I thought this was good fare\nwith a superbly manipulative character in it.<br><br>It touches very well on relationships, domestic bliss, different\ndemands, infidelity, secrets and does not paint a picture of all is\neasy in love.<br><br>Good characters, good acting, good build up and thoroughly enjoyable\nfilm.\n"
"\nThe story is just full of contradictions, obscenely loses touch of\nreality. <br><br>What happened to all the misleading evidence and the notes that Amy\nleft? <br><br>Why the diary ended up in the fireplace that had nothing to do with\nDesi?<br><br>The cast and the plays were fantastic, alas this work will not leave a\ngood mark.<br><br>The last 15 minutes was a mix of joke and question marks and killed\nwhatever could be accomplished by the climax.\n"
"\nWith all due respect, I have come to the conclusion that I really\ndisliked this movie. When I got home from the theater, people asked me\nand I said, \"It was pretty good\", but the more I thought about the more\nridiculous things kept coming to mind. The stereotypes of the cunning\nwomen was unwelcome. Amy's sudden turn to violence was absurd. Prior to\nslashing Doogie Howser all she'd been guilty of was fraud. How do you\ngo from fraud to cold-blooded (and very bloody) first-degree murder\nwithout batting an eye? Also, all the cops were skinny dudes with\nordinary haircuts. Been up close to a police force any time in the past\n30 years? They're all skinhead bullies nowadays, not clean-cut gee-whiz\ndo-gooders like in this movie. And then Nick wordlessly ends up staying\nwith Amy? Just awful. The only mystery here is why people thought this\nwas any good.\n"
"\nThe movie seemed like a mystery thriller where the husband plays\ndetective to find his wife's killer/kidnapper and there will be the\nplot twist. That's how the trailer looked like. Too much ineffective\ncharacter build up that took 90 mins of the film. The plot was like an\neasy murder case from a Dateline episode and I am sure everything wrong\nwith the story has been enumerated on previous reviews. And I cannot\nbelieve how dumb the policemen were portrayed. The plot really sucks.\nWhen the credits started rolling, this movie left me with anger. If the\nstory in the book is the same as the movies, then, I am really glad\nthat I didn't read it.\n"
"\nAfter 30 minutes you are still not interested. The 30 minute time frame\nis the cutoff for interest. The lines in the movie are so idiotic that\na three year old could have written them. I think people that wrote\ngood reviews actually were getting paid to do it. My wife likes chic\nflic's but this one is so stupid and the dialogue is so stupid that\nonly an idiot could like it. The scenes are ridiculous, the police in\nthe story are stupid and do not act like police. The main character\nwhich happens to be Ben Aflec of should i say Aflac, is searching for\nclues that his wife left after she disappeared and how can I say how\nbad the script is. It is for an emotional response from women. Men do\nyourself a favor and DO NOT WATCH.\n"
"\nA drama in the beginning became a thriller by reasoning. The best muse\nI felt was the setting which provided the inspiration for the switch.\nThe best actor in the movie was Ben Affleck with best face - confused\nstate of mind. The story-line really I felt catered to the\nwell-informed because it changed. It's meant for those that anticipate\nwatching the whole movie not just parts. It requires attention and\nattention to detail; thought provoking. It used a favorite quality of\nmine called \"thinking outside the box\" with a retrospect to the\ninnermost thoughts of a killer. The metaphor and plot formed in the\nfolds of that relationship making this a unique book to movie thriller\n"
"\nI finally got around to watching 'Gone Girl'. With all the hype, I\nfigured it might be worth watching. It wasn't. My opinion is that this\nmovie fails due to poor directing, awful acting, lousy continuity, lack\nof plausibility, zero suspense. The biggest issue was Ben Affleck. Come\non people, he can't act. He doesn't act. I believe he could be replaced\nwith a cardboard cutout. Rosamund Pike was little better, but that may\nhave been a direction issue. Kim Dickens and Carrie Coon were the only\ntwo that brought game. Spoiler Alert, in my opinion, watching this move\nwill spoil your day. The rest of this is just filler. It seems that\nIMDb thinks reviews have to be long and boring. \" Your review does not\ncontain enough lines - the minimum length for reviews is 10 lines of\ntext. Please see the guidelines. Attempts to pad the comment with junk\nwords can result in your account being blocked from future\nsubmissions.\"\n"
"\nThe acting and the script is so bad in this movie it almost seems like\nsome surreal dream, with so many twists and turns in such a drawn out\nmovie it just does too much and too little at the same time, however\nthat is possible I have no idea but it manages that, there's a lot of\nscenes this movie could do without and if you've seen it you'll\nprobably know which ones and not to mention the message that it puts\nacross. seems to be that there are very little good movies around these\ndays and we cannot even rely on established directors and producers for\na good film anymore. steer clear of this movie, it is Ben Afflek's\nworst performance to date and that is saying something!\n"
"\nGone Girl is a 2014 American psychological thriller film directed by\nDavid Fincher and adapted by Gillian Flynn from her 2012 novel of the\nsame name. It stars Ben Affleck and Rosamund Pike. Set in the\nMidwestern United States, the film's story begins as a mystery about a\nman, Nick Dunne (Affleck), whose wife, Amy (Pike), has gone missing,\nand depicts the ensuing events that arise.<br><br>In Carthage, Mo., former New York-based writer Nick Dunne (Ben Affleck)\nand his glamorous wife Amy (Rosamund Pike) present a portrait of a\nblissful marriage to the public. However, when Amy goes missing on the\ncouple's fifth wedding anniversary, Nick becomes the prime suspect in\nher disappearance. The resulting police pressure and media frenzy cause\nthe Dunnes' image of a happy union to crumble, leading to tantalizing\nquestions about who Nick and Amy truly are.\n"
"\nThe amazing performance by Cate Blanchett in the movie Blue Jasmine was\nexplained for the mass audience. Plus, the women dominated movie was\nnarrated from a male perspective, so everything in the world could be\nnormal again. It was fairly predictable, and most of it has been seen\nin so many movies before. Only the last quarter there was a glimpse of\ngreat acting from the woman lead role, yet nonetheless it was not\nenough to convey a message or unleash an emotion. It was a typical Ben\nAffleck movie with a meaningless ending and no message whatsoever. Dull\nand unfinished. It is something that has been seen so many times\nbefore, that has lost all of its meaning.\n"
"\nThis starts off like a Lifetime thriller - Drew or Scott Peterson come\nto mind. But it's got a more A list cast and is slickly filmed with\nslightly too attractive household interiors and a black comedy vibe\nthat gives it a big screen style.<br><br>Ben Affleck looks quite weighed down as the unhappy husband. Rosamund\nPike's with her blank rather cold expression finally finds a role\nsuited to her as Amazing Amy.<br><br>The different perspectives and plot twists keep one interested and\nentertained for over 2 hours but the murder is just too much, more\nshocking than plausible. Something less brutal but more clever would\nhave made a better story.<br><br>Overall entertaining for its style but the story doesn't come together\nin a believable way.\n"
"\n@Points worth to mention.<br><br>~A new way of storytelling. The way Director approaches the script is\nengaging.You keep on guessing who is positive or negative.Some scenes\nare brilliant towards end. As an audience ,I found sometimes when\nscenes switches is difficult to keep up(visual adds like date etc).<br><br>~Story we can easily see the amount of detail research team has done,\nScript is able to pull off both the dark and bright part of the lead\ncharacters,It never allows you to settle down,events are well placed in\nbetween.<br><br>~Acting Both the lead actors are brilliant.Specially I like to mention\n'Rosamund Pike' She is amazing and beautiful.<br><br>Now: Why to watch<br><br>-If you are looking for Engaging Encounter. -Good acting. -Good\nStorytelling. <br><br>Why Not<br><br>-weak ending -Sometimes difficult to relate with the emotions of the\ncharacter in some scenes.\n"
"\nThis really is a very poor plot indeed - but it would be unfair to list\nthe many logical flaws here and so spill the story. But you can look up\nother websites for the synopsis if you want to discover what I mean. In\nsummary though not only does the plot defy all reasonable logic and\nexpectations of a true police investigation, but it's as if the author\ngets so far and doesn't know how to end the story and after dragging it\none for nearly 2 1/2 hours panics and ends it all abruptly very\nunsatisfactorily. The characterisation suddenly implodes at the end and\nthe main character played by Ben Affleck who has been stable and\nconsistent the rest of the movie within the last 5 minutes suddenly\nchanges 360 degrees to become a completely different character, which\nagain makes no sense. It really is a waste of time and money to buy\nthis DVD. I believe 90% of anyone who buys this DVD would not also be\ndisappointed with their purchase after viewing.\n"
"\nThis is what movie's all about...twists? <br><br>The plot and the script (which are at the service of the \"twists\") are\nnot credible, so the movie provides the same features as the typical\nafter-lunch entertainment TV movie.<br><br>It is a shame that a director such David Fincher could have plumbed\nsuch depths. Furthermore, it seems logical to satisfy both adapting to\nthe times and practical needs. Even so, Fincher still remains one of my\nfavorite live directors. But it's fairly common that early movies (in\nmost cases), are the best. To maintain quality over time it's beyond\nthe reach of most. Only directors as Peter Weir, Andrei Tarkovsky,\nKrzysztof Kieslowski, Joseph Losey...to name just a few, are able to\nkeep with that level of excellence.<br><br>4/10\n"
"\nI've never written a review on IMDb before, but I'm taking the time to\ndo it on this one!<br><br>My wife and I just spent what felt like 3 hours watching this movie,\nthat once it ended, left us staring at each other, until we began\nlaughing.<br><br>What a piece of crap! We like all of the cast, and typically they star\nin above average movies.<br><br>Not this time. So many holes in the plot, too many things that just\ndidn't make sense, and the ending that was impossible to believe.<br><br>How on earth could this have an 8.2 user rating (at the time of this\nreview)?!?!?!<br><br>Great acting, good drama, stupid plot, original storyline, horrible\ntwist that was way too unbelievable.\n"
"\nThis started of as an intense absorbing thriller. It really is an\nabsorbing plot, we see the steady deterioration in their marriage and\nthen the love affair that ruined it. At times we're with him, at others\nwith her. The plot has numerous weaknesses but generally carries itself\nquite well. I watched it and considered any number of ways the story\nwould end. Was he really the bad guy and she a poor mentally abused\nwife? Was she a crazed psychopath who would kill him in the dying\nembers of the film? And in the words of Docking, having prepared for\neverything I was not prepared for nothing! This film has the worst\n\"We've really run out of ideas\" ending in cinematic history. What a\nhuge 2hr and 30min let down!!!\n"
"\nI'm surprised at the viewer reviews of this movie. Every review I've\nseen for pages has been either a rating of 1 or a rating of 10 and I'm\namazed that what I considered a pretty mundane film is evoking such\nimpassioned opinions. The storyline of a wife framing her husband for\nher murder is a tale that has been told many times before (and often\ntold much better, imo). The plot was far-fetched with plenty of holes,\nas many reviewers have pointed out however, although I wasn't \"on the\nedge of my seat\", I was reasonably entertained. The antagonist was\ndefinitely despicable and I was rooting for Ben Affleck's flawed, yet\ngood, guy and his twin sister. All-in-all, I would sum it up as\nunremarkable - worth watching on video on a rainy night when you just\nwant to enjoy it for what it is without thinking too hard. If this\nmovie deserves a rating of 1 out of 10 (or for that matter 10 out of\n10) what do we have left for the truly awful (or truly masterful)\nmovies?\n"
"\nWhat a silly movie this is Creepy yuppie couple Nick and Amy live\nunhappily in the middle of American nowhere. For petty reasons, Amy\nturns nasty on Nick and plan the most incredible and far-fetched\ndisappearance act ever seen on screen.<br><br>In fact. Amy turns into a psycho-crazy criminal mastermind, committing\nseveral acts of violence on herself and others, all graphically shown\nin the movie.<br><br>I guess this is the reason why the rating of Gone Girl is still so\nhigh. It does not happen often to see a blond, beautiful, angelic,\nyoung woman doing what Amy does. It is a sort of moral-porn of female\ndebasement.<br><br>The plot is wrapped up by one of the sloppiest police investigations\never and by Amy and Nick deciding to stay unhappily together for\nreasons impossible to understand. Just like the rest of the movie.\n"
"\nThe more time passes since finishing \"Gone Girl\", the more the\naftertaste worsens. It did its job in keeping me guessing until the\nfinal credits, but with that bloated running time and those levels of\nhype, that can't be all it set out to do, right? Affleck and Pike are\nplaying such bland characters that I didn't care what happened to\neither of the Dunne party. I cared far more for Carrie Coon and Kim\nDickens, who were unquestionably side players. Neil Patrick Harris was\njust a plot device to get -SPOILER- Amy to return home and reveal that\nshe was alive.<br><br>Sure, Amy Dunne is a sociopath for the ages, but she's a terribly draw\ncharacter. This is all very hollow, like some big-budget Lifetime\nmovie.<br><br>No, thank you.<br><br>5/10\n"
"\nMay contain spoilers...<br><br>Unless your super curious to see for yourself then don't waste your\ntime. I wish I had known more before wasting my time.<br><br>To many things happened that should have been figured out which in turn\nmade this movie ridiculous. The people who figured out who she was that\nrobbed her of her money could have avoided charges by turning states\nevidence.<br><br>I hated how it ended where he is forced to take her back and forced to\nlive a lie and a life of hell. This movie makes the police look stupid.\nIt is to unrealistic....bad movie, oh wait really bad movie\n"
"\nLacked drama and suspense. Why did she disappear? I asked myself \"what\nwas the whole point?\". At first I thought it was going to be similar to\nthe Lacy Peterson story and I watched it to find out what the hype was\nall about. No hype here. Watch something better. This movie was too\nlong, boring and annoying. I am so disappointed. Everyone recommended\nit and I can't see why... The only thing I can say is that Ben Affleck\nplayed a good role as a clueless and dumb husband. The character Amy\nhad nothing better to do. She was miserable and clearly insane. I\nstarted this review a little before the movie ended, it made me that\nbored. BORED! I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone, sorry.\n"
"\nI have not read the book but will now just in the hope of finding\nsomething that justifies the hype around this story. The film was like\na farce which to me verged on the comical with the cartoon-esque type\ncharacters. Another reviewer comments that had this been billed as a\ndark comedy it might have just cut the mustard and with that I agree\nbut a tense psychological thriller? No way. It was not cleverly\nwritten, there were plot holes galore (the diary really bugged\nme...even after slight burning I think they could have told that it had\nbeen recently written)and the whole of Amy's escape story was just\nutter hogwash. The acting was abysmal; with the exception of Carrie\nCoon (Margo)who presented the only sympathetic and remotely realistic\ncharacter in the whole thing, Not my cup of tea at all.\n"
"\nThis film wasn't as bad as some people say it was. It was actually\ngood. It was a pretty nice psycho thriller. It had me guessing at times\nand there really weren't any dull moments. This film was well done with\njust enough suspense to keep me interested. The acting in this film was\ngreat as well. Now, I'm not a big fan of Tyler Perry's films but his\nacting is good. He had a wonderful performance in this film playing\nTannor Bolt, Nick Dunne's (Ben Affleck) lawyer. He was really perfect\nfor the part. For me it was kind of weird seeing Neil Patrick Harris\nplaying a serious roll as the crazy ex boy friend of Nick Dunne's (Ben\nAffleck) wife, Amy Dunne (Rosamund Pike). Rosamund Pike and the parts\nshe were in were well done! I mean she pulled that roll off! Amy Dunne\n(Rosamund Pike) was allegedly killed by her husband Nick Dunne (Ben\nAffleck). From the beginning Nick Dunne (Ben Affleck) is the suspect\nand the craziness starts from there. If you like mysteries/thrillers\nyou won't be disappointed with this one.\n"
"\nthe story has revenge , meticulous planning , cruel manipulation and\nlies everywhere . the lost lady looks very charming in first meeting .\ni would blame husband for disappearance of his wife . the news hungry\nmedia tears apart husband under investigation . the message is - it is\nhuman nature to take advantage and nobody is a saint . also laws are in\nwomen's favour who can frame their husband or lover if they don't obey\n. example - consensual sex can be reported as abuse and alleged\noffender has nowhere to go . there are some marriage lessons here -\nfirst, don't take your partner for granted . second , stay faithful .\nparents should give little freedom to children lest they feel burdened\nunder ideal behaviour expectations .\n"
"\nI was actually excited to see this movie because it was rated over 8.0.\nIf there were not so many huge holes in the story line and if they\ndidn't wreck the plot halfway through the movie, it could have been\nalright. They started by making you think that the husband had\nsomething to do with the wife's disappearance, then it was revealed\nthat the wife framed her husband. They should have just finished the\nstory by having him get revenge on her, but instead, they get some ex-\nlover involved to take the blame for everything and get killed too. The\nhusband and wife live happily ever after at the end of the movie! How\ncould he even live in the same house with such an evil manipulative\npsychotic murdering bitch?? How stupid are the police and detectives in\nthis movie? I could go on and on, but you can read the other bad\nreviews to see how ridiculous the plot and entire movie actually is. So\nmany things made no sense at all. We were very disappointed...why did\nsome of you give it such a high rating???\n"
"\nSo implausible. There is really nowhere to begin. The acting was\nadequate but the plot was so full of holes it was just sad. This movie\naveraged 8.2 on IMDb based on the input of over 300,000 viewers. Very\ntroubling. I guess the biggest problem I had was once her plan became\nobvious to nick and, (correct me if I'm wrong but did she not leave a\nnote with the Punch and Judy dolls admitting to the whole thing ????)\nnick doesn't go right to the police and say here I solved the case for\nyou the whole thing from then on was ruined. OK even if there wasn't a\nnote confessing to all the crimes and ending the mystery and the movie,\nstill, when they found all that stuff in (HIS SISTERS SHED!!!) why\nwould they not go to the police then, no normal human being let alone\ntwo would think that the police wouldn't find it or try to hide it for\na minute. It's crazy. How do the actors not say hey wait a minute this\ncould never happen. I'm so mad I stayed up to watch this hunk o junk\nthat I felt compelled to write my first review ever. So bad.\n"
"\nI'm not sure how this movie could have such a high rating. I suppose it\nhad its moments, but surely there has to be some, however thin,\nconnection that allows the audience to suspend belief enough to go with\nthe movie. That connection in Gone Girl is stretched beyond breaking\npoint pretty early on and never recovers.<br><br>The performances are good - I'm not saying it is a total stinker, but\nit just doesn't stand up to even the most casual reality check. If you\nwant to know some of the particular points that I refer to you can look\nat some of the recent reviews which outline them in great detail. But\nthen of course there are many spoilers to deal with - so here is a non\nspoiler warning - This Movie Is Just Too Far Fetched to suck you in so\nwhy not give it a miss?\n"
"\nWell that's two and a half hours of my life I won't get back. Settled\ndown to watch this film with high expectations. I love a good, clever\nthriller which has you guessing all the way through. This one is not.\nIts dreadful. Half an hour in, you realise it is meant to come across\nas an arty, intelligent piece all about control rather than the 'edge\nof the seat' thriller it is billed to be. We persevered, still thinking\nit may improve and half way through it picked up a little and left us\nthinking if the ending is good it will have been worth it. It wasn't.\nLoose ends all over the place, poor plot and merely acceptable acting\nwill leave you scratching your head and still asking questions, even at\nthe end. Mainly along the lines of 'Why did I bother?'\n"
"\nAlthough the film contains several gimmicks which have apparently\nattracted the attention of the easily entertained, the plot and story\nare deeply flawed.<br><br>The plot contains numerous gaps in logic which are so obvious that\nthere are already several threads about this.<br><br>Basically, the story involves a recently married couple. The husband is\nclearly not as enthralled with his wife as he was when he proposed. The\nwife, who is aware of this, has become a psychopath and will do\nanything to damage her husband.<br><br>The biggest and most ridiculous flaw in the film is that the wife,\namong other things, has decided to kill herself so that her husband\nwill be accused of murder and, she hopes, get the death penalty. This\nis much like the joke of the robber who tells a victim: \"Give me your\nmoney or I'll shoot myself.\"\n"
"\nThis is just an example of awesome filmmaking! Everything worked for\nthis movie! The acting was impeccable, every actor did their job\nbeautifully, and each character was so complex in the film. Everyone\nhad two sides to them, or at Least you come to find out. Rosamund Pike\nwas amazing as our lead actor, very well deserved Oscar nomination and\nGolden Globe nomination. And let's not forget Ben Affleck our other\nstar. He did a great job of playing the somewhat disturbed and confused\nhusband. This mystery thriller had soo many twists and turns throughout\nthe whole thing! That is what I love, surprises!! I was very shocked to\nsee tyler perry involved in this, but he did very well with his\nmaterial, and so did Neil Patrick Harris! Warning: if you get unsettled\nat rough violence or sex, this probably is not the one for you, the\nwhole story is very eery and somewhat dark. Oh, and the ending is mind\nbending!! Very exciting ending!\n"
"\nI've never wrote a review before but.. this was awful. Do yourself a\nfavor, learn from my mistake and do not watch it. Lame beginning, cheap\nending. There were a good 30 minutes when I thought the investigation\nwill save the movie a little but no. Non-realistic scenes and\ndecisions. Annoying from the beginning. Cant find enough bad words.\nI've never wrote a review before but.. this was awful. Do yourself a\nfavor, learn from my mistake and do not watch it. Lame beginning, cheap\nending.

"\nLove love loved this movie. Read the novel by Gillian Flynn and was\namazed by how sick and twisted the story line was I could not stop\ntalking about it and the fact the movie was coming out shortly after.\nLet me start out by saying the book to screen adaption was SPOT ON. The\nmovie did not leave out a lot of information from out of the books\nwhich normally is the case. Ben Affleck and Rosamund Pike were the\nideal couple I had pictured from the novel, their performances couldn't\nhave been done better by anyone else. Very happy with the casting. Kept\nmy attention the whole time, and could not wait for that twist. It was\neverything I had imagined. Very impressed with this movie. One of my\nfavorites most definitely. Go see this and watch it 100 times more\nafter that if you love the kind of movies that f#$% with your mind.\n"
"\nJust a tick above awful for me, and that's being kind cause it's\nChristmas. I hardly fought to make out any meaning out of this\ncommercial-filled 160min. waste of life.<br><br>The script is totally detached from the un-realistic characters, and\nthe flow of the story is for the most time boring. I admit to the nice\ntwist but that's about all that this movie has to offer. Those 5\nminutes where the whole 'mater-plan' is being revealed. <br><br>Sorry for the short review, I just think I already forgot it, just half\na day after watching it. <br><br>I do feel quite annoyed by the '8.4' (!) score shown here on IMDb\nthough - even more annoyed that i fell for it :)<br><br>don't waste your time, please.\n"
"\nThis movie was honestly among the worst and most over-hyped pieces of\ngarbage I've ever seen. Politically/morally repugnant in its\nirresponsible, misogynistic stereotypes, yeah, but almost as repugnant\nis the unendurably bad delivery of an abysmally written story. The\nsound was good, I will give it that, but everything else about it was\nterrible. Just terrible.<br><br>I suppose I shouldn't be surprised that it's so well rated. Given the\naudience for this type of drivel, I suppose there are plenty enough\npeople to enjoy it and rate it highly. That fills me with existential\ndread. Beam me up, Scotty! ASAP.\n"
"\nThere is not a thing I did not like about this film. I watched it\nwinter 2014 at Avenue Mall's Cineplexx in Osijek during its release\ndate in a Croatian European Union part. This is, according to my\nopinion, Ben Affleck's acting of a lifetime. I was astonished by\nRosamund Pike's marvelous acting as well. The plot was greatly\ninterpreted by David Fincher even greater than he did in a 1997 The\nGame film starring Michael Douglas. I adored the scenery in the film\nand the overall atmosphere was spooky in a rather good way. I will\nnever forget the posh scenery in and around a stone house with a wine\ncellar and Rosamund Pike's throat cutting.\n"
"\nRight on the occasion of their fifth wedding anniversary, Nick Dunne\n(Ben Affleck) finds that his wife, Amy (Rosamund Pike), has gone\nmissing under suspicious circumstances. The police's attention soon\nturns to the husband just as the high-profile case turns into a media\ncircus that uncovers dark secrets about a seemingly perfect marriage.<br><br>While Fincher's direction is no doubt stylish, Gone Girl plays out a\nlittle too long for the \"urban myth\" type of thriller that is ends up\nbeing. A thought-provoking start turns into sheer shock as characters\nbecome harder and harder to sympathize with. The very convincing acting\ncan't make up for an implausible and macabre script that made the movie\na disappointment in my eyes. All it manages to achieve in matters of\nleaving the viewer petrified is lost in a contrived plot and an\noverindulgent runtime.<br><br>6/10\n"
"\nI've read a lot of user reviews of this movie which give it a score of\none out of ten and sight numerous plot holes as the reason. I believe\nthat all these people are mistaken in their assessment. The point is,\nthe fact that the story that Amy Dunne tells the police when she\nfinally comes back is full of holes is intentional. The crime scene at\nthe start of the movie was meant to be poor. The whole way through the\nfilm, Nick Dunne feels like he's going crazy because it seems no one\nelse can see these holes. <br><br>I think it's meant to be a striking commentary on how the mass media\nand mob mentality can molded to believe any story regardless of the\nfacts present. Nick even says at one point: 'They disliked me, they\nliked me. They hated me and now they love me.' That line sets the tone\nof the thinking of the people and the story being constructed by the\nmedia. <br><br>It's a very well made movie. I've always enjoyed David Fincher's work\nbut I'm sad to say I think many people missed the point of this movie.\n"
"\nThere was a point at which I thought, \"This movie is brilliant! I never\nsaw that coming!\" It had me second-guessing my own perspective as a\nviewer. The plot was incredibly well thought out. Then, it went to far.\nIt wasn't just too long in terms of run-time, it was too long in terms\nof the number of plot twists before the end. It got too incredibly\noutlandish, cliché and sensational. In the end, I had no idea what the\nartful manipulator's end game was. What was the motivation? I don't\nknow what you want! This movie, like it's character, should have quit\nwhile it was ahead. Still, I think this is one of those stories that's\ngoing to stick with me. I'll find myself mulling over it in my head for\na while to come.\n"
"\nSo my wife, inspired by favorable critical as well as popular fanfare,\nhaving bought and finished reading the book exclaimed, \" now we have to\nwatch the movie. \" Upon the film's conclusion she looked at me and said\n\" Yeah, the book was no good either. \" We agreed that this flick is\nfodder for middle-of-the-night Lifetime channel viewing and that's not\na knock against Lifetime because we both enjoy the sordid salaciousness\nof many of their films, however most of the programming would never be\nconfused with brilliant filmmaking, which is what apparently happened\nwith the GG franchise. I see a lot of user ratings at \"1\" and while I\nunderstand that score, both Affleck and Pike are skilled actors not low\non the charisma scale. I can only believe that they didn't realize the\nstory would play out like an episode of \" The Edge of Night \" penned by\nTristan Tzara. I will say that I anticipate the MST3K version with\ngreat relish.\n"
"\nI loved the movie, more than the movie I only loved the book! If I had\nnot read the book before I watched the movie the ending would have been\na bigger surprise factor for me like it was for my fellow viewers. The\nmovie kept me hooked till the end and I couldn't wait to find out what\nwill happen next (even if i already knew it). The doze of excitement\nand entertainment this movie gives you is remarkable. The actor choices\nwere amazing, I would not be able to pick a better Amazing Amy myself.\nThe movie was mind blowing. What I also loved is that they kept they\nscript so close to the book. They really made an effort to present as a\nmovie that was so close to the descriptions in the book. Not only the\ncharacters but also the environment.\n"
"\nA truly terrible movie. Didn't care what happened to any of the\ncharacters. How could I, because I never knew them? There is absolutely\nno motivation given for the female lead's pathological ways. I thought\nwe might lead back to some trauma she had as a child, but no, that's\nnever fleshed out, she's a generic monster. Her parents just kind of\ndisappear. The male lead's no better.<br><br>The plot has many, many holes, enough to drive a semi-truck through.\nLike many modern movies, it's bloated up to 2 1/2 hours what could have\nbeen told in 1:45. Because of the positive reviews, I was waiting for\nsomething clever to happen, some twist, but it was predictable from the\nbeginning.<br><br>A black hole and waste of time. The fact it's gotten such great reviews\nfrom professional journalists may be an indication of how terrible US\nmovies have become. Compared to the latest superhero movie maybe it\nlooks great. I will be more wary about choosing movies if this is what\npeople like today.\n"
"\nI had heard SO much about this film. It lived up to it's buzz. The\nmovie is clever, funny, suspenseful, erotic, and heartbreaking at\ntimes. Rosamund Pike deserves all the reviews that she received for\nthis film. She chews up the scenery. While Ben Affleck is often miscast\nin films, he is perfect here. It has been a long time since I have\nenjoyed him in a film. The second and third acts really give him\nmaterial to sink his teeth in. The movie had so many twists and turns,\nwhich I love in movies. Gone Girl is one of the best movies I have seen\nrecently. David Fincher takes you on a ride that will stay with you\nlong after the credits end.\n"
"\nI really struggled not to rate this movie as one despite being\nextremely awful but then I realized I have seen a lot worse movies.\nMaybe the reason I wanted to rate this movie as \"One\" so bad is to\noffset of the mind-blowing gigantic bubble rating of 8.2!!!!!!!! To be\nfair to actors, they did what they were supposed to do, but with such\nextremely bad, no point, shallow script, there is no way this movie\ncould be even close to being acceptable, even if the naked- covered in\nblood-shower scene was performed by Julia Roberts and Anthony Hopkins.\nI mean that could have explained the high number of views and reviews\nbut not the rating. With such hype and high rating, chances are you\nwill probably watch this movie however, if you are one of those who\nactually value their own time and try to spend it on something worthy,\nthen this is a one you should not waste your time on.\n"
"\nThis evolved into a tight, suspenseful thriller: what happened. An\nintriguing story unfolded, but the movie went on and on and on. At the\nend, everyone has become seriously stupid and so the movie lost me.<br><br>Clearly, there was supposed to be an ironic story of a media feeding\nfrenzy. The TV coverage motivated the action of the characters. Okay,\nbut it was not told all that clearly and there was little irony and no\nhumor to this part of the movie.<br><br>Who was responsible for such a long picture. Anyone watching it could\ntell that the compelling nature of the story was dwindling.<br><br>Okay but could have been m much better (and shorter).\n"
"\nHaving seen the IMDb rating of 8.4 we decided this film was a must. It\nstarted off OK, i mean just OK, improved slightly then ended up as\ntotal drivel. <br><br>I had heard that the book was fantastic so there really is no excuse\nfor such a poor film. I think I guessed the twist within 5 minutes and\nwasted an inordinate amount of time to find out I was right and this\nwas p*sh. <br><br>From the pouring red wine on her pants to cry rape, being released from\nhospital after murdering a man without giving any full explanation and\nthe fact the husband who she tried to frame wheeled her back into the\nhouse with the aid of the FBI who all of a sudden were powerless but\nknew she was guilty . . . . It was an insult to intelligence.<br><br>A few shocking scenes that failed to shock really do not make up for\nthe couple of hours I've lost from my life.\n"
"\nYou couldn't get two worse actors or performances if you tried. This\nmovie is so flat it puts you to sleep within 25 minutes.<br><br>The book was pretty good, but BA has to be the worst big name actor\naround, and the story was dumbed down and flattened by the reading of\nthe diary and horrible narration.<br><br>The role of the invasive parents was played down, as was their mind\ncontrol of childhood Amy - probably the best part of the book was the\nusing and controlling parents, hardly played in the movie.<br><br>The book evoked emotion, the movie and the actors did not.<br><br>I can not understand how this was a popular movie, and the nominations\nfor awards are laughable. Contrast the emotions in this \"Popular\" movie\nto under-appreciated movies such as \"The Station Agent,\" or \"Reign Over\nMe\", both rated much lower but far superior movies.\n"
"\nMore like a list of things wrong with this film. Probably the most\ndisappointed I've ever felt after watching a film. It's only February,\nbut I'd be surprised if I saw a worse film this year. The amount of\nplot holes actually annoyed me. Amy's character wasn't at all\nconsistent. So much doesn't make sense. You feel nothing for the\ncharacters for the most part. Some bad casting choices were made. Is\nthat really how the case would be portrayed on television? Did Amy\nreally think that her final plan made any sense and wouldn't be found\nout. She's supposed to be both intelligent and meticulous. Leaving\nhospital covered in blood. The cameras in the home.\n"
"\nI do not understand the hype with this movie. I thought it was quite\ninteresting as long as one did not know what had happened to the\nmissing wife: that is about to half the movie. But after that it was\nonly long, boring and muddled, and the ending was just odd. Not at all\npsychologically believable. <br><br>It had no depth, no message, no substance. This can be okay once in\nawhile, if you instead get something thrilling: adventure, mystery,\nromance, horror, atmosphere, some good scares that make you jump,\nexciting characters, humour, witty dialogue... But this movie had none\nof that. The only thing that was good was the photo, and the fact that\nyou could see that they had had a lavish budget.\n"
"\nI hated the book. In the end, it became decrepit but at the beginning,\nit was evident that the person who made it desperately wanted to seem\nerudite. Well, a billion purchases by other people later...<br><br>This film is not poorly made, but it's built on a castle of pap (i.e.\nthe book) and as such, it's not translated badly. Where Fincher\nsucceeds, is about halfway through the film, where a specter comes into\nplay; that scene's good. The rest of the semi-good bits (i.e.\ncinematography, photo, glossy scenes, soundtrack) are there as well,\nbut I loathed Affleck's acting and I didn't really care about any of\nthe actors. I tried not to dislike the film; I went in with an open\nheard.<br><br>This is a crock of pap. Go see George Sluizer's \"The Vanishing\"\ninstead.\n"
"\nThis movie went through the paces.<br><br>Started out predictable and so so, rather blasé.<br><br>Then headed to a change about an hour in and that made it absolutely\nexcellent. Just really interesting, fun to watch, engaging, had me\ninvested in wondering what was going to happen next.<br><br>Then the end just went Wonka.<br><br>Like ludicrous and stupid. I ended up thinking that if that's what Nick\nwas stupid enough to settle for then that's what he deserved. Beyond\ndumb dumb dumb.<br><br>So disappointing! With a different ending this could have been a\nfantastic movie.\n"
"\nI'm speechless--utterly without speech, therefore taking the time to\nWRITE my first movie review ever. Not so bad that I wasted 2 1/2 hours\non this turkey (who hasn't done it before? and I'd probably have wasted\nit anyhow on something else), but that the critics' consensus is\nsomehow so high for this POS film. I venture to guess that they're\nrationalizing the film in whole to be as good as certain segments;\nprobably from subconscious fear of suffering the same letdown that the\nmore objective viewers (i.e., myself) are, meaning they just CANNOT--DO\nNOT--WILL NOT--believe this movie could go from bad to good to great to\nbad to just plain terrible effing lousy so fast. I almost don't blame\nthem: my head still wants to explode, and it's been over for half an\nhour. Good thing I stream. I'd be sooooo P.O.'d had I paid money to see\nthis, but wouldn't have in the first place if damn Rotten Tomatoes\nhadn't steered me wrong.\n"
"\nI think Gone Girl is the best movie in 2014. I enjoyed watching every\nsecond of it, in fact, I watched it again couple times.<br><br>Gone Girl is that kind of movie that leaves you with wow impression. I\nam so glad I have not read the book yet when watched this movie, so the\ntwist in the half of the movie is mind blowing surprise.<br><br>Rosamund Pike and Ben Affleck are brilliant in this movies. Actually I\nwatched Rosamund in her other movies before, and I think she was all\nright, but in Gone Girl, her acting is amazing. This is her best role,\nOscar worthy, its kinda pity she did not win the Oscar thou.<br><br>David Fincher is also amazing, like always. Almost all his movies is my\nfavorite, except for The Social Network. He did a great job in Gone\nGirl. Good story telling, good pacing, every seconds is enjoyable,\nreally there is no boring part in this movie.<br><br>Overall the acting, writing, and the cinematography are stunning, this\nis a beautiful movie. Like I told you it's the best movie in 2014.\n"
"\nI found this movie plot interesting, and decided to view it with my\nwife and kids. What a total waste of time. Already after a couple of\nminutes, we were looking at each other with an expression on our faces\nthat said \"Hmm this is a strange movie\". Well, we kept on watching it,\nhoping it would improve. At some points it did, but during the whole\nmovie we were all thinking that this movie was a waste of time. Since\nwe already had watched a lot of it, we just decided to see it through.\nwe all regret today. Why didn't we just stop after 5 minutes, 10\nminutes or 15 minutes ? We could have stopped and found another movie.<br><br>A great plot, with some good actors, all put together to a crappy\nmovie. 8.2 on IMDb? I really think that IMDb should investigate the\nvoting here...\n"
"\nWell, how's this for a terrific soap opera..... all too clever by half,\nand with so many new century thriller films, paints itself into a\ncorner that cannot be redeemed in the running time. Here is a great\nmodern destructive thriller with an ending that completely undoes the\nwhole film. Drone character husband meets cryptic woman manipulator who\nscores a 10/10 for bitch mayhem. Wealth allows plot points and absurd\nnew characters to be hired to glance sideways. In-joke about deception\nsees gay actor hired as hetero obsessed stalker lover. Ice blonde\nproves to be better temptress than all the men mired in ghastly double\ndealings. Oakie rednecks prove to be the smartest characters in WASP\nthriller. Stay gasping until the 139th minute. Admire the Frank Lloyd\nWright architecture. Toss food at the screen. Shake head as credits\nroll.\n"
"\nNot sure how this movie has such good reviews. It is one of the most\nboring and dumb movies I have ever seen in my entire life. This is 2\n1/2 hours of my life I will never get back. Do yourself a favor and\ndon't waste your time on this garbage.<br><br>I honestly gave it a shot I watched the thing the whole way though.\nAbout 1/4 of the way through the movie I really wanted to turn it off.\nIt just didn't keep my interest. The ending makes it even worse and\njust puts the icing on the cake for a terrible freaking movie.<br><br>I am glad I didn't go to see this in the movies because I would have\ndemanded to get my money back. I am usually pretty open minded when it\ncomes to movies. There have been a few I've seen that are like, \"Wow\nthat was terrible.\" This is definitely one of those in my opinion.\n"
"\nIn all disappointing film. The movie does have some merits. First half\nof the movie was interesting and with a half of the movie left i was\ngenuinely curious to know where this would go...unfortunately it went\ndownhill from there. Acting was pretty good especially Pike. Script was\nbelievable and while you could give it the benefit of the doubt in the\nfirst half after watching the whole film i realize it was actually\npoor. In the first half, some scenes make little sense, but you hope\nthat the rest of the movie will reveal the truth. It only gets worse.\nThe movie is full of plot holes and very illogical actions. It becomes\nlaughable in the end and i don't think that was the intention...\n"
"\nThe argument over the best suspense thriller director in recent times\nends with David Fincher. After successfully directing The Girl with The\nDragon Tattoo, Fincher presents another unpredictable thriller, Gone\nGirl (also adapted from a book with the same name). Gone Girl starts\nwith a cozy pace gradually getting the audience interested with a story\nbased on disappearance of Amy (inspiration to Amazing Amy series).\nAmy's husband falls into the suspect list as their bad marriage\nrelationship emerges. As the movie progress the captivated audience is\nmade to believe in something absolutely defying added with an even more\ndubious ending. Fincher intermixes tense relationship with violence to\ncreate a spectacular mystery. The show stealer performance by Rosamund\nPike is notable and justifies her character beautifully. It feels so\ngood that Fincher never disappoints with his work!\n"
"\nThis is a thriller/mystery movie that has quite a lot of cool twist and\nturns and shock value. Sure, there are some plot holes and certain\nareas that just doesn't make much sense. But when it comes tot he\noverall package of the movie, it's actually crafted very well. It's one\nof those movie that when you think you have everything figured out, it\nmakes another turn...In a good way. David Fincher is a great director\nand I was impressed with his movie \"Zodiac\" which this has a similar\nvibe going for. Except with more immersive elements and less detective\naspects going for it. Without giving much away when it comes to the\nplot. This is a movie that is worth seeing, especially if you are a\naudience member that enjoys watching mystery/thrillers.<br><br>8.4/10\n"
"\nI read the book and it was EXCELLENT I absolutely love her writing when\nI heard it was coming to the big screen I was worried about the casting\nbut I think Rosemund Pike was an absolutely PERFECT choice ! She was\namazing ! The way the movie was presented had all of the suspense and\nsurprise of the book, you literally never see each part coming, the\nfirst half you are SURE he did it then when it goes through the account\nstep by step of how she basically planned it all perfectly until she\nmade the one mistake your mouth drops open ( for someone that hasn't\nread the book) I think it was an excellent adaptation and I hope they\ndo another of Gillian Flynn's books!\n"
"\nThis is an amazing film, it keeps you on your toes from the start all\nthe way until the end. I would suggest it for anyone to watch, although\nit's 2 and a half hours long, not once was I bored! I would suggest\nthis film to anyone, it really is amazing!<br><br>It's Amazing, Gripping, Thrilling and highly intelligent!<br><br>It has a superb twist and you never expect what happens, this film is\nexciting and I'm so glad I got to see it.<br><br>For once I'd also suggest watching the trailer as it doesn't ruin the\nfilm although most of them do, I would happily watch this film over and\nover as it's surprising but yet it is still interesting!\n"
"\nWas looking forward to this film, had read positive reviews, etc. Very\ndisappointed after seeing this film. I admit it's not completely\nhorrible, but definitely not in the same category as other top rated\nfilms on this site. This is not an 8 or 9 IMO. Story and acting reaches\na comedic level, where at one point during the film I thought I was\nwatching a satirical dark comedy. Definitely a watchable film, but not\nclose to deserving the hype and attention it received. Rosamund Pike\nwas certainly memorable and in my opinion gave a much better\nperformance than Patricia Arquette in Boyhood, but again at times I\nfound the story downright laughable and implausible.\n"
"\nWe went to watch this movie because of many people recommending it and\nof course because of David Fincher. I was very surprised why it got so\nmuch acknowledgment. A big part of the run-time was unnecessary. In\ncomparison to his movie \"game\" in which every minute something utterly\nextraordinary was happening and it kept the audience in extreme\nsuspense, this one was mostly just fillers. Ben Afleck was just himself\n(he didn't need to do any acting here), while some of the cast were\nactually not bad so at least something to watch. All in all, not what I\nexpected. We left the cinema very disappointed. Didn't really worth it.\nSome parts were alright (I don't want to spoil anything) though, so\nthat's why I'm giving it a six. But mostly it was very predictable.\n"
"\nDavid Fincher is a master in making good films-especially\nthrillers.''Gone Girl'' is one of them.The atmosphere is dark and the\nfilm unrolls slowly,full of surprises.Ben Affleck is very good at his\nrole,so is Carrie Coon and Tyler Perry but the true revelation of the\nfilm is Rosamund Pike's performance!Her character is full of surprises\nand twists.Half of the film is a puzzle to the viewer and then,piece by\npiece the puzzle is complete.During the film you may start wondering\nabout how things are not always what they seem to be.The film's\nsoundtrack is also enigmatic and matches completely with the plot.I\nthink it's an excellent,mysterious film from the very beginning till\nthe end and will absolutely excite thriller fans!\n"
"\nNever posted on IMDb before, and I never thought I would, but this time\nI had to. <br><br>I am a movie buff, watched thousands of films and I love it. I was\nlooking forward to this movie. Great reviews, and 8.4 on IMDb. (I never\nread reviews, listen to my friends or EVER watch trailers because I\nlike going in with a clean slate, that's when I've had my best film\nexperiences. Try it!) <br><br>This movie is garbage. I love Fincher's work but he failed miserably at\nthis one. So the movie starts out as an interesting drama/thriller with\nthe usual effects. Then it turns over to black comedy/satire with the\nsame direction!?? I couldn't believe the last third, I've never seen\nthis many plot holes in ANY movie! Unbelievable!<br><br>Garbage\n"
"\nOkay, from where do I start? First when I heard Ben Affleck was in it\nsomething told me movie would suck &amp; it seems my inner voice was right,\nlol. At first, movie seems weird, no intense moments, nothing like\nthat. I keep watching in hope, something interesting comes, but in\nvain. It's just so dead, empty &amp; jumbled, that lacks everything. Oh, by\nthe way, there are lots of mistakes, I'm not going to mention all, but\na few, for example: she is interviewed at the hospital were she arrived\ncovered in blood, telling the story that she was raped. And nobody\ncleans the blood of her in the hospital, and she is in a room with lots\nof cops, plus husband, lawyer etc etc. Then she leaves with her husband\nthat was accused of murder and they go home together. It's just an\nenormous junk heap of illogical and nonsense movie! Oh and movie is so\nstretched... It's 2:30 minutes of boring, uninteresting &amp; unrealistic\nplot. It's as bad as Fincher's \"Fight Club\" which is another overrated\npiece of junk. Just avoid this movie, do no waste your time on it.\n"
"\nJust seen the film Gone Girl. <br><br>I really struggled with the book and found it incredulous so never\nfinished it but the film was getting good reviews so I thought I'd give\nit a go.<br><br>What a pile of crap!<br><br>Two and a half hours of my life wasted. The story is just unbelievable.\nNeither character makes you like them or hate them. They are just bland\nand, well, unbelievable. <br><br>By the end I just wanted someone to firebomb the house and kill the\npair of them. I would have stood up and cheered. As it happened it has\na really lame ending.<br><br>A waste of my life. Utter tripe!\n"
"\nActually a good well acted movie till the end. Ben Affleck was\nexcellent and Rosamund Pike had me 100% convinced she was evil\nincarnate. Carrie Coon as Ben's twin sister and Kim Dickens as the lead\ndetective also gave excellent performances. As for the story, I can\ndeal with sad endings where the hero dies like Braveheart, Cool Hand\nLuke, and endless others. When the credits came up on Gone Girl, I\ncould only regret spending over 2 hrs to watch a movie that left me\nthat angry. I would have preferred she had just killed Ben Affleck and\ngotten away with it. Assuming the book had the same ending I would have\nthrown it across the room upon finishing it. I enjoyed the movie up\ntill the end but that completely ruined it for me.\n"
"\nThought this would be a good thriller, but ultimately it was draining\nand depressing. Would think any man who sees this film would never want\nto have sex again......it portrayed woman/women as being monstrous and\nmen as passive, sex-crazed zombies. The story had so many loose ends\nand unbelievable scenes, such as where she returns home covered in\nblood.....then she's at the hospital - there had to be an exam, then\ngiving an interview to detectives, then comes home still covered in\nblood....how much time elapsed during these scenes, and who would allow\nher to drive around, carry on, covered in blood for all that time? With\ngreat emphasis on crass words for women, violent sex scenes, and a\nscore that sounded like a synthesizer importing screeches from an\nairport runway, this was one depressing film. The only place it was\nbelievable was in its depiction of the media and how they revel in\ntragedy and perversion. If this becomes our prime form of entertainment\nwe are in big trouble. Need to watch a pre-1960 film or musical now.\n"
"\nThe first act of the movie is the run-of-the-mill wife gone missing,\nthe husband accused of killing her plot. This is clearly established in\nthe theatrical trailer and may have thrown off some potential viewers.\nTo the people who are familiar with David Fincher's work, this is not\nthe case with Gone Girl.<br><br>Yes, the first act is very ordinary, but the second act uproots\nwhatever ever considered dull about the movie as it takes a rapid turn\ninto thriller stardom, resembling something taken out of a Hitchcock\nmovie. Only a handful directors can completely enhance the movie's\nnarrative through editing, and Fincher is one of them. I know there is\na lot of praise around Rosamund Pike's performance, which makes it easy\nto overlook Ben Affleck. He plays the tired, oblivious and boyish\nreally well. This may be the very reason why he is completely\noverlooked.<br><br>And in a time of sequels, prequels, remakes and biopics, finally a\ncontemporary piece of work! Stellar!\n"
"\nNever again will I trust the Metascore. Big fan of David Fincher, but\nlet me tell you this movie was spectacularly bad. The score was ham\nhanded and clashed with the film itself and I was embarrassed for the\nactors at some points that they had to say the ridiculous lines in the\nterrible script. I felt every single minute of this 149 minute movie.\nAt one point my husband turned to me and whispered \"this is really bad\"\nand we started laughing. Then we started rewriting the story and\nrecasting. For example, Ben Affleck could have played his own twin\nsister and it wouldn't have made the movie any more ridiculous. You\nmight love it. I really, really did not.\n"
"\nGone Girl is directed by the mastermind of David Fincher. Amazingly\nwritten by Gillian Flynn whom wrote the novel the film is based on.\nStarring Ben Affleck as Nick Dunne and Rosamund Pike as Amy Elliot\nDunne. On the day of their 5th wedding anniversary Nick's wife, Amy\ndisappears out of nowhere, and this crazy, intense and haunting journey\nbegins. David Fincher and Gillian Flynn's intelligent storytelling\ntrough out this fantastic journey will keep at the edge of your seat\nfrom start to end. The soundtrack and score is also very intense and\nhaunting, and has huge impact on the film. The performances from all\nthe actors, especially Rosamund Pike are top notch which really helps\nthe element of the realism stand out in this film. <br><br>Gone Girl is easily the best film I have seen this year so far, and I\nhave to give it a 10/10. It is also one of the best films from David\nFincher in my opinion. I strongly advice everyone to go and see Gone\nGirl, it is one thrilling ride.\n"
"\nHaving read the book, it was not an easy feat who will be able to bring\nto life the leading character of the book, which is Amy Dunne. Her\ncharacter is so complex, that Rosamund Pike deserves all awards that\nwill be coming to her. She was able to give Amy the mysterious vibe but\nlikable aura of a socialite New Yorker.<br><br>The score of the film is perfect, as it builds up suspense and the tone\nof the story. Great supporting performance by Ben Affleck, and the\nactress who plays her sister. Great ensemble cast who works together to\ndelivery the dark humor lines in the film.<br><br>This movie will definitely be an instant classic and I cant wait to\nwatch it again!\n"
"\nI wish I could rate this movie with a 0 Maybe the first part, is OK,\nbefore anything happens. When the action starts, you see that the\nacting, the plot, everything starts to go down the drain. I must say\nthat in general the acting is very bad, and there are very stupid\nmoments. Like when the wife returns after killing her ex-boyfriend, she\nis interviewed at the hospital were she arrived covered in blood,\ntelling the story that she was raped. Well nobody cleans all the blood\nof her in the hospital, and she is in a room with at least 10 FBI\nagents that look goofy, a lot of local police, plus husband, lawyer etc\netc. Then she leaves with her husband that was accused of murder and\nthey go home together. Then I walk out, maybe 10-15 minutes before what\nI understand was a awful ending.<br><br>How can IMDb give such a high rating?????\n"
"\nGone Girl had the potential for a great plot and movie, the plot was\ngiven away very early on as you knew he didn't do it because of the bar\nscene with his sister, then I sat there bored with a couple of moments\nof interest. Seemed to have some resemblance to the Lacy Peterson case,\nin other words lost some otherwise originality. So you know what is\ngoing to happen what you didn't know was all the details of why, which\nfound dull, I like more of a traditional mystery/drama. Personally\ndidn't see any academy award acting. The ending was way to far fetched,\njust absolutely unbelievable that 3 law enforcement agency would just\ntake a position of \"Oh Well\", the group grope to interview her was\ntotally unrealistic, I really was wondering if this was such a low\nbudget film they just didn't have enough funds to complete the movie\nand they had to jam multiple plots in a single scene. I think the hype\nthis is getting is why people believe our entire world is contrived, we\ncan't all be crazy. The movie was a loser.\n"
"\nDavid Fincher has done what i thought was the impossible, by making a\nmovie from a book, and it actually being good, i'm even going to say\nbetter than the book, and i don't give that out lightly.<br><br>First off, the use of sound within the film, both diegetic and\nnondiegetic really sell this film to me, it does a great job in\nunnerving us as an audience and its just a little off, if i looked at\nthe score of the film, i wouldn't be surprised if it comprised of\ntritones (For those who don't know, tritones make music sound just that\ntad off), and the synth sorta sound reminds me a lot of Alex Forrest's\nsignature tune from \"Fatal Attraction (1987), Adrian Lyon\"<br><br>The Story is fantastic it really shows the disconnect between people in\nthe modern day, and how the media influences everything so strongly.<br><br>In Summary this movie is a great watch, and if you enjoy the genre, or\njust trying to put together pieces of a metaphorical puzzle you will\nenjoy this movie.\n"
"\nSpoiler Alert -- In a time when we are supposed to be more aware of\nmental illness, along comes this highly-crafted movie with high\nproduction values and a big budget whose whole story is based on the\nmachinations and manipulations of a psychopath. Really, what would\nHollywood do without psychopaths? They might have to come up with an\noriginal story that actually had something to say about life, the state\nof the world, etc. This movie is purely a fiction to waste a few hours,\nit won't make you ponder or reflect on anything, save the bizarre\nending and the inevitable question: why did Nick stay? It doesn't\nmatter. This story has nothing to do with real life.\n"
"\nVERY MINOR SPOILERS BELOW<br><br>The first half of the film is pretty nice: it builds tension, mystery\nand manages to grab the viewer's attention. However the second half\nquickly undoes everything that's been shown earlier.<br><br>What's worse, the second part becomes incredibly implausible, very\ntedious, and lacking any interest because it ventures into so unlikely\nsituations and reactions, you cannot help but wonder why people act\nlike they act. For instance the police, who are very captious in the\nfirst half of the film, later believe everything they're told without\ndoubting. Other people similarly and drastically change their mind and\nwe are not given any reasonable explanation.<br><br>To give the film due credit, it's impeccably played, it has, like many\nother Fincher's films, its very likable palette.<br><br>Probably this film is about all sorts of psychos, at least its lead\ncharacters are. However the film doesn't give a chance to root for any\nof them due to their faults.\n"
"\nSPOILER!!!<br><br>I read the book, I watched the movie, let me tell you something: This\nis the dumbest s***storm they ever tried to sell me as good.<br><br>Just one thing, and it will say it all: Is this good??? NO! I read the\nbook and I thought it was the most unrealistic s**t I ever saw in my\nlife (especially the Amy and the FBI part where they believed\neverything although the whole story was screaming I'M A F****ING LIAR!)\nthe movie was the same... it's a huge disappointment both the book and\nthe movie<br><br>this whole thing is dumb. the girl is clearly a psychopath, they try to\nsell her as mastermind who thinks about EVERYTHING. They try to show\nthe police as stupid bastards who will believe every coincidence just\nbecause the woman was raped\n"
"\nLuckily I watched this soulless piece of crap as part of awards season\nscreenings, which means I didn't pay for it. I cannot believe this is\nthe shooting script they signed off - the amount of plot holes and\ncontinuity gaffes is staggering. I cannot believe that all these highly\ntalented people agreed to be in this hollow piece that uses all of its\n148 minutes to say absolutely nothing. David Fincher is clearly a\ntalented director, in full technical control of the medium, but after\nwatching this, and having watched most of his previous films, I have to\nconclude that his films very often have nothing relevant to say.\nTechnical prowess counts for nothing if the film has no soul, which is\nwhat I think of Gone Girl. I gave it a 4 for the acting, it is the only\naspect worth noting here. The end is absolutely appalling, character\ndevelopment is shallow, and that graphic extended murder scene was\npretty gratuitous, horrid and unnecessary. But what else could I expect\nfrom a director who chose to remake an already perfect film (Girl With\nThe Dragon Tattoo)?\n"
"\nTwisted is all I can say without giving anything away, great movie one\nof my favourites of 2014 ,Big fan of Ben Affleck (Good Will Hunting,The\nTown and Boiler Room)Rosamund Pike only seen her in (Jack Reacher.)And\nis crazy in this one.<br><br>One to watch twice for sure , OK so the ending might make you mad, but\nthe movie will throw you curve ball after curve ball till you get tired\nof presuming who it may be. <br><br>This film is full of thrills chills and suspense, which you wont forget\nafter its of over, it will make your heart beat , it made my wife's for\nsure lol,its not what your think, so get ready for a roller-coaster of\na movie you will like this one.\n"
"\nI really like David Fincher as a Director and some of his previous\nmovies are my favorite (e.g. Seven). Gone girl is a dull movie with\ntotally no surprise or tension. Everything in this movie is so\npredictable. Actually from the very first minutes of the movie you know\nthat the wife is responsible for all what is happening and that she\nfaked it all herself to make the husband look bad - as a revenge for\ntheir unsuccessful marriage. On top of that we have really, really bad,\nfake acting (especially Ben Affleck). The story isn't realistic and\nsometimes behavior of the characters or their actions seem simply\nstupid. The idea for the movie is actually quite interesting and could\nturn into a really great movie. But well... it is what it is\n"
"\nPlease don't waste your time or money on this hyped-up piece of\ngarbage. I don't think I've ever been as disappointed in an ending (not\nthat the beginning and middle were all that great) as I was with this\nstupid, illogical movie. The only spoiler I have is one of the biggest\nplot fails ever... she's escaped her captor by slitting his thread,\nshe's virtually covered with blood, and the hospital simply allows her\nto go home, where she coyly showers it off. Totally amazing that this\nmovie has gotten the positive press and reviews it has received - if\nthis doesn't make you realize how incredible Hollywood hype/marketing\nsystem is at distorting reality, nothing will. I only wish I could give\nit a zero.\n"
"\nAvoid this couple at all costs - they are very toxic. Gone Girl is a\nmisleading title since Amy is not a girl. She used to be a childhood\nstorybook celebrity named Amy but there is nothing girlish like about\nher in this movie. In fact she calls herself the C-word. David Fincher\nhas made some of my favorite movies (Fight Club, Zodiac, etc.) but this\nis not one of my favorites. This movie is all the things I dislike in a\nmovie - tedious, depressing, unlikeable characters, dark photography,\nmoody music, strange casting, smug dialogue. This might work with The\nGirl with the Dragon Tattoo but come to think of it - that was no girl\neither.\n"
"\nI cannot believe how disappointed I was watching this film. Form all of\nthe reviews I thought I was about to see a modern classic. In instead I\nwatched a movie so lacking in common sense that the last hour was\nalmost unwatchable. The plot is very obvious (even the ending). Without\ngiving away any plot lines, it seems that in this film, common sense\nand the trail of evidence does not exist once the real story is\nrevealed. As the last hour of the movie dragged on and on, I was hoping\nfor some redeeming scene that would make everything right or at least\nmake sense. Unfortunately this did not happen. Maybe one of the worst\n\"good\" movies I've ever scene. If this is what people think is good\nplot twists, then the IQ of movie watchers has gone down into the\nsingle digits.\n"
"\nThe most satisfying thing about this movie is writing this review.\nWhilst I'm a firm believer in the adage, \"to each his own,\" and I\ncertainly mean no disrespect to others' opinions, I do worry over\nconsumers' standards that movie-goers are able to say anything\nredeeming about this film. Many other reviewers have nailed the\nstupidity of the plot and the absurdity of most aspects of the\nstoryline so I'll leave that alone. Suffice to say that at the end, I\nfelt as violated as Amy Dunne claimed she was. I can't believe that\nsuch a large group of professionals watched the rushes and felt\nsatisfied with what they'd created. Oh and about the foul language -\nhow did Bogart, Wayne, Heston, Lancaster, Kirk Douglas, Davis and\nCrawford ever make an impact without the filthy language? Oh yeah -\nthey call it acting. I rate myself as reasonably intelligent and I'm no\nprude but I like a bit of subtlety which I believe any true art form\nallows for. This was rank nonsense and I gave myself an uppercut for\nwatching it but am slightly redeemed now.\n"
"\nInsipid. Tepid. Vacuous. The first 30 minutes are the most pretentious\nscript ever written in the history of film making. Please, somebody,\nburn every copy of this film ever distributed.... To try to sit through\nthis film to its uninspired and tired (read: \"lame\") ending challenges\nthe endurance. Okay, let's start with the actors: Ben Affleck has not\nmade a good movie-- i.e. a movie a viewer might be able to sit\nthrough-- since Jay &amp; Silent Bob Strike Back. Who forced/corralled\nRosamund Pike into making this?!? Who willingly makes movies with\nAffleck besides Jennifer Lopez?!?! Really? I was sitting on the couch\nwith my wife for the first 30 minutes of this movie and was forced to\nhit the pause button an physically leave the room for minutes at a time\nduring the first thirty minutes. God help America, Hollywood, acting,\nand movie-making.\n"
"\nThis does contain a spoiler, one that if I would have known I wouldn't\nhave wasted my time or money. I don't like to even watch trailers on\nmovies because I want no preconception of how a movie is going to be.\nThis movie has single handily changed 30+ years of thinking.<br><br>I thought the story was very well written and acted, despite almost\nalways knowing what the twists were going to be until... The pace was\nso slow and could have been compressed into a normal 75-85 minute\nmovie. My guess is that the reason there was no ending was because they\nran out of time for dragging it on like they did.<br><br>When the credits hit the entire audience I was with pretty much let out\na stream of obscenities and we all felt like the\nproducers/directors/studio all just gave us two middle fingers. I could\nhave dealt with the slow pace if they would have just wrapped up the\nmovie.\n"
"\nwell well well thanks a lot for spoiling 150 minutes of my life, i\nstill don't understand why this film is so highly rated. i guess i\nshould not believe in ratings of IMDb anymore , please don't watch this\ntrash its such a waste of time, a girl , to avenge the betrayal gets\nhold of her husband by planting a successful crime scene (that can\nhappen only in movies) and that girl ends up patching up with him\nagain, if this all had to happen then what was the fun of making that\ndirt of 150 mints, so awful ending. those who rated it 10 must be\nbanned for further rating, the most disgusting movie i have seen in my\nlife, and yes what happened to police in the end , they knew she was\ncriminal but they couldn't do anything, wow u think we are buffoons ,\nget a life Mr director and please don't breed, regards!\n"
"\nI'll keep this sweet and simple. Just read any of the other 1/10\ncomments for the synopsis. <br><br>You would be better off spending two and a half hours staring at a wall\nrather than watching this Swiss cheese of a movie. I didn't read the\nbook but if it was as riddled with plot holes as this crap was, I would\nrecommend it only to my mortal enemy.<br><br>What truly made me write this review is the horrible human beings that\nexcept money to write 10/10 comments for garbage like this. And just\nfor your information scabs , if I was the marketing execs paying for\nthose comments, I would expect some stuff a little bit more human and\nas little less Siskel and Ebert.\n"
"\nIf they shortened it down to maybe 1 hour and 45min.It would be worth\ntwo stars.But they didn't! As most Hollywood movies with overpaid\npeople who can't act,they stretch it way beyond way beyond what they\ngot storyline <br><br>I haven't read the book,and after watching the movie I don't want to\neither.<br><br>Rosamund pike does a fairly good job of being a manipulative cunning\nbitch.Bt could just as easy be replaced. And affleck does whatever it's\nhe does.Look stupid I call it,but others referred to it as acting<br><br>There's so many plot holes that I wouldn't know where to begin. Start\nwith all the stuff he supposedly bought,most stores have security cam\nthese days, should be fairly easy too see if he was the one purchasing\nthe items or not\n"
"\nSome of the worst dialog I've ever seen in a movie. Bad story, flat\nacting. The critics who gave this good reviews should find other work.<br><br>I read the book, so I know what the story was supposed to be. This\ndisjointed telling does no credit to the book.<br><br>I can't imagine how the director managed to get such terrible\nperformances out of experienced actors. It's a real credit to bad\ndirecting. The only character who really clicks is the sister. Affleck\nlooks like they already paid him, and he's ready to go home.<br><br>This movie had absolute no emotional impact. The characters were too\nflat and the dialog too unrealistic to have any effect. The storyline\nwas poorly conceived.<br><br>The mostly positive reviews for this movie demonstrate, once again, how\nmost people are not very observant or discerning about what they watch.\n"
"\nThis is by far the worst movie I have ever seen in my entire life - and\nI'm 62 years old and have seen A LOT of movies.<br><br>I failed to see any plot and failed to see the point of even making\nthis into a movie.<br><br>I have read that this movie actually is based on a book. I am not sure\nif they missed something from the book or if it was the director's take\non the book - or what.<br><br>I would hope that the book made more sense and that the person using\nthe book just didn't comprehend it well - or if the book was just as\nbad.<br><br>This has got to be the only movie that I have searched online for \"why\"\n- \"why even bother to put this into a movie\"?<br><br>I admit it was unlike any other movie I have seen in my life - maybe\nthat was the point - to be different. Well they got that right - a\nlittle too different if you ask me.<br><br>Don't waste your time as you will be sadly disappointed you just wasted\nover an hour of your life because the movie is gripping.\n"
"\nQuite honestly, this was one of the best movies I've ever had the\nprivilege of seeing. Not sure why there are so many negative reviews..\nIt seems to me that most of the negative reviewers are trying not to\n\"follow the crowd,\" and seem unique in their unrealistic absolute\nhatred of this film. Everyone is entitled to their opinion.... But\njeez, even if this film isn't your cup of tea, it is incredibly\nentertaining. And this is coming from someone who usually is one of\nthose \"don't follow the crowd\" people. I reluctantly took my girlfriend\nto see it a week after release since she had been begging me since we\nsaw the previews. The theater was entirely sold out, even having been\nout a week at that point, and the entire theater was on the edge of\ntheir seats and gave quite the standing \"O\" at the end. I'm just\nsaying, in my humble opinion, even if you don't like the movie, you\ncertainly won't feel as if you've wasted your time.\n"
"\nNever again will I trust the Metascore. Big fan of David Fincher, but\nlet me tell you this movie was spectacularly bad. The score was ham\nhanded and clashed with the film itself and I was embarrassed for the\nactors at some points that they had to say the ridiculous lines in the\nterrible script. I felt every single minute of this 149 minute movie.\nAt one point my husband turned to me and whispered \"this is really bad\"\nand we started laughing. Then we started rewriting the story and\nrecasting. For example, Ben Affleck could have played his own twin\nsister and it wouldn't have made the movie any more ridiculous. You\nmight love it. I really, really did not.\n"
"\nAfter reading the book I wasn't expecting much (the book is awful too)\nbut I absolutely did not enjoy watching this film. The lead actress was\nterrible and her voice overs were simply annoying. She and Ben affleck\nhad no chemistry what so ever. I didn't enjoy the book but this\nfilm....it actually made the book worse (originally I rated the book a\n2, after this, it's a 1). Save your $10 and Don't SEE IT! First words\nout of my friends mouth when it ended? \"Thanks for that, that's 2 1/2\nhrs of my life I can never get back\" to which I wholeheartedly agreed.<br><br>Apparently to submit a review there is a minimum of 10 lines. As I've\nsaid what I needed to say I am now just taking up space.\n"
"\nI had a pleasant surprise over the last weekend; free HBO Cinamax time!\nSo I caught up on some films I had heard about but haven't seen. This\nwas one of them. I wish I had read other member reviews....I wouldn't\nhave wasted my time. It wasn't the acting. It was the completely\nconvoluted/implausible/mistake-ridden/crappy plot that stunk. REALLY\nbad. It annoys me that supposed \"art\" and \"film\" professionals are so\nwound up in their own little worlds they can't see the terrible stuff\nthey produce. Just read most of the other reviews. Don't they use\n\"focus\" groups or something to get feedback before the release?? If so,\nthe groups must be drinking the same water as the production staff (can\nyou say So Cal??) Glad it was free and the only waste was the 2:27 of\nmy time. Don't bother seeing this.\n"
"\nIn one scene the word \"fucking\" was used over and over and I wonder\nwhere American movies are going to go next, some of the language was\ndisgusting. I had to engage subtitles to understand much of the mumbled\ndialogue, Rosemund Pike has a lovely natural speaking voice what a\nshame to see her speaking like she does in this movie How on earth does\nthis get a good rating? As for the story it is so improbable in parts\nas to be laughable, we used to have some great movies from America but\nthings are gradually getting worse. It seems only money matters in\nHollywood now, thankfully the odd one still pleases but not much to\nlook forward too, I prefer to watch a top British series on TV\n"
"\nReasonable plot development that builds in intensity throughout, with\nstrange and interesting elements added and developed as the movie\nprogresses.....culminating in a crap ending. I don't care about book\ncomparisons because a film should stand on it's own merit. Neil Patrick\nHarris is a bright spot in this whole effort and it surprised me that\nhe was so good. As an actor, unless he's portraying a cigar store\nIndian, Ben Affleck should stick to directing....which he's pretty good\nat. Rosamund Pike was good but it is not an Oscar winning performance.\nOthers in \"cameo\" supporting roles were just OK. It gets pretty intense\nand somewhat gory as the plot unfolds and I found the film to be overly\nlong, unnecessarily.\n"
"\nThis movie reminded me why I seldom attend movies anymore!<br><br>I was excited with anticipation to see this film and I must say I was\nleft feeling extremely disappointed. The acting was sub-par, the\ncharacters weren't believable and the story was far to drawn out and\nbecame almost laughably ridiculous as it evolved. I won't spoil the\nplot but I will say that if you watch this movie and haven't figured it\nout shortly after \"Amy\" goes missing than you should stick to watching\nSponge Bob. Isn't Hollywood capable of producing a captivating film\nanymore? The story was also unbelievable. No way in real life would the\nsuspect not be arrested much sooner giving his highly suspicious\nactivity and behavior. <br><br>Gone Girl = 2 wasted hours gone!\n"
"\nWhat a mess! If the concept of the \"faked murder\" appeals to you, skip\nthis train-wreck and go watch Ashley Judd, Bruce Greenwood and Tommy\nLee Jones do it somewhat well. It's not happening here. The hidden\nbaseline is a parody of what TV \"reality news\" does to shape public\nopinion, most of which is consumed as the truth by the ignorant masses.\nThat I can agree with. Heck, it describes all of politics today. But\nthe story itself is such junk - especially how the cops are complete\nidiots - and this woman's crazy schemes are consumed as truth. My\nfavorite is when the investigators who question her toward the end\n\"hush up\" the cop pointing out the huge holes in her nonsense story,\nbecause of all she's \"been through\". C'mon guys, you can't write better\nthan that?? If you want something suspenseful that will exercise your\nbrain this will completely disappoint you. If it wasn't for some decent\nacting of this garbage script I'd award it zero stars. IMHO.\n"
"\nGood suspense thriller and well worth watching. An ex Irish football\nlegend mentioned this wasn't great so I had low expectations. I think\nhe was wrong now after seeing it.<br><br>It is actually a very smart film, it is good in suspense, story line,\ndoes not go down predictable lines, has the stupidity and smartness of\npeople crafted into it, and as a thriller I thought this was good fare\nwith a superbly manipulative character in it.<br><br>It touches very well on relationships, domestic bliss, different\ndemands, infidelity, secrets and does not paint a picture of all is\neasy in love.<br><br>Good characters, good acting, good build up and thoroughly enjoyable\nfilm.\n"
"\nThe story is just full of contradictions, obscenely loses touch of\nreality. <br><br>What happened to all the misleading evidence and the notes that Amy\nleft? <br><br>Why the diary ended up in the fireplace that had nothing to do with\nDesi?<br><br>The cast and the plays were fantastic, alas this work will not leave a\ngood mark.<br><br>The last 15 minutes was a mix of joke and question marks and killed\nwhatever could be accomplished by the climax.\n"
"\nWith all due respect, I have come to the conclusion that I really\ndisliked this movie. When I got home from the theater, people asked me\nand I said, \"It was pretty good\", but the more I thought about the more\nridiculous things kept coming to mind. The stereotypes of the cunning\nwomen was unwelcome. Amy's sudden turn to violence was absurd. Prior to\nslashing Doogie Howser all she'd been guilty of was fraud. How do you\ngo from fraud to cold-blooded (and very bloody) first-degree murder\nwithout batting an eye? Also, all the cops were skinny dudes with\nordinary haircuts. Been up close to a police force any time in the past\n30 years? They're all skinhead bullies nowadays, not clean-cut gee-whiz\ndo-gooders like in this movie. And then Nick wordlessly ends up staying\nwith Amy? Just awful. The only mystery here is why people thought this\nwas any good.\n"
"\nThe movie seemed like a mystery thriller where the husband plays\ndetective to find his wife's killer/kidnapper and there will be the\nplot twist. That's how the trailer looked like. Too much ineffective\ncharacter build up that took 90 mins of the film. The plot was like an\neasy murder case from a Dateline episode and I am sure everything wrong\nwith the story has been enumerated on previous reviews. And I cannot\nbelieve how dumb the policemen were portrayed. The plot really sucks.\nWhen the credits started rolling, this movie left me with anger. If the\nstory in the book is the same as the movies, then, I am really glad\nthat I didn't read it.\n"
"\nAfter 30 minutes you are still not interested. The 30 minute time frame\nis the cutoff for interest. The lines in the movie are so idiotic that\na three year old could have written them. I think people that wrote\ngood reviews actually were getting paid to do it. My wife likes chic\nflic's but this one is so stupid and the dialogue is so stupid that\nonly an idiot could like it. The scenes are ridiculous, the police in\nthe story are stupid and do not act like police. The main character\nwhich happens to be Ben Aflec of should i say Aflac, is searching for\nclues that his wife left after she disappeared and how can I say how\nbad the script is. It is for an emotional response from women. Men do\nyourself a favor and DO NOT WATCH.\n"
"\nA drama in the beginning became a thriller by reasoning. The best muse\nI felt was the setting which provided the inspiration for the switch.\nThe best actor in the movie was Ben Affleck with best face - confused\nstate of mind. The story-line really I felt catered to the\nwell-informed because it changed. It's meant for those that anticipate\nwatching the whole movie not just parts. It requires attention and\nattention to detail; thought provoking. It used a favorite quality of\nmine called \"thinking outside the box\" with a retrospect to the\ninnermost thoughts of a killer. The metaphor and plot formed in the\nfolds of that relationship making this a unique book to movie thriller\n"
"\nI finally got around to watching 'Gone Girl'. With all the hype, I\nfigured it might be worth watching. It wasn't. My opinion is that this\nmovie fails due to poor directing, awful acting, lousy continuity, lack\nof plausibility, zero suspense. The biggest issue was Ben Affleck. Come\non people, he can't act. He doesn't act. I believe he could be replaced\nwith a cardboard cutout. Rosamund Pike was little better, but that may\nhave been a direction issue. Kim Dickens and Carrie Coon were the only\ntwo that brought game. Spoiler Alert, in my opinion, watching this move\nwill spoil your day. The rest of this is just filler. It seems that\nIMDb thinks reviews have to be long and boring. \" Your review does not\ncontain enough lines - the minimum length for reviews is 10 lines of\ntext. Please see the guidelines. Attempts to pad the comment with junk\nwords can result in your account being blocked from future\nsubmissions.\"\n"
"\nThe acting and the script is so bad in this movie it almost seems like\nsome surreal dream, with so many twists and turns in such a drawn out\nmovie it just does too much and too little at the same time, however\nthat is possible I have no idea but it manages that, there's a lot of\nscenes this movie could do without and if you've seen it you'll\nprobably know which ones and not to mention the message that it puts\nacross. seems to be that there are very little good movies around these\ndays and we cannot even rely on established directors and producers for\na good film anymore. steer clear of this movie, it is Ben Afflek's\nworst performance to date and that is saying something!\n"
"\nGone Girl is a 2014 American psychological thriller film directed by\nDavid Fincher and adapted by Gillian Flynn from her 2012 novel of the\nsame name. It stars Ben Affleck and Rosamund Pike. Set in the\nMidwestern United States, the film's story begins as a mystery about a\nman, Nick Dunne (Affleck), whose wife, Amy (Pike), has gone missing,\nand depicts the ensuing events that arise.<br><br>In Carthage, Mo., former New York-based writer Nick Dunne (Ben Affleck)\nand his glamorous wife Amy (Rosamund Pike) present a portrait of a\nblissful marriage to the public. However, when Amy goes missing on the\ncouple's fifth wedding anniversary, Nick becomes the prime suspect in\nher disappearance. The resulting police pressure and media frenzy cause\nthe Dunnes' image of a happy union to crumble, leading to tantalizing\nquestions about who Nick and Amy truly are.\n"
"\nThe amazing performance by Cate Blanchett in the movie Blue Jasmine was\nexplained for the mass audience. Plus, the women dominated movie was\nnarrated from a male perspective, so everything in the world could be\nnormal again. It was fairly predictable, and most of it has been seen\nin so many movies before. Only the last quarter there was a glimpse of\ngreat acting from the woman lead role, yet nonetheless it was not\nenough to convey a message or unleash an emotion. It was a typical Ben\nAffleck movie with a meaningless ending and no message whatsoever. Dull\nand unfinished. It is something that has been seen so many times\nbefore, that has lost all of its meaning.\n"
"\nThis starts off like a Lifetime thriller - Drew or Scott Peterson come\nto mind. But it's got a more A list cast and is slickly filmed with\nslightly too attractive household interiors and a black comedy vibe\nthat gives it a big screen style.<br><br>Ben Affleck looks quite weighed down as the unhappy husband. Rosamund\nPike's with her blank rather cold expression finally finds a role\nsuited to her as Amazing Amy.<br><br>The different perspectives and plot twists keep one interested and\nentertained for over 2 hours but the murder is just too much, more\nshocking than plausible. Something less brutal but more clever would\nhave made a better story.<br><br>Overall entertaining for its style but the story doesn't come together\nin a believable way.\n"
"\n@Points worth to mention.<br><br>~A new way of storytelling.

As an audience ,I found sometimes when\nscenes switches is difficult to keep up(visual adds like date etc).<br><br>~Story we can easily see the amount of detail research team has done,\nScript is able to pull off both the dark and bright part of the lead\ncharacters,It never allows you to settle down,events are well placed in\nbetween.<br><br>~Acting Both the lead actors are brilliant.Specially I like to mention\n'Rosamund Pike' She is amazing and beautiful.<br><br>Now: Why to watch<br><br>-If you are looking for Engaging Encounter. -Good acting. -Good\nStorytelling. <br><br>Why Not<br><br>-weak ending -Sometimes difficult to relate with the emotions of the\ncharacter in some scenes.\n"
"\nThis really is a very poor plot indeed - but it would be unfair to list\nthe many logical flaws here and so spill the story. But you can look up\nother websites for the synopsis if you want to discover what I mean. In\nsummary though not only does the plot defy all reasonable logic and\nexpectations of a true police investigation, but it's as if the author\ngets so far and doesn't know how to end the story and after dragging it\none for nearly 2 1/2 hours panics and ends it all abruptly very\nunsatisfactorily. The characterisation suddenly implodes at the end and\nthe main character played by Ben Affleck who has been stable and\nconsistent the rest of the movie within the last 5 minutes suddenly\nchanges 360 degrees to become a completely different character, which\nagain makes no sense. It really is a waste of time and money to buy\nthis DVD. I believe 90% of anyone who buys this DVD would not also be\ndisappointed with their purchase after viewing.\n"
"\nThis is what movie's all about...twists? <br><br>The plot and the script (which are at the service of the \"twists\") are\nnot credible, so the movie provides the same features as the typical\nafter-lunch entertainment TV movie.<br><br>It is a shame that a director such David Fincher could have plumbed\nsuch depths. Furthermore, it seems logical to satisfy both adapting to\nthe times and practical needs. Even so, Fincher still remains one of my\nfavorite live directors. But it's fairly common that early movies (in\nmost cases), are the best. To maintain quality over time it's beyond\nthe reach of most. Only directors as Peter Weir, Andrei Tarkovsky,\nKrzysztof Kieslowski, Joseph Losey...to name just a few, are able to\nkeep with that level of excellence.<br><br>4/10\n"
"\nI've never written a review on IMDb before, but I'm taking the time to\ndo it on this one!<br><br>My wife and I just spent what felt like 3 hours watching this movie,\nthat once it ended, left us staring at each other, until we began\nlaughing.<br><br>What a piece of crap! We like all of the cast, and typically they star\nin above average movies.<br><br>Not this time. So many holes in the plot, too many things that just\ndidn't make sense, and the ending that was impossible to believe.<br><br>How on earth could this have an 8.2 user rating (at the time of this\nreview)?!?!?!<br><br>Great acting, good drama, stupid plot, original storyline, horrible\ntwist that was way too unbelievable.\n"
"\nThis started of as an intense absorbing thriller. It really is an\nabsorbing plot, we see the steady deterioration in their marriage and\nthen the love affair that ruined it. At times we're with him, at others\nwith her. The plot has numerous weaknesses but generally carries itself\nquite well. I watched it and considered any number of ways the story\nwould end. Was he really the bad guy and she a poor mentally abused\nwife? Was she a crazed psychopath who would kill him in the dying\nembers of the film? And in the words of Docking, having prepared for\neverything I was not prepared for nothing! This film has the worst\n\"We've really run out of ideas\" ending in cinematic history. What a\nhuge 2hr and 30min let down!!!\n"
"\nI'm surprised at the viewer reviews of this movie. Every review I've\nseen for pages has been either a rating of 1 or a rating of 10 and I'm\namazed that what I considered a pretty mundane film is evoking such\nimpassioned opinions. The storyline of a wife framing her husband for\nher murder is a tale that has been told many times before (and often\ntold much better, imo). The plot was far-fetched with plenty of holes,\nas many reviewers have pointed out however, although I wasn't \"on the\nedge of my seat\", I was reasonably entertained. The antagonist was\ndefinitely despicable and I was rooting for Ben Affleck's flawed, yet\ngood, guy and his twin sister. All-in-all, I would sum it up as\nunremarkable - worth watching on video on a rainy night when you just\nwant to enjoy it for what it is without thinking too hard. If this\nmovie deserves a rating of 1 out of 10 (or for that matter 10 out of\n10) what do we have left for the truly awful (or truly masterful)\nmovies?\n"
"\nWhat a silly movie this is Creepy yuppie couple Nick and Amy live\nunhappily in the middle of American nowhere. For petty reasons, Amy\nturns nasty on Nick and plan the most incredible and far-fetched\ndisappearance act ever seen on screen.<br><br>In fact. Amy turns into a psycho-crazy criminal mastermind, committing\nseveral acts of violence on herself and others, all graphically shown\nin the movie.<br><br>I guess this is the reason why the rating of Gone Girl is still so\nhigh. It does not happen often to see a blond, beautiful, angelic,\nyoung woman doing what Amy does. It is a sort of moral-porn of female\ndebasement.<br><br>The plot is wrapped up by one of the sloppiest police investigations\never and by Amy and Nick deciding to stay unhappily together for\nreasons impossible to understand. Just like the rest of the movie.\n"
"\nThe more time passes since finishing \"Gone Girl\", the more the\naftertaste worsens. It did its job in keeping me guessing until the\nfinal credits, but with that bloated running time and those levels of\nhype, that can't be all it set out to do, right? Affleck and Pike are\nplaying such bland characters that I didn't care what happened to\neither of the Dunne party. I cared far more for Carrie Coon and Kim\nDickens, who were unquestionably side players. Neil Patrick Harris was\njust a plot device to get -SPOILER- Amy to return home and reveal that\nshe was alive.<br><br>Sure, Amy Dunne is a sociopath for the ages, but she's a terribly draw\ncharacter. This is all very hollow, like some big-budget Lifetime\nmovie.<br><br>No, thank you.<br><br>5/10\n"
"\nMay contain spoilers...<br><br>Unless your super curious to see for yourself then don't waste your\ntime. I wish I had known more before wasting my time.<br><br>To many things happened that should have been figured out which in turn\nmade this movie ridiculous. The people who figured out who she was that\nrobbed her of her money could have avoided charges by turning states\nevidence.<br><br>I hated how it ended where he is forced to take her back and forced to\nlive a lie and a life of hell. This movie makes the police look stupid.\nIt is to unrealistic....bad movie, oh wait really bad movie\n"
"\nLacked drama and suspense. Why did she disappear? I asked myself \"what\nwas the whole point?\". At first I thought it was going to be similar to\nthe Lacy Peterson story and I watched it to find out what the hype was\nall about. No hype here. Watch something better. This movie was too\nlong, boring and annoying. I am so disappointed. Everyone recommended\nit and I can't see why... The only thing I can say is that Ben Affleck\nplayed a good role as a clueless and dumb husband. The character Amy\nhad nothing better to do. She was miserable and clearly insane. I\nstarted this review a little before the movie ended, it made me that\nbored. BORED! I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone, sorry.\n"
"\nI have not read the book but will now just in the hope of finding\nsomething that justifies the hype around this story. The film was like\na farce which to me verged on the comical with the cartoon-esque type\ncharacters. Another reviewer comments that had this been billed as a\ndark comedy it might have just cut the mustard and with that I agree\nbut a tense psychological thriller? No way. It was not cleverly\nwritten, there were plot holes galore (the diary really bugged\nme...even after slight burning I think they could have told that it had\nbeen recently written)and the whole of Amy's escape story was just\nutter hogwash. The acting was abysmal; with the exception of Carrie\nCoon (Margo)who presented the only sympathetic and remotely realistic\ncharacter in the whole thing, Not my cup of tea at all.\n"
"\nThis film wasn't as bad as some people say it was. It was actually\ngood. It was a pretty nice psycho thriller. It had me guessing at times\nand there really weren't any dull moments. This film was well done with\njust enough suspense to keep me interested. The acting in this film was\ngreat as well. Now, I'm not a big fan of Tyler Perry's films but his\nacting is good. He had a wonderful performance in this film playing\nTannor Bolt, Nick Dunne's (Ben Affleck) lawyer. He was really perfect\nfor the part. For me it was kind of weird seeing Neil Patrick Harris\nplaying a serious roll as the crazy ex boy friend of Nick Dunne's (Ben\nAffleck) wife, Amy Dunne (Rosamund Pike). Rosamund Pike and the parts\nshe were in were well done! I mean she pulled that roll off! Amy Dunne\n(Rosamund Pike) was allegedly killed by her husband Nick Dunne (Ben\nAffleck). From the beginning Nick Dunne (Ben Affleck) is the suspect\nand the craziness starts from there. If you like mysteries/thrillers\nyou won't be disappointed with this one.\n"
"\nthe story has revenge , meticulous planning , cruel manipulation and\nlies everywhere . the lost lady looks very charming in first meeting .\ni would blame husband for disappearance of his wife . the news hungry\nmedia tears apart husband under investigation . the message is - it is\nhuman nature to take advantage and nobody is a saint . also laws are in\nwomen's favour who can frame their husband or lover if they don't obey\n. example - consensual sex can be reported as abuse and alleged\noffender has nowhere to go . there are some marriage lessons here -\nfirst, don't take your partner for granted . second , stay faithful .\nparents should give little freedom to children lest they feel burdened\nunder ideal behaviour expectations .\n"
"\nI was actually excited to see this movie because it was rated over 8.0.\nIf there were not so many huge holes in the story line and if they\ndidn't wreck the plot halfway through the movie, it could have been\nalright. They started by making you think that the husband had\nsomething to do with the wife's disappearance, then it was revealed\nthat the wife framed her husband. They should have just finished the\nstory by having him get revenge on her, but instead, they get some ex-\nlover involved to take the blame for everything and get killed too. The\nhusband and wife live happily ever after at the end of the movie! How\ncould he even live in the same house with such an evil manipulative\npsychotic murdering bitch?? How stupid are the police and detectives in\nthis movie? I could go on and on, but you can read the other bad\nreviews to see how ridiculous the plot and entire movie actually is. So\nmany things made no sense at all. We were very disappointed...why did\nsome of you give it such a high rating???\n"
"\nSo implausible. There is really nowhere to begin. The acting was\nadequate but the plot was so full of holes it was just sad. This movie\naveraged 8.2 on IMDb based on the input of over 300,000 viewers. Very\ntroubling. I guess the biggest problem I had was once her plan became\nobvious to nick and, (correct me if I'm wrong but did she not leave a\nnote with the Punch and Judy dolls admitting to the whole thing ????)\nnick doesn't go right to the police and say here I solved the case for\nyou the whole thing from then on was ruined. OK even if there wasn't a\nnote confessing to all the crimes and ending the mystery and the movie,\nstill, when they found all that stuff in (HIS SISTERS SHED!!!) why\nwould they not go to the police then, no normal human being let alone\ntwo would think that the police wouldn't find it or try to hide it for\na minute. It's crazy. How do the actors not say hey wait a minute this\ncould never happen. I'm so mad I stayed up to watch this hunk o junk\nthat I felt compelled to write my first review ever. So bad.\n"
"\nI'm not sure how this movie could have such a high rating. I suppose it\nhad its moments, but surely there has to be some, however thin,\nconnection that allows the audience to suspend belief enough to go with\nthe movie. That connection in Gone Girl is stretched beyond breaking\npoint pretty early on and never recovers.<br><br>The performances are good - I'm not saying it is a total stinker, but\nit just doesn't stand up to even the most casual reality check. If you\nwant to know some of the particular points that I refer to you can look\nat some of the recent reviews which outline them in great detail. But\nthen of course there are many spoilers to deal with - so here is a non\nspoiler warning - This Movie Is Just Too Far Fetched to suck you in so\nwhy not give it a miss?\n"
"\nWell that's two and a half hours of my life I won't get back. Settled\ndown to watch this film with high expectations. I love a good, clever\nthriller which has you guessing all the way through. This one is not.\nIts dreadful. Half an hour in, you realise it is meant to come across\nas an arty, intelligent piece all about control rather than the 'edge\nof the seat' thriller it is billed to be. We persevered, still thinking\nit may improve and half way through it picked up a little and left us\nthinking if the ending is good it will have been worth it. It wasn't.\nLoose ends all over the place, poor plot and merely acceptable acting\nwill leave you scratching your head and still asking questions, even at\nthe end. Mainly along the lines of 'Why did I bother?'\n"
"\nAlthough the film contains several gimmicks which have apparently\nattracted the attention of the easily entertained, the plot and story\nare deeply flawed.<br><br>The plot contains numerous gaps in logic which are so obvious that\nthere are already several threads about this.<br><br>Basically, the story involves a recently married couple. The husband is\nclearly not as enthralled with his wife as he was when he proposed. The\nwife, who is aware of this, has become a psychopath and will do\nanything to damage her husband.<br><br>The biggest and most ridiculous flaw in the film is that the wife,\namong other things, has decided to kill herself so that her husband\nwill be accused of murder and, she hopes, get the death penalty. This\nis much like the joke of the robber who tells a victim: \"Give me your\nmoney or I'll shoot myself.\"\n"
"\nThis is just an example of awesome filmmaking! Everything worked for\nthis movie! The acting was impeccable, every actor did their job\nbeautifully, and each character was so complex in the film. Everyone\nhad two sides to them, or at Least you come to find out. Rosamund Pike\nwas amazing as our lead actor, very well deserved Oscar nomination and\nGolden Globe nomination. And let's not forget Ben Affleck our other\nstar. He did a great job of playing the somewhat disturbed and confused\nhusband. This mystery thriller had soo many twists and turns throughout\nthe whole thing! That is what I love, surprises!! I was very shocked to\nsee tyler perry involved in this, but he did very well with his\nmaterial, and so did Neil Patrick Harris! Warning: if you get unsettled\nat rough violence or sex, this probably is not the one for you, the\nwhole story is very eery and somewhat dark. Oh, and the ending is mind\nbending!! Very exciting ending!\n"
"\nI've never wrote a review before but.. this was awful. Do yourself a\nfavor, learn from my mistake and do not watch it. Lame beginning, cheap\nending. There were a good 30 minutes when I thought the investigation\nwill save the movie a little but no. Non-realistic scenes and\ndecisions. Annoying from the beginning. Cant find enough bad words.\nI've never wrote a review before but.. this was awful. Do yourself a\nfavor, learn from my mistake and do not watch it. Lame beginning, cheap\nending.

"\nLove love loved this movie. Read the novel by Gillian Flynn and was\namazed by how sick and twisted the story line was I could not stop\ntalking about it and the fact the movie was coming out shortly after.\nLet me start out by saying the book to screen adaption was SPOT ON. The\nmovie did not leave out a lot of information from out of the books\nwhich normally is the case. Ben Affleck and Rosamund Pike were the\nideal couple I had pictured from the novel, their performances couldn't\nhave been done better by anyone else. Very happy with the casting. Kept\nmy attention the whole time, and could not wait for that twist. It was\neverything I had imagined. Very impressed with this movie. One of my\nfavorites most definitely. Go see this and watch it 100 times more\nafter that if you love the kind of movies that f#$% with your mind.\n"
"\nJust a tick above awful for me, and that's being kind cause it's\nChristmas. I hardly fought to make out any meaning out of this\ncommercial-filled 160min. waste of life.<br><br>The script is totally detached from the un-realistic characters, and\nthe flow of the story is for the most time boring. I admit to the nice\ntwist but that's about all that this movie has to offer. Those 5\nminutes where the whole 'mater-plan' is being revealed. <br><br>Sorry for the short review, I just think I already forgot it, just half\na day after watching it. <br><br>I do feel quite annoyed by the '8.4' (!) score shown here on IMDb\nthough - even more annoyed that i fell for it :)<br><br>don't waste your time, please.\n"
"\nThis movie was honestly among the worst and most over-hyped pieces of\ngarbage I've ever seen. Politically/morally repugnant in its\nirresponsible, misogynistic stereotypes, yeah, but almost as repugnant\nis the unendurably bad delivery of an abysmally written story. The\nsound was good, I will give it that, but everything else about it was\nterrible. Just terrible.<br><br>I suppose I shouldn't be surprised that it's so well rated. Given the\naudience for this type of drivel, I suppose there are plenty enough\npeople to enjoy it and rate it highly. That fills me with existential\ndread. Beam me up, Scotty! ASAP.\n"
"\nThere is not a thing I did not like about this film. I watched it\nwinter 2014 at Avenue Mall's Cineplexx in Osijek during its release\ndate in a Croatian European Union part. This is, according to my\nopinion, Ben Affleck's acting of a lifetime. I was astonished by\nRosamund Pike's marvelous acting as well. The plot was greatly\ninterpreted by David Fincher even greater than he did in a 1997 The\nGame film starring Michael Douglas. I adored the scenery in the film\nand the overall atmosphere was spooky in a rather good way. I will\nnever forget the posh scenery in and around a stone house with a wine\ncellar and Rosamund Pike's throat cutting.\n"
"\nRight on the occasion of their fifth wedding anniversary, Nick Dunne\n(Ben Affleck) finds that his wife, Amy (Rosamund Pike), has gone\nmissing under suspicious circumstances. The police's attention soon\nturns to the husband just as the high-profile case turns into a media\ncircus that uncovers dark secrets about a seemingly perfect marriage.<br><br>While Fincher's direction is no doubt stylish, Gone Girl plays out a\nlittle too long for the \"urban myth\" type of thriller that is ends up\nbeing. A thought-provoking start turns into sheer shock as characters\nbecome harder and harder to sympathize with. The very convincing acting\ncan't make up for an implausible and macabre script that made the movie\na disappointment in my eyes. All it manages to achieve in matters of\nleaving the viewer petrified is lost in a contrived plot and an\noverindulgent runtime.<br><br>6/10\n"
"\nI've read a lot of user reviews of this movie which give it a score of\none out of ten and sight numerous plot holes as the reason. I believe\nthat all these people are mistaken in their assessment. The point is,\nthe fact that the story that Amy Dunne tells the police when she\nfinally comes back is full of holes is intentional. The crime scene at\nthe start of the movie was meant to be poor. The whole way through the\nfilm, Nick Dunne feels like he's going crazy because it seems no one\nelse can see these holes. <br><br>I think it's meant to be a striking commentary on how the mass media\nand mob mentality can molded to believe any story regardless of the\nfacts present. Nick even says at one point: 'They disliked me, they\nliked me. They hated me and now they love me.' That line sets the tone\nof the thinking of the people and the story being constructed by the\nmedia. <br><br>It's a very well made movie. I've always enjoyed David Fincher's work\nbut I'm sad to say I think many people missed the point of this movie.\n"
"\nThere was a point at which I thought, \"This movie is brilliant! I never\nsaw that coming!\" It had me second-guessing my own perspective as a\nviewer. The plot was incredibly well thought out. Then, it went to far.\nIt wasn't just too long in terms of run-time, it was too long in terms\nof the number of plot twists before the end. It got too incredibly\noutlandish, cliché and sensational. In the end, I had no idea what the\nartful manipulator's end game was. What was the motivation? I don't\nknow what you want! This movie, like it's character, should have quit\nwhile it was ahead. Still, I think this is one of those stories that's\ngoing to stick with me. I'll find myself mulling over it in my head for\na while to come.\n"
"\nSo my wife, inspired by favorable critical as well as popular fanfare,\nhaving bought and finished reading the book exclaimed, \" now we have to\nwatch the movie. \" Upon the film's conclusion she looked at me and said\n\" Yeah, the book was no good either. \" We agreed that this flick is\nfodder for middle-of-the-night Lifetime channel viewing and that's not\na knock against Lifetime because we both enjoy the sordid salaciousness\nof many of their films, however most of the programming would never be\nconfused with brilliant filmmaking, which is what apparently happened\nwith the GG franchise. I see a lot of user ratings at \"1\" and while I\nunderstand that score, both Affleck and Pike are skilled actors not low\non the charisma scale. I can only believe that they didn't realize the\nstory would play out like an episode of \" The Edge of Night \" penned by\nTristan Tzara. I will say that I anticipate the MST3K version with\ngreat relish.\n"
"\nI loved the movie, more than the movie I only loved the book! If I had\nnot read the book before I watched the movie the ending would have been\na bigger surprise factor for me like it was for my fellow viewers. The\nmovie kept me hooked till the end and I couldn't wait to find out what\nwill happen next (even if i already knew it). The doze of excitement\nand entertainment this movie gives you is remarkable. The actor choices\nwere amazing, I would not be able to pick a better Amazing Amy myself.\nThe movie was mind blowing. What I also loved is that they kept they\nscript so close to the book. They really made an effort to present as a\nmovie that was so close to the descriptions in the book. Not only the\ncharacters but also the environment.\n"
"\nA truly terrible movie. Didn't care what happened to any of the\ncharacters. How could I, because I never knew them? There is absolutely\nno motivation given for the female lead's pathological ways. I thought\nwe might lead back to some trauma she had as a child, but no, that's\nnever fleshed out, she's a generic monster. Her parents just kind of\ndisappear. The male lead's no better.<br><br>The plot has many, many holes, enough to drive a semi-truck through.\nLike many modern movies, it's bloated up to 2 1/2 hours what could have\nbeen told in 1:45. Because of the positive reviews, I was waiting for\nsomething clever to happen, some twist, but it was predictable from the\nbeginning.<br><br>A black hole and waste of time. The fact it's gotten such great reviews\nfrom professional journalists may be an indication of how terrible US\nmovies have become. Compared to the latest superhero movie maybe it\nlooks great. I will be more wary about choosing movies if this is what\npeople like today.\n"
"\nI had heard SO much about this film. It lived up to it's buzz. The\nmovie is clever, funny, suspenseful, erotic, and heartbreaking at\ntimes. Rosamund Pike deserves all the reviews that she received for\nthis film. She chews up the scenery. While Ben Affleck is often miscast\nin films, he is perfect here. It has been a long time since I have\nenjoyed him in a film. The second and third acts really give him\nmaterial to sink his teeth in. The movie had so many twists and turns,\nwhich I love in movies. Gone Girl is one of the best movies I have seen\nrecently. David Fincher takes you on a ride that will stay with you\nlong after the credits end.\n"
"\nI really struggled not to rate this movie as one despite being\nextremely awful but then I realized I have seen a lot worse movies.\nMaybe the reason I wanted to rate this movie as \"One\" so bad is to\noffset of the mind-blowing gigantic bubble rating of 8.2!!!!!!!! To be\nfair to actors, they did what they were supposed to do, but with such\nextremely bad, no point, shallow script, there is no way this movie\ncould be even close to being acceptable, even if the naked- covered in\nblood-shower scene was performed by Julia Roberts and Anthony Hopkins.\nI mean that could have explained the high number of views and reviews\nbut not the rating. With such hype and high rating, chances are you\nwill probably watch this movie however, if you are one of those who\nactually value their own time and try to spend it on something worthy,\nthen this is a one you should not waste your time on.\n"
"\nThis evolved into a tight, suspenseful thriller: what happened. An\nintriguing story unfolded, but the movie went on and on and on. At the\nend, everyone has become seriously stupid and so the movie lost me.<br><br>Clearly, there was supposed to be an ironic story of a media feeding\nfrenzy. The TV coverage motivated the action of the characters. Okay,\nbut it was not told all that clearly and there was little irony and no\nhumor to this part of the movie.<br><br>Who was responsible for such a long picture. Anyone watching it could\ntell that the compelling nature of the story was dwindling.<br><br>Okay but could have been m much better (and shorter).\n"
"\nHaving seen the IMDb rating of 8.4 we decided this film was a must. It\nstarted off OK, i mean just OK, improved slightly then ended up as\ntotal drivel. <br><br>I had heard that the book was fantastic so there really is no excuse\nfor such a poor film. I think I guessed the twist within 5 minutes and\nwasted an inordinate amount of time to find out I was right and this\nwas p*sh. <br><br>From the pouring red wine on her pants to cry rape, being released from\nhospital after murdering a man without giving any full explanation and\nthe fact the husband who she tried to frame wheeled her back into the\nhouse with the aid of the FBI who all of a sudden were powerless but\nknew she was guilty . . . . It was an insult to intelligence.<br><br>A few shocking scenes that failed to shock really do not make up for\nthe couple of hours I've lost from my life.\n"
"\nYou couldn't get two worse actors or performances if you tried. This\nmovie is so flat it puts you to sleep within 25 minutes.<br><br>The book was pretty good, but BA has to be the worst big name actor\naround, and the story was dumbed down and flattened by the reading of\nthe diary and horrible narration.<br><br>The role of the invasive parents was played down, as was their mind\ncontrol of childhood Amy - probably the best part of the book was the\nusing and controlling parents, hardly played in the movie.<br><br>The book evoked emotion, the movie and the actors did not.<br><br>I can not understand how this was a popular movie, and the nominations\nfor awards are laughable. Contrast the emotions in this \"Popular\" movie\nto under-appreciated movies such as \"The Station Agent,\" or \"Reign Over\nMe\", both rated much lower but far superior movies.\n"
"\nMore like a list of things wrong with this film. Probably the most\ndisappointed I've ever felt after watching a film. It's only February,\nbut I'd be surprised if I saw a worse film this year. The amount of\nplot holes actually annoyed me. Amy's character wasn't at all\nconsistent. So much doesn't make sense. You feel nothing for the\ncharacters for the most part. Some bad casting choices were made. Is\nthat really how the case would be portrayed on television? Did Amy\nreally think that her final plan made any sense and wouldn't be found\nout. She's supposed to be both intelligent and meticulous. Leaving\nhospital covered in blood. The cameras in the home.\n"
"\nI do not understand the hype with this movie. I thought it was quite\ninteresting as long as one did not know what had happened to the\nmissing wife: that is about to half the movie. But after that it was\nonly long, boring and muddled, and the ending was just odd. Not at all\npsychologically believable. <br><br>It had no depth, no message, no substance. This can be okay once in\nawhile, if you instead get something thrilling: adventure, mystery,\nromance, horror, atmosphere, some good scares that make you jump,\nexciting characters, humour, witty dialogue... But this movie had none\nof that. The only thing that was good was the photo, and the fact that\nyou could see that they had had a lavish budget.\n"
"\nI hated the book. In the end, it became decrepit but at the beginning,\nit was evident that the person who made it desperately wanted to seem\nerudite. Well, a billion purchases by other people later...<br><br>This film is not poorly made, but it's built on a castle of pap (i.e.\nthe book) and as such, it's not translated badly. Where Fincher\nsucceeds, is about halfway through the film, where a specter comes into\nplay; that scene's good. The rest of the semi-good bits (i.e.\ncinematography, photo, glossy scenes, soundtrack) are there as well,\nbut I loathed Affleck's acting and I didn't really care about any of\nthe actors. I tried not to dislike the film; I went in with an open\nheard.<br><br>This is a crock of pap. Go see George Sluizer's \"The Vanishing\"\ninstead.\n"
"\nThis movie went through the paces.<br><br>Started out predictable and so so, rather blasé.<br><br>Then headed to a change about an hour in and that made it absolutely\nexcellent. Just really interesting, fun to watch, engaging, had me\ninvested in wondering what was going to happen next.<br><br>Then the end just went Wonka.<br><br>Like ludicrous and stupid. I ended up thinking that if that's what Nick\nwas stupid enough to settle for then that's what he deserved. Beyond\ndumb dumb dumb.<br><br>So disappointing! With a different ending this could have been a\nfantastic movie.\n"
"\nI'm speechless--utterly without speech, therefore taking the time to\nWRITE my first movie review ever. Not so bad that I wasted 2 1/2 hours\non this turkey (who hasn't done it before? and I'd probably have wasted\nit anyhow on something else), but that the critics' consensus is\nsomehow so high for this POS film. I venture to guess that they're\nrationalizing the film in whole to be as good as certain segments;\nprobably from subconscious fear of suffering the same letdown that the\nmore objective viewers (i.e., myself) are, meaning they just CANNOT--DO\nNOT--WILL NOT--believe this movie could go from bad to good to great to\nbad to just plain terrible effing lousy so fast. I almost don't blame\nthem: my head still wants to explode, and it's been over for half an\nhour. Good thing I stream. I'd be sooooo P.O.'d had I paid money to see\nthis, but wouldn't have in the first place if damn Rotten Tomatoes\nhadn't steered me wrong.\n"
"\nI think Gone Girl is the best movie in 2014. I enjoyed watching every\nsecond of it, in fact, I watched it again couple times.<br><br>Gone Girl is that kind of movie that leaves you with wow impression. I\nam so glad I have not read the book yet when watched this movie, so the\ntwist in the half of the movie is mind blowing surprise.<br><br>Rosamund Pike and Ben Affleck are brilliant in this movies. Actually I\nwatched Rosamund in her other movies before, and I think she was all\nright, but in Gone Girl, her acting is amazing. This is her best role,\nOscar worthy, its kinda pity she did not win the Oscar thou.<br><br>David Fincher is also amazing, like always. Almost all his movies is my\nfavorite, except for The Social Network. He did a great job in Gone\nGirl. Good story telling, good pacing, every seconds is enjoyable,\nreally there is no boring part in this movie.<br><br>Overall the acting, writing, and the cinematography are stunning, this\nis a beautiful movie. Like I told you it's the best movie in 2014.\n"
"\nI found this movie plot interesting, and decided to view it with my\nwife and kids. What a total waste of time. Already after a couple of\nminutes, we were looking at each other with an expression on our faces\nthat said \"Hmm this is a strange movie\". Well, we kept on watching it,\nhoping it would improve. At some points it did, but during the whole\nmovie we were all thinking that this movie was a waste of time. Since\nwe already had watched a lot of it, we just decided to see it through.\nwe all regret today. Why didn't we just stop after 5 minutes, 10\nminutes or 15 minutes ? We could have stopped and found another movie.<br><br>A great plot, with some good actors, all put together to a crappy\nmovie. 8.2 on IMDb? I really think that IMDb should investigate the\nvoting here...\n"
"\nWell, how's this for a terrific soap opera..... all too clever by half,\nand with so many new century thriller films, paints itself into a\ncorner that cannot be redeemed in the running time. Here is a great\nmodern destructive thriller with an ending that completely undoes the\nwhole film. Drone character husband meets cryptic woman manipulator who\nscores a 10/10 for bitch mayhem. Wealth allows plot points and absurd\nnew characters to be hired to glance sideways. In-joke about deception\nsees gay actor hired as hetero obsessed stalker lover. Ice blonde\nproves to be better temptress than all the men mired in ghastly double\ndealings. Oakie rednecks prove to be the smartest characters in WASP\nthriller. Stay gasping until the 139th minute. Admire the Frank Lloyd\nWright architecture. Toss food at the screen. Shake head as credits\nroll.\n"
"\nNot sure how this movie has such good reviews. It is one of the most\nboring and dumb movies I have ever seen in my entire life. This is 2\n1/2 hours of my life I will never get back. Do yourself a favor and\ndon't waste your time on this garbage.<br><br>I honestly gave it a shot I watched the thing the whole way though.\nAbout 1/4 of the way through the movie I really wanted to turn it off.\nIt just didn't keep my interest. The ending makes it even worse and\njust puts the icing on the cake for a terrible freaking movie.<br><br>I am glad I didn't go to see this in the movies because I would have\ndemanded to get my money back. I am usually pretty open minded when it\ncomes to movies. There have been a few I've seen that are like, \"Wow\nthat was terrible.\" This is definitely one of those in my opinion.\n"
"\nIn all disappointing film. The movie does have some merits. First half\nof the movie was interesting and with a half of the movie left i was\ngenuinely curious to know where this would go...unfortunately it went\ndownhill from there. Acting was pretty good especially Pike. Script was\nbelievable and while you could give it the benefit of the doubt in the\nfirst half after watching the whole film i realize it was actually\npoor. In the first half, some scenes make little sense, but you hope\nthat the rest of the movie will reveal the truth. It only gets worse.\nThe movie is full of plot holes and very illogical actions. It becomes\nlaughable in the end and i don't think that was the intention...\n"
"\nThe argument over the best suspense thriller director in recent times\nends with David Fincher. After successfully directing The Girl with The\nDragon Tattoo, Fincher presents another unpredictable thriller, Gone\nGirl (also adapted from a book with the same name). Gone Girl starts\nwith a cozy pace gradually getting the audience interested with a story\nbased on disappearance of Amy (inspiration to Amazing Amy series).\nAmy's husband falls into the suspect list as their bad marriage\nrelationship emerges. As the movie progress the captivated audience is\nmade to believe in something absolutely defying added with an even more\ndubious ending. Fincher intermixes tense relationship with violence to\ncreate a spectacular mystery. The show stealer performance by Rosamund\nPike is notable and justifies her character beautifully. It feels so\ngood that Fincher never disappoints with his work!\n"
"\nThis is a thriller/mystery movie that has quite a lot of cool twist and\nturns and shock value. Sure, there are some plot holes and certain\nareas that just doesn't make much sense. But when it comes tot he\noverall package of the movie, it's actually crafted very well. It's one\nof those movie that when you think you have everything figured out, it\nmakes another turn...In a good way. David Fincher is a great director\nand I was impressed with his movie \"Zodiac\" which this has a similar\nvibe going for. Except with more immersive elements and less detective\naspects going for it. Without giving much away when it comes to the\nplot. This is a movie that is worth seeing, especially if you are a\naudience member that enjoys watching mystery/thrillers.<br><br>8.4/10\n"
"\nI read the book and it was EXCELLENT I absolutely love her writing when\nI heard it was coming to the big screen I was worried about the casting\nbut I think Rosemund Pike was an absolutely PERFECT choice ! She was\namazing ! The way the movie was presented had all of the suspense and\nsurprise of the book, you literally never see each part coming, the\nfirst half you are SURE he did it then when it goes through the account\nstep by step of how she basically planned it all perfectly until she\nmade the one mistake your mouth drops open ( for someone that hasn't\nread the book) I think it was an excellent adaptation and I hope they\ndo another of Gillian Flynn's books!\n"
"\nThis is an amazing film, it keeps you on your toes from the start all\nthe way until the end. I would suggest it for anyone to watch, although\nit's 2 and a half hours long, not once was I bored! I would suggest\nthis film to anyone, it really is amazing!<br><br>It's Amazing, Gripping, Thrilling and highly intelligent!<br><br>It has a superb twist and you never expect what happens, this film is\nexciting and I'm so glad I got to see it.<br><br>For once I'd also suggest watching the trailer as it doesn't ruin the\nfilm although most of them do, I would happily watch this film over and\nover as it's surprising but yet it is still interesting!\n"
"\nWas looking forward to this film, had read positive reviews, etc. Very\ndisappointed after seeing this film. I admit it's not completely\nhorrible, but definitely not in the same category as other top rated\nfilms on this site. This is not an 8 or 9 IMO. Story and acting reaches\na comedic level, where at one point during the film I thought I was\nwatching a satirical dark comedy. Definitely a watchable film, but not\nclose to deserving the hype and attention it received. Rosamund Pike\nwas certainly memorable and in my opinion gave a much better\nperformance than Patricia Arquette in Boyhood, but again at times I\nfound the story downright laughable and implausible.\n"
"\nWe went to watch this movie because of many people recommending it and\nof course because of David Fincher. I was very surprised why it got so\nmuch acknowledgment. A big part of the run-time was unnecessary. In\ncomparison to his movie \"game\" in which every minute something utterly\nextraordinary was happening and it kept the audience in extreme\nsuspense, this one was mostly just fillers. Ben Afleck was just himself\n(he didn't need to do any acting here), while some of the cast were\nactually not bad so at least something to watch. All in all, not what I\nexpected. We left the cinema very disappointed. Didn't really worth it.\nSome parts were alright (I don't want to spoil anything) though, so\nthat's why I'm giving it a six. But mostly it was very predictable.\n"
"\nDavid Fincher is a master in making good films-especially\nthrillers.''Gone Girl'' is one of them.The atmosphere is dark and the\nfilm unrolls slowly,full of surprises.Ben Affleck is very good at his\nrole,so is Carrie Coon and Tyler Perry but the true revelation of the\nfilm is Rosamund Pike's performance!Her character is full of surprises\nand twists.Half of the film is a puzzle to the viewer and then,piece by\npiece the puzzle is complete.During the film you may start wondering\nabout how things are not always what they seem to be.The film's\nsoundtrack is also enigmatic and matches completely with the plot.I\nthink it's an excellent,mysterious film from the very beginning till\nthe end and will absolutely excite thriller fans!\n"
"\nNever posted on IMDb before, and I never thought I would, but this time\nI had to. <br><br>I am a movie buff, watched thousands of films and I love it. I was\nlooking forward to this movie. Great reviews, and 8.4 on IMDb. (I never\nread reviews, listen to my friends or EVER watch trailers because I\nlike going in with a clean slate, that's when I've had my best film\nexperiences. Try it!) <br><br>This movie is garbage. I love Fincher's work but he failed miserably at\nthis one. So the movie starts out as an interesting drama/thriller with\nthe usual effects. Then it turns over to black comedy/satire with the\nsame direction!?? I couldn't believe the last third, I've never seen\nthis many plot holes in ANY movie! Unbelievable!<br><br>Garbage\n"
"\nOkay, from where do I start? First when I heard Ben Affleck was in it\nsomething told me movie would suck &amp; it seems my inner voice was right,\nlol. At first, movie seems weird, no intense moments, nothing like\nthat. I keep watching in hope, something interesting comes, but in\nvain. It's just so dead, empty &amp; jumbled, that lacks everything. Oh, by\nthe way, there are lots of mistakes, I'm not going to mention all, but\na few, for example: she is interviewed at the hospital were she arrived\ncovered in blood, telling the story that she was raped. And nobody\ncleans the blood of her in the hospital, and she is in a room with lots\nof cops, plus husband, lawyer etc etc. Then she leaves with her husband\nthat was accused of murder and they go home together. It's just an\nenormous junk heap of illogical and nonsense movie! Oh and movie is so\nstretched... It's 2:30 minutes of boring, uninteresting &amp; unrealistic\nplot. It's as bad as Fincher's \"Fight Club\" which is another overrated\npiece of junk. Just avoid this movie, do no waste your time on it.\n"
