"\nA decent comic book adaptation of the DC comic book character Green\nLantern. <br><br>It's certainly not as bad as some critics have made it out to be. <br><br>It's fun, the action sequences are flashy and exciting. The acting is\nall top notch and the humor is done really well. <br><br>Green Lantern is unpretentious, probably even one of the most\nunpretentious superhero movies ever made. It embraces its inherent\ngoofiness and excludes much of the angst and over-seriousness that we\nseen in other comic book movies like Batman and Spiderman. <br><br>The after-credits scene is awesome. A real fan pleaser and hopefully\nthey will make a sequel.\n"
"\nFor a comic book movie, Green Lantern had the potential to be great. If\nthe writers of the movie even watched the animated movie First Flight,\nthey would've been able to come up with a better script than what they\ndid. I think the cast did the best that they could with the corny lines\nand terrible writing.<br><br>Ryan Reynolds was believable as Hal Jordan, Blake Lively was\nexceptional in her role (which primarily involved looking pretty which\nshe is good at) and Mark Strong as Sinestro was flawless. Though I\nthoroughly disliked what the writers did to this movie, I do hope the\nGL series isn't written off. There is still enough in the story of\nGreen Lantern for a sequel, but for the love of Oa the old script\nwriters need to go and a brand new team needs to bring something to the\ntable. Mark Strong is an acting powerhouse and as we have seen in the\nDark Knight, it is the villain and not the hero that makes an\nexceptional comic book movie! Sinestro has to do for GL what the Joker\ndid for Batman! Thats my 2 cents\n"
"\nThey say that if you've seen one superhero movie, you've seen them all.\nThat's not entirely true, but if every superhero movie were like Green\nLantern, then it would be true. Green Lantern is your typical superhero\nmovie, so if you've seen quite a few superhero movies (like I have),\nyou'll know what's ahead. This is the problem with Green Lantern, it's\ntoo predictable and does nothing new to make it stand out from the\ncrowd. That's not necessarily a bad thing though, but it's not a good\nthing either. There are 3 good things in this movie. One, Peter\nSarsgaard as Hector Hammond is delightfully hammy and fun to watch.\nTwo, the SFX are cool and what they do with the Green Lantern ring is\nalso cool, and Parallax's design suits its evilness. Third, the fight\nbetween Hal and Parallax is the best scene in the movie. Other than\nthose things, it's average. If you've never seen a superhero movie\nand/or are a Green Lantern fan, this movie is worth seeing. Everyone\nelse should see X-Men: First Class.\n"
"\nDon't listen to the negative remarks. This is a great movie. I've been\na long time Green Lantern fan and the story line is a great adaptation\nfrom the comics. Yeah there are little things about the acting and\nwriting, but they are overshadowed by the excellent story. This movie\nis well worth your time and money. The origins and background are spot\non. I was glad the movie was built around the Green Lantern Corp. It is\nimportant to know that there is more than one Green Lantern. They did a\nreally good job of showing Hal's personality. My wife even liked this\nmovie. There is not dull moment. The momentum of the story keeps you\nfrom being bored.\n"
"\nAll I can say is that I was extremely impressed with this film. Based\non the trailers, I was expecting this film to be mediocre, I was wrong.\nIn my opinion, for a superhero film to work, it all narrows down to\nspecial effects and the acting. For this movie, both are great. This\nmovie may not have been as good as X-men: First Class or The Dark\nKnight, but it is an above average superhero movie. Ryan Reynolds is\ngood as always and Mark Strong delivered a strong performance as well.\nThis movie is heavy on special effects and they are SPECTACULAR. The\ndialogue is nothing new but don't expect it to be excellent given the\nfact that its a superhero movie. Overall, this movie was very well done\nand I liked it a whole lot more than I thought it would. Hopefully this\nmay be the first of many Green Lantern movies because this has the\npotential to become a great movie franchise.\n"
"\nI know a lot of people didn't like Green Lantern but I don't know why.\nIt was a fun movie with a good solid lead in Ryan Reynolds. It was not\nas dark as The Dark Knight or V For Vendetta but that is not the nature\nof Green Lantern. The special effects were good and the casting was\nfine. Tim Robbins was well cast as Hammond as was Peter Sarsgaard as\nHector Hammond. Kudos to Mark Strong as Sinestro. I do hope they do a\nsequel with him as Sinestro was one of my favourite villains. All up it\nwas a solid film and one I enjoyed immensely. Pity some people were\ndisappointed but to be honest, I don't know what they were expecting as\nthe film stayed reasonably true to the character and the tone of the\ncomic books.\n"
"\nThis film is a highly underrated masterpiece, fast paced, fun and true\nto the comic. The cast is almost right, though they should have used\nsomebody more serious for the lead than Ryan Reynolds, Sam Worthington\nperhaps. Blake Lively makes a sexy helpless heroine and Peter Sarsgaard\ndoes a fine job as a creepy bad guy, albeit one covered in makeup. All\nin all this deserves to be up there with Superman II, Dark Knight and\nthe first two Spidermans. I really do hope they'll ignore the critics\nand box office revenue to make a second one, as I feel one of the\nreasons its flopped is because many people who have watched it had\nnever read the comic beforehand, meaning it was harder to pick up some\nparts of the plot.\n"
"\nGreen Lantern is a great film it so didn't deserve the critical\nthrashing that it got I loved it not the best film of the year but non\nthe less great. The performances were OK Mark Strong as Sinestro was a\nfantastic as ever his performance reminded me of his performance in\nSherlock Holmes as Lord Blackwood which is a great thing Ryan Renyolds\ndid better than expected as Hal Jordan but Peter Sarsgaard as Hector\nHammond was down right awful whenever he was on screen it detracted\nfrom the experience and which is why I can't give this film any more\nthan 8/10 i'm just glad he dies so he cant be in the next one. Oh and\nby the way if you stay after the film has finished there is an extra\nbit which strongly hints towards a sequel so watch out for that.\n"
"\nI do not understand the various bad reviews on rotten tomato. I took my\nfamily and they all loved it and so did everyone else in the theater (\na loud applause confirmed that at the end of the movie). Filled with\nmuch more action than the great X-men First Class, I felt that Green\nLantern delivered in a great way. Not to mention, this is one film that\nactually works great in 3D. Personally i loved the film and hope that\npeople will start to go to the movies without checking various reviews\nbefore hand. If you like Ryan Reynolds, or if your a die hard Green\nLantern (Geoff Johns) reader like myself, you will love this movie. I\ngave it a 9/10. Very entertaining, not over the top, easy to follow,\ngreat special effects and the usual occasional humor from Ryan\nReynolds. Defiantly a great summer film. Critics are way to harsh on\nthis film. Trust me give it a chance. According to rotten tomato, Mr.\nPoppers Penguins is worth going to see over Green Lantern. Give me a\nbreak lol come on!!! Take your family to a great summer action film. Do\nyourself a favor and go see Green Lantern.\n"
"\nI have been reading the comic for over 40 years and I was blown away by\nthis. I understand that they can't make the movie exactly like the\ncomic and I am fine with that. I want to say that the entire cast was\nsuperb, except for the part of Hector Hammond (the growing forehead was\njust a bit too nasty for me). Mark Strong as Sinestro was a perfect\nchoice! Ryan Reynolds was also superbly cast. I think that the special\neffects for the movie were done very well and I applaud the movie\nmakers for making the aliens seem very lifelike. Too many times they\nseem to get lazy with this or give the aliens very poor makeup. Do not\ngo in with a closed mind on this. Give it a chance and I believe you\nwill be well rewarded. I like the concept for this movie and thoroughly\napplaud the effort.\n"
"\nthe movie is great...............i have seen almost every movie , you\nname it,not just super hero flicks and i can say for sure this movie\nstill feels a fun filled ride with something new to offer in CGI\naspect...........i don't understand what people are complaining about ,\nit's a superhero movie for heaven's sake , the hero is supposed to\nwin.......what's cliché about it ? please don't listen to critics and\nsome sheeps who feel criticising everything makes them a superior\nvoice............shame on them, they are the very reason that such a\nworthy movie is being discarded without even being given a try . GO\nWATCH THIS MOVIE...............if u don't want to miss on something\njust because others said so .\n"
"\nI didn't go to see this when it was released because some reviews were\nso negative. So I have just watched it on DVD. It was actually a very\ngood film - and I thought it was well paced and enjoyable to watch. Of\ncourse there are flaws - but it was better than recent DC superhero\noutings, such as Bryan Singer's Superman or even the Dark Knight. I\nhave to say, as a youngster, I was always more interested in DC comics\nthan Marvel ones. And I have always felt that the Green Lantern would\nlend itself well to the big screen. This was really a very good film\nand unfairly criticised. As I mentioned there are flaws but these can\nbe forgiven because of the movie's spirit - and also, as some have\nalready mentioned - because it doesn't take itself as seriously as\nother superhero flicks.<br><br>So - ultimately - we trust the major reviewers - but it seems they can\nget it wrong. And now I am sorry I didn't see this in a movie theatre.\n"
"\nNice, strange and new. Ironic image of super heroes and interesting\nmetamorphose of evil. Few slices of love story and an adorable\ncharacter. Green,intelligent, childish and fragile, with an unhappy\nchildhood, Hal Jordan is perfect icon of our time. Behind him,\nrock-star Green Lantern, a kind of Elvis Presley or bored Charming\nPrince.Few fight scenes,a museum inauguration, a surprising victory and\nquestion of life sense.A Frankenstein creature. The error. In final,\nthe clothes of Charming are perfect for new hero of town. Movie ad usum\ndelphini, like every cartoon, tale about values and entertainment,Green\nLantern is more. Game with rules and reflection of few ordinary crisis.\nModelation of old definitions and replacement of marginal character.\nAnd birth of a very different hero far from any Superman or Batman but\nrelative of their. It is not insignificant fact !\n"
"\nThe critics can go to hell. There's no way this film deserved the\nslagging off it got from the critics. It was fun, it was exciting and I\nwas damn proud to see Hal up on screen, Ryan Reynolds did a great job\nof playing GL and Mark Strong was even better as Sinestro. Hector\nHammond was suitably creepy and Parallax, whilst completely different\nfrom the comics, was nicely translated to the screen. The cgi Is\nnowhere near as bad as people make out, Tomar Re and Kilowog being\nprime examples, although the Guardians did look a tad ropey, however-\nbut that's a small problem THAT CAN BE SOLVED IN THE SEQUEL. I must\nhave blinked and missed the John Stewart/Guy Gardner cameos, but not\nthe extra bit at the end of the first set of credits. If you're\nwondering whether or not to go and see this, ignore the critics and\nmake up your own mind. It was brilliant. Now, a sequel please.\nFeaturing that OTHER corps...\n"
"\nRyan Reynolds as an all-American superhero could've worked if it wasn't\nfor the terrible script and useless attempts to charm the audience with\ngoofy humor and stereotype lines. If you're really into the comics\nworld, you might give this movie a chance... otherwise, STAY CLEAR!\nIt's not worth spending 150 minutes of your time on such utter crap.\nThe acting is not the worst, but the storyline and all the cliché makes\nit hard to watch. You'll find yourself waiting for the end, or wanting\nto fall asleep. It might just make \"the worst movie of the year\". A\ntotal disappointment for any superhero-movie-lover, and especially for\nthose who don't even love this genre.\n"
"\nI avoided this film for for a long time because I thought that many\ndidn't like it(a la Daredevil)but was I wrong to avoid it! I loved this\nmovie and have now seen it many times.<br><br>I barely remember reading Green Lantern as a kid, but who cares, this\nwas a fun, exciting and impressive movie.<br><br>Ryan Reynolds was perfect as Hal Jordan, and everyone else was fine\nalso.<br><br>Special Effects were top-notch.<br><br>The film still made an impressive $116 million domestically, which\nshows that many people ignored the ignorant critics.<br><br>Parallax was a superb creation.<br><br>I intend to see this film many more times in the future.\n"
"\nI saw this movie yesterday, and i'll admit i expected more, but what\nCAN you expect from a superhero movie?. The special effects were great,\nbut where one of the reasons why it flopped.300 million for a budget is\njust too much. Also, for once the girl actually noticed who green\nlantern's secret identity was, not like other superhero movies. Owa was\ngreat, Peter skasgaard was good, and scary, John hurt was\nmind-blowingly good as always, as for Ryan Reynolds, he doesn't make a\nbad GL. Sorry, this is a short review, and my first, so sorry. But\nsince this IMDb restriction of 10 lines is just annoying, i will\ncontinue. Martin Campbell good have done a better job on this, for\nsure,(look at casino Royal and this, and i think you will get my\npoint), but i think he did just fine. Oh, the plot was better than the\naverage GL comic (i read some really awful ones). 10 lines yet? I guess\nnot...\n"
"\n'In Brightest Day, In Blackest Night, No Evil Shall Escape My Sight.\nLet Those Who Worship Evil's Might Beware My Power -- Green Lantern's\nMight.'  The motto that has the Summer of 2011 talking about. What is\nit about evil that it can be nothing but good? I can only guess two\nwords  pure evil. The bright part, I didn't expect it to be green, I\nexpected it to be white. But what do I know. I do know that this movie\nhas surpassed the other super-hero movie: Thor by a landslide. Ryan\nReynolds  yes sir  you talk about doing the green suit justice. The\nradar has been lifted, and it can never be down thanks to this great\nactor. <br><br>This movie was in one sense of the word INCREDIBLE!!!! I loved it.\nKudos goes to the director Martin Campbell. There was something that\nstuck out to me in this movie and that was you can't be afraid to take\non the responsibility to embrace what you need to become but embrace\nthe thing that you want most of all  not to fear.\n"
"\nI'm surprised by the average score this movie has gotten and so I must\nadd to its legend in the hope that they do a follow up one day. I've\nwatched it five times now - once at the theater, once as a hired DVD,\nand three times from the bought DVD. If you are a connoisseur of sci-fi\nand comic-to-movie this definitely belongs in the collection. I'd have\ngiven it a ten but I never give a ten to anything... Bought the\noriginal comic when it first came out (that's how old I am)and wish my\nmother didn't throw out my whole collection of original first editions,\ntwo suitcases worth (forty years ago)... I'd be worth a lot more than I\nam now if she hadn't.... If you haven't seen this one I strongly\nsuggest you do!\n"
"\nI just watched this new Green Lantern film on VCD just a few days ago,\nand I figure this one has pretty much everything people can expect from\na super hero movie. For instance, there are a couple of times where the\ntitle character gets into near-death experiences but was able to get\nout of it, a very essential theme for films of this genre. Another\ngreat theme used shows how the hero went from being a misfit to someone\nworth being part of the fighting force.<br><br>There's probably a number of explanations why this film did little in\nthe box office. But I figure the most logical reason might be that the\ntitle character isn't as famous as those other DC Comics heroes. I\nmean, I've been hearing about Superman and Batman when I was a kid. As\nfor Green Lantern, I never heard of him until the Justice League series\nappeared in Cartoon Network. Anyway, I do find that green guy cool to\nwatch.\n"
"\nYou know what? I like this movie. Fun, good action, comic book stuff\nwhich I love, and sure, some decent acting to boot. The female lead is\nhot, strong and she can act. The bad guys are kind of the problem in\nthis movie, too many weird connections trying to bring too many Green\nLantern enemies into one flick. <br><br>I think this movie is a little irreverent in terms of comic book\nmovies, takes some jabs at itself and has fun in the process. I've\nnever seen Ryan Reynolds before, reminds me of Jason from True Blood,\nbut he did a very good job.<br><br>I recommend it for what it is: light, fun and comic book entertainment.\n"
"\nThe powerful but arrogant warrior, A decent comic book adaptation of\nthe DC comic book character Green Lantern.<br><br>It's certainly not as bad as some critics have made it out to be. <br><br>It's fun, the action sequences are flashy and exciting. The acting is<br><br>all top notch and the humor is done really well. It's fun, the action<br><br>sequences are flashy and exciting. The acting is all top notch and the\nhumor is done really well.<br><br>Now let me begin by saying this film is not an amazing film. It is\ndefinitely not an awful film, like most critics are saying. I think\ncritics might have raised their expectations due to Thor and X-Men:\nFirst Class. They should not compare the Green Lantern with those\nfilms. It is ranked now 24% on Rotten Tomatoes, which is way too low.\nIt would probably be in the high 60s, if it was released before Thor\nand X-Men: First Class.<br><br>keenly waiting for second part...\n"
"\nAfter the whole alien scene, and we finally get to the humans and Ryan\nReynolds' part we see that he is really just a regular guy that's a\ncocky pilot. He isn't the easiest person to be around, but he is good\nat what he does and tries to be the best and be different. Once he gets\nthe ring I feel like this is the start of trying to find out who he\nactually is and the \"something\" that is in him that even he can't see.\nI really like the idea of the fear and how they showed that. It's as if\nit means something more and then if you fall into the trip of this fear\nand \"enjoy\" it too much its going to take you over and you will\neventually die to the fear. It holds you back from what you know is\nright and your will is sucked right out of you and you succumb to its\npower. There is always going to be fear in the world, as we see from\nthe very end of the movie after the credits, and even tempting the idea\nof fear will take you over faster than you realize. Having the will\npower and faith power is always going to win over fear and death.\n"
"\nAmazing film, definitely the best superhero film in the last years!; An\nexcellent use of visual effects and the main character with great\nattitude, just a good movie, thumbs up!! Although there are changes to\nthe story are minor adjustments that help the continuity of the script.\nThe key lines of the main character makes you understand the philosophy\nof the hero. Despite the lukewarm reception from critics consider this\nfilm is far superior to what is described and even what to expect after\nwatching the trailers. It shows that enthusiasm goes beyond the fear,\nwhich makes these teachings to the level of Yoda himself. Since the\nbeginning of the movie shows agile and witty, giving us an opportunity\nto recognize the background of each character. For connoisseurs of the\nGreen Lantern comic will be a joy to see the conformation of Oa and the\ndeployment of power and charm of the Green Lanterns.\n"
"\nI just finally watched the extended version of the movie. And it took\nme this long to get to it because i like many other people heard it\nsucked. That could be further from the truth. I kinda regret now not\nwatching it in the movie theater and supporting the film. Just goes to\nshow, should not listen to what everyone else has to say. Guess some\ndie hard comic book fans were not to happy about it. But i say it was\njust good fun.<br><br>One thing that threw me off from watching it originally was the on the\nTV commercials it appeared like the CGI was just awful (Maybe the could\nhave left that part out of the trailers). But after watching the movie\ni now see i was wrong. Being that i had never read any Green Lantern\ncomics i did not understand that the Green Lantern Outfit was more like\na skin and not a costume ala superman, batman, flash. So from the\ntrailers my misconception of the Green Lanterns look was that it was\njust a bad case of a CGI outfit, which it isn't. So just Watch it\nyourself and make your own decision.\n"
"\nWhat I loved about this movie is that it was like the superhero movies\nof my youth (1990-2000). Sure it was predictable and \"cheesy\", but\nthat's exactly what I wanted. But also, its smart where I wanted it to\nbe and had a lot of important messages for the upcoming generation.\nCarol was not fooled by the eye mask for example, and reacted\nconvincingly to the situation; and Hector's comment on how its unfair\nfor him to get the job with the alien when there are people more\nqualified than him and that have waited their whole lives for an\nopportunity like that is something that wouldn't have happened just a\nfew years ago. The movie introduced all the important characters and\nlaid out all the points important for the story. I'm really looking\nforward to the sequel!\n"
"\nThis movie was a very good. It basically gave me everything I asked for\nin a superhero flick, good action scenes, great special effects, and a\ncool new superhero character. The story was a little rushed in some\nparts, but mostly it was pretty entertaining. The acting from most of\nthe main cast was spot on and Reynolds was at the top of his game. I'd\ndefinitely like a sequel and that easter egg scene at the end\ndefinitely set it up for one. <br><br>The only problems I really had with it was the narration at the end,\nwhich was a little corny, and the image of that purple alien at the\nbeginning, where it just shows his face and his fist; it looked a\nlittle like a drawing. Everything else though, was great. A solid entry\nto the summer superhero movie season.\n"
"\nThis movie is the best DC Comic to make it to the big screen (better\nthan any Superman or Batman). Comparing to Marvel for a moment, it is\nat least as good as \"Iron Man\" and better than \"Fantastic Four\" and\n\"X-Men\". Be sure to stay after the first set of credits to see a\nsurprising extra minute which (I believe) will lead into a sequel.<br><br>Now I have heard some stories about a few people walking out. That did\nnot happen in the theatre I attended so I can only assume that those\npeople probably would also hate the TV show \"The Big Bang Theory\" or\nwould not ever read a comic book. (I'm a 58-year old software developer\nworking for a large Canadian telecommunications company and I still\nread comics; although I've never read an issue of \"Green Lantern\" in 40\nyears, I'll bet I would still find it a experience pleasurable)\n"
"\nIt wasn't horrible. That's the best thing that can be said about it. It\nwasn't totally horrible.<br><br>Ryan Reynolds was amusing, certainly watchable, except maybe he was\ndoing too much of a Chris Evans playing the Human Torch sort of\nimpersonation, but that wasn't exactly bad just more of a \"we saw this\nbefore\" kind of feel.<br><br>The big problem is that he is supposed to be utterly fearless and that\nnever really came across. He did a bit too much complaining for someone\nthat was supposed to be fearless.<br><br>BUT, it wasn't horrible, it wasn't as bad as people say it was.<br><br>You sit down and you get action and humor, and you get to watch things\nthat are actually pretty cool on the big screen. There is a lot to say\nthere, mainly that it was a fail, but one that was far from an epic\nfail.\n"
"\nAll these reviews are saying it is really bad but it's actually a\npretty good movie. There is fighting the whole time and it's not like a\nmarvel movie where the fighting doesn't start until the last half hour.\nIt is very time consuming and fun to watch. It is a great movie for 10\nor 12 year olds who are into sci-fi and fantasy. I thought this was\ngoing to be an awful move when my son wanted to watch it but I have to\nsay I was impressed. Don't listen to the other bad reviews. The reason\nwhy I say it's pretty good is because some parts were not well written,\nsimilar to Disney movies, but that was only 3 or 4 scenes and I don't\nunderstand all the negative reviews.\n"
"\nI haven't read any of the Green Lantern comics and I think this movie\ndid a very good job of setting the context and background of all the\nkey characters. I was surprised to see this get a relatively lower\nrating because I think this movie was quite well made.<br><br>There is a brief history/narrative of the green lantern corps, intro to\na bad guy, selection of a human green lantern, entry of the bad guy\ninto planet earth and finally human green lantern defeats bad guy. Come\non, thats the theme of every superhero comic/movie and this is no\ndifferent.<br><br>I am sure there is more character development in the comics but there\nis only so much that can be adapted to the screen - especially as an\nintro movie. I do hope they make a franchise of this. There is an\nindication towards the credits that there could be a part 2.<br><br>All in all, a pretty enjoyable and entertaining movie. Don't always\nbelieve what the critics say :)\n"
"\nI don't know why people are hating on this movie! It isn't as bad as\neveryone says and here is why...<br><br>Acting: Ryan Reynolds is a very good Hal Jordan. Yes he is a little\ngoofier than the Hal we see in the comics but so isn't Tony Stark to an\nextent. Could they have gotten someone to play him better? Maybe, but I\nwas actually pretty happy with his performance. Blake Lively wasn't the\nCarol Ferris I would of liked to see, I would say her performance was\nthe weakest. Mark Strong IS Sinestro. Couldn't have picked someone\nbetter.<br><br>Action: Was very strong. I however don't really like CGI to much but it\nwas still very cool to watch GL fighting off the Parallax.<br><br>Writing: It wasn't great. A little to comedic, but the origin story was\nspot on. The villains were not bad choices, Parallax could of come a\nlittle later, and I didn't really like Hector Hammond to much but, Oh\nwell.<br><br>Overall I would say it was actually a pretty good superhero flick. Not\nThe Dark Knight or The Avengers, but it was very good. Not as bad as\nGreen Hornet, Catwoman, Elektra, etc.\n"
"\nThough I generally consider Martin Campbell as a potent director, this\none Lacks direction and also dives into awkwardness several times. All\nthis peaking into an intellectual dead-zone at a finale, while -of\ncourse - swimming in screen-saver CGI. As a personal opinion I might\nadd, though producer-raped, GreenLantern felt more like a movie then I\nexpected. It's not good, but to be fair, it also isn't the worst\nSuperhero movie ever created. I contribute this fact to Ryan Reynolds,\nwho - surprisingly - is not the weak spot of this flick and considering\nthe little he's given to work with actually does a good job, adding an\nemotional dimension to the movie. After Marvels latest concept work, I\nam also grateful for any kind of action scene and especially ones\nfeaturing some kind of imagination and choreography. 5/10\n"
"\nAlthough slightly corny a couple of times, this movie was actually very\ngood. <br><br>This movie had every element, action, love, hate, comedy, etc. I\nlaughed multiple times and enjoyed the action scenes quite a bit.<br><br>The villain, a good guy gone bad and turned into a roiling cloud of\nFear and evil was actually quite disturbing, especially when it would\nsuck the souls from it's victims.<br><br>The action was intense and thrilling and had me on the edge of my seat,\nyelling advice at the hero.<br><br>And for once, someone saw through the ridiculous mask and recognized\nHal for who he was. He talked with his friends for advice and pretty\nmuch saved the universe. Overall, this was a very enjoyable film which\nI will probably watch again.\n"
"\nI'm not going to leave a wordy,long explanation for my opinion.<br><br>I'm 45. My whole life, when I can.. I watch movies.<br><br>Thousands of movies.<br><br>This movie is as good as any other super hero movie. (Spider Man, etc.)\nAnd a lot better than many movies the critics say are great..<br><br>Ryan Reynolds is perfect in this role.<br><br>I don't really have anything bad to say about it.<br><br>Worth whatever the fee to watch is Its great movie that kids will love\nalso..<br><br>That's why I have it on Blu-ray..\n"
"\nI have put off seeing this movie for quite a while, thinking it was\nterrible, and because I knew nothing about Green Lantern. I read about\nthem on Wikipedia and I guess that made me want to see it more.\nOverall, the movie wasn't as bad as I thought it would be. As with most\nmovies that feature aliens, it had its cheesy parts. However, it wasn't\noverdone in my opinion. Ryan Reynolds was fine in the role. It was\nfunny to see all the things he created with the ring, like a chainsaw,\nthose big guns toward the end, and turning a helicopter into a race\ncar. I would look forward to a sequel, as there is plenty of action I\nwant to see out of these characters. The costume was pretty cool on\nGreen Lantern.\n"
"\nI thought it was pretty good. Probably because I had low expectations\nto begin with, after seeing the trailer and hearing the reviews. The\ntrailer did a good job in preparing me for what to expect-- lots of\ncartoonish CGI and a bland, insincere Ryan Reynolds. Despite this, I\nstill enjoyed the film. I put it ahead of the Fantastic Four but\nbehind, of course, the X-Men 1 &amp; 2, First Class, Iron Man, Thor and\nCaptain America.<br><br>Tim Robbins was good and so was Blake Lively, even though she didn't\nmake a convincing fighter pilot. It was her chemistry with Reynolds\nthat made her an asset. More could've been done with Hal Jordan growing\ninto the Green Lantern job, and the defeat of the bad guy could've been\nmore challenging, but overall it was an enjoyable film.\n"
"\nThe Universe is a big and dangerous place. Good thing there's an agency\nof guardians to watch over us. When one of them dies their selection\nprocedure finds a replacement, and against all odds it turns out to be\nan Earthling.<br><br>Another comic turned into film. Another comic I have never read so I\ncan't say whether the conversion was done well or not. As a film it\nworks OK enough - it's popcorn amusement with plenty of spectacle to\nkeep the audience busy for its full duration. It is not going to win\nany prices though, no master piece performances, no master piece story,\nno master piece of anything.<br><br>Graphic-wise it works well enough. The planet of the guardians is\ndepicted like a place worth living and the effects used are ranging\nfrom OK enough to pretty good. Story-wise it tells enough even though\nmost of the backing tale is biased along an all-too-known cliché.\nSound-wise I see no reason to complain - music was either not there or\nnot disturbing.<br><br>So, all in all, a 7 out of 10. Popcorn amusement and decent enough at\nthat.\n"
"\nMy kids (17, 19) and I were happily surprised that this was a much\nbetter movie than we had been led to believe. The acting decent to very\ngood from all. The special effects great (especially in 3D), and the\nstory line was able to be followed by those who had no idea who/what GL\nwas/is. And that's the way the movie should be made. Not everyone is a\nGL fan with a working knowledge of GL lore and facts. They need to fill\nin the story to inform people of the GL history while keeping the\naction up and storyline moving. In our opinion they were able to do\nthis. We all agreed that if GL2 comes out we hope the cast will remain\nthe same. And we will not only go see it, but bring friends. Not the\nbest of reviews if you're looking for what happened in the movie, but I\ncouldn't let all those negative reviews go unchallenged.\n"
"\nJust home from watching the green lantern, and i have to say i was\nreally impressed. The always impressive Ryan Reynolds was great in the\nlead role of Hal Jordan who has been chosen as the new green lantern.\nThis is an effects heavy movie but they are jaw dropping and some of\nthe action sequences are totally amazing, the plots not hard to follow,\ni cant understand how this film is being so heavily criticized. Right\nfrom the start of the film we are taking on a real roller-coaster ride,\ngiven an in depth explanation of the green lantern corps and what they\nstand for. The fantastic mark strong gives great support as usual, and\nit was nice to see Angela Bassett in a small part. Totally recommended\nand i hope its not the last we see of the green lantern!!!\n"
"\nPuncher line: I see a lot of negative reviews ... but they are wrong!<br><br>OK, someone can argue about actors performance, script, scenes\ntransition between earth and space, movie length, etc.<br><br>But is this movie so bad to be rated as a mediocre B production ? I\ndon't think so.<br><br>The kid in me like it. It has great CGI, a cheese but enjoyable main\ncharacter. I mean , common, who can take seriously a green guy who can\nmanipulate universe with the power of \"will\". It's a light joke, meant\nto be taken accordingly. When he comes, after saving his girl, to\ncollect the anonymous kiss in the style of Batman, she sees who he is\nwith easy, and does justice to all viewers screaming \"it's just a tinny\nmask\". This defines the movie.<br><br>Is not Shakespeare and we are not reviewing such a thing. Beside, there\nis no need to tell the story of the movie. What you saw in trailers is\nalmost all there is, but is still fun enough to worth watch it.\n"
"\nRyan Reynolds sucked in Comic Book movies (Blade: Trinity, and X-Men\nOrigins: Wolverine). This time in the Green Lantern he did a really\ngood job. Critics have been giving this movie negative reviews even\nRotten Tomatoes started off giving the movie 23%. I believe that the\nCritics should watch the movie again and take back everything they said\nabout the movie the first time. This movie has pretty good humor, very\ncool special effects I'm guessing that it will be nominated for an\nOscar, the action is pretty cool, it's climax was pretty good even\nthough I expected to see more but it was still decent. I'm sure that\nthe Comic Book fans won't be disappointed with Ryan Reynolds playing\nthe Green Lantern.\n"
"\nIt's rare that a movie surpasses my expectations, but this one did. As\nperhaps one of the less-known, less-popular superheroes, Green\nLantern's origins added a lot to the story, and the noble theme to his\nmission endears the audience, and perhaps strikes a chord when the\nbattle between \"fear\" and \"will\" is articulated throughout the movie.\nBlake Lively, of \"Traveling Pants\" fame does an outstanding job of\nbeing the beauty and brains, while still being the vulnerable maiden in\ndistress. The personal struggles of the novice superhero strike a chord\nwith most every viewer, and keep you rooting for him until the end. The\ngraphics are a bit cartoonish at times, but this is a superhero action\nmovie, so anything goes. The almost unlimited powers possessed by the\nGreen Lantern keep you guessing during the intense conflicts with the\nbad guys, both of which are reaaal bad. Very enjoyable, and my 23 yr\nold son who watched it with me was very impressed also - he's usually\nvery particular about the movies he watches. Fun and entertaining.\n"
"\nto be quite honest i think this is a good film... seeing this in 3D was\nprobably the better option (don't know what it would of been like as\n2D) as the previous comments yeah i don't think it is as good as x-men\nbut its still pretty amazing.. definitely was worth all the money i\npaid.. <br><br>Ryan Reynolds is a good actor, everything i have seen he has portrayed\nthe character really well like in blade, he was the funny cocky guy. he\nis generally a funny person. if you like action you will love this...\nif you get the chance watch in 3D before it is released on DVD, because\nDVD 3D's aren't as good.\n"
"\nSo all I read all week was about how bad this movie was. I am aware\nthat when I go to see a movie with high expectations, I am often let\ndown. So when I saw Green Lantern I expected the worst. So right out of\nthe box the acting was stiff and roboticlly scripted. I was very\nworried. But after awhile I found myself at home in the story. If\nanything the first act could be better (reshot). The effects were\noh-humb but at least not over-the-top like Super 8. Ryan Renynolds is\nalways entertaining. I do think he could of been giving more\nopportunity to ad-lib. that is where he's at his best, but he still\nshines by the end. And Blake Lively is worth the $11.50 every time.<br><br>So it's not the best movie of all time... nor the worst. It is mindless\nsuperhero fun... and most of the time that is enough.\n"
"\nI know there are a lot of negative reviews of this film. As is often\nthe case I'm glad that I shut myself off from them. I started with\nGreen Lantern when I was in elementary school in the early 60's. If\nsomeone were to pull the Silver Age Green Lantern from my mind and\nsplashed him onto celluloid the end result would have been this movie.\nI'm not comparing it to any other superhero film because I feel that\nGreen Lantern is such a special character. The Green Lantern Corps\n(especially Sinestro), the Guardians of Oa, the reckless Hal Jordan -\nall of it rang true.<br><br>Martin Campbell has solid action creds. He was the perfect choice for\ndirector. It was well shot by Dion Beebe and solidly edited by Stuart\nBaird. The acting was okay, but, frankly, if I want good acting I'll\nre- watch ON THE WATERFRONT. This movie was pure fun, from first frame\nto last. I wouldn't have changed a thing.\n"
"\nI just want to say that I thought this movie was epic. The visuals were\ntotally believable, the acting was really great, and the story was\nentertaining. <br><br>Ryan Reynolds plays such a good depth of character, he totally makes me\nbelieve his emotions, and forces me to empathizes with him and root for\nhim all the way. <br><br>I did feel the movie was a bit rushed, he only had like a 2 minute\ntraining course, and a line at the end was \"Can I train them, or can I\ntrain them?\" This was a really stupid line as he didn't have much\ntraining at all. <br><br>The one true thing I find fault with, is the fact that no one is really\nshocked at the fact that there are aliens, a corp, that will and fear\ncan be turned into rings and used as forces of good and evil. Everyone\njust rolled with it. I have a hard time swallowing how nonchalant\neveryone is about this, and a senator not a president? I don't get that\npart but whatever....\n"
"\nThe theatrical cut of Green Lantern is far better than many people may\nlead you to believe. The movie is all at once a science fiction,\nhorror, action, and romance adventure with terrific special effects and\na great score to boot. While the insecure masses wrote it off with\nbroad strokes fearing it as some kind of threat to the Marvel universe,\nthe more astute viewer will recognize the brilliance of this magical\ngenre blender. The film delivers wit and high concept science fiction\nthat succeeds at capturing the magical weirdness of Green Lantern\nwithout much compromise in an effort to make the concept consumable on\na grand scale. Part Star Wars, part Exorcist; Green Lantern dares to be\ndifferent in an exciting way that will be appreciated by anyone\nunafraid to try something new.\n"
"\nThe Dull Lantern When I first saw the trailers to this movie it looked\nunimpressive nor exciting so I waited for the DVD and I am glad I did.\nThe movie was just dull. First Ryan Reynolds could have played the hero\nif they gave him more direction but I never really cared for him during\nthe movie. His suit was just awful. Seriously a CGI suit looked\nextremely fake and looked more like someone taped a bunch of lights to\nhis suit. The worst part was the effects. For a 200 million budget you\nthink they would have had better effects. But the worst thing about the\nmovie is that it was dull and boring. I could never really pay\nattention because it felt like the script was terrible and acting was\nterrible at well. Plus with the special effects being bad but not\nlaughably bad it was tough to get through. Deadpool was right. Do not\nmake your suits CGI. Overall 4/10. Bad and painful to watch but there\nwere a few scenes that were fun and generally the rest of the Green\nLanterns were pretty fun to watch.\n"
"\nGreen Lantern deserves some credit. It tries, and it tries hard. Hal\nJordan (Ryan Reynolds) has his work cut out for him, his Green\nLantern's completely outs-muscled by DC favourites Batman and Superman.\nHe's chosen by the universe's greatest to represent Earth, tackling a\nbulbous headed professor (Peter Sarsgaard), a giant tentacle-looking\ncreature, a romance with fellow pilot Blake Lively and some been-\nthere-done-that daddy issues. This film only dapples in its plot\npoints, but none quite gel. Harder to believe is Hal left on his Lal to\nsave the world. TGL's leader Sinestro (Mark Strong) and his buddies are\nleft out of what could have been an epic showdown. <br><br>Some good scenes are amongst the mundane, and the CGI is terrific. Hal\nJordan though, promptly suffers, left without an audience to care for\nhim. The Green Lantern is good, but never coming out its superhero\norigin, romance, showdown-with-villain formula.\n"
"\nThese movies based off of comic books are interesting. As I don't read\nthe comics or the book, I tend to judge a movie based on it's story and\nacting and if it gets me emotional.<br><br>This movie just didn't do that for me. The visuals were impressive,\nyes. I fully admit that CGI wise it was very well made. However, you\nmust remember that it isn't just the visuals that matter, but also the\nstory and acting.<br><br>The story was okay. It seemed a bit too science fiction for me to be\nable to judge it fairly, as I judge based on reality and this wasn't.\nBut from what the plot was trying to suggest, I was interested to see\nhow it went.<br><br>Until the ending came. It seemed forced and the surprise wasn't really\nthere. The acting was okay, but again it's like any movie. Good guy\ngets the girl right? At least there were no random sex scenes that were\nunnecessary.<br><br>Anyway, I'll rate this 7/10.\n"
"\nIt's a superhero movie, not an Oscar-winning drama. It is what it is.\nSo, going in to see this movie, I expected the typical\n\"intro-to-the-superhero\" routine that all superhero movies must endure\n- for fans of the green lantern, a fair amount of the storyline is of\ncourse unnecessary (but tolerable) - for newcomers to the lantern\nscene, these details are a requirement, particularly for sequels.\nBeyond the intro and background component, the movie was a great for\nwhat it was, having a decent storyline, reasonable casting, excellent\nSFX, and an adrenaline-filled \"final battle\". The writers did leave a\nfew angles untapped as well, opening several opportunities for future\nlantern movies that I look forward to. And, as usual, the superhero\ngets the girl but hey... it is what it is. Definitely worth watching.\n"
"\nI entered this movie with very low expectations, since most reviews\nbashed it, calling it noisy, predictable and pointless. Wouldn't have\nhappened if it were labeled MARVEL comics. It offers a lighter story,\nsome warm humor and visible CGI effects. The action scenes aren't\ndragged at all and I found a nice balance between character\ndevelopment, story and special effects. But it's labeled DC, and after\nChristopher Nolan set higher standards with his outstanding Batman\nfilms, critics and possibly even hardcore fans tend to be overly\ncritical of any other projects. This is a movie about a guy who\nbasically receives a magic ring that gives him the power of flight and\nthe ability to create any object of his desire through will-power, so\nenjoy it for what it is, a decent entertaining flick, that would have\nfitted the Marvel studios universe very well, with the Green Lantern\neventually joining the Avengers. 7/10.\n"
"\nThis 2011 adaptation of 'Green Lantern' in an attempt to kickstart DC's\nCinematic Universe failed with recognition surprisingly. Probably going\ndown to history as not of the greatest superhero films made and in\ncontrary, one of the worst, Green Lantern is not that bad in a whole\nsummary.<br><br>Actors Ryan Reynolds, Mark Strong, director Martin Campbell were great\nassets to the movie, but the horrible aspects of the film that pulls it\ndown are the CGI utilized and the choice of villains, especially\nParallax and Hal's mask. Though it's not as universally bad as everyone\nsays, I can tell it was a major letdown for many Green Lantern fans.<br><br>Not that good, but that bad either. Worth watching before criticizing.\n"
"\nWatched Green Lantern Featuring Ryan Reynolds(Blade III) as Hal Jordan,\nBlake Lively(Gossip Girl) as Carol Ferris, Geoffrey Rush(Pirates Of The\nCaribbean) as Tomar-Re, Temerua Morrison(Star Wars Attack Of The\nClones) as Abin Sur, Michael Clarke Duncan(Daredevil) as Killowog, Tim\nRobbins(Top Gun) as Senator Hammond, also Starring Mark Strong(Sherlock\nHolmes) as Sinestro and Clancy Brown(Starship Troopers) as Parallax .\nFor a Superhero Sci-Fi Film was great also Very also Very Cool also\nEnjoyed how the Lanterns are similar to the Jedi though The Protect\neach sector of The Milky Way Galaxy also Great Performance from\nRenyolds as Hal Jordan also enjoyed the Story of Him Overcoming also\nloved the Visuals . Music By James Newton Howard(The Last Airbender)\n,Amazing Cinematography By Dion Beebe(Chicago) ,Costume Design By\nNgailia Dickison (Lord Of The Rings) and Direction By Martin\nCampbell(007 Casnio Royale) , The Best Green Lantern Film For Now.....\n8/10\n"
"\nWell I will be quite direct: Pros: Loved the actors and their acting;\nstory of green lanterns is well presented; is funny isn't very serious\nand I don't think it shouldn't; Parallax is a bit scary but is fine\nwith me, maybe this it should be.<br><br>Cons: I think the whole story shouldn't switched back and forth from\nEarth to Oa, I think it should focus more on the hero theme, and maybe\na bit less than humane one. Sinestro had no reason to become a villain\nat least that is what movie is telling us, but maybe it was his\npersonal choice I guess.<br><br>Overall like I said in the title this movie should have better score\nbecause he deserves it. It teaches us how to overcome fear, how to deal\nwith it even in difficult situation. I think that's what people should\nknow about this movie. People should take this movie more lightly and\nnot to criticize so hard this movie. It is a good movie.\n"
"\nam i the only one who thinks Blake Lively can't act her way out of a\npaper bag?? i mean she was so bad in this movie that it made the movie\nmore boring in some part. everyone say its because of Ryan Reynolds.\nbut i say was she any better then he was?? i think she was the worst\npart of the movie. the movie could have been better without her in it.\nand people who getting mad saying it was a bad movie. don't read the\ngreen lantern comic. first off the green lantern is more of a real\nsuperhero then others now.<br><br>Ryan Reynolds will play dead-pool in a movie hope he give people who\nsay he can't act a big one\n"
"\nFinally a Superhero film that everyone can enjoy!<br><br>Very simply, SFX are top notch. In particular the location of space,\nother worlds and technology of the suit. Nothing too dark or risqué in\nthe story or love interest (I can actually watch this with my kids),\nthis can't be done with \"The Dark Knight\" or \"The Hulk\" too scary for\nthe little ones!<br><br>I felt that Ryan Reynolds was perfect for Hal Jordan if not a touch\nrestrained. Not knowing the history of the characters or story, Green\nLantern seemed strait forward and easy to follow (until the final act). <br><br>Hopefully there is a sequel, as they have built in some openness to the\nfinale that keeps non comic book fans guessing. I suppose the hard-core\nfans will be wondering how true they will stay to Green lantern lore\nand therefore hang in there for another ride!<br><br>This reminded me of the classic animated cartoons from Saturday\nmornings of old. Innocent and action packed.<br><br>The bottom line. Enjoyable ride from start to finish.\n"
"\nIt's not the best super hero movie in the world. But it's entertaining\nand it occasionally made me smile. Ryan Reynolds as the green lantern\nwas a good choice. He does a good job in playing the bit lazy pilot Hal\nJordan. Blake Lively looks stunning, the Gossip Girl star is turning\ninto a real film-actress. I think we are gonna see a lot more of her. I\ncertainly hope so! The make-up is very well done but some CGI aliens\nare very ugly and look fake and very computer generated. Story wise\nthere are some funny moments, the action scene's characters it's all\nthere.Peter Sarsgaard does a great job, Only i think that the story of\nthe bad guy should have been better. He is very easily defeated and\nthere is not a real thread of all people in the world dying. And why\ndidn't they kill him in the first place? The music score is good, and i\nleft the theater with a good feeling. I give this movie a 6,9/10 not a\nreal 7.\n"
"\nHaving just watched Green Lantern, I must say I'm kind of relieved that\nthis portrayal of a superhero didn't go down the dark, introspective\nroad of self discovery, but chooses the light, fun way of bringing the\neternal battle of good and evil on screen. I mean, it's a superhero\nmovie, not existentialist drama or something.<br><br>The visuals are fittingly bright and colorful, Oa looks especially\ngreat. Actor performances good enough, with Mark Strong and Ryan\nReynolds leading the way.<br><br>In the end, I'm not saying this movie is a masterpiece, but it's a fine\npiece of light summer entertainment.\n"
"\nBut its not as bad as people make it out to be. It's 15x better than\nThor...that has GOT to count as something.<br><br>Watched Green Lantern...On a scale of best to worst represented by\nTitanic to Kazaam...Its about Star Trek (2009)...Great effects (and hot\nactors/actresses), but a solid story and proper background into the\nseries is lacking.... <br><br>1. Hal isn't the first Human to be a GL, that's Alan Scott. 2. Along\nwith the first, most people don't understand that Alan was the first,\nHal was the strongest (Will wise) and John was the blackest (and better\nfighting wise.) 3. CALM DOWN, DC movies only top with Batman, Marvel is\nbetter 'cuz its got the Disney money now. 4. Thor was god awful...So\nthis is better in comparison. Win/Win, right?<br><br>I give it 3.9/5 shirtless Ryan Reynolds...Mmmm,Love you, Ryan...\n"
"\nThis movie was really boring for me, seems like it didn't have enough\naction in it I'm not gonna tell exactly what happened in the movie\nbecause I don't want to spoil it but, if you watch the cartoon movie\nmade by(I think) WB you will actually know whats gonna happen its\nalmost scene for scene, with one difference, the cartoon actually shows\nmore and is more developed. I'm a big comic book fan but this movie\njust didn't do it for me, maybe it was because it was in 3D and within\nthe first hour I was bored, and after that I was just counting the\nminutes till it was over, but one thing that would help the movie and\nI'm warning you, do not watch the cartoon movie before going to see\nthis, if you want to watch it, do it after the live action movie, I\nbelieve that's mostly why I didn't like it, because I had recently\nwatched the cartoon movie. sorry if this offended you and you thought\nthe movie was the best of the year.\n"
"\nI have always been a fan of Marlvel Comics and the superheroes and I\nfirst met green lantern when i watched Justice League. Although he's\nnot one of my favorite superheroes, i like his powers very much . I\nboth expected and wanted to see more green light action in this movie,\nmore creativity and longer action scenes. I also think they put a\nlittle bit too much faith in Ryan Reinolds bringing the movie home,\ngiving him too much screen time. I wanted to see more conflicts with\nrelationships and friends, not just with Blake Lively. It also seemed a\nlittle bit unrealistic that the greatest threat to the Corps was\ndefeated by a single, untrained human. That the whole space and all the\nother green lanterns just gave up on this human and just stood and\nwatched as he single-handed took down the creature that they feared the\nmost. Maybe if they made the movie longer they could have dealt with\nthe things missing in my opinion.\n"
"\nI've always been a fan of the comic book style movies. Not because they\noffer depth and substance, but because they allow me to escape into a\ncompletely ridiculous dimension of fantasy. None of them should be\ntaken seriously.<br><br>With that said, I really don't understand why so many people slated\nthis movie. It was shallow, corny and unbelievable - sure, but it was\nalso entertaining, full of action, drenched in fantastic CGI and fairly\nwell acted - for the most part. Even the plot wasn't so terrible.<br><br>Ignore the (teen) scoring here on IMDb for this title.<br><br>Or to put it another way:<br><br>Vampire Diaries: 8 Green Lantern: 5<br><br>Something is definitely wrong with the voting system here...\n"
"\nWell, Green Lantern is as disappointing as they get for superhero\nadaptations mind you it's not as bad as say Batman and Robin. But it's\njust kind of bland, average movie directed by the guy who directed\nGoldeneye and Casino Royale of all things, two of the best James Bond\nMovies and he makes one of the most disappoint superhero movies I have\never seen. Ryan Reynolds is like acidic poison to most superhero movies\nanyway, this is the guy who poisoned Blade: Trinity and X-men Origins:\nWolverine. And he drags this promising superhero movie down to through\nthe gutter, I mean I was disappointed by Amazing Spider-Man but not as\nbadly as this film. I mean I know they can't all be Batman and\nChristopher Nolan, but you can at least be as good as Captain America\nor Thor or Iron Man or The Incredible Hulk but Green Lantern can't.\nIt's so mediocre that it can't even get over the every mild manner\nsuperhero movies like these. And it is a failure to watch.\n"
"\nI have just been amazed at all the pre-premiere hatred of this movie.\nAfter seeing the movie, I am even more amazed.<br><br>This is not Macbeth. It doesn't pretend to be written by Shakespeare\nor, for that case, even Faulkner. It is simply a comic book story,\nbrought to the big screen. And it is well done.<br><br>Some things were a little rushed. Hector was killed off too early, and\nwas a wasted character, as was Dr. Waller. Senator Hammond? mmeehh!\nRyan Reynolds was good when he was being the goof ball trying to grow\nup. Chris Pine, would have been more well-rounded in the character.\nHowever, I think Reynolds could well grow into the role.<br><br>I am looking forward to the next installment, I want to see the\ncontinued development of the yellow ring/Sinestro storyline.<br><br>As for you troll haters: Grow up.\n"
"\nOkay, first of all: I've never even heard of Green Lantern before this\nmovie, so I may not have a good comparison of what it should be. I will\ngive my opinion on the movie however. Not the best movie in the world,\nbut it isn't the worst either. thought that Ryan Reynolds and Blake\nLively were cute together, and like any other super hero film, it's\ngoing to be predictable! To be honest not a lot of action happened and\nit wasn't all that 'thrilling.' If that's what you wanted your better\noff will some other super hero. That being said, the plot wasn't bad,\ngood graphics, and I would watch it again. Blake Lively is better off\nin Gossip Girl, I don't think she can pass as someone being overly\nsmart like her character Carol is. I like her and all, but I think she\ncould have put more effort into the role. Ryan Reynolds seemed to enjoy\nthe film, I sort of get that vibe from all of his work, and I think he\nproved himself capbable of being a Green Lantern.\n"
"\nThis movie has been getting a bad rep from so many. So many people\ncomplain about too much time being spent on building characters, but\nthis is the first Green Lantern movie of this generation, so let's cut\nthem some slack. One thing you gotta love is when he can't full his\n\"love interest\" with a simple little mask. That alone scores bonus\npoints! Then, once the foundation has been laid, and any true comic\nbook movie fan knows not to leave til after the credits, the sequel has\nbeen set, starting with the new villain on the \"Lantern\" home planet,\nthis will be huge! My only disappointment would be waiting and not\ngetting the anticipated sequel! Definitely worth the money going to an\nevening show (but buy the large popcorn instead of seeing this in 3D)\n"
"\nLots of people will say that the movie was a let down and wasn't good\nat all. This movie was epically awesome! Yes, they could have done more\nas far as the rings power, but it was a good movie none the less. I\nwish they had more of Blake Lively in there. Maybe her in a two piece\nwould have been nice.<br><br>It was flashy and entertaining to watch, but most of all I liked its\npresentation of the message it tried to deliver. Which is basically\neven though you don't see it, you can go as far as you allow yourself\nto go. <br><br>Also, be sure to stay after the credits. They show something\nafterwards.\n"
"\nI went to see this film because the 3d projector broke down on the film\nwe were going to see and this was picked because a) it started at the\nright time b) it was 3d and c) it was a superhero film. So, I had no\nexpectations and didn't know about reviews so no pre-conceptions.<br><br>I go to the cinema to relax and be entertained. This film did just\nthat. Decent performances all round (although the Green Lantern mask\nwas a bit much - so bijou!) good special fx and it managed to avoid\nthat 15 minute period where you think \"this is a bit slow\". As it drew\nto a close I found myself thinking \"I really enjoyed this\". It might\nnot be the greatest film ever made but I thought it good fun and it\nkept me entertained - and surely that is the purpose of a film like\nthis.<br><br>I don't know why folks seem to expect a film with the depth of a\nShakespeare or Hemmingway classic - it comes from a comic for goodness\nsake and it does what its source did - entertained.\n"
"\nIt's a good adaptation from the comics. didn't stray far off and didn't\ngive it full justice either, but overall it's fun and entertaining to\nwatch, specially if you don't know about the green lanterns and it's\nyour first experience.<br><br>the story is good, direction and special effects are not bad at all.\nwhat i didn't like was the script, it's desperate for some good writing\nas some of the dialogue were lame and most of the secondary characters\ndidn't get their proper spotlight.<br><br>I loved Ryan Reynolds he fits the part and he easily could relate his\nhuman weakness to the audience. also the performance by Mark Strong as\nSinestro blew my mind away.\n"
"\nI will say that i was SO EXCITED for this movie to come out, and i was\nexpecting so much out of it that it was just a little bit less than i\nexpected, but i still loved it. I have heard some people say that Ryan\nRenolds didn't play Hal Jordan well, i disagree, i thought he did\ngreat, but i like him as an actor anyway, so that could just be me. If\ni would change anything in this movie i would make the final fight a\nlittle longer. But it was still a cool final fight, i loved this movie,\nespecially all of the cool gadgets he used. I recommend this movie to\njust about any super hero fans, because i think that you wont be\ndisappointed.\n"
"\nCome on people, you saw the trailer, you knew how cheesy it was going\nto be. Just watch the trailer and you'll see what I mean. I mean the\nvillain is a doctor with an over-sized forehead! I've never seen that\nbefore! \"You have the ability to overcome fear\"... wow! What brilliant\nwriting! Blake lively is eye candy but seriously she's such a dead\nactress. I came into the theatre knowing that this movie might suck and\nin fact I was fairly satisfied. It was cheesy, and I'll keep saying\nthat and I think it was meant to be that way. But I can see where the\nnegativity may be coming from. It doesn't choose to balance. At one end\nyou have Mark Strong as a really good Sinestro and the other end you\nhave... all the other stuff. It's still watchable, there won't be any\npoint in time where you feel like leaving.\n"
"\nThis movie didn't make the top 3 movies I saw this year, but I thought\nit was still good. Here's why: <br><br>There was plenty of action, and plenty of romance. I thought some of\nthe great pro's of this movie was the CGI, which was very well\nconstructed, and also the storyline, which was very nice as well. I\ndidn't think too much romance was necessary in the movie because this\nis an Action movie. Also, some of the sound effects were too loud and\nreally made my ears ring. Other than that, I thought the movie was\nexcellent.<br><br>I would recommend this movie for everyone. This is why I gave the Green\nLantern an 8/10.\n"
"\nDon't know why folks are dogging the flick. It's good. Not great (Dark\nKnight, X-2, Iron Man) but not Hulk (first one) either. Development is\nnot really slow. Ryan is much cooler than wimpy tobey mcguire. It is\nwitty, and the folks act like real people. Come on--you find out you\nhave super powers aren't you going to gloat at least a little bit?\nThere could have been more to it--better development of Eo, guardians,\netc., but we didn't go to the movies to watch star wars rejects fight.\nwe came here to see GL kick some booty and entertain us. Do yourself\nand us a favor. See it. The 2nd will be even better because we won't\nhave to spend as much time on introducing the characters.\n"
"\nMy husband and I just came back from watching the movie in 2 D, here in\nIpswich.I am a big comics fan. My husband isn't, but he thought on the\nwhole the film was pretty good. We both thought it was slow moving in\nthe first half. The portrayal of Hal did annoy me at first; after all,\nhe wasn't that irresponsible at the start in the Silver Age comics.\nOverall the themes were developed well and I liked how the movie\nfollowed the comics fairly faithfully. I just wish the producers had\ngiven credit to the Green Lantern comics original artist Gil Kane and\nthe original writer John Broome. I did not like how the movie set up\nthe sequel already.\n"
"\nI saw the movie to night not expecting to much after reading a review\nin the papers, when the movie started it was a little hard to\nunderstand since i have never read the comics but as it got more into\nthe movie i found my self having a good time laughing and quenching my\nhands all through the movie.<br><br>now i saw x-men wolverine origins and when i first watch it i didn't\nlike it that much i found this movie was funnier and better i plan to\nwatch it a few more times just so i can understand it better and i\nmight even start reading the comics but over all it was quite good and\ni plan to buy it when it comes on to DVD :)\n"
"\nBeing a DC fan since I was a child it pains me to see such a beloved\ncharacter be portrayed in such a bad way. The acting is god-awful and\nthe stupid cheesy lines serve absolutely no benefit to the film. I'll\nadmit, Blake Lively played a good Carol Ferris but Ryan Reynolds played\na terrible Hal Jordan that throughout most of the movie is beyond\ndramatic and everything is so...\"cartoonish\". \"Parallax\" was a stupid\nchoice of a villain and the Lantern's along with the Guardians looked\nlike shriveled up, unappealing aliens. This whole movie was really\naimed at little kids. Your kids will love it, you'll probably snooze\nthrough it. Do yourself a favor and don't watch this movie.\n"
"\nI think the problem maybe that even in Green Lantern's heyday he was\nnot the most popular comic hero. The real problem is this movie is too\nmuch like a comic and doesn't appeal to non-fans it's not just the the\ngreen thing . Being a Green Lantern fan of the Golden Age and Hal\nJordan since the 70s my own view is Ryan Reynolds comes off as a nigh\nperfect Hal Jordan and the there is not much wrong with this movie I\nthink there is just a lot of nitpicking because Green Lantern isn't\nThor or the Avengers. I'm a fan of Marvel since way back when but also\nDC, you anti-DC types need to get a grip. This movie was easily one of\nthe best comic to movie projects ever if what you want is to see a\ncomic on the big screen not some bloated Hollywood farce.\n"
"\nThis is my first review as i feel a bit let down by some of the other\nnegative reviews i have read i saw the film yesterday with my daughter\nand i have to say i thoroughly enjoyed the film from beginning to end<br><br>The whole point of going to the cinema is to be ENTERTAINED and that is\nexactley what this film delivers it's fun fun fun i have never heard of\nthe green lantern before and i now wish to read the comic books<br><br>For me everything worked the hero played by Ryan Reynolds was brilliant\nhe drew me into his character and the supporting cast in particular\nMark Strong were very good and paradox was a fantastic villain and the\nspecial effects were fantastic <br><br>If you like to be entertained by a good syfy film go and see this and\nignore the negative reviews because i think critics are far far too\ncritical and miss the point of going to the cinema\n"
"\nI opted for the 3-D version and viewed this movie with my wife, son &amp;\ndaughter in law. I'm an avid movie goer and do admit I'm not a critic.\nWhen I pay 13 dollars for a movie I want to enjoy myself and typically\ndo unless there is a bad plot or unnecessary filth. Ryan Reynolds was\nperfect in the lead role. He seems to bring the right mix of .\n(awe-shucks/who-me?/mega-butt-kicker) to the part. His interaction with\nfriends after he has the ring is hilarious. Blake Lively was very\nbelievable in the role of ace pilot, corporate exec, and love interest.\nDidn't really know who she was before but she's very hot and talented.\nPeter Sarsgaard was a great creepy bad guy in this movie. It's hard to\nrecognize him but the voice and mannerisms come through. Other high end\nactors play smaller parts which make this a must see! I never even\npicked up a green lantern comic book as a kid but picked right up all\nthe plot points. How about a Green Lantern II and while you're at it\ntoss in a new Van Wilder!\n"
"\nLet me say this, Green Lantern is the first movie of a series. That\nbeing said they introduced everyone and got a good story with it. They\nintroduced the core, the villains, and his family and friends plus I\nthink they added a little teaser as well, but I may have been mistaken.\nthought the acting was done well and the visual affects were fun. I\nwish they would have done more fight scenes but what was done was very\nenjoyable. Introducing of Kilowog, John Stewart, Tomar-Re, and of\ncourse Sinestro make future movies a high chance of happening. I never\nthought Ryan Reynolds would have made a good Hal Jordan but he pulls it\noff very well, adding his own flair to it makes the old stuff shirt Hal\nJordan that I remember reading makes him a lot more likable. Blake\nLively doesn't add anything but she also doesn't take anything away\nfrom the performance. Now Mark Strong's performance was very well the\nlook in his eyes makes me believe that he may turn one day, I can't\nwait to see that. I would put this in my top 10 comic book movies but\nbe prepared for a sequel.\n"
"\nI thought this movie was pretty good. If I had read the reviewers, I\nmight not have seen it, because they latched on some items and all\nseemed to be repeating each other. There was an exposition at the\nbeginning that the reviewers seemed to hate, but it lasted only about\n30 seconds, I don't see what the big deal was. There was a lot of\naction, and the graphics were quite good. The 3D was great, there\nweren't any 3d \"thrill shots\", instead the 3D just made everything look\na little more real. While I liked the movie, and my younger daughters\nliked it as well, my wife did not - she fell to sleep. So perhaps it's\nnot for everyone. But I'd rate this the second best superhero movie\nthis year, after X-Men first class.\n"
"\nLast night, I went to see this movie in theaters and it took 10 years\nfor DC Comics to line up our heroes from the Justice League of America\nwas the front-runner Green Lantern to become a live action\nmotion-picture film. This movie is cool and I did watched the Special\nCGI Effects on Ryan Reynolds playing \"The Emerald Knight\" defeating the\nalien race and save Earth from the forces of evil. I really did liked\nthe movie and its similar to STAR WARS &amp; TOP GUN. This movie gets an\nA++++ Martin Campbell did a good job directing this movie.<br><br>\"In Brightest Day and Blackest Night, No Evil Shall Escape My Sight,\nLet Those Worship Evil's Might\"\n"
"\nContrary to what MANY professional critics have to say about it, green\nLantern is an enjoyable superhero movie, but one that doesn't quite\nlive up to its potential. My biggest concern was Ryan Reynolds casting\nas Hal Jordan, and I was pleasantly surprised in this movie. He is a\nlittle jokey, but certainly not too much as to detract from the\ncharacter. The parts of the movie that are not on Earth are great, from\nthe opening scene to the Lanterns home world OA. Mark Strong as\nSinestro is quite good and Peter Sarsgaard as hector Hammond is also\ngood. While this movie does have flaws, mainly being some editing of\nscenes that seem to end to quickly and the main villain isn't too\nvillainous. Plus, the final fight is a bit too short. All in all\nthough, the movies strengths make up for its flaws. I think the main\nreason that critics have hammered the movies is that Thor and X-Man\nhave come before and were both excellent, so this movie had A lot to\nlive up to. Also, DC fans will love Dr. Amanda Waller's cameo.\n"
"\nGreen Lantern was a good movie. A few people in my office have now seen\nit and agree that it is a good movie, one has actually seen Thor and\nX-men First Class as well (her boyfriend likes the genre) and ranks\nthem in the same order I do (1 being the better of the 3 movies)<br><br>1. Green Lantern<br><br>2. X-men First Class<br><br>3. Thor <br><br>It's unfortunate that this movie received so much and unwarranted bad\npress before it's release. The biggest one was concerning his mask,\nwhich Iooked fine to me. I did have lower expectations for the film\ngoing in because of the bad press concerning everything from the mask\nto the pace of the movie, etc. and I was glad that I enjoyed it and\ndidn't see any of these negative things in the movie that people have\nbeen talking about (To add every comment I've read none of them give a\nspecific example of bad pacing, etc).<br><br>I recommend this movie.\n"
"\nthis film is the most unthoughtful dreary and horrific piece of\nillogical nonsense, nothing makes sense , it looks like something they\nare trying to bribe you with .... we know its crap so we will stick\nlots of these special effects that look awful to win you over..... well\nyou didn't ..it was terrible, the only people that seem to like this\nare comic book fans who always start with i read this comic 20 years\nago - IRRELEVANCE ! just because there is a comic book about the green\nlantern doesn't make the film any better or save it in any way ... its\na disaster zone no where near a 6 whoever gave it that are dreaming it\nisn't worth a single mark ! Director should be hanging himself for this\nfilm.... did the people involve actually sit in a premier and say wow\nyeaa that was great ! fools\n"
"\nI don't know why people expect greatness from comic book movies. By\nnature, comics are generally fun and fantastical and that's the way I\nlike the movies. The Green Lantern was right along that plane (Think\nFantastic Four, not Dark Knight). I loved the characters with their\nsubtlety and genuine presences. The interactions were very well done.\nAnd with so little time to tell so much of a story, I felt that the\nlittle nuances gave good insight to back story and developed character\nwhen there just wasn't time to get too deeply into it. As a whole, the\nfilm is bursting with fantasy; space travel, mind-bending, energy\npowered manifestations, and has the ability to poke fun at it's\ninherent comic book cheese. The humor is light (you are not getting Van\nWilder), but that plays well into Hal's personal journey and the\nrelationship he has with Carol. In short, I thoroughly enjoyed it and\nwill be on the lookout for sequels.\n"
"\nWhere do I start? Okay, lets start with the acting since most people\nthink the actor makes the movie instead of the movie making the actor.\nBlake Lively, please, make me understand how this person is even\nallowed in film. She can not act and she certainly is not enough eye\ncandy (samantha fox) to warrant making me suffer through two hours of\nher bad acting and misshaped facial ticks. I love Ryan Reynolds in\neverything but feel that he over \"cheesified\" the character. The movie\nitself wasn't a total waste but is reminiscent of the first Hulk. Great\nactor playing the Hulk but the movie was inferior. Same thing with\nGreen Lantern, the CGI wasn't exactly on par with what we are used to\nseeing in the theaters and therefore, I do not recommend that you go\nspend twenty something for your time and money not so well spent.\n"
"\nThis for comic book fans is just atrocious. Flat storyline with just\nhyped up special effects and a loud sound base to cover up the fact\nthat this is just a bad movie. Nothing memorable in this or original\nand the actors are just not up to par. Why they got Blake Lively for\nthis movie is beyond me. She's a terrible actress and can't hold a\npicture like this. I think she should go for lifetime movies or\nsomething like that - that would better hold her um...\"talent\".\nProbably has this role because of her PR (joke) and that her mom is a\nmanager but REALLY they should have gotten someone that could have\nleast act!<br><br>Overall, just a waste of time, money and theater space. Not a movie\neven really to wait for on netflix, on demand or whatever that you use.\nI would say just pass on this in general and you'll be glad you didn't\nwaste your couple of hours watching this turkey!\n"
"\nOK to start with, i am a big comic fan and Ryan Reynolds is one of my\nall time favorite actors. So i thought i would love this film. But it\nsucked big time. There was so much wrong with it i just don't know\nwhere to start. The CGI in it was not very well done. The bad guys\nwhere awful. The story just dragged on. It felt like it was 4 hours\nlong and i was even thinking of walking out. I feel done that i payed\nto see this. How can they make a movie this bad when X-Men First Class\nwas well First Class. Please save your money and wait for the DVD. That\nway after you have watched it, you can use it as a drinks coaster.<br><br>.\n"
"\nI did not like the movie. Because I think it only was a Hollywood\ncliché and nothing beyond it. I mean I have seen a super hero who saves\nthe world a thousand times and this one was no different. I think\nHollywood immediately needs new ideas. Although names and costumes of\nthe superheros change, the main theme always stays the same. I do not\nknow how long will they be able to make such kinds of movies but they\nshould immediately revolutionize their ideas. If you ask me I would say\nit did not worth my time and I would not suggest it to any of my\nfriends. Watch it and see it for yourself. Of course I appreciate their\neffort. It is not easy to make a movie. But if you are going to make a\nmovie at least make a new one\n"
"\nI thought Green Lantern was an OK movie. But I do not feel it was as\ngood as it could have been. I thought Ryan Reynolds played a decent Hal\nJordan, Mark Strong was a great Sinesto and Killowog was great too. The\nscenes on Oa is were I thought this move really worked. I think they\nshould have focused more of the movie there. The scenes on Earth were a\nlittle distracting. do think that they relied too much on CGI and would\nhave been better off using so real costumes for the charters That being\nsaid I would still recommend this film to people who like comic book\nmovies and action films. Other wise I would say skip this film it isn't\nwork you time.\n"
"\nWhen I first saw this film I was quit young so to me it was perfect.\nGoing back and watching again I can see why people slag it of but come\non its not that bad. As a die hard fan of all DC and Marvel comics the\nfilm was true to the comics so it still is a good film. The film could\nhave been better if perhaps green lantern went to alien worlds (aside\nfrom Oa)as people tend to forget sector 2814 is not just Earth. Also I\nthink the choice of villains was poor as much as I love parallax he\nshouldn't have been the first villain, and Hector Hammond was a joke. I\nthink a more suitable villain would have been black hand, the\nman-hunters or some alien gang with qwardian weapons which could lead\nnicely into a sequel with the sinestro corps. apart from that casting\nwas good story could have been a lot better but not to shabby.\n"
"\nI thought that it was decent. I think that people's expectations were\ntoo high, and maybe the reason I liked it was that I expected it to\nreally suck and it didn't.<br><br>Having said that, there were some poor choices made. The movie could\ndefinitely have been cut better. The prologue for instance; it isn't\nnecessary.<br><br>And why did they make the one guy get all deformed and ugly from the\nyellow energy? That whole side story felt a little out of place to me.\nI didn't know or care enough about that character for his story to\ninterest me.<br><br>Ryan Reynolds did a fine job as the Green Lantern. It's actually one of\nhis better performances I'd say. Blake Lively was alright. A little\nbland perhaps but it doesn't take away from the movie in my opinion.\nMark Strong did a good job, as always. Tim Robbins gave a rather boring\nperformance. I honestly don't know if he phoned this one in or if he\njust can't act anymore. Not that he was ever a great actor.<br><br>Anyway, as long as don't expect it to blow your mind, you should enjoy\nthis movie.\n"
"\nAs comic-genre film, this is surprisingly solid. It is well-acted and\nhas good character development. I found this film to be more\nentertaining and less predictable than this years crop from Marvel,\nalthough I did enjoy the blonde God of Thunder. Ye other critics need\nnot to forget this is still based on a comic lest ye be too critical.\nIt will be interesting to see if the proposed sequel will make it to\nproduction. If so, they better find someone who can create a stronger\nscript, like Paul Haggis. The latest caped crusader films took comic-\nbased films to the next level, where Chris Columbus delivered 9 to10\nstar films.\n"
"\nBy the poor reaction and general panning by critics early on last\nsummer, I went in to watching \"Green Lantern\" with low expectations for\na DVD watch. I kept waiting for it to get awful and employ my trusty\nfast-forward button on the remote but it never really did. It was a\nfairly good, entertaining movie. Not as good as Thor or even Captain\nAmerican, and granted the alien/evil being was mostly clichéd and\nunintersting, but I liked the back story pretty well especially the\nGreen Lantern origin planetary development. Some of the effects\n(especially with the fighter jets) were less than stunning, and the\nromance was not really there, (spoiler) however the Green Lantern\neffects were pretty well done, and I loved the weird assortment of\nAlien Green Lanterns. All and all, the movie is worth a watch as\nsatisfactory.\n"
"\nThe film is about a pilot who had an accident , discovered an alien who\ngot crashed too , and decided to help him. And alien gave the power he\nhas to him trough the ring.<br><br>What got this film so wrong is that the film is only a film. It feels\ntoo animated, and it doesn't live in our heart. Even animated can move\nour feeling.<br><br>On the paper, it seems like Ryan Reynolds is the perfect choice. But,\nhe made Hal Jordan look annoying and doesn't get my sympathy, I think\ni'm not the only one with this.<br><br>And the love story is so cheesy. There are two element that actually\nbumped this a little bit, Mark Strong and the Make-Up department.<br><br>If you're a DC Comics Fans, be ready for the worst.\n"
"\nGREEN LATERN--There are enough detailed reviews. I just want to say\nthat even the \"Rotten Tomatoes\" ratings can be wrong sometimes. They\ngave a rating in the 20% range for Green Latern but I thought the movie\nwas well done and I enjoyed it. I didn't have any trouble accepting\nRyan Reynolds as Green Latern and Green Latern was one of my favorite\ncomic book characters when I was growing up.<br><br>I could have wished for more action and interaction with other fellow\nGreen Laterns but the ones who were presented were so well done that\neach additional Green Latern character might have run the risk of\npresenting one not up to par with the others.\n"
"\nLooks cool. Sounds cool. The script is BEYOND weak. Moments seem\nforced. Reynolds is a perfect Hal Jordan however. I blame the\ndirector/producers for the mess they made here. What purpose did\nBrainiac serve? NONE. A wasted villain. Jordan's training in Oa was\nshorter than the stack of stars people gave the movie. The movie is\nredeemed at the very end in the final boss battle. In that scene, I was\nfinally roused by the character, the stakes were established, the\naction was terrific. I don't want to spoil it, but believe me, the last\n5 minutes are the best moments in the film, IMO. <br><br>For #2, if that happens, the direction and script have got to be\nsharper than this was. With a legion of nerds at the internet's\nfingertips, there is no excuse for half-assed money grabs.\n"
