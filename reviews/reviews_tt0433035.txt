"\nWe saw an advanced screening on Sept 22. I thought it was going to be\nanother one of those cheesy, campy, not really believable, warm fuzzy,\ntype of underdog/rags to riches movies. I was actually surprised. It\nhad some great plot twists, it had a real story line. And while yes,\nthere is some language sprinkled throughout, it did make a good family\nmovie for older kids, 10+ (my opinion). The ending wasn't quite what I\nwas expecting, but looking back I think I liked it better for that. Who\nwants an ending they can see coming the entire movie?<br><br>It had some great comedy moments. The relationships between the actors\nfelt genuine and not overdone or forced. <br><br>The robot animatronics was good. The robots themselves were fun and\nimaginative and definitely made me wish we really had this sport. I\nwould so be there!\n"
"\nAny movie that gets the audience involved in a positive way and leaving\ncheering is an excellent movie. It is like Rocky on adrenaline and with\na whole lot better acting. Hugh Jackman, Evangeline Lilly and Dakota\nGoyo all have great performances. Dakota who plays the son really makes\nthe movie, but all the actors performances are great. The guy who\nthought it boring... well, you lack passion and your soul must be dead.\nReal Steel is the absolutely hands down best movie I have seen in a\nlong time. You will cheer, cry, laugh and be thoroughly entertained. I\nhad to sit and watched the credits at the end just to catch my breath.\nGreat movie.\n"
"\nI wasn't expecting much when I saw this movie - and I'm not really a\nfan of movies where kid's are the lead - but, I was pleasantly\nsurprised with this one.<br><br>Even though this was a \"formula / underdog\" type of movie, it had me\ncheering for Atom, Hugh Jackman was great and so were the cast of\ncharacters.<br><br>The CGI was excellent, I really connected to the characters, and it was\njust a fun, guilty-pleasure (c'mon, boxing robots - who DOESN'T want\nthat !) type of movie.<br><br>Not quite \"A Space Odyssey:2000\" but then again, it's not supposed to\nbe.<br><br>FUN. ENTERTAINING. GREAT ACTION.<br><br>Recommended !\n"
"\nI had low expectations and I am sure many people did so too, however I\ndid rather quite enjoy the movie for various factors in which I will\nList: Every scene had purpose - No pointless scenes which have no\nimpact on the audience. The Ending - Original and Motivating, showed it\nhad a moral to the story (If you watched the movie, you would know)<br><br>HOWEVER, unfortunately the kid put me off immensely. I appreciate his\nconfidence in acting but his screaming and his cheesy lines were just\noff putting. I also noticed that his technological understanding was\nridiculously high, which is rather unrealistic...And that is an\nunderstatement.<br><br>That being said, I can sense a 'Real Steel 2' and would hope it turns\nout as good as this first one. Sequels are very hard to perfect\nespecially for this movie, but I digress.<br><br>This movie is worth watching and if you plan on watching it, be sure to\nprepare your tissues.\n"
"\nI had been waiting to see this movie for a long time, saw it today and\nit was worth all the wait.<br><br>The move has a perfect blend of emotions, Robo-fight(very Importantly\nnot over done) and some comic scenes, what else do you want? <br><br>For me the robot fighting was great. Have been following Huge Jackman's\nmovies off late and all have them have been good including this one.\nBut apart from all of that the movie has an embedded message that there\nare things that sometimes you can not handle or overlook when you have\nother priorities but you can always make things right, it may be hard\nbut it can be done.<br><br>The kid Dakota Goyo did a good job as well.<br><br>So I would say go out there and see the movie, worth every penny that\nyou will spend for the ticket.\n"
"\n\"Real Steel\" starring Hugh Jackman and directed by Shawn Levy is an\nawful clichéd bunch of trite. It reaches into the dozen or so boxing\nmovies in a grab bag of hackneyed and rip-off situations from much\nbetter movies. It tries to be original by throwing in robots as the\nboxers, but ultimately the outcome is more like a bad video game movie.\nThe one where the story gets washed away by unintelligent and\npatronizing dialog. Hugh Jackman instills some needed energy, and the\nsci-fi concept has some merit, but the PG script and storyline is\nsteaming turd. An \"R\" rating, adult script, and tossing out the whole\nfather/son mush would've sharpened the movie some. The music is\ngawd-awful and brainless with a mix or rock, rap, and cheesy dramatic\ninterludes from a soap-opera, and the romance is perfunctory. Overall\nbad - not recommended\n"
"\nI am a big fan of Hugh Jackman movies, this is what drew me towards\nthis film in the first place. After reading the initial reviews I was\nvery hopeful and was looking forward to watching it. However I was very\nwrong, I don't understand why it is rated so highly. This movie was\nawful, most of it made no sense, the acting was really bad at times and\nthere was no structure to the movie. The writer has wasted a great\nconcept which had a lot of potential, this movie was cringe worthy to\nwatch and I found it hard watching it to the end. So I will save you 2\nhours of your life by telling you to..<br><br>AVOID THIS MOVIE!!\n"
"\nThis is a high budget cheesy piece of garbage with boring dialogue,\npredictable plot and one-dimensional characters that nobody cares for.<br><br>At first it reminded me of A.I. Artificial Intelligence (which is a\nbrilliant movie), but then as movie went by, I got more and more\ndisappointed. You see, AI was smart, it had a very interesting plot, it\nhad scale, it had interesting characters, interesting dialogue and good\nhumor, it was real good sci-fi. Real Steel has none of that, it's just\na bunch of special effects and a few actors who don't give a sh*t about\ntheir roles.<br><br>The worst part is predictability. I could see where movie was going an\nhour in advance, and that made it just so damn boring.\n"
"\nCharlie Kenton (Hugh Jackman) is a loser in robot fighting. His robots\nare old out of date junkers. His showboating costs him his last robot.\nWhen his kid's mother die, he's left with the kid. Not only does he\nwant to abandon the kid, he blackmails the kid's aunt (Hope Davis)'s\nrich husband (James Rebhorn) holding the kid hostage. Ladies, he's a\nreal keeper.<br><br>My biggest complaint is that Charlie is a huge douche. Why do they have\nto go big douche? He could be a loser without being such a horrible\ndouche. He's a douche. Why would I root for a douche? <br><br>Bailey Tallet (Evangeline Lilly) is hot for Charlie. She lets him stay\nin her gym. The kid (Dakota Goyo) is real mouthy. When he's told his\nfather sold him to his aunt, the big thing he wants is his cut, half of\nthe money. Neither of them are that likable. <br><br>I guess the point is they grow together. But I lose interest in these\ncharacters pretty quickly. I do like the robots thought. Robot fighting\nis kinda cool. Other than that, there's nothing much to watch this for.\n"
"\nIf you think this is kind of a Rocky Balboa movie, you're totally\nright.<br><br>Real Steel is a soap opera made into a movie. Family values, dad gone\nwrong and from that on you know how it goes.<br><br>This is Rocky Balboa wrapped in I Robot, with a little bit of really\ncheesy dialogs.<br><br>I even heard of people who cried with Real Steel, really?, I mean\nREALLY?!. I can't imagine how could you cry with this if you know how\nit's gonna be from the first scene!. I hope this is made like this on\npurpose, cause if it isn't, God, that went really wrong.<br><br>Poor, this is simply poor.\n"
"\nI was half way through this but i had to turn this movie off when the\nboy starts dancing with the robot...... That says it all doesn't it\nreally, i should of known better when i saw the name spielberg\n(produced it) as all his stuff is the same sappy formula over and over,\nbut i wanted to give it a chance...... Afterall its fighting robots, It\nshould be good right??? Well no its not the characters are stupid,\nespecially the little boy... he speaks Japanese he programmes robots he\ndances with aforementioned robots and he can negotiates fight prices\n.......... Like cumon!!!!!!!!!<br><br>Even just small annoyances like are we really meant to off taken such a\ntechnological jump in such a short period of time..... Everything about\nthis film is predictable and terrible, please don't buy it, Hollywood\nand especially Spielberg need to be thought a lesson\n"
"\nWhat a waste of $35 Canadian! It's not compelling or even that\ninteresting. The 'bot fights are obviously CGI but the story line sucks\nthe big one. Move along, don't waste your money... You're supposed to\nfall for the kid who's father is a screw-up but it's hard to feel sorry\nfor a manipulative kid who's no better than his own father. Some have\nsuggested that this is \"Rocky\" on steroids but the script is anemic at\nbest. The closest you'll get to an emotional connection is to the\ngirlfriend running the gym. At least she knows where she stands! For\nthe rest of the cast, it's like lost sheep. Baah! Seriously, this\nmovie, despite the hype, is one you should take a pass on. There are a\nlot of much better actions movies out there. If you're into a retro\nvibe then pick up some James Bond on Blueray, sure to appeal to both\nmen and women. Any of the Jason Bourne (Idnetity, Supremacy, Ultimatum)\nvideos are far better than this piece of tripe. Then again, your\nmileage may vary.\n"
"\nThis one was a total clichéd Hollywood movie. The movie began well with\nlots of hope that this movie was going to be a stunner, but I guess I\nwas wrong. <br><br>let me put it in simpler words. You would predict the movie before its\neven over. <br><br>The good things about the movie were Hugh Jackman, some good action\nscenes, new movie concept about Robots boxing and not humans.<br><br>Bad things were clichéd story and how everything seems to work well for\nthe kid and his father throughout the movie. Everyone seems to be\nreally agreeable in this movie. The kid does manage to get on your\nnerves and so does many other actors.<br><br>The movie failed to evoke any emotions during the second half. I was\npast caring about any of the characters. I cried watching Kung Fu\nPanda-2 but not this movie.<br><br>One thing i can say for sure is that a 10 year old kid would definitely\nlove this movie and suckers for typical clichéd and corny Hollywood\nfilms.<br><br>And if this movie managed to win an Oscar I would certainly be shocked.\n"
"\nThis sci fi \"action\" film is an entertaining, though still standard\nHollywood fare, besides the basic premise, it is completely standard\nand clichéd ridden, its structure, story and characters are all taken\nfrom basic Hollywood models and they follow the standard script by the\nbook. The basic premise of the film is that in the future people like\nwatching joystick robot fights instead of real people fighting, a\nrather absurd premise, but interesting all the same. Though it also\nseem rather ludicrous that a massive highly sophisticated machine such\nas those 3 meter robots would cost less than a car.<br><br>I would recommend this to someone who likes the ludicrous premise but\nnot to anyone else. I found it to be an enjoyable guilty pleasure, but\nI wouldn't recommend it to any of my friends.\n"
"\nI went in to the theater expecting a lot from this movie..I was\ndisappointed by the end of it. Hugh Jackman's acting was worse than the\nkid playing his son..Evangeline Lilly had a very little role- a major\npart of which was cheering for Jackman's robot to win. The plot - lots\nof questions left unanswered. Why did the owners of Zeus want to buy\natom - the old sparring robot? Does Atom actually understand people?\nDoes he have special qualities? There's a scene where atom is looking\nat himself in the mirror..which builds up anticipation in the audience\nabout atom having human qualities etc etc..which is very conveniently\nis left out by the makers of the movie.Disappointing. 4/10.\n"
"\nThis movie is an insult to viewers intelligence. <br><br>Funny, the thing that is most unbelievable in the movie are not the two\nmeter, and a 100 pounds fighting robots, but the dialoge between the\nactors. I don't understand who else except a pre-teen boys can like it.\nHollywood is really making only entertainment flicks which rely on\nthings blowing while an eleven years olds are saving the day. I found\nmyself watching only the robot boxing on normal mode and every time\nthere was an father-son or \"never give up and cheer\" tale i couldn't\nstand watching it so i forwarded the DVD. I swear i won't pay a dime to\nsee a movie like this in the cinema from now on.\n"
"\nI don't know what Hollywood producers are thinking any more... Or maybe\nI do: cast a kid that looks like Justin Bieber, and focus the whole\nmovie on his constant whining, screaming, yelling and in general acting\nlike a spoiled brat, because apparently it sells! Lines that will keep\nringing in your ears for a few hours after the viewing (in pre-puberty\nwhiny childish voice): \"Do something!!\", \"Why are you not fighting\nback!!!\", \"I don't like hamburgers!\". And let's not forget forced\ntouching moments with the appropriate music, tears in their eyes and\nthe family re-uniting just because some robots are punching at each\nother. Was this movie made by Disney? I don't know or care, but please\ndon't give your money to watch it.\n"
"\nThe rest of it, it's just too unreal. So this proposal may work for\nkids and I don't disregard that fact, but there's nothing solid for an\nadult in it, other than the beautiful Evangeline Lilly, or I guess Hugh\nJackman for girls. And please consider I have no preconceived ideas\nabout this movie, I watched Transformers and I actually thought It was\npretty good and entertaining, but this one here didn't feel that way.\nFirst off, sentiments. If the relationship between the father and the\nson is important for the story, develop it, and if not, just don't put\nit in there, but to see characters showing great feelings for each\nother out of the blue and with no explanation whatsoever really reminds\nme of a B-class 80's action movie. Well, this is not a B movie given\nthe budget and these are not the 80's. This movie spills cheese all\nover in the wrong decade.\n"
"\nIn the first 30 seconds, I knew this film inside out. Poor little kid\nand bad dad would come together in a loving embrace. Poor little robot\nwould probably become president. Typical mawkish junk from Hollywood.<br><br>Save yourself a couple of hours and just recall Rocky, Robocop, and\nKarate Kid. That's all there is, folks. Nothing new. Nothing memorable.<br><br>Blah.<br><br>Yawn. Yep. The plot goes exactly where you think it will.<br><br>The FX are pretty good, but a film can't survive on CGI alone. Decent\nacting is pretty desirable too.<br><br>Blah. To satisfy IMDb's minimum number of 'Blahs'.\n"
"\nI need to preface this review with one statement. My skills at movie\nmaking are not even as good as Uwe Boll's. Rather than list spoilers I\nwill say that the ending was a twist on what I thought would happen.\nBut, the path to get to that twist was paved with glitter glue and\nrainbows. It is beyond me on how IMDb users give movies like BloodRayne\na 2.8 and Real Steal a 7.1. And I have not even seen BloodRayne. My\nthought is that 80% of the people who watch BloodRayne would know that\nthe acting, directing and plot are going to be abysmal and would then\nsay...wow...this movie is just like what I thought it was going to be\nso I will give it a 5. Who watches BloodRayne and thinks maybe 6 or 7\ntweaks could have raised their USER rating from a 2.9 to a 7.1?\nBloodRayne was never meant to be a 7.1. I guess I need to remember that\nsome people may have given Real Steel higher scores because they were\nlooking for CGI instead of an intriguing back story and believable\ncharacters. Oh well, to each their own I suppose.\n"
"\nAffected story about an estranged father and son with fighting robots\nthrown in for the gullible American audience. Couple that with bad\nmusic and the kid doing black-inflected \"dance moves\" with the robot,\nbad enough to make you feel embarrassed for even watching, and you got\nyourself a typical piece of affected feelgood crapola. The bird-brained\ndemographic who enjoyed the Transformers movies and Armageddon will\nundoubtedly swallow this one down and ask for seconds.<br><br>I would give this movie less points but I'm afraid it's not possible.\nThe only reason it gets two is that the action was halfway decent.\nBeyond that it was a waste of time. Oh, it also has the increasingly\nunattractive woman from the \"Lost\" series, which everyone likes because\nthat's what magazines and TV told them they're supposed to like this\nyear.\n"
"\nThis is not a good movie it's one of the worst I ever saw. Here is my\nlist of negative points : <br><br>- Hugh Jackman is way below his average level of acting. - This is not\nan action movie, 4 or 5 robot fights is not enough. - Dakota Goyo make\nme think of a toddler who found the ultimate toy. - Stereotyped\ndiscussion. - Anticipated ending. - Jackman has 2 professional robots\ndestroyed but when he founds some old non-fighting robot he goes to the\nfinals !!!<br><br>If such a movie has a current rate of approximately 7/10 well I think\nI'm losing faith in humanity.\n"
"\nThis movie is the epitome of Hollywood's demise...<br><br>A story that has so much potential; ruined by cliché writing,\noveracting and sub-par fight scenes. An obvious attempt at a\nblockbuster, that by the end of the film you will be somewhat glad the\ndisaster of a movie is over. Usually you can expect a somewhat\nrespectable performance out of Hugh Jackman but during this movie he\noveracted to the point of annoyance. I will say I thought Kevin Durand\ndid a great job and I believe he should be receiving the large paycheck\ninstead of Jackman. <br><br>Very Bad and I would not recommend it to anyone. <br><br>-Jeff B.\n"
"\nI have to disagree with the man who said it was an average boxing\nmovie. This movie is a wonderful movie. I laughed, I cried, I cheered.\nI left the theater feeling great. The audience I was with actually\ncheered and clapped, I don't know about you , but that is the first\ntime I have seen and heard, an audience get to it's feet cheering and\nclapping, while at the theater. This is more than an average boring\nboxing movie. It also showed me that when no one else would believe in\nyou all it takes is one person to show you that yes you can do\nanything, It also showed me that no matter how many punches life gives\nyou, you get back up and keep fighting, Don't give up , don't back\ndown. I would highly recommend this movie.\n"
"\nI like robots. I like robots that fight. So if I had gotten my full\ndose of fighting robots I might've been nicer to this movie. But I\ndidn't get what I wanted. What I got was a trifle of a film that\npretends to give connection from a kid that I was sick of in the first\n5 minutes. I really did NOT like that whining, overacting slimy kid.\nThe fact that I had to sit through painfully cheesy scenes with that\nlittle ham actor and Hugh Jackman made the whole thing barely\nwatchable. By the way Hugh, what the hell kinda accent was that? So,\nchessy acting, predictable story, hack writing, good (not remarkable)\nspecial effects and yet this drivel went on to make $256 million, not\nincluding licensing, which I assume will be gigantic when Real Steel 2\ncomes out!?!? I'm not upset, just disappointed.\n"
"\nI had the displeasure of watching this on a plane flight recently. The\nCG looked goofy. The bad guys were like villains out of the worst\nKarate Kid films. The most engaging character was made out of metal.\nThere is no emotional wind-up, because the outcome of every scene is\nobvious as soon as it starts. The scenes which are supposed to be\nuplifting and emotional are so corny that I was laughing instead of\ncrying. It's like a movie of Rock 'Em Sock 'Em Robots, with all of the\ndepth and complexity of the original game.<br><br>That said, it's probably a good way to keep (young) kids entertained\nfor an afternoon.\n"
"\nThis was a movie filled with horrible acting, a horrible storyline and\nsome of the worst clichés I have ever seen. I really do not understand\nall the positive reviews.... ...at all. For a movie that was supposed\nto rely so heavily on CGI I found the CGI average at best. I really\nwasn't expecting much when I saw who was directing this and even the\nwhole premise of a 'rock-em sock-em robots' movie starring Hugh Jackman\nhad me thinking this was some kind of joke. The only thing I can\nimagine worse than this is the sequel that they are planning. <br><br>A great deal of the acting felt forced and the child's acting consisted\nmostly of screaming in an incredibly high-pitched voice.<br><br>In summation this movie is terrible.\n"
"\nThe most awful thing I've ever seen. Absolutely atrocious. This kind of\nfilm should be banned. It's definitely not meant for adults and it will\nmake your kids lose any intellect they have if they watch it to the\nend.<br><br>I had such an extreme emotion about this film, that I had a tear coming\nout of my eye during watching. And the emotion was extremely negative.<br><br>the score is 1/10<br><br>This film reminds of \"Idiocracy\", but this time \"idiots\" are for real.<br><br>I cannot recommend this film to anyone, even if you a person that can\npotentially enjoy it. Trust me - It will make you no good.<br><br>Stan UK\n"
"\nFighting robots, Hugh Jackman, Evangeline Lilly, sounded like a decent\ncombination for this sci-fi geek, so I went into it as optimistic; I\ncouldn't have been more disappointed. Each scene of this movie seemed\ncompletely independent to the rest, there was no continuity and no real\ncharacter development, which made it impossible to care about anything\nthat happened during the two hour snore fest. <br><br>If the father/son story, the child actor, and yes, even Evangeline\nLilly, were eliminated from the film entirely, they could have spent\nmore time on the real draw.. a story about GIANT FIGHTING ROBOTS!<br><br>How on earth this film is getting good reviews is beyond me...\n"
"\nI would enjoy fighting robots until I've seen the first hour of this\nmovie. A few times I wanted to quit watching in that part. So many low\nquality dialogue, non-sense up and downs and much more. How could Hugh\nJackman agree these script? It would have been a good action movie\nwithout the script. What about robot fighting with a bull? And why Zeus\nwon at the end with referee decision? There was no need for that. I\ngive this movie 2 out of 10. Don't be fooled with the high rating.\n"
"\nBy crossbreeding of Terminator and Rocky we get...<br><br>Maybe it is cliché, maybe it is Hollywood phew, but battles kept me at\nthe edge of my seat and the rest of the story at the edge of tears. I\nloved it very very much.<br><br>9/10 (10 is reserved for the best movies of all time and I can not go\nthat far)\n"
"\nReal Steel is always doing the bare minimum to obese its viewers.\nEverything in this film is bland, boring, and painfully uninspired.\nMovies are meant to provide experiences not forgettable adventures.\nEverything in the movie is so average that you can not feel anything.\nBoring is the best way to describe Real Steel.<br><br>4/10\n"
"\nReal Steel is really a excellent movie ever I saw. Which is most\npopular to children and young also. it's starting to end everything is\nso excellent to me. A boy is changing his life with his father is so\ngood to all father also. it's also future realistic and future world is\ngoing to be like this. now we are using smart phone and later will keep\na robot in our house. So all are future related also. really a famous\nmovie to me and I always watch this movie when I get free time. Other\nside past created robot is also showing a good image which is showing\npast also. past + present + future is real life which is also reality\nof Real Steel.\n"
"\nIn the near future, robot boxing is a top sport. A struggling promoter\nfeels he's found a champion in a discarded robot. Real Steel is one of\nmy favorite movies that Hugh Jackman has starred in besides the X-Men\nFranchise, Prisoners, Les Miserables and a bunch of others movies it's\nbasically Rocky meets Terminator and honestly who the hell doesn't love\nRobots? This film brought some life in all those boxing movies sure it\nrepeats some stuff from Rocky like the ending for example but still one\nhell of an awesome movie and i would love to see a sequel after Hugh is\ndone with Wolverine and i think it might happen cause the movie was\ndirected by Shawn Levy the director of the Night at the Museum Trilogy.\nThey also did one hell of job with the robots you feel like they are\nreal and not just some cgi or puppet in a science fiction movie the\nanimatronics in these film are outstanding and so are the robots and\nthe human characters. It really deserves a much high score on Rotten\nTomatoes than just a drop dead 59% Atom for the win!!!\n"
"\nWhen a father is stuck with his son who he barely knows - a robot is\nfound - This leads to Battles in an actual arena - Don't let the robot\nbattle make you doubt this movie, because it actually has a fantastic\nstory line - By the way, the acting is pretty darn good too. Special\neffects are done quite well - and you can't help but lose yourself in\nthe movie due to the wonderful story line - it's no Gone With The Wind\n(HA!) but it is unique and extremely worth a watch for a father (Or\ngrandfather) and son (grandson). Lots of action - And who doesn't like\nHugh Jackman - He plays a great mean father - but even the hardest\nheart can be changed with the love of a son and a passion for battle\nbots!\n"
"\nCame across this film a few months ago and was blown away. Simple\npremise of lonely boy desperate for a father figure finds solace and\nfriendship in a fighting robot. Yes it's cheesy and some what\npredictable but the whole film made me smile throughout. Hugh Jackman\nplays the wayward father looking for direction while his son is looking\nfor the father he never had.The robot is the pragmatist that brings\nthem together. Fight scenes are good and the interaction between the\ncharacters is charming. Many films of father and son coming together\nrely on a love interest this thankfully doesn't . So sit down and enjoy\nand film that will leave you feeling warm inside.\n"
"\nCharlie is a gambler who risks everything he has without thinking too\nmuch about the consequences if he looses his bet. He has a robot and\nuses him in fights to get him money but unfortunately is not invincible\nand now owes cash to others. Soon his son Max arrives and this is an\nopportunity to restore his debt but instead he buys another robot. Max\nfinds one of his own but need his dad help to make him the perfect\nwarrior. Will they manage to teach a machine to box and escape from\nthose who wants their money?<br><br>Delaying this was a big mistake because only now I found out what I was\nmissing for such a long time. Is a unique film witch will make your\neyes weeping and this while watching two robots fighting and there are\nnot too many movies out there where I can say that. Congratulations to\nthe director, all the actors involved specially to that little kid who\nmade the movie even more emotional. I would watch this again anytime.\n"
"\nMy son can't get enough of Real Steel, and I found it very entertaining\nthroughout the whole movie. Its not the worlds best movie at anything,\nbut I feel is a good solid effort that really has given me and my son\nplenty to talk about and have fun with. It reveals whats right and\nwrong with humans, plus gives give us great realistic action along the\nway. <br><br>The characters give us a great mix to love and hate and are played\nreally well, along with some very cool robots that seem to come alive\nin their fights whilst you don't notice the cgi work. <br><br>Because my son loves it, I get plenty of satisfaction from this. It\ncertainly sits a top of our DVD pile for replaying often.\n"
"\nI had seen this film a couple of times in the last years and I enjoyed\nit every time.<br><br>The movie has various robot fighting and every robot has its own\npersonality mixing all with a perfect blend of emotions.<br><br>For me the robot fighting was great. All late Huge Jackman's movies are\ngood. There are also some comic scenes and the movie has an embedded\nmessage: you can always make things that sometimes you can not handle\nwhen you have other priorities; it may be hard but it can be done.<br><br>Dakota Goyo (the kid) did a good job as well.<br><br>I would watch again gladly this movie!\n"
"\n\"Real Steel\" is the imaginary future of sports, robot boxing. Which,\nwhy not that seems logical with the way technology has been going. They\nbuild these huge, mechanical, and smart fight robots from metal and\nscraps. Even programmed controllers, voice command, and shadow\nfunctions. With all these parts to the robot they even made they have\ncool or extravagant exterior designs. The robots are from the future\nhowever the plot of the story is not. It's about a dad (Charlie) who\nhas success earlier in his life from boxing, who has now retired and is\nin desperate need of money. When he divorces his wife she re marries an\nolder wealthier guy. When they leave on a trip and ask Charlie a favor\nto watch a kid he sees as a way to get easy money from them, and so\nwith that money he receives he goes out and buys fighting robots.\n"
"\n(61%) A better than most were expecting, including myself, family\nsci-fi action drama that has Hugh Jackman to thank for much of its\nsuccess. Jackman brings his great screen presence, bubbling\npersonality, and charismatic charm lifting what could have been an\nunlikeable character into someone you really do root for. The plot is\nvery similar to both Sly Stallone's \"Over the top\" and of course\n\"Rocky\", but everything is done well enough for this to be on the whole\nquite exciting at times, meaning this has the power to bring on enough\nthrills and spills along with a very enjoyable ending. So it may not\nhave an original bone in its body, but as far as well made family\nfriendly movies go that parents will enjoy as much as the kids, then\nlook no further.\n"
"\nReal steel. A movie that certainly lives up to its name. Plus it has\nHugh Jackman. So technically, what more does one want? In reality, if\nyou are going to watch this just for him, you will be mightily\nsurprised. The movie completely takes over and you enjoy the movie for\nwhat it is and not for the actors that bring it to life. <br><br>The emotional bond between father and son, between childhood friends\nwho turned sweethearts and the battle between one man and himself is\nall so beautifully woven. This movie has robots, fights, boxing,\nemotions, a story line, survival of the underdog and so much more. <br><br>I have wanted to see it for such a long time and i am really glad that\ni finally got down to watching it. Much Much worth it. I personally\nthink it is a movie for all ages, men and women alike, for the movie\nteaches you one important life lesson. <br><br>If you work hard and you have faith, nothing and no one and stop you.\nYou are unbeatable, unstoppable and will remain undefeated. <br><br>Bottomline - Must watch for movie buffs and non movie buffs alike.\n"
"\nYes, this resembled \"Rocky\" in many ways (but minus the obnoxious\nmusic) and didn't do anything really new in terms of plot. The actors\ndid their parts quite well and there were some scenes that stood out.\nSince the robot couldn't talk, we didn't have to translate what it was\ntrying to say. In that respect it was a step up from the never-ending\n\"Rocky\" series . There were comic book elements throughout - expected -\nand one dimensional. A few of the parts were genuinely funny but\nputting a kid in such a brutal world struck me as a bad choice all\naround. I felt like I was watching a fixed game.<br><br>Curtis Stotlar\n"
"\nAffectation of story full of chances to become (and it should happen)\nin a muscular film full of testosterone, cheap movie or blockbuster.\nBut it dropped in the hands of a pu**y soft hand of an executive\n(Disney) how Homer regretted when he helped Mel Gibson. <br><br>Let's see, soft story with an absolute prick of a kid (I don't know why\nthey put them in so many movies, I can't stand'em JEBEM!)and his\nfather, Disney redemption, and robots, of course, to give coolness. <br><br>They tried to give us \"cat for rabbit\", Spanish idiom, like Chinese\nrestaurants. Tough guy atmosphere with that Midwestern smell, rodeo,\ntattoos, beers and booze, hot girls; all fake, you just need 10 minutes\nto get sick of this pretending film. Come on, bad \"Over the top\"\nremake, think something new, and without this kind of sons, please. <br><br>Best, Hugh Jackman, who does what he can, and the first song. For kids,\ndi**heads, but kids.\n"
"\nThis film is actually entertaining in parts. The actual fights and the\nrobots where pretty cool. This film isn't slow to get started and there\nare not many lulls. Jackman and Dakota both give decent performances.\nHowever I found that the storyline and the way the characters interact\nwith each other wasn't very realistic (putting the giant robots a\nside). I didn't get why the kid stuck around all things considered? Why\nwas the kid and woman crying during the final battle? There wasn't a\nreal explanation as to why Hugh Jackmans character abandoned the kid\nand his mother... This film could of been better but as is it passes\nthe time.\n"
"\nDuring last decades, movies with similar structure and points have been\nshown in the market, many of them with the participation of Steven\nSpielberg. But all is not gold that glitters, the audience has\ndeveloped and the messages so fresh in E.T. or A.I. are not so in\ndecades later. Of course, if you are fond of sci-fi and bloodless\nfights and do not tend to analyze the logic of events and character\ndevelopments, Real Steel is definitely for you. However, Hugh Jackman\nand Dakota Goyo are worth watching.<br><br>My ranking is above the average due to some politically incorrect\nmoments in the - to the great extent - family movie; above all, a minor\ninvolved in legal gambling and nighttime IT :)\n"
"\nI've had this movie for quite a long time now, but I thought it was\ngoing to be a cheesy film, so I never watched it. What a surprise!\nAlthough it feels like a very expensive kid's movie, I have to admit I\nhad not enjoyed any aimed-for-the- adults movie so much for quite a\nlong time. The movie and the outcome of every single match were very\npredictable (it's a kid's movie after all!) yet it somehow managed to\nget me all excited. Right now I'm thinking if I've seen a real action\nmovie that came close in delivering this level of joy and\nexcitementFace/Off maybe. The CGI used here is some of the best I've\nseen. You can't tell if the robots are real or computer-generated. The\nactors do a really great job in showing a wide range of emotions,\nalthough the ending failed to make me all emotional due to the childish\nnature of the movie. The fights were really exciting, even though the\nend result was clear from the start, and this has to be the movie's\ngreatest accomplishment. I strongly recommend this movie to anyone who\nfeels he/she can still communicate with the child within.\n"
"\nA movie that has no pretences beyond unadulterated action. This film\nconsists of great big towering metal robots, (a little too akin to\nTransformers if you ask me), fighting (although robot fighting seems to\nmakes it a tad less 'gratuitous' - but not much). Real Steel is\nyawningly predictable, way too long (over two hours of 'robot-on-robot\nactionyaaaaaawn), did I mention predictable? After the first 5\nminutes you know exactly what's going to happen so unless you like big\nmetal things pounding each other's heads for 2 hours, you may as well\nturn it off at that point. There was a feeble attempt at a 'plot', Hugh\nJackman did a reasonable job of acting (considering he didn't have much\nto work with), the kid (Dakota Goyo) wasn't too cringe-worthy and\nEvangeline Lilley, playing Bailey Talet was OK in a 'cookie cutter'\nkind of way.\n"
"\nBeing a lifelong Richard Matheson fan, I knew the instant I saw a\ntrailer for it that REAL STEEL was a ripoff of his short story STEEL\n(one of the greatest SF short stories ever written). By combining the\nidea of Rock 'em Sock 'em robots with Matheson's notion of a world in\nwhich boxing between human beings has been outlawed, the producers of\nthis heaping mound of mindlessness- aided and abetted by cheesy cgi and\nthird-grade level writing- thought they'd cash in. Which they did.\n(It's interesting that they only approached Matheson about the rights\nto his story AFTER they'd stolen it). The recent first episode of the\nteleshow ROBOT COMBAT LEAGUE just goes to show what can happen when\npeople don't really have a clue as to what to do with advanced robotic\ntechnology- ROCK 'EM SOCK 'EM- The Series??? Go back to the original\nASTRO BOY TV series and you'll see what it SHOULD be all about.\n"
"\nThe only reason I gave this film 1 star was because I couldn't give it\n-50.<br><br>Horrendous story (another butchering of a Richard Matheson work), corny\nacting, quite good effects, atrocious sweeping camera work and\nextremely dull direction.<br><br>It saddens me that Hollywood puts so much effort and money into making\ngreat looking films with no heart and no story. There is so much great\nSci-Fi material out there yet they insist on excising all the great\nstuff to make glossy turds that poisons the next film that comes along\nbecause we're the idiots that keep paying money to see this crap!\n"
"\nI've never commented on a movie ever in my life, however this movie was\nsooooooo crap that i felt like i owed it to the internet.. this movie\nsucks. Hollywood has gone crazy. nothing makes any sense. what a waste\nof money to make this piece of crap. loud music and big name actors\ndon't make a movie for crying out loud.. if you liked this movie your a\nmoron. i definitely feel dumber having watched it. Hugh Jackman, i want\nthe last 2 hours of my life back.. zero continuity, zero emotional\nattachment between anybody, why are there a thousand semi-futuristic\nanarchists sitting around an old zoo waiting for a robot to rock up? do\nyou control a robot with your voice, your controller or what? don't\nwatch this or you will become bitter and twisted with contempt for\nAmerica, although if you live in the world you probably already are..\n"
"\nI am only giving this movie 3 stars because of the fighting robots.\nThis movie was a very bad ripoff from I, robot and Rocky. Only very\nvery very bad. The acting was bad, the characters unbelievable, the\nscript sucked, the story was the worst I have seen in years. Sure,\nfighting robots are cool, and even with no story at all I would have\nrewarded more stars. But this story was so bad, that I got irritated\nthe whole movie. I haven't said this many times the word f#ck in two\nhours ever! I was actually hoping for the robot to shout out:\nADRIAAAAAAAAN!<br><br>So, no laughs, no thrills, no fun. Only fighting robots...<br><br>And that kid, really, don't quit school! You can't act! <br><br>Hugh, shame on you.\n"
"\nReal Steel could have been a really fun blockbuster for the whole\nfamily, as they had the talents of writer Dan Gilroy, Hugh Jackman as\nthe lead, composer Danny Elfman, and the special effects wizards at\ntheir disposal. Unfortunately, the film tries to be cool and has pretty\nawful dialogue that distracts the viewer from watching robots fight\neach other. Sure, the story is basically Rocky with robots, but what\nperson in their right mind Wouldn't want to see that, if only the film\nis well made. The special effects people did their job right, and\nwatching animatronic/digital robots perfectly mimic an actor's every\nmove in real time is really impressive.\n"
"\nFrom beginning to mostly end this movie has a subtle way of getting to\nthe punch and then it delivers time and time again with the fight\nscenes. Real Steel delivers in the same way/formula as any Rocky movie,\nany underdog movie, and it's exciting to watch. It leaves you smiling\nas you root for the father and son underdogs. But then the ending comes\nand the word of the day becomes C for Cheese. Real Steel does not\ndeliver the goods with the ending. It becomes too forced/contrived and\ncheesy as heck. This movie was about a 9 for me until the ending.\nHowever, overall, it's a pretty good movie and worth the watch. Also,\nyou can never go wrong watching the beautiful and stunning Evangeline\nLilly either.\n"
"\nI didn't think I'd like Real Steel. In fact when I popped it on, I was\nsure I'd be witching it off after 15 minutes. But in the end I was\nrooting for the little underdog robot fighter, despite there's not one\noriginal bone in the movie.<br><br>What it boils down is, that Real Steel is a feel good movie. It knows\neverything in it has been done before in sports movies and father/son\nbonding stories. But at the same time the movie manages to do those all\nso familiar plot twists and turns pretty well and with ease many other\nmovies, that aren't about robot boxing and sons looking to bond with\ntheir estranged fathers, simply aren't able to do.<br><br>So, after doubtful start, I was, in the end, in a pretty good mood.\nEvery plot element I had guessed before hand, but despite the ending\nthat is riffing Rocky and pretty much every underdog sports movie, the\nmovie had made a big smile on my face. It isn't a masterpiece, but it\nis a fun little movie, that aims to make you feel good, because in the\nend everyone learns a lesson and a sun peeks from behind the clouds.\n"
"\nThe story is another fatherhood thing, a common theme for family\noriented movies. And the story gets more in common with the more recent\nfamily movie where the father figure is told as a reluctant, if not in\ndenial, at first as a daddy. The developed story goes on as the common\nfatherhood movies, where the father and the kid finds the one thing\nthey like in common and build relationship and bond more on it, despite\nit being a long shot, and eventually wins out the long shot. What's\ngood about this one is that, unlike most other fatherhood movies where\nit's only the father that gets to do the struggle while the kid only\nshouts from behind to lift his spirit up, this movie presents that\nactually the kid can do something too. Jackman, as always, played this\none nicely. It's good to see Dakota Goyo can balance the aura of Hugh\nJackman. Also it's nice too Evangeline Lily's earlier works here.\n"
"\nI think if were a kid I would have loved this movie, I mean come on\nfighting robots, that's awesome right? As it was I watched about an\nhour and decided I'd had enough. Even the well done CGI and Hugh\nJackman couldn't save this for me; sappy, clichéd, and overacted in a\nvery Disney sort of way.<br><br>It's a father-son story about a former boxer turned fight promoter\n(Jackman) who trains robots after humans are replaced by them in the\nring. Jackman also tries to establish a relationship with his estranged\nson Max while they assemble and train the next robotic champion of the\nworld. <br><br>As an FYI this is listed as a \"sci-fi sports drama\" which is a movie\ngenre I can't say I've ever heard of before.11.13\n"
"\nBefore watching this movie ,i was thinking about another robo-fighting\nmovie that we used to see these days but they just simply integrated\nemotion with it.yahh,that is true !!!!They have showed most probably\nsweetest moment between father (Hugh Jackman) and Son (Max Kenton)\nthrough out the movie,if you a fan of Transformers and expecting robots\nwill act like human ,man this not the movie OR you are expecting crack\ntype action ,you will never get meaningless action all of a\nsudden.Through out the whole time a viewer will see a unstoppable force\nthat could not separate father and son, how a junkyard Robot became\nfamily and hope of those lives,challenging the authority,fighting\nagainst time ,regaining honor,regaining energy etc etc .itz a full\npackage of entrainment,i don't care even other characters,how they have\ndone but father (Hugh Jackman) and Son (Max Kenton) will make you cry\nand happy as well ,that will be the felling when you will finish this\nmovie .....:)\n"
"\nOn a lazy Sunday afternoon, while going through my movie collection, I\ncame across this movie and I thought why not give this epic another\nshot!! I had loved it the first time but had no idea that reliving this\nscintillating flick will give me goosebumps and fill my eyes with\ntears...again!! <br><br>In this 21st century, there are very few movies made which you can\nwatch more than once and even fewer which you will enjoy...Well Real\nSteel is a movie which will leave you with emotion and delight every\ntime you see it!! It just never gets old. <br><br>With a unique plot and some impeccable performances (especially Dakota\nGoyo as Max...you have a bright future ahead), this movie will always\nbe one of my favourites. Thanks Shawn Levy!! Your masterpiece will\nalways shine in people's hearts. You are a \"people's champion\" and\n\"Don't worry, your secret's safe with me!!\"\n"
"\nPretty good film, I'll be honest, when I read the film description, I\nthought it was going to be about Hugh Jackman building and actually\ntraining robots for fights.<br><br>Still, the film was really good, much better than ''Transformers'' and\nthe like. Hugh was good as always, the kid I thought was awesome, not\nseen him before.<br><br>The ending brilliant ( a bit like rocky), predictable of course, but..\nwell, you knew what was going to happen anyway!!!<br><br>Good times, really pleased that some good, watchable films are coming\nout, I've seen 4 in a row so far on Box Office and only 1 has been a\nlet down by a long way!!\n"
"\nThe World we live in, gets complicated more and more each day.\nCivilization advances, thus Technology is influencing our lives more\nand more, as we go on. <br><br>In These Times, as well as to the Times Ahead, it is so Good to know\nthat some things still remain the same. Faith, Love, Hope, Effort, and\nUltimately Success!<br><br>Those Values are The Essence of Our Existence. As long as we Honor them\nthroughout our Existence, nothing can hold us back!<br><br>This Film is All About Them! <br><br>Enjoy It!\n"
"\nAnother highly Emotional Extravaganza from the Spielberg stable. It is\na Loud and Ludicrous Story of a Bad Dad taught a Good Lesson from a Kid\nwith the help of an endearing third party. In this case it is a Boxing\nRobot who of course has been Discarded just like our supposedly likable\nLittle Boy.<br><br>They make a Winning Combination when They get to it after all the\nInfighting and Bickering and set off to the Big Show in typical Movie\nmachinations of unrealistic Time. <br><br>But hey, this is a fantasy and that's OK. But what is Not OK is all the\nYelling and Shouting and Screaming and Jumping and Cheering and\nRoaring. <br><br>This Ear-Splitting decibel level is substituted for Real Emotion and\nReel Steal has very little that is sincere and much that is Forced on\nthe Audience.<br><br>The CGI is standard and Fun and there is a Superficial, Watchable,\nChildish Story that can be Enjoyed by the Little Ones. What is\nWorrisome is that Hollywood thinks They are making these Movies with\nwide appeal and not just for the Kiddies. They might be Right.\n"
"\nThis film really is so clichéd, so formulaic, that you would think that\nthere just programmed some robots to write it.<br><br>Okay, you have the redemption story arc you get in a movie like this.\nYou have cardboard villains, both the racist rodeo promoter and the\nforeign designers of the villain robot. You work in just about every\nboxing movie cliché. It was really a paint by number script writing\nprocess.<br><br>Jackman is okay in the film, and on the Child Actor Annoying scale,\n(Jake Lloyd of the Phantom Menace being a 10) the kid in this movie\nrates about a four.<br><br>Oh, I do love the whole \"Rocky\" like ending that sets us up for a\nsequel if they decide to do one. I guess I can't get that emotional\nabout robots beating each other up. Certainly not CGI ones.\n"
"\nRockem-Sockem Robots meets Rocky with a get the family back together\ntheme. I got to see the movie in an advance screening tonight. The\nwhole theater was at times applauding and whooping it up. This is not\nhigh-brow, intellectual docudrama or supposed to be real. This movie is\nfun. It is meant to be fun. The kid steals the show. The meaning I\nbrought home from this movie is heart. If you have heart, there is\nnothing in this world that can stop you from your dream. Just like \"The\nLittle Engine That Could.\" I really don't want to give away any\nspoilers here, just advice. If you want to feel good about life, and\nfighting the good fight, then go see this movie. You will be glad you\ndid. I am not a movie critic nor will I ever be one. But I know what\nmakes good movie and this one has tons of heart.\n"
"\nI made an account just to review this. This \"film\" is a Real Piece of\nGarbage, truly assembled from the scrap yard. It has just about every\ncliché Hollywood has to offer all humble jumbled together to create a\nsloppy sappy movie about a jerk father who suddenly reaches a moment of\nclarity and gets the hot girl, then insert robots and a soundtrack only\nHallmark could produce. I seriously think the only reason they put\nrobots in the movie at all was to lure people who enjoy sci-fi. Bad\nacting (sorry Hugh, we're cool, it wasn't your fault), bad script, and\noverall bad.....everything) In fact even the way the robots fight is\nridiculous (they use remote controls). This movie is the illegitimate\nchild of Battle Bots/Rock Em Sock Em Robots/and (insert any Hugh Grant\nor later John Cusack Movie.<br><br>I'm generally fairly open-minded when it comes to movies, but I have no\nproblem saying this movie is complete garbage.\n"
"\nWhat can I say ? I really have doubts about some of the comments. I\nguess movie producers must have a whole team of people leaving good\ncomments on the forum for marketing purpose. How this movie can get\nsuch a high ranking is a mystery to me. I can clearly see what the\nmovie was aiming at but it clearly missed. The kid, kind of reminded me\nof the cat in Shrek except it was funny in Shrek. I was not expecting\nan Oscar contender but still.. The pace was completely wrong. Some of\nthe characters in the movie have no purposes at all. As somebody else\nmentioned in another comment, the zoo scene itself represents to movie\nin its whole. Many comments mention rocky, and yes, the last 20min is a\nremake of rocky but robot version. They even attempted to reenact the \"\nAdrian.. Adrian .. \" scene.. I hope for them that they made it for\nfunny purposes... Bad, bad ... bad.\n"
"\nThis movie, unfortunately like most top-budget movies nowadays, is\npretty bad. Literally countless clichés, mediocre acting,\nnon-interesting characters, a very obnoxious loudmouth kid who will\ninspire kids all over the world to enhance their 'loudmouthness' even\nfurther and the list goes on forever. The special effects don't look as\nfake as in some other movies, though.<br><br>It's really incredible that people can't come up with something better\nwhile having all the resources that must have been available for a\nmovie such as this one. As long as people keep paying to see these crap\nmovies, they'll keep making them.<br><br>Fortunately, it's not as bad as Transformers 2 and 3, but what is ?\n"
"\nSaw Reel Steel and enjoyed this decent popcorn flix. Hugh Jackman is\nalways fun to watch and Dakota Goyo channels Rick Schroeder in his The\nChamp like performance. Jackman and Goyo interacted well together and\ntheir relationship anchors the film. It is only Evangeline Lilly who\ndoesn't hold her own, but to her defense she isn't given much to do\nexcept where unflattering tee shirts and complain a lot about Charlie\nin the old days. I wish they had given her more to do; showed her\ntechnical expertise in helping Max with ATOM. I have to admit that I am\nnot a boxing fan and thought that the fight scenes were not great. They\nshould have channeled Gladiator more and Cinderella Man less.\n"
"\nOK, is it just me or this folks in Hollywood are trying hard to make\nall their movies most annoying these days? This movie was clearly a\ncombination of Rocky and \"Over the top\", which both have been\nsuccessful \"feel good\" movies. However, when you put in it the most\nannoying kid on the planet, play most annoying rap music all the time,\nuse a lot of foul language and have grown people act like idiotic\nchildren, than I am not sure who's gonna fall for it. Cause I ain't,\nfolks. I've seen too much of this stuff coming out of Hollywood lately.\nAre they trying to make us give up watching movies? Because after\nwatching real steel, I am ready to give it all up. The whole\ninstitution. This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen, not\nnecessarily badly made, however everything is played in such an\nannoying manner, that I am really wondering if they actually wanted to\nannoy the audience instead of pleasing it. Parts of the movie were\nemotional in a good way, however the annoying parts were so bad that I\nreally felt overwhelmed by it. Not recommending, save your time and\nmoney.\n"
"\nI really did not like this movie at all, it was actually really boring\nand you can't relate to any of the characters at all. Max is an\nannoying kid and Charlie is an a*hole. There's a lot of things wrong\nwith this movie like in the beginning you have a robot fighting a bull,\nthat's animal cruelty and then later on Max is taking Atom for a run\nbut he causes destruction like trashing bins everywhere and breaking a\nfire hydrant, you do realise you have to pay for that kid...<br><br>Then there's this Kingpin guy who just wants to beat the hell out of\nCharlie and steal both his and Max's money but why is it that in movies\npeople never use the Police...<br><br>As for the robot fighting, only a brain dead 12 year old would think\nit's good, they are actually incredibly bland, I had more fun watching\nRobot Wars than this and they were basic remote controlled robots.<br><br>Overall, a very boring movie with plot problems.\n"
"\nI kept on waiting for a \"ghost in the shell\" plot that never\nmaterialized. I don't have a problem with the father/son story, but\nremote controlled robots as a big time event is too silly for me.\nPerhaps if they had gone a little closer to reality and featured a\nfather/son robot story based on what has already been done in robot\nfighting, i.e. Battle Bots, and kept it small time I would have\naccepted it. But I really needed the kid's bot to turn out to be\nanother Sonny, from I, Robot; or B1-66ER of The Matrix; or Andrew of\nBicentennial Man; and to give that line of the story a lot of face\ntime. At the end it seems clear that Atom, the robot, was indeed\nworking autonomously but it comes too little too late. (Also, it's not\nsuper clear weather or not this is a robot with a human soul, or\n'Ghost', or simply a learning computer AI being slightly evolved...).<br><br>Also, \"Who, Boy, let's fight a bull!\" not being a tragedy but a hokey\nway to introduce the father's losing streak? Not cool. You want to\nfeature CG animal abuse, fine, but you don't treat it like fun.\n"
"\nI put off seeing this movie a couple of years because if you've seen\nthe trailer you almost have seen the film. The story is one big fat\nlump of predictability. It just goes straight to the end without any\ntwist, turn or unexpected event. Jackman plays his stereotypical roll\nwell and the Visual Effects (the reason I did see the film) are done\nexcellently well. The CG robots are almost indistinguishable from the\nanimatronic ones. But besides that they just rehashed one of the\nblueprint scripts from the vault and added nothing to the genre, cinema\nor the art of filmmaking in general. This movie might have some value\nto families with kids or kids themselves (I guess they are the target\naudience) who aren't already jaded by the output of the clone factory\nnamed Hollywood.\n"
"\nI watched this film a year or so ago, and I had low expectations for\nit. I didn't think such an abstract and unrealistic plot could have\nbeen made into such a great film.<br><br>I began watching this and soon became rather bored with the whole bull\nversus robot scene and the whole boring, unneeded bits. But then WHAM!\nI was soon engrossed when that little boy rescued that robot from the\nscrapyard. It went from being n average, run-of-the-mill movie into one\nof my favourite movies at that time.<br><br>When it finished, I had become so attached to the characters and so\nhateful towards the guy who beat up the father and son (when he was\ntaken off screen and beaten up, I was almost as happy as when Dolores\nUmbridge was captured by the centaurs(Harry Potter)!) that I had a lump\nforming in my throat(joy, not sorrow) when the film ended!<br><br>Overall, a great film to watch with the older members of your family/\nfriends.\n"
"\nThis is a very good movie that tell you how to how you don't have to be\nthe best to do your best. It has took me a long time to understand that\nbut this movie help. you can learn a lot from watch movie like Real\nSteel. Many life lessons. Know that you have to be willing to take your\nbumps and lumps and keep going. These movie tell the story of the\nultimate underdog. No one believe that he can make it. The Hero get the\nchance to prove the world wrong. This is about a man his son that he\nhas never met before and a robot name Adam. They find these old robot\nand little do they know it would change there future and life forever.\nThey take this training bot. He keep takes on the best in the w2orld\nand keep getting better. When they get really good have a chance to win\nit all. These movie is really good. I thought it was going to be lame.\nThen I show it and like to watch it ever time it come on TV. It is very\ngood if you don't have to like robots to watch the movie. This is a\nmovie that will speak to people that are look at as under Dogs. Because\nwe have a will of steel.\n"
"\nIts been a while since I was this entertained. The movie is brimming\nfull of character, its funny, the human touch comes through and even\nsome light drama. The lines across the film are spot on. Sure, the\nsecondary plot is very lightweight, but who cares? For the type of\nmovie this wants to be... its atom! It hits the spot every time. I\nthought the acting added value and the whole father/son, albeit via a\nrobot game evolved through the movie. It went from a very distant and\n'so what' to warm, sentimental scenes. Very good acting. On the\ndialogue, some of the 'You sold me', '100 miles for a kiss - Was worth\nit', they are just peppered lightly to life and amuse. Brilliant.\n"
"\nReal Steel is a heartwarming story of estranged father and son bonding\nand an underdog story packaged in a new bottle  in a world of robots\nboxing it out in arenas for professional glory and money in an\nimaginary future world.<br><br>Hugh Jackman stars in the role of a former boxer turned who now\nparticipates in robot boxing events with his robots to earn his bread.\nThe plot progression is predictable and the performances are okay.\nHowever, a few magic moments and the novelty of the \"arena\" adds to the\nuniqueness of this film. While not a must-watch, Real Steel is a\npleasant watch nonetheless, which gets one rooting for the underdog\n(yet again) at some stage  sooner or later!\n"
"\nI really like the movie. I love Hugh Jackman and most of the films he\nis in. But this one is one of his best. I love the storyline of the\nfather and son learning and growing together. I really liked the part\nwhere Aunt Deborah comes to get Max and Charlie tells Max that Max\nforgot who Charlie was. When in reality Charlie grew up some and become\nalmost a whole other person. Though I have to say the ending was my\nfavorite part where Charlie tries to tell Max how he feels and Max says\nthe secret is safe with him. I enjoyed the action of the robot boxing,\nbut liked the human side of it better. I'm not much of a boxing fan. It\nwas well shot, edited and directed, and all the actors were great. If\nyou haven't seen this film yet, I suggest you go rent it. It's totally\nworth watching.\n"
"\nI think that it is a pretty interesting take on the old Rock-em Sock-em\nRobots that I grew up with as a kid.<br><br>Enjoyed it for what it is...a fun feel good movie. A dead-beat dad gets\na clue, the bull doesn't get hurt, and there weren't bullets flying\neverywhere. Imagine that.<br><br>The special effects were pretty good, in fact I would put them better\nthan another fighting robot movie that used the cover of shaking\ncamera's to hide detail and simulate real action.<br><br>Also liked how this movie combined Transformers, Every Which Way but\nLoose, The Mighty Ducks, and professional wrestling all into one\nfeature.\n"
"\nIt's the old underdog story. Mixed in with some family fun and road\ntrip action. Hugh Jackman obviously had fun doing that, though you do\nwonder sometimes where his motivations lie (especially when he looks\nburned out). Even more out of place -&gt; Evangeline Lilly. I love that\nwoman, but could the role be played by anyone else? Actually it could\nhave been played by literally anyone.<br><br>But this shouldn't really break the movie for you. What does count are\nthe action scenes. And they really put their back into them. The movie\nis highly entertaining (while not original and highly predictable) and\nmore than just decent. The nice story touch (the robot) is that you\nmight see more there than there actually is ...\n"
"\nI am going to be brief- one of the best movies in 2011!<br><br>Hugh J's performance in this movie is flawless. Playing the role of the\nfather and an unsuccessful robot boxer, he meets his son, Max (played\nby Dakota G). Soon, their relationship blossoms together with their new\nsparing robot, Atom- how i wish i have Atom as a friend, that lead them\ninto the world championship.<br><br>The movie begins with plenty of development and foreshadow, making the\nmovie very predictable. But the excitement and the journey from where\nthey were to where they are at the end was spectacular. A movie with\nnumerous layers, Real Steel surely did succeed at all levels. The fight\nscenes were well executed- i was at the edge of my seat, clenching my\nfist and cheering all the while.<br><br>It touched straight to the core- that i teared up in the end. It\naccomplished bittersweet moments effortlessly; and while some other\nmovies fail to make the hero loses and wins at the same time, Real\nSteel did it in style.<br><br>I highly recommend Real Steel because really, it's as good as any metal\nout there!\n"
"\nThe reason I want to review this film is because it something that I\nlike doing and have done well not as a robot but in Eggars I was doing\nkick boxing as well as boxing so what the film is about robot getting\ntrained by some people but some of the robots don't need to be\ncontrolled by a controller but ATOM and Zeus are the ones that don't\nneed to be controlled by anything and the reason I like the film is\nbecause towards the end it is Atom VS Zeus and Zeus is the unbeaten but\nwith Atom he was the one who was perfectly matched for Zeus because he\nwas a fast movement Robot Boxer. I would recommend this film to anyone\nwho enjoys Rocky and terminator because they based on the same things\nmainly because with rocky it boxing and with terminator it the robot\nbit.\n"
"\nI have to admit, i didn't think this movie was gonna be good the first\ntime i saw the trailer. I rented from redbox when it came out on DVD\nand i was totally wrong. I came from watching Rocky to this. It is not\nas good as rocky, but i can give it props for being a lot like it. The\nplot (no spoilers) is about Charlie Kenton, a retired boxing champion,\nis now part of robot boxing. He finds out that his ex is dead and he\nmust go get his son. His son's an A**hole to his father, but Charlie\nfinds out his son loves robot boxing. So the find a robot named atom\nand they train him to fight. The things i love about this movie, one is\nthe music by Danny Elfman, definitely one of his best sound jobs. I\nfind myself listening to some tracks every so often. The story is\nreally good, it sucks you in, in a blink of an eye. you feel for pretty\nmuch every character. It's a really feel good movie, that really leaves\na great impression. i give it 8 out of 10 Stars\n"
"\nSPOILER ALERT This movie is just the right movie, with a combo of\nperfect robo fight scenes and some decent characterization.\nCharlie(Hugh Jackman) is a big a** who doesn't know what he's doing,\nand the little kid is a better business man then him, even though\nchallenging Zeus after one Pro fight is a little extreme. The story is\na little predictable and some parts that are just a little dumb, like\nthe classic stand on a cliff-fall down-find something valuable scene.\nAlso you might notice some cracks on Atom's face, which looks vaguely\nlike a mouth and nose, which might be some discreet attempt at adding\nmore heart to the movie? Overall this movie is pretty decent to watch,\nwith amazing CGI and a rank of 7/10 stars.\n"
"\nThis movie really channeled a lot of inner Rocky. The underdog fighter\ngetting a chance to fight the champ. The movie also channels some of\nRocky 4, since the bad guy is a technological marvel and \"Whatever he\nsees, he destroys.\" Alright, in Real Steel the line is \"he kills\"...\nKind of sad that they didn't just take the quote directly.<br><br>Overall, this is the story of a down-on-his-luck robot boxer, he\ncontrols the robot via remote control, who gets his son dumped in his\nlap. A son who he never talked to, and he doesn't even know how old he\nis. Hugh Jackman's character reluctantly drags the kid around as he\ntries to get his career back on track. In the end the kid teaches his\nfather to believe in himself.<br><br>Yes, it is a pretty sappy movie in a lot of ways. It's loaded with\nclichés and terribly trite one liners. But I have to say the audience\nate it up and was cheering during the boxing matches, and laughing at\nthe jokes. While it's not a great movie, it's fun, especially if you go\nin with the right frame of mind.\n"
"\nOne of the worst movies of this decade! The film has absolutely no\nscript, no logic, no drama ... nothing.<br><br>They've probably spent some money on CGI, got a poster actor and then\nsaved money on everything else : supporting actors, scrip, everything.<br><br>I actually can;t believe Spielberg put his name no this garbage. it\nmight be that he was simply drunk or maybe this is a money maker by\nrecipe.<br><br>The recipe is : poster actor, poster director, CGI + action = money.<br><br>Unbelievably bad movie. :(<br><br>Don't waste any of your time on this!<br><br>Don't waste your money on this either.\n"
"\nI absolutely loved this movie, which I wasn't even going to watch but\ndecided to give it a try due to the high ratings on IMDb and I'm very\nglad I did. The acting was superb from the entire cast, I felt an\nempathy and connection to the characters like I haven't since watching\nDisney movies as a kid. I'm a big fan of boxing but I don't think I've\never being cheering so much for any man as I did for that robot. This\nmakes Transformers look like out of touch, cheesy rubbish. Great\nsoundtrack. Plot has an original spin that we've never seen before, the\nexecution and every detail was just perfect. A crazy budget well spent!<br><br>I'm not one to watch a movie more than once but I look forward to\nwatching this again. I can't fault it in any way.\n"
"\nWhen I saw the previews for this movie, I thought it would just be\nOKAY. My wife talked me into watching it and I was very surprised to\nenjoy it so much. I think they could have developed the story with\nCharlie's son a little more but from what I understand they are\nplanning a sequel and maybe they will build on it more then. I think\nthey could have ended the movie with them deciding to stay together or\nsomething along those lines instead of stopping abruptly after the\nfinal fight. I still give the movie a solid 8 out of 10. I am looking\nforward to the sequel and think they can do so much more with the idea\nbehind this film and hope they develop it well on the next one.\n"
"\nI think it is a good film with a good underdog theme.<br><br>The plot works really well. Hugh Jackman and Dakota Goyo act really\nwell together, the robots are stunningly animated and the sets are also\ngood. There are a few minor problems in my mind: Some of the fight\nscenes were a bit dodgy, the music isn't original and some parts of the\nfilm were slightly overacted.These problems don't affect the story at\nall, they only lower the standard of the film by a small amount. The\nprops are good, it looks like it is set in the future, but at the same\ntime the props don't look ridiculously futuristic.<br><br>An inspiring film that will entertain Si-Fi and boxing fans alike.\n"
"\nThe CGI is good, as good as the Transformer movies. It's a good looking\nfilm, with some nice shots and direction. If only I could have watched\nit on mute. The acting is TERRIBLE. The dialogue is HORRENDOUS. <br><br>Irresponsible father who has a kid he hasn't seen in years: √ Somehow\nthe father ends up having to take care of the kid: √ Kid actor who\nyells half his lines: √ Kid angry at the father and is sarcastic half\nthe film: √ Kid has extensive knowledge of father's line of work, just\nby chance: √ Father falls in love with kid, wants full custody: √<br><br>It's one of those movies you know within 15 minutes it stinks.. and end\nup watching most of the movie in fast forward. I'm sure you\nunderstand.. so, go rent something else.\n"
"\nThis movie was completely boring. The story is boring. Dakota Goyo\ncan't act and is really annoying. The relationship between Hugh\nJackman's character (Charlie Kenton) and Evangeline Lilly's character\n(Bailey Tallet)is boring to say the lest. You will know how the movie\nends within the first five minutes, the story is that predictable and\nreally shows how lazy the movie industry has become.The only good\ncharacter in the movie is Atom and that's because he has no lines in\nthe movie. My suggestion is instead of watching lazy Hollywood movies\nwith bad writing and no originality, you should watch truly original\ncontent like Cowboy Bebop or Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex.\n"
"\nI've really enjoyed watching this amazing movie, though you can find\nsome similarity between it and Rocky Balboa, where every champion has a\nlast fight to fight. I really enjoyed two hours of enthusiasm,\nthrilling and light focus on details \"which makes other movies boring\".\nThe movie's sequence of events is fast, organized and logical, and\nemotional parts are not heavy, which makes your heart pumping as long\nas possible. I really enjoyed the clearance of the relationship between\nboth the father and the son when they met for the first time in the\nmovie, and the personal similarity makes it not ugly as it may looks\nwith normal father-son relationship. And an extra point for the good\nquality of movie, as you don't see sexual shots, which makes it\nsuitable movie for all ages, especially that it doesn't have a violent\nshots \"Unless of course you have a heart problems or under 7 years\nold\". So, If you have not watched this movie yet, I recommend it for\nyou. Enjoy watching.\n"
"\nThis movie is amazing! The CGI is excellent!! The casting of Hugh\nJackman, Dakota Goyo and Evangeline Lily is just match made in heaven.\nBoxing fight never get any exciting than this. I normally don't like\nboxing because of all the bloody and sweat so I don't watch Rocky\nmovies. But robot boxing is totally cool with all those metals busting\naround. Atom the junkyard robot is the CGI star in this show. Both Hugh\nJackman and Dakota Goyo play their role very well. Plenty of emotions\nand sometimes annoying but they will grow on you. And the music score\nis really good!!! Those metal punches sounds real good. And the music\nreally brings out the emotion out. Combined with the actors emotions\nshowed, it is a total win. <br><br>Real steel packs 2011 up!!! This is real entertainment!!!\n"
"\nThe story line in \"Real Steel\" is quite simple: A quitter guy, Charlie\n,tries to make it as a robot fighter. Loaning his way through life to\nthe next fight. <br><br>Ready to flee, when two suited guys shows up, not to get money, but to\ninform him that he's now legally in charge of his 11 year old son, that\nhe abandon when he was born, because of the mothers death. And so it\ngoes from there. The movie is entertaining yes, but from the moment\nCharlie gets his kid, I felt like I was watching an updated version of\nStallone's \"Over the top\". And I guess that I think that that's the\nbest thing about this movie: Being reminded of that time I saw \"Over\nthe top\" in my, almost, teen years.\n"
"\nWell I saw the movie expecting some powerful acting by the Hugh Jackman\n,but the actor seems to be confined himself and let the child actor do\nhis duty of acting.The movie is like a future version of Rocky except\nin this Robos will fight against each other rather than original pro\nboxers.I think children and teens will like this movie rather than\nadults.Director tries to show father and son relationship but the drama\nis very weak and it gets boring.The child actor is OK .The lady who\nplayed the girl friend of Jackman is pretty dam good.She has great\nexpressions.I am giving 6 out of 10.Go for the movie if you don't have\nanything special do to on that day.\n"
"\nGot this one because I am a fan of Hugh Jackman. I was not expecting\nmuch given the premise of the movie, and even with that I was\ndisappointed. It makes no difference what level of dispencement of\nreality you are willing to afford this epic rubbish, you will lose\ninterest about 12 minutes into the carnage of intellect this thing is.<br><br>HJ must have been desperate for a payday. This POS flick would be a\ncareer killer if he had but a little less merit in his history.\nHonestly, the fact that I had to suffer through watching this made me\nwant to punch the entire cast and crew in the face.<br><br>At the end of the day, I cannot in good faith find a single reason to\nrecommend this time-waster. It is completely worthless, and makes me\ncringe for a number of reasons outnumbering the number of running\nminutes of the \"movie\".\n"
"\nNow that is a movie that stays with you long after its over.. with the\nright blend of emotions and action it surely will give you your money's\nworth. Hugh Jackman is terrific as always.Even the discarded dancing\nRobot ATOM is so adorable and you feel connected with the cast almost\ninstantly.But the real find of the movie is the kiddo Dakota.Sometimes\nyou wonder what is the age of that kid, given the expressions and\nemotions coming out of that cute face. The storyline and the screenplay\nkeep you engrossed throughout and prepare you for the final showdown.\nAnd what a climax you have(i feel it was better than 'The Fighter')..!!\nIn a movie's war/fight you always know who is gonna win..but the real\ntalent lies in the way you WIN it. But it manages to WIN your hearts\nmore importantly. I would recommend this movie for all age groups, a\nsure-shot entertainer.\n"
"\nWatching the trailer I felt great interest to see the movie, as I'm\nfond of sci-fi, and that trailer appeared quite like one of my\nfavorites \"Transformers\"... big robots, crazy fight, man with them; I\nwas eager to get a DVD of it. Surprizing me, my friend at home bought\nit for the weekend. Relaxing on the couch with drinks and snacks we\nstarted playing it in our PS3... and next few hours I didn't speak a\nword but watching the movie, enjoying its every bit, the fights, and\nmost - the characters. To my opinion, it is not just an action movie.\nBesides the bot-fight tensions comes up the tension of father-son\nrelationship. I think at this point, this movie becomes a meritorious\none. I just loved the characterization, the presentation of story\n(though the story wasn't an epic one) and the two main characters'\nacting was superb; especially the kid -- his acting was so naturally\nflowing and spontaneous, really blown my mind! Jackman's talent faded\nto that little boy's performance, if we compare them considering the\nage and experience of acting. A great movie for all.\n"
"\nThe robots and the action in the movie meld together nicely. Taking\nplace in the not-too-distant future of about 2020, transformer-like\nrobots spar, box, and fight in place of humans, in events such as the\nWRB (World Robot Boxing). Some of the robots that fight in the movie\nare Midas, Twin Cities, Noisy Boy, and the world-famous Zeus. The\nrobots all have their own uniqueness and a lot of color and well-made\naction shots, making the movie very entertaining for many ages. Not\nonly was there plenty of action, a robot that almost takes on a\nhuman-likeness, but there are also heart-felt and touching moments that\nmake the movie worth-while.\n"
"\nIn the vain of \"Over The Top\" (Sylvester Stallone, 1987), \"Rocky\" and\neven \"Transformers\" comes a movie that will have you standing and\ncheering. Yes the story has been told before and yes we are confronted\nwith some cliché moments, nevertheless Real Steel is a winner. It is a\nhard hitting (literally), feel good movie. The fight scenes are very\nwell choreographed ,thanks to the influence of Sugar Ray Leonard, and\nthe acting was just as good. <br><br>Robots beating each other senseless, a great story, good actors and\nsome good humor everything a movie needs to be entertaining and that it\nwas. As Roger says: TWO THUMBS UP...WAY UP!!!\n"
"\nReal Steel is a great movie. This is movie is directed by Steven\nSpielberg. It is almost the same with Transformers, but in Real Steel\nthe robots are a kind of boxer robots those are controlled by humans.It\nis about a collaboration between a father and his son. The father\nteaches the robot many kinds of tricks in boxing. There are uppercut,\nand the others. The good side of this movie is that it doesn't imitate\nthe other movies about robot, because most of all movies with the same\ntheme feature similar robots with Transformers. The lack of this movie\nis that the storyline is almost the same with the other movies' , first\nthe good people are lost,but at the end they always win.<br><br>By:Alien\n"
"\nReal Steel<br><br>The worst thing about robot boxers is their inability to grasp the\nconcept of \"taking a dive\" without self-destructing. <br><br>Fortunately, the pubescent manager of the steel-plated pugilist in this\nsci-fi movie has got too much integrity for bribes.<br><br>Following his mother's death Max (Dakota Goyo) becomes the ward of his\naffluent aunt (Hope Davis).<br><br>But with a vacation on the horizon, she must bribe his father, an\nex-boxer (Hugh Jackman), to safeguard him until her return.<br><br>Under his supervision, Max recuperates a robot, which he and his dad\nenter into bouts. <br><br>On the eve of their title shot, however, Max is removed from the event\nafter his dad's creditors come looking for their cut.<br><br>In spite of its cheesy lines and flamboyant bouts, Real Steel has real\nheart underneath its steely exterior. <br><br>And while watching boxing with your absentee father can be healing,\nbeating him up would be more rewarding.

"\nSeems a few reviewers here are taking themselves and this film a little\nto seriously.. schindler's list this isn't and it should be rated\naccordingly, that said... what a thoroughly entertaining film. I\nwatched this with a friend and by the mid way point we were both\nshouting come on \"rocky\" get off the ropes..come on hit him..\n5..4..3..2..and he's up ;-). I got that same great feeling i had when i\nwatched rocky fighting Apollo creed, awesome feel good fun. Is it\npredictable? absolutely! but who cares. We enjoyed every minute. it\nticks all the boxes for an all round action packed family film. great\ncast, great effects and an old as time everything will be OK in the end\nstoryline. in the words of jimmy krankie (voted most Scottish person\n2003) it was faaaaandabeeedozee. watch and enjoy.. it will make you\nfeel good ;-)\n"
"\nI hated boxing. When I first heard about LOTR, I thought it was a\nboxing movie. And I go not watching that movie for year, unless I came\nto know original plot from a friend. pathetic but true!!!<br><br>But luckily I watched Cinderella man, and then that movie got me into\nboxing movies. Then I watched The Fighter. Those movies touch my heart.\nWhen I heard about Real Steel where Robots fight Boxing. I had no high\nhopes about it, but felt interested because the movie got The\nWolverine. <br><br>Now, I liked it and I like it much, seeing how realistic a science\nfiction movie can be. Seeing how a unknown son can change a father, how\na son can rebuild a father's heart, I love the movie. <br><br>FYI, this is the movie which will freshen your mind better than lots of\ncomedy. No hard scene, but you may attempt to cry watching happy\nmoments.A movie to watch with family. I rated it 8, and hope you will\nfind my review helping.\n"
