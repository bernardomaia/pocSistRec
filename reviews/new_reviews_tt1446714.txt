what a disappointment
two hours of movie time passed like 10
the script is terrible
its kind of like when a 5 year old tries to tell a story
and then the science lady goes to a different planet and she finds an alien head but its not really an alien head and she puts it in a bag and then she takes it back to the spaceship and the lady and another science lady bring it back to life and the robot guy gets some alien blood and gives it to the science ladys boyfriend and then they go to sleep together and the next day she has a baby inside of her so she goes into the surgery machine and has the baby taken out but its not really a baby its an alien and then she goes to save her friends but then she goes back and finds out that the baby alien didnt die and kills the bald man and on and on
zero suspense
a golden razzies level performance by charlize theron
save your  on this one
its a stinker
prometheus is one of the most underrated and misunderstood science fiction movies in recent memory
do not view this as a prequel to alien
it is part of the same universe but while the first 4 are actionhorror films prometheus is a scifi adventure that explores the origins of mankind
this concept is something ive always wanted to see put to screen and prometheus delivers so well that im enthralled by it no matter how many times i watch it
the cinematography and score are oscar worthy and the direction and visuals are near perfect
i believe prometheus would be much higher rated if more people went into it with an open mind
the first alien did have mixed reviews upon initial release and now it is an all time classic
i really think that one day prometheus will have the same status and i hope the sequels are more appreciated
what can i say
i personally think ridley scott lost his mind or something terrible happened
im sorry to say this but lately all hollywood movies are bad i mean bad in terms of acting script ideas everything is going down
at some point you should do something because otherwise we would need another hollywood soon
special effects is not enough really not enough and this movie doesnt have in my opinion good special effects and when it has plenty the impact on the viewer is low because of the bad acting and script
im sorry to say this and to write this review but it is true
the difference between aliens and this one is huge
almost 30 years ago and aliens has better script acting plot even special effects are better
this moview was predictable with every step and no thrilling moments none
i dont know what happens to your ratings and with all the people here the figures dont picture the reality
what can i say wake up hollywood before it is too late
this movie was not at all what i expected
i expected a somewhat intelligent script
no
this is nothing but a vapid cgi hollywood film with a big explosion at the end
this will probably be the last 3d movie i see
i loved the original alien movie
if you did you will be totally disappointed by this one
it lacks everything the original had
the characters are boring the dialog is stupid there is no suspense and no humor
fans of the original will be wanting to learn more about the alien world of the the original but you wont find that here
there are too many questions that are never answered
there is absolutely not one original scifi idea in the script
i am so upset by how bad this film is that i want to write to ridley scott himself
apparently all hollywood knows is cgi and big explosions
the movie obviously is going to have a sequel but they wont get my money
fans of the original alien film prepare to be disappointed big time
save your money watch the original film
this movie was absolutely terrible
it has no plot at all they just go to a planet that they discovered from two researchers about our creators coming from another planet who in the end try to kill them
this movie is very stupid and is not only a waste of money but a waste of time
the movie was a complete waste and ended horribly just so that there could be a sequel by making dr
shaw get on another ship just to go to another planet because the planet that they where currently on was just a war experiment planet
the movie had a lot of random scenes that tried to make the audience flinch to make the movie seem exciting or horror like but it backfired and made the already terrible movie worse
um so basically to sum it up this movie is worse than watching miley cyrus act
i practically feel like slamming my head into a wall right now
prometheus was maybe the worse movie ive ever seen in my whole life other than grease 2
the events that occurred were completely random and really did not go along with the plot
i mean really wtf does the doctors baby have to do with the story at all
how could she be running around after a csection
what in the heck was her boyfriend doing with his legs behind his neck after being killed
really
going into the movie theatre knowing what the plot was i thought it would possibly change my beliefs about the beginning of life
i now know how much i believe in god
dear lord
dont waste two hours of your life watching this load of crap
i saw this film twice on two languages a my native russian and original english
when i saw prometheus first time i had exciting experience
great visual effects drawing views a it was on highest level
second time i saw interesting story with different turns good acting
special acting is acting of michael fassbender who acted robot david
he was brilliant
film gave us a lot of questions
when how and who created us
meeting with creator is the greatest dream of our world
author of the film gave us own version of answer
greatest race engineers created humanity from its dna
price of this was the life of one of them
may be it was prometheus a atlas who kill himself for life of next generation creatures a people
there are many questions without answers
we are waiting next film
expected a lot better from such a renowned director and following all the hype about the movie
i am very pleased i did not waste money going to the cinema
the plot was poor and predictable the acting very wooden and some of the scenes involving a young woman leaping around having just undergone abdominal surgery downright silly and humanly impossible
i did expect something a lot better than this
i have struggled with the 10 lines of things to say about this and also because the system did not want me to submit anything profane or spiteful  not being spiteful but this was slow and unwatchable in parts and i found myself contemplating the pile of ironing in the kitchen that needs doing
it was boring
cannot imagine why this was oscar nominated  can understand why it didnt get any awards
i would not recommend
prometheus is both horrible and awesome
awesome because im a sucker for alien worlds
great special effects and awesome world building
michael fassbender is wonderful as david
a good movie for 3d
but what was ridley scott thinking
some pretty bad dialogue and awful horrorscifi clichas
i dont care for plot lines that only move forward due to one stupid decision after another
the viewer wasnt taken on a journey of discovery
instead whole plot lines were resolved thru unexpected short dialogues
i could almost see noomi rapace cringing
as if she new the dialogue was bad as she was saying them
despite the bad lines rapace acting is good
because the prometheus movie trailer was amazing i expected a smart and sleek movie
am i glad i saw the movie
yes
am i disappointed
yes
butperhaps my expectations were too high
if they had been lower i could have just enjoyed it for what it was
all that being said ill probably see it again on dvd and if there is a sequel will look forward to it
as a selfconfessed alien fan boy ive found it difficult to put down some unbiased thoughts around prometheus
after the first viewing i was disappointed i was expecting a direct alien prequel and this isnt it
the film was better second time as i could leave all my preconceived ideas behind and enjoy it for what it is
there are some good performances particularly michael fassbender some great setpieces and for the thinkers it proposes some answers to the big questions who are we and where did we come from
thats not to say the film is without its flaws it has plot holes what doesnt
can be clumsy in its delivery and at points to fast paced
however its enjoyable  which is all you can really ask for and from me is praise indeed
well i somehow looked forward to that film coz i generally like ridley scott films esp
the alien movies
man was i disappointed
ure just sitting there for the whole film to evolve but its far from happening
the most action takes place when this one actress cuts out an alien from her womb somewhere before or after that her boyfriend gets fried with a flamethrower by his own men and let not forget the starship which gets shotdown and is rolling over the earth quiet the funny scene actually
after that gt cut  they get another starship and fly away
youll get to see some kind of alienish alien in the last 2 seconds of the movie
well see for yourself or get to see some better movie like the last batman which actually pays off
okay so this is a big budget movie that purports to be some epic event but ten minutes into it i wasnt sure if by accident i was watching some made for scifi channel low budget piece of garbage by the asylum
their mission is the most expensive the largest undertaking in the history of mankind and these guys wake up from years of deep sleep to immediately disobey orders run around a completely uncharted alien planet without taking even five minutes to study the damn thing
did they not hire any technical advisers
i just get really irritated when hollywood types producers and directors have zero clue about how things would have gone and simply have the characters act like a bunch of idiot mitten screwballs believing that the kid doing the special effects will make up for the really really bad direction and complete lack of technical advice
the film was rubbish
it looked all shiny but was rubbish
at no time did i care for anything of anyone
well okay maybe the android david
the script should have been thrown out
dialogue was weak
plot was shockingly bad
this was an insult to the alien franchise
in order of goodness this is at the bottom
yes you read that right even worse than alien 3
oh it was shinier but they should tell each viewer to leave their brains at the door and not to question anything because youll be disappointed if you do
i cant believe the imdb rating
my fear is now on the bladerunner reboot
just find some new material to destroy
there are countless thousands of good scifi books out the
just waiting for the cinema treatment
with the exception of fassbender and theron the casting was very poor
these actors had zero charisma
it was a mistake to not cast more well known actors that dont need a lot of character development
fassbenders character development was the only attempt theron didnt need it and it worked
guy pearce would have been great if cast in a real role
the young actor made up as an old guy never works
pearce so strong in the trailer was totally wasted in this film
maybe a prequel might be in store for him that would be an excuse
the plot also got a bit too coy it was thought provoking but went overboard trying not to be transparent and not explain anything characters while being developed in a film often discover things with the audience
not in this film
rapace was just awful no way to compare her to the strength that weaver had in her many alien appearances
overall a disappointment when there was such a good potential story with which to work
not a film i would want to see a second time
must be time for ridley to retire  after creating a video game and marketing it as a film
there is nothing redeeming about this effort
script
terrible
acting
often terrible
character development
terrible
ending
beyond terrible
this film was so bad i may never watch anything from ridley scott again
what happened to mr
scotts ability to create a masterpiece
he has been responsible for several amazing films thus i can barely comprehend this embarrassment
if i had to write one thing that could be a positive from it i can only say that hopefully it will falter at the box office and minimize the chance of them making another one
one basic bit of advice if youre an intellectual trust me and spare yourself from this disaster
as a big fan of the alien series and of science fiction in general i went into this film slightly concerned that ridley scott would after all these years botch the job
and he did
this film was horrible
there were gaping plot holes the behaviour of the characters in the film completely illogical at times and an overall weak story that is never fully explained
yes the film is very pretty and stunning to look at
yes some of the acting is quite good
but as far as story and plot goes this film is a disaster
an apocalyptic scifi catastrophe
any scifi fan of blade runner 2001 bsg the original star wars alien aliens will be let down on all fronts
in regards to alien this film isnt as scary
in regards to aliens this film isnt as fun
very disappointing
i had high hopes and they were dashed
i went to this movie hoping for a revolutionary sophisticated new sci fi genre
nope
this movie was written by the guy who wrote lost and it was just as pointless
it was like he crammed every theme you could possibly think of in the movie and then didnt even bother trying hard on any of them
the characters were completely unrealistic
they dont seemed to be interested in the fact that they are the most important explorers that have ever lived
or that they have discovered the greatest discovery ever
or that there is a squid alien they just left behind in the medical bay
theyre all hostile toward each other for no good reason
no one in the movie acts reasonably at all
if you take out all the visual effects you dont have a movie
if you decide to go just bring your ipod and listen to music over it or something
they didnt even put that awesome sound from the trailer in the movie
i could go on about all the failings of this film but there are enough other reviews that do that
without going into detail about the actual film
this is a film with zero plot very little explanation about why they embark on the trip it produces zero empathy for the characters essential in a film where you know some will not see the closing credits the characters themselves are not believable and there is some pretty poor acting
there is an attempt at a bombshell but it is so predictable that the dramatic pause leading up to it makes the scene laughable
the only reason to see this film is if you like lots of cgi and the fact that it appears to be some rushed padding to set up another few films
much like the series lost damon lindelof started out with a great storyline but was unable to conclude
the idea was good but the execution was poor
again like lost it left you with more questions than answers and the ending doesnt exactly suggest they will be making a sequel so youre left wandering what the whole movie was about
visual effects wise the movie was excellent and the actors did a great job but their was a clear lack of depth in the characters
over hyped movie and like star wars episode 1 it leaves you feeling a little disappointed
i would recommend waiting for it to come out on dvd rather than go watch it in the cinema
there were aspects of this film that blew me away
it was a great concept but its execution could have been so much better
the crew selected for this extremely important mission were portrayed as fools unstable jerks and undisciplined morons its like they werent vetted even to slightest degree
would this occur in a similar undertaking
i dont think so
how could ridley be so blind to this how could the cast in general accept these moronic roles
ridley your opening sequence promised so much then the plot spiraled into lunacy
i would encourage everyone to watch this vehicle because it does make one think but just keep in mind the execution leaves one wondering at least it did me how the nonsense remained in the film
i do enjoy pondering why the beings that seeded the planet are so upset with us
the one clue is the 2000 year time period mentioned
eh
i saw this film the day it was released eager with anticipation
i then watched it last night again a year later i still dont really know what to make of this film
first off visually its stunning
people who say avatar was dont know what theyre talking about
blue people aint visually stunning
story wise it certainly raises a question or a dozen i mean what was the story with that black goo
and why were theyre loads of squids
and how could that machine perfectly remove the alien from her
overall it is rather compelling tho and has that horror factor thats associated with the originalnot to the same extent obviously
worth watchingmichael fassbender is the definite man of the match with this film
nobody else really stands out the girl noomi rapace isnt bad tho she is no sigourney weaver
if your a fan of the franchise watch it i mean after alien vs predator requiem this is like the greatest film ever
6 out of ten i think an interesting and compelling film that is lacking in the most basic sense
is this some kind of joke by ridley scott
answer big life questions
i dont think so
i love the first two in the franchise and was bored by subsequent ones taken over by other directors
so this is his big statement
a mess of silly philosophy is what i saw not unlike what scientologists try to peddle
bad computer animationeffects a laborious storyline and a grating female lead protagonist
no thanks but i do give thanks that i didnt pay hard cold cash to sit through this snorefest
in short i found no redeeming qualities in this opus of excess and hope scott realizes its time to call it a career as well as close the franchise
i saw this movie thinking this looks cool and i was disappointed
so a massively expensive space exploration goes under way and a bunch of bumbling babbling baboons who often know hardly anything about science
all i ask is why
why did they have to do it that way why is there hardly anything in the movie thats original
example
carnivorous space creatures that wind up killing everybody by the end of the film
sound familiar
try apollo 18 alien creature etc
its a story thats been told many times and its not any more entertaining or interesting the fifteenth time its told
i was not pleased with this film at all
even the acting performances werent very good
fassbender did a great job playing an emotionless robot but other than that i saw nothing special about this movie especially after all the prerelease hype that it received
final score 4
210
i remember ridley scott directing some great scifi movies in the past
well
this starts as a decent scifi but as soon they land to the planet it turns to a some family drama and pointless walking in the dark
nothing really happens just horrified shouts all the action is boring
so predictable twists on the plot that made me yawn when i was supposed to be excited and terrified
i think ridley scott should retire from scifi and make some good old time movies with a good story
this movie is just waste of money and time
id rather see stalker and 2001a space odyssey once again
this is like a james bond movie going bad you only watch it once
really disappointed to say the least  i was expecting something epic and mythical to add to the canon of alien and aliens
looks like scott was trying too hard and tried to juggle too many ideas at once so the end result is a mishmash of halfbaked ideas and red herrings  just when you think you know what direction the movies taking and you think youve got it sussed scott will throw in another random idea thats unrelated to the other plot points before it thatll take the whole thing in a different direction
youll be left wondering how the characters went from one plot point to another for example at what point did idris elba and his crew actually realise the danger theyre in and the imminent threat to humanity that they become so heroic as to sacrifice themselves
they were hardly involved
what was the purpose of charlize therons character
how the hell did the dead engineer get from the shuttle wreckage back to his own ship to position himself for the start of alien
overall stunning visuals but this is a confused mediocre effort
pretty much all pizazz and no substance
i expected it to be a proper prequel but it wasnt supposed to be but even as a movie it had plenty of shortcomings
its like a series of boring events made exciting by having them take place on an alien planet
i didnt like the character of david at all and his ridiculous knowledge and understanding of an alien dialectlanguage hes never seen before
i dont like how weyland was alive and on the ship for no reason other than his own desires
and i especially didnt like how stupid every single crew member was
although the technology was seven kinds of amazing its not a big enough influence on the actual movie itself
if you wanna see amazing technology just find it on youtube
scott demands that the audience suspend practically all of their disbelief to make the film work and thats never a good idea
i am quite disappointment of this movie
its a scientific fiction movie
you basically can make up anything you want that contradicts any known scientific theory
so i am not going to be picky about the discoveries in the movie
as a scientist myself i have to say that the socalled scientists in this movie are totally unprofessional
the writers need to have real scientists as consultants
just like when you are making a war movie you want to have real military personnel pilots snipers etc as your consultant to make sure the things the actors do and say in the movie are authentic and believable
i am a big fan of tom hardy after warrior
i think he gives an oscar worthy performance in that movie
in this movie he is good but not marvelous
mostly because of the role he is playing
so poorly directed and written that it could classify as one of the best comedies ever written
so many why dont we stall the story here with traditional moments that dont really move the story forward but might get us to two hours worth of filming
on a positive great idea on a prequel for alien and photography is very good
just wish direction would have been more sophisticated and logical
you can probably stop reading here because the site is requiring me to write more as if length of idea is more important than the idea itself
which arent really the point of reviews but in order to get this published im going to publish words that dont really matter but the site would like me to continue writing because they believe more is better
not the greatest logic dont you think
wow this has to be one of the most ridiculously made movies in history
first 20 mins was interesting and then it went downhill exponentially
nothing the characters do in this movie makes any sense especially given that they are super scientists
so many things happening in this movie that made me wanna cuss out ridley scott for making such a piece of
seriously man do not watch this skin through it if anything and you shall want to puke
how the heck does this movie currently have a 7
4 rating on imdb
this is more like a 2
5
anyway dont want to keep repeating myself but go watch something else even if you are desperate
the only positive thing i can say about this is that it looks great on screen stunning actually at times
everything else was disastrous
the biggest problem was the plot which would have been naive and clichad if it had been done well but did not even live up to that and ended up being simply nonsensical
i could literally list dozens of contradictions holes and unexplainable oddities in the storyline
then there was the acting which was uninspired to be kind about it which obviously leads you to wonder about the direction
i find it hard to understand how a movie like this which should have been great can go so completely wrong and not be caught by the studio quality control somewhere before release or perhaps it was too far gone too fix by then
i find it harder to understand how people are giving this movie positive reviews
major disappointment given the directors history with this genre
its pretty obvious that whoever wrote this script lacks the scientific knowledge of the average 12year old
thats a pretty major problem with a science fiction story
unfortunately the fiction part of prometheus is even worse than the science
characters with very little development maddeningly stupid dialogue and wildly inconsistent and questionable actions leave the excellent visuals as the only enjoyable part of this film
i am astounded that the studio allowed this film to be released in this state
its a mess from start to finish
not even worth a rental unless you want to invite your friends over and make fun of it together
this show have its good point but mostly its all bad
the starting of the show seems rather alright as it was flowing rather smoothly
however already at the beginning of the show it was extremely boring
i find myself nearly dozing off at the front part of the show as all that talking without the suspense which it was suppose to have just makes it dreadful to watch
at least at the later part of the show begins to get more interesting and the suspense was starting to build up
but the ironic thing is that the story wasnt flowing properly as it progresses deeper
in fact the plot seems to be mixing up at the last few part and it felt more like the director was vomiting out whatever he could to end the show something to me which makes it extremely horrible
but the only plus side to the story is that it is not predictable as i thought it would
to conclude its not really worth the time to watch or let alone buy the dvd
if you are really interested to watch the movie i recommend you wait for hbo or foxmovies premium to play it on tv
ridley scott
uneblievable
what a disappointment
so much to look forward to so much to experience
then what disaster
absolutely no sense at all pointless plot really poor storytelling nothing makes sense scenes without any connection
i am speechless
good sound editing good visual effects
point taken someone threw money in and said make it look nice dont worry about meaning or sense the 3deventandsensationgeneration swallow any nonsense
and so ridley did
hard to believe this was meant to be like that
if anyone has an explanation for this please come forward but truly nothing in this film is coherent or within the story or the setting plausible
very disappointing
predictable
firstly anyone at the end of the 21st century still using miles
is just pandering to a yank audience who would not understand distance anyway when expressed in scienfic termology
anyone who goes on such a mission and does not believe and know it is a one way mission  is living in a disney fantasy world
calling it not a pre  alien film
get real i might have been slightly amused if this was made in 1976 but to make it in 2012
very disappointing
seems the studios think because it has a half cooked plot that any kindergartener could follow and 3d actually 4d is going to get people to watch and think oh ah la la like with logans run or star wars is sadly mistaken
it actually starts out really visually interesting for about the first 20 or 30 minutes but leaves you wondering when something is going to happen
gimmicky marketing tricks make you think this is going to be a movie in the same class as the alien movies
the plot is some kind of weak push toward the idea that humans came from giant space aliens and there is no god
this is a very slow scattered movie with a horrible story and a mess of a script
there is no action no drama no suspense no tension no adventure no background story and no character development
there are no connections or attachment to any of the characters
the characters are unintelligent and annoying
this is literally one of the worst movies ive ever seen
i dont know how the same producer of some of my alltime favorite movies including the original alien movie can put out this complete piece of garbage movie
this film really disappointed me
i am a huge ridley scott fan so that made it worse
i think it needed a better editor to tighten up some scenes that were slow because that drags the film down
it got to the point where i started thinking why are we seeing this
this diatribe is boring and irrelevant can we get back to the story
it would be like listening to my mother share what should be a 2 minute story but taking 15 minutes to do so
good story buried in a long and boring dialogue
the cgi is awesome and the tech ideas are cool as would be expected these days
but that isnt enough to make me want to see this a second time
