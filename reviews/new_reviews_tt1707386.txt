i must be getting old amp cynical or both
i saw the actors listed and thought this has to be a great movie
it wasnt
i couldnt endure more than 30 minutes so perhaps it got better after i left
i doubt it
i love a good musical
i also like it to have some dialogue mixed in as well
when i realised the whole movie was going to be sung i started to cringe no amount of delicious hot popcorn and gallons of coke was going to keep me stuck in the seat
its the worst movie i have seen in a long long time and i have seen some shockers lately wrong as an example
as i said in the header les miserable is exactly how i felt when i walked out of the cinema after spending good money on utter rubbish
after i walked out i noticed many others quietly exiting the cinema
amazing
les misarables is a powerful story of redemption grace and love
i recommend the book abridged
hugo does go on as well as the 1998 version liam neeson is a great valjean
i could not say enough good things about this production
the performers were excellent the sets and effects were great and the direction kept things moving
if this were on the stage anne hathaways i dreamed a dream would have stopped the show
i wanted to stand a cheer
hugh jackman deftly guided us through valjeans anger anguish despair love and honor
tom hoopers decision to have the actors sing on set instead of miming a recording made the experience more emotional
wow
les misarables is seriously outstanding
seriously amazing
if this doesnt win a best picture oscar  nothing should
hugh jackman  oscar
he made me cry
anne hathaway  oscar
shemade me cry
samantha barks  oscar
she made me cry
eddie redmayne  oscar
he made me cry
and then we move onto russell crowe  if only they had enough time to reshoot  edit out  destroy all existence of him ever being near this movie
he didnt make me
think he could act or sing
the entire movie is nonstop and with them singing live while filming you can really feel the authenticity of their singing
when they move into some of the big torch song  you just want to give a standing ovation
i actually loved phantom of the opera watched it 3 times
thought id give this one a chance
after 45 minutes i shut it off
ann hathaway was just awful and hugh jackman wasnt any better
i never gave crow a chance to see if he was any better
boring boring
glad i didnt waste my time and money to see it in the theater
there was way to much singing would have been better if at least half of it were just talking
phantom was also singing when the time was right but there was half of it just speaking too
if you want to watch the story and it really is a good story watch the one with liam neison and jeffery rush excellent movie
if you have a modicum of intelligence avoid les mis
it truly is miserable
this movie is the worst movie i have seen in a very long time
russell crowe is dreadful and can not sing a note
not since pierce brosnan pierced our ears in mama mia has an actor been so badly cast
from the opening scene when the dote appears you know this is going to be a dog of a film
and thats where is remains for the entire epic
there is a reason his band is a total failure and hugh jackman and anne hathaway are not much better
this miserable piece of garbage drones on for over 2
5 hours and i resented every moment
do not see it
ever
if it gets any awards at the oscars i may never watch them again
truly awful poorly paced film adaptation of a musical
bad direction cinematography sets costumes
the miniatures of paris looked horrible
the sets looked cheap
no wonder the entire thing was shot in a series of nauseating closeups
i like hugh jackman but if this is the performance of a lifetime he may need a couple more lifetimes to make up for it
he suffered from frame one to the dismal end and so did the audience
worse was russell crowe who managed to look constipated for the entire film
and newsflash he cant sing
anne hathaway can sing but she cant act
why did they bother hiring helena bonham carter and sacha baron cohen
they did nothing but mug in ugly costumes and wigs
maybe the director thought it was a remake of sweeney todd
three perfumers stood out eddie redmayne as marius samantha barks as eponine and amanda seyfried as cosette
poor amanda seyfried
she is the best part of two of the worst musicals of all time  this one and mama mia
i watched this movie three nights ago and im generally never a big fan of musicals however considering reading many positive reviews about this movie i decided to give it a try and was hoping that it could change my perspective
it unfortunately was very disappointing and after almost three hours of singing i had enough
these songs were done by actors who clearly did not have any experience and training in singing
even simple dialogues were in songs which were very irritating considering the fact that the writer had obviously aimed for a 100 musical without any normal dialogue
it seems like a cheaply made movie consisting mostly of only a few stages which is repeated throughout the whole movie
the first scene was very eyecatching which seemed to have been designed to prevent further disappointment
even though the theatre had assigned the largest screen to this movie but it never really helped to drive my enthusiasm
the settings were always too dark and depressing
i do not recommend this movie to anyone
this film is stunning
as one who cried through most of the stage show i wondered if this would have the same effect
it did
anne hathaways i dreamed a dream is heartbreaking she did it beautifully and hugh jackmans voice is fabulous
amanda seyfried has the sweetest purest voice and eddie redmayne played a dashing marius
people had mentioned in reviews that the camera work was a little odd but i thought it conveyed the feeling of being on the stage where we tend to look directly at the person singing so i had no problem with it at all
the weakest link for me was mr crowe whose voice was poor next to the others
had he not been alongside so many fantastically strong singers it may not have been so noticeable but sadly he fell a little flat in comparison
this is my first review as i felt so strongly about it i just had to write one
go and see it
its amazing
i have never read or seen les mis before but now understand its endurance on broadway and as a classic piece of literature
this movie is more of an experience than a movie and my teen daughter and i left with much to discuss
anne hathaways performance and singing were breathtaking and i still get teary just thinking about it
the entire cast deserve academy awards in my bookevery character was believable and created a simply breathtaking performance
it is simply not possible to gush enough
bring your kleenex and prepare to be blown away
the only problem both my daughter and i noticed which was very minor were the english accents displayedfrench revolution should equal french accents non
mais oui
as someone who have seen the original musicals china premier years ago and us tour in chicago this year les misarables movie is a complete disappointment
its such a disgrace to the original musical
the singing is completely amateur and shitty sometimes even laughable
they are not even likely to enter the audition in normal situation
i gave the movie 1 star
and for those who liked it it is no more than a high school mockup play of king lear
the true masterpiece is yet to be seen
i saw people applauding at the end of the movie for a couple of seconds
at the end of the musical everyone stood up and applauded for minutes
it is my favorite musical and sorry for being sarcastic but this movie really didnt live up to it
dont get me wrong i do like musicals
but i only like musicals that have real music in them with songs that have something to do them
musicals i do like for example are the sound of music oklahoma and west side story
they all have something this movie didnt  good songs
in this movie the music was so terrible it ruined the movie
it would have been a half way decent movie if they eliminated the songs altogether and the actors just delivered their dialog without the singing the dialog to what i can only describe as droning the words
the lesson is this if you dont have good songs and people like rogers and hammerstein with the wonderful ability to write good songs dont even try to make a musical
i turned it off after a half hour
victor hugos les miserables is a wonderful story
too bad they chose to ruin it
one of the best musicals ive seen
anne heatherway is truly amazing actress amp singing i dreamed a dream made me shed some tears
her singing is beautiful amp she acted the part vert well
was very impressed with the other characters as well
very surprised at russell crows singing
who would of thought this man could sing
helena bowen carter was amazingfunny as well as sacha baron cohan
laughedcried durning this musical
i would watch this again
also made me feel for the charters amp at times had a ump in my throat as well the hairs at the back of my neck stood up
hugh jackman was very good as well incredible songs that you could sing along to
shame these actors are not on the stage
would recommend this to anyone x
this is one of the most powerful breathtaking films i have ever seen
if you havent seen this yet you need to
now
i literally cried all of the way through and all the way home in the car
anne hathaway hugh jackman and russell crowe were just brilliant and sacha baron cohen with helena bonham carter bring a brief but needed bit of humour to an otherwise heartbreaking plot
annes rendition of i dreamed a dream had me literally sobbing it was that powerful
i cant praise this film enough and cant believe the people who are giving bad reviews
please give this a chance even if you dont like musicals this is a film everyone must see
ok so i know the music never seen on stage so perhaps this is a rating that goes with the first time you see lm  1010
i was so emotional at the end i couldnt even speak and needed a very big scarf to both mop up my tears and hide my face
they will criticise some of the vocals but they are real and come from actors singing live and perhaps thats why this grips the emotions
great acting great songs and wow anne hathaway has created one of those movie scenes that joins my top ten
without a doubt this is one of the best films i have ever seen and not been this blown away since ncfom thats there to recover some shred of masculinity seeing as i have been a blubbering wreck on the way back home
this movie is simply breathtaking in its dramatic presentation of this literary masterpiece
all the actors did a fantastic job drawing us in and causing us to feel the emotions and become a part of the action
the fact that it is a musical will be a turnoff for many but this is a musical like no other where the songs here are rich and deep the plot wellcrafted the characters fully engaged and the costumes and scenery simply breathtaking
this is a movie for both men and women boys and girls
it is fun sad thrilling and contemplative all in one
i went with low expectations and was blown away by the movie
it exceeded my every expectation and is now my favourite movie of all time
it is nice to see that hollywood can produce something that doesnt depend on vulgarity and crude humour to attract their audience and can deal with the theme of redemption from a perspective that doesnt have to offend christians
loved it
my mum took me to go and see this
i was not expecting such a powerful and beautiful movie with a perfect cast
anne hathaway gave a fantastic performance and you could really see the emotion and feeling in her voice and her face
i would name all the other actors and actresses on how well they did but i would be typing for days as i left the cinemas i was a mess and so was everyone else
i can honestly not explain how amazing this movie is this has already hit the top of my favorites list and it will stay up there for many years to come guaranteed
and those who say it was horrible because it was not like the musical does that really matter
this is a masterpiece on its own and does not need to be spot on with the musical
the only problem i did have was that it is too good and did not give the other movies of 2013 a chance
please do yourself a favor and watch les miserables but make sure you bring a few boxes of tissues
this is the best film i have seen in a few years if you love the book or plays you will love this movie
i will not ruin it for anyone who reads this review and wishes to see the film but i have plans to watch it 3 more times in the future in less then a week
damn i want to watch it now i was crying through the whole thing
this movie has an a1 cast i am not a russell crowe fan at allbut in my opinion everyone who was in this film deserves an academy award i really hope they at least gets nominated for if not that would be the greatest injustice since the first futurama cancellation
my aunt has never watched the play or read the book and she was just blown away by this epic movie
first off let me preface this by saying i have never seen the stage production
having said that i was thrilled beyond belief to see this story unfold in front of me on the silver screen
as the story progressed i continued to be unnerved by the choices in camera angles framing and slow focus pulls
as a film student who knows what a challenge it is to achieve crisp focus in scenes and have had to cut great footage because it is too soft to use am embarrassed
i am baffled why the director made certain choices and i am not really sure who is at fault but it prevented me from me being able to enjoy this film
if you are not troubled by out of focus shots or cramped in your face framing then you might enjoy this film
i however expect such an esteemed director to not settle for anything less than perfection and as moviegoers we should not either
les mis was miserable
just seen les miserables and came out of it shaking with rage
how dare they reduce the greatest musical ever made to this pile of absolute s
the only bearable bits i found were russel crowe because he actually decided that acting was a good idea and eponine but even then she lacked the power and strength of voice to sing the part
if i were to pinpoint all that was wrong with the movie id be here longer than the shows been around
and hugh jackman you have no excuse
you are a musical theatre actor and you have brought shame upon yourself and your profession for your lack of vocal control meaning his huge sodding vibrato and your decision to not even bother with any acting
any halfwit can shed a tear and make his eyes water
my advice go see the musical
you wont want to tear your eyes out and plug your ears
shame on you cameron mackintosh
thought parts of this film outstanding
i wasnt enamoured by all the casting
some offered great marquee value but mediocre vocal value
hugh jackman anne hathaway and actress playing epinome were brilliant
for a musical to be turned into a film this was one of the better ones ive seen but still prefer this one live
nothing beats seeing the volume of live singers on stage singing one more day and do you hear the people sing
the film cant capture close to this
aside from that stylistically i disliked the number of close ups and found the fact that they went in and out of focus as the performer moved singing irritating
really pulled me out of the film
for fans of the musical it is spellbinding to watch les miserables finally come to life on the big screen
however for the typical movie goer or even a fan in retrospect its clear that the movie doesnt know quite what it wants to be
its a mess of gloomy gritty sequences mixed with animated silly or downright ridiculous imagery
although there are some great voices the majority of the film consists of terrible singers which feels so out of place with all of the great instrumental
mix in some awkward unbelievable cgi long shots and strange uncomfortable camera angles and now we have the les mis movie and we arent going to get a new one any time soon
however the film is better than most of the movie musicals that we get
and at the end of the day les mis is like pizza
even when its done poorly its still pretty good
please take this advice before viewing the turgid nonsense that is les miserables
this effort makes miss saigon look like the wackiest comedy ever
i have honestly never seen such a depressing sight since my last tax demand
hopefully everyone concerned with this production was offered counselling
by the time javert decided to end it all by jumping into the swirling waters i was on my feet ready to push him
director tom hooper should have told young daniel huttlestone  gavroche  that he was no longer playing a part in oliver
his cockney accent in the middle of paris was ridiculous
stone the russell crowes guv
you wouldnt adam and eve it hope anyone who viewed this in the cinema went on orange wednesday 2 for 1
at least this would be a small compensation
with so many talented actorsingers in this world why make a movie with people who cannot sing
sorry but the point of a musical is music with singing so why cast actors who struggle to carry off each and every song
performance crimes of weak voices flat voice and parodies of emotion
i am perplexed by the praises but the majority always perplexes me in their choices
i put this in the same barrel of rotten apples with the nauseating sweeney todd starring boring over used johnny depp
how sad that in the pursuit of comedy they overcooked the master of the feast characters and scene to the point of not funny
yes talented people they may be but not for a musical
like the comedian who longs to do a serious role and the serious actor who longs to make em laugh are these wanna be frustrated musical actors
no just actors who cannot sing carry a tune or have any power of performance of voice
guess this is another movie fad
put rotten singers in musicals
my opinion dont waste your money or time
i remember seeing a professional theater company puton les miserables in the early 90s
it was a romp of a performance and production
the music numbers came back to life with the movie
this new movie lit up my memory and although i commend the actors for giving their best in singing none of them save amanda seyfried are very good
so what does that suggest
well here is a musical without good singing so its not really recommended
the production was enhanced fairly competently by computer generated backgrounds and i especially liked the introductory scenes however as im sure is already noted the movie runs and runs and
it feels like 180 min vice 150
anyway if you liked the play this may be worth a watch and listen despite its execution to judge for yourself
although i had never seen les mis before i was very eager to see the movie
i do like musicals and it looked like a very good story as well
i absolutely loved the music and how passionate the performances were by the actors
i actually liked the fact that the majority of the film was sung
it brought a certain emotion to it that simply cant be felt by talking
the story was very touching and it was a joy to see the transformation of jean valjean
it was amazing to see that he could go from a prisoner with nothing to a man who changes his life and becomes a father to a young girl who is in desperate need
i would recommend this movie to everyone
it is definitely worth watching
yes the script is respectful both to the novel and to the stage show which is no mean feat but as a movie and a musical
positive reviews to this
have people lost their hearing
arrangements and direction are dreadful
lack of good support crying and muttering destroy most performances
only samantha barks sounds decent
hugh jackman tries his best but his amateurish singing
how could his bring him home stay in the movie
eddie redmayne makes nick jonas  earnest and likable marius with mediocre nasal voice  sound like michael ball
there are many great fantines ruthie henshall maybe the best
anne hathaway however is irritating
yes as a tortured dying prostitute fantine has reason to cry and moan but this is  wait for it  musical
hathaway won oscar because the academy likes to see lot of drab ugly movies about human suffering that makes true art
true art looks crap sounds crap is crap
no its not crap
just worst musical i have ever heard
having only seen one previous film version 1935ish i am delighted to report this version is enthralling and moving
plan to bring kleenex
my husband has had no experience with either book or film version and had only a mild problem with following the story line
if anyone is planning to go without any previous experience with this story such as my husband my suggestion is to allow the story to lead and the main story line will make sense
music is extraordinarily moving actors portray the emotions of the specific scenes exquisitely and the background scenery allows the one viewing the film to feel and be involved
so many times background scenes maim or injure the believability of the film but this movie background does not
i was so engrossed in the film i found myself leaning forward and having lost all tract of time
the movie is fantastic
its a little sad that the movie is so significantly better than the play
i did not really know what the heck was going on when i saw the play
and the music is good in the play but in the film everything is so vivid up close and i know i should be shot for saying this
but i actually liked the way anne hathaway sang i dreamed a dream better than patty lapone
something about the way anne hathaway sang it more personal and emotionally connected than the theater version patty lapone sings just made it so great
and all the characters are so much more tangible
sacha b cohen is perfect with helena b carter
hugh jackman deserves an oscar
the other actors were amazing too
cosette young
totally adorable amp older amanda s marius eddie r aponine samantha barks even russel crowe all of them were wonderful
if you like musicals this to me is a brilliant combination of film and theater
love it
cant wait to see more like this
les miserables is the best movie ive seen this year as great as the broadway show was the film is better more action the closeups
etc the cast is excellent hugh jackman should receive an oscar for his performance as should anne hathawy wonderful performances russell crowe is excellent as well though his voice doesnt stand up to the others auduence broke out in applause several times rare in a nj theater after hathaways moving performance  i dreamed a dream  and master of the house  sascha cohen  helen bonham carter hysterical and for hugh jackmans performance of bring him homeat the end received a standing ovation
long yes 3 hrs never boring not a bad moment in film beautifully directed by tom holland and photographed
the most satisfying film ive seen this year  and there are many good films this yr note glad colm wilkinson broadways original jean val jean was included in a small part as the preacher
ot to be missed
based on the broadway musical hit with a cast of excellent actors you get a magnificent version of victor hugos book which conveys the history violence poverty revolution and rebellion and different human personalities  the maternal love the conviction of the revolutionary youth the opportunism of the scoundrels that exploit poverty to abuse of the wretched the repentant prisoner the unjust and discriminatory legal system and the hard and difficult time of the french revolution that completely changed the course of contemporary history
a masterpiece of hugo complemented by extraordinary music that resembles more to a wagner opera the leitmotifs that identify the characters and events great costumes continuous singing permanent drama that a film
a grim and harsh atmosphere of the big city paris and french villages where the action happens with a camera focused particularly on the gestures and expressions of the characters is human comedy at its best or rather the human tragedy
les miserables is my favorite musical and i thought the movie was great and the casting was spot on
i must admit that i was very skeptical of the cast when announced but they were superb
anne hathaways performance of fantine was definitely oscar worthy and exceeded my expectations or her acting capabilities
i am now a true fan
hugh jackman was brilliant in the role of jean valjean showing both strength and humility in this role
this movie possessed all the qualities youd want in a film great acting strong storyline amazing cinematography evokes a variety of emotions and more
all i can say is well done to the entire crew for this production
truly a class act
im an old cinemamaniac and imho this is one of the three best movies ever made
hugos masterpiece novel do read it shines through enlightening and brightly illuminating the human soul
the music and lyrics from the best musical ive seen were hauntingly memorable beyond any previous film  including west side story  and the cinematography is quite without parallel
a total ten  only because there wasnt a higher rating available
hooper should have gotten best director award but the critics are without much taste at times
good example back in the 1960s was phillipe de brocas king of hearts alan bates amp genvieve bujold which got next to nothing in terms of awards but ran in some theaters for many many years
also les miserables 1995c
lelouch with jean paul belmondo
was a true masterpiece but only some precious few critics saw that
i for one loved this film
i came with a fresh mind keeping out the stage production which i have seen in the west end
the reason i did this is because unlike some people i knew it wasnt going to be the same just seemed obvious to me
this film was well paced and told the whole story in general well lots of people have complained about russel and okay he doesnt have the best voice but he has a better voice than pierce brosnan in mama mia
and plus he fits the role well as well as being a big actor to try and get more people to go and see the film
in short it is a good film 810 acting 810 singing 1010 for the sets and overall looks
and yes it does give you goose pimples at the end just like the show
i have seen the stage version of les misarables and must say the movie version has taken it to a whole new level
it is absolutely amazing the way they took it from the stage to the big screen
the uprising of the lower class reminded me of a modern occupy movement that the misarables stated we are not going to take it anymore
it has all the elements of a good story a love interest jealously and a clash to the death
hugh jackman as jean valjean carried this film and did a top job
it was funny to see russell crowe sing as that is a role i usually dont think of him in but he did it
anne hathaway as fantine did well but amanda seyfriend emotions ran through
i totally did not expect to see sacha baron carter whose role as thanadier was a caricature of his normal self
take a visit to old france and fall in love with les misarables this is sure to become a modern classic
this was an amazing movie
for me what made it so interesting was how difficult it must have been to act and sing at the same time with a camera right up front
russell crowe was perfect in the part of javert and had a great baritone voice
the opening scene when they were pulling the ship into the dry dock was really cool imagine what it must have been like to build ships in those days
hugh jackman toiling in the bottom of the dry dock reminded me of ben hur in the guts of the roman galleon
it was hard to believe that these actors were not professional singers they were all so great
the scenes in paris were recreated extremely well
i can just imagine what the barricades must have been like
i guess my favourite song was by samantha barks who played aponine
i must admit i am biased toward anything french having grown up in quabec
where would we be without descartes and fourier
in this cinematic operatic production of victor hugos ma gnus opus there is beautiful color superb acting and grand singing
the poor miserable and destitute people of earlyeighteenthcentury france are depicted well
hugh jackman came across well as the horribly mistreated jean valjean and russell crowe was definitely cruel heartless and horrible as the mean officer javert
anne hathaway made you sympathize with her in her role as the anemic mother of cosette and the little cosette was a heartstealer and you cant do anything but feel love and sympathy for her because of the mistreatment of her by the thenadiers it was easy to fall in love with her when she became a girl of roughly twenty years of age
while i did like the singing it maybe made the movie comical in places
but again it maintained my attention well and is bound to be one of universals most outstanding productions
i have never reviewed a movie on imdb before but after seeing all the positive reviews i did see some other reviews that agreed with mine but they were in the minority i needed to write one
this movie is awful
do not make hollywood actors sing when they cannot
a musical should be with good singers and good songs and good music
this great story has been ruined by the musical format using hollywood actors
this is a story that requires dialog and there is no need to sing every single line  it makes no sense
i heard the broadway show was good and i am sure it was but this movie is pretentious tedious and i could barely sit through it
of note the previous les miserable starring lieam neeson and geoffrey rush was awesome
if you have not seen that rent it instead if you have see it again  avoid this version at all costs
just watched les misarables
i am not the type who loves musicals but this movie just went all the way up to the top of the list of best movies of all times
i cried from beginning to end
no i did not just get emotional i cried huge and heavy tears
not only the movie was beautifully done but hugh jackman and anne hathaway had the performances of a lifetime
they both deserve the oscars
hugh jackman showed how an actor can reach deeply into his soul and bring out feelings that are so intense that they are able to truly touch the souls of those on the other side of the screen
no words i say can do justice to his performance
i thought the constant singing throughout this film was awful
i was expecting some dialogue without the cast singing and singing badly
the film had all the makings for an amazing film so its such a shame that someone decided to be quirky and different and sing the whole film through
the story was a brilliant story the cinematography was the best ive seen the actors acted brilliantly
i was expecting it to be somewhat like sweeney todd and have singing moments now and again
i didnt even get to finishing watching the entire film as i left with 30 minutes to go as i was cringing with embarrassment for some of the actors awful voices that they must hate when listening back to just like everyone else in the world with a good sense of hearing
rather see the film with jean gabin
this musicalfilm is awful
eventhe composer decided what style he wanted to use
mixed noise i not really consider it music actors without singing skills
they really cant sing
uhhh my ears
ehh
its wasting time see this
and is it nominated for  oscars
it tells more than enough about the academy
and imdb wants ten lines from me to review this horrible thing
ok i read the book saw about three different films from the story
and my conclusion is never ever will see this again
and never ever buy the dvd or blueray
tehre were times when there were good musicals
this is not one from them
the entire movies was sung and quite horribly by some of the actors
in several recent successful musical to theater translations the directors have done a great job of adapting the playmusical while retaining the integrity of a movie
after a bout a half hour of nothing but singing at times too quickly to understand the lyrics leavings gaps in the storyline if you have not seen the playmusical
this is simply a filming of a musical with better sets
5 minutes in i was ready to leave
simply put if you want to see les mis go see the musical
if you want to see a translation of les mis into a movie wait 20 years for a remake
2stars because great storyline
this story is one of broadways most popular musicals yet the three main actors jackman hathaway and crowe were horribly miscast
why on earth the producerdirector opted to go with nonprofessional singers is a mystery to us all other then the drawing power of jackman and crowe
hathaway was the worst and out of her element and league
how sad that what might have been a hollywood classic for the ages will die a quick and slow death
do not look for this film to garner a great many nominations much less an oscar although the only category an oscar may be extended to is the cinematography  but even that was cgid to death
you want good cgi
go see the hobbit
you want to see les mis as a remarkable musical with songs sung by incredible voices
go see it on broadway
this movie is simply wonderful an astonishing movie
as a reader of the original victor hugos novel i found that the movie is a true reproduction of the original one very touching impressive
anne hathaway as fantine brought tears in my eyes extremely afraid after spitting on jean valjean  incredible performance and incredible talent
jean valjean the innocent prisoner  the one who feel the injustice as he was jailed just because he stole a piece of bread to feed his hunger also an incredible performance from hugh jackman
finally the unique performance of russell crowe the aggressive stonehearted javert who think he is serving god and justice with his rigid cruelty look
the movie deserve not only 10 points bit 20 or even 100 points
jean valjean known as prisoner 24601 is released from prison and breaks parole to create a new life for himself while evading the grip of the persistent inspector javert
set in postrevolutionary france the story reaches resolution against the background of the june rebellion
hugh jackman and anne hathaway give 2 amazing stand out performances the same goes for russell crowe and this is without a doubt the best musical since sweeney todd theres a little bit of actual dialogue but the biggest part of the film is songs and the movie is really heart breaking especially the ending and i will definitely give it a 10 out of 10
my cousin showed me a very nice film  i cried very much liked me i would recommend a period our souls in this i am glad that you are anonymous movie paylaao my house my motherin law rented we re home of his uncle ibiza care was now safe in the apartment site our pool you have bestowed more beautiful to those who ask god  gt mia mate hugh jack man god drew you to catapult him very comfortable very successful bi i pray for our brothers drew so much i explained to him in the film itself already has in itself already something like this was a man valle what you would expect to get halal i say shame on stores adviser my friend to everyone come a little mia from germany gekd hacks until
this is the one of musical movies
some people dont like musical movies but actually i like that
some people says singing suddenly is very strange and i agree with that but i dont care about that so much because the songs characters sing shows their feeling so well
in this movie all dialog is in songs so its a little bit different than usual musical movies
one thing i want to say is the way to shoot this movie is very fantastic
when people shoot musical movies before the shooting starts actors record songs and they move their mouth without singing when they shoot
but this movie takes different way
actors put ear monitor on and sing with listening only piano
actors sing the way they want to sing so they can act and sing very naturally
so actors in this movies have great and wonderful skills
this movie shows a view of the les miserables world so well
we can enjoy everything about les miserables same as the play
the well known story of les miserables as a musical this time for me it failed to deliver
the amazing cast and the beautiful shots and sequences of the revolution and the struggles that people had to endure are overshadowed by the failure the keep the interest high throughout the movie
the songs focus mainly on the drama but they do get boring especially for someone who doesnt love musicals but just wanted to see what all the buzz was about
the performances were splendid although for me having the con couple act as the comical part of the film felt out of place and sometimes ridiculous
so 3 out of 10
this movie was the first musical i ever watched and it made me love the musicals
cast plays really well although it is not easy to sing and play at the same time
hugh jackman russell crowe anne hathaway and the other cast are successful on that
i got the emotions clearly while watching the movie
of course victor hugo author of the book les miserables played an important role in beauty of the movie because the book is one of the best
while i was watching the movie i remembered the book that i read almost 15 years ago
i perceived the same feelings after 15 years and that made me really happy
the movie tells the virtues of french revolution in a touchy manner
vivre la france
