"\nRyan Gosling's at his best in dramatic roles and there's no exception\nhere. As things unravel - that happens quickly thanks to the intense\nplot - Gosling decides that his ambitions are so important that he'll\nbe willing willing to lose his soul. George Clooney has a very strong\nappeal, he's very convincing, his acting being almost perfect. \"Ides of\nMarch\" has very few flaws, the twists in the plot are not predictable\nand overall doesn't have any problems connecting with the viewers.\nEventually, though there's no character to empathize with, the audience\nhas the impression of a notable film noir, challenging us to come to\nterms with what politics is nowadays. I've seen intelligent filmmaking\nand a provocative moral fable.\n"
"\nWell we see George Clooney play himself yet again. There is no real\nacting talent at all and the plot is thin an weak. Ryan Gosling, on the\nother hand does put in a credible performance as his aid. Ryan finds\nhimself caught between a rock and a hard place however it is not enough\nto save this very average film. The way in which the dirty side of\npolitics is portrayed is given some credence here and that may be its\nsaving grace.<br><br>By the time the end of the film had rolled around I was bored and then\nto see this long shot of Ryans face hiding the anguish due to his\nactions was really quite pathetic. I wondered if the director had run\nout of ideas and was trying to make the drama stronger with this quite\nsilly closing shot.<br><br>If you are really bored, have nothing at all better to do then it might\nbe worth a look but really you would have to be at your wits end to see\nthis film.\n"
"\nSorry, but this one clunked from beginning to end. <br><br>Let's start with the plot. Idealistic staffer for presidential\ncandidate is tempted to the other side. Then a silly girl suicides\nbecause her lover, the candidate, disappoints her. One is tempted to\nask what she expected, especially as she's from a political family and\nis also a staffer for the same candidate: hasn't she heard of Monica?\nThen candidate denies having known her, to the great disappointment of\nMr Idealist. Again, what did he expect? <br><br>Acting? It's OK, but I never found myself caring for a single moment\nwhat happened to any of the characters, not Mr Idealist, not the silly\ngirl, and certainly not presidential candidate Clooney, whose only\npolicy seemed to be some ridiculous waffle about renewable energy.<br><br>I was bored about two minutes after this started and it never got any\nbetter. Just totally unconvincing from beginning to end.\n"
"\nI can't believe I watched it, The plot I didn't get and the ending was\nan anti climax. I suppose its a good mirror of how politicians are 2\nfaced. Really struggling to come up with 10 lines here to review this\nmovie as it does not have many redeeming points about it and I don't\nwant to give the plot away. I suppose I watched the movie thinking\nabout where it was going and how it would end.. and it ended with?\nwhat?!! no idea. I suppose in the states people might be kinder about\nthis movie, but I think it lacked all imagination or originality. Its\nas if it were a copy/paste story from Clinton era with a slight twist.\nI did not think George C. did himself any favours with this movie.\n"
"\nThe non-American individual is always a bit lost when it comes to US\nelections, and The Ides of March is pretty much no exception to the\nrule.<br><br>The script suffers from a certain difficulty for the uninformed viewer\nto fully understand what is at stake and the little aspects of that big\nmachinery. Therefore, the plot loses a lot of interest and we find\nourselves enduring this succession of unclear scenes. Moreover, the\nmessage that one manages to get from the scenario has been used many\ntimes: politics is a crooked world where the personal interest comes\nbefore the general. Not revolutionary whatsoever.<br><br>The characters could also have used more development and depth. Even\nso, the cast did quite honorably except perhaps Gosling that lacked\nemotions, which is the case sometimes for him.\n"
"\nWhy doesn't this film scratch the surface? We never learn much about\nMorris the politician outside of campaign offices, and the sidelines at\na few events leading up to a primary: we don't know what kind of\npolitician he is even *supposed* to be, and we don't know what the\nGosling's idealistic campaign manager really believes in. Clooney\nappears to have been content to rely on recent events to develop the\ncharacter of an Obama-like liberal rather than to develop the story of\na career both on the verge and in jeopardy, and it isn't much of an\nemotional letdown for us when we learn the truth about Morris. The\nstory does well with the machinations in and between campaign offices,\nwith good performances by Gosling, Giamatti, and Seymour-Hoffman, but\nthere is not much in the way of political reality here.\n"
"\nI went into this movie with great expectations; too bad. Ides of March\nis noise signifying nothing. I expected more from George Clooney.\nHollywood likes Ryan Gossling. He'd better hope that they don't start\nto like him too much because when they do they start to put you in\ngarbage like this. Ides of March should have been a great political\nthriller, but instead we get a predictable movie that telegraphs all of\nits intentions and leaves you empty. I guess George has become cynical\nabout politics and I guess I can't blame him based on the current\nsituation. I guess I can understand why more people haven't flocked to\nthis movie. My husband fell asleep on the first half and I was angry\nafter the second half. The movie should have left you with something to\nthink about like Michael Clayton but it didn't; too bad.\n"
"\nOh Dear! Considering the amount of talent involved in making this it's\na real disappointment. A dull story about characters I couldn't care\nless about doing things I wasn't interested in. It's the old chestnut\nabout American politics being a dirty business and how no one can be\ntrusted and all the double dealing and manipulating that goes on. It's\nbeen done before and better with films like 'The Best Man'and\n'Bulworth'. Many of the characters seem to have been drawn from every\npolitical stereotype and none of them seems very believable, and Marisa\nTomei's cartoon styled journalist belonged in something like 'The\nSimpsons'. For fans ofthe particpants only I'm afraid.\n"
"\nI understand that movies are the willing suspension of disbelief, but\nIdes of March asks for WAY too much suspension. I have worked on dozens\nof campaigns and I have never seen less energy in a headquarters. I\nhave never seen less passion in a candidate, a manager or a volunteer.\nWhat was George Cloony running for? Coroner? During a hard fought\ncampaign, the staff fits in a meal when they can and sleeps for a few\nhours if possible. Except for that, they have no life.<br><br>All of the problems of the campaign were handled in the worst possible\nway. The idea that this was an actual presidential campaign was\ncompletely unbelievable. <br><br>It was like watching a baseball movie in which the greatest player of\nall time didn't know which end of the bat to hold.\n"
"\nOK but not the best political thriller I've ever seen.<br><br>The idea is to show how politics corrupts an idealistic political\nactivist on the campaign trail. Ryan Gosling plays this character. He\nis a young talent but naive and at first easily wrong-footed by the\nmore experienced Machiavellians around him. Until he has an affair with\nan intern, gets caught up in things and becomes just like them...<br><br>It's not exactly an original idea for a political movie and the plot\ndoesn't race along as quickly as I'd like. But again, it's OK. There\nare plenty of heavy-hitting actors in here that put in good\nperformances - Clooney, Giamatti and Seymour Hoffman all play their\nroles well.<br><br>Worth a watch.\n"
"\nFilms and television shows about politicians all make the same mistake:\nthey focus on what we all assume goes on behind the scenes in politics,\nand what we end up with is a predictable non-story. Netflix's\npretentious House of Cards is another example. The characters are\ncorrupt and scheming, leaving no one for an audience to sympathize\nwith. No wonder nobody trusts Washington. This film seems to suggest we\nshould accept and expect dishonest showboating instead of realistic,\nhonest political discussion. This film did nothing more for me than\nremind me of why I generally don't vote. I was hoping for something\nexciting, as the title's reference to Julius Caesar suggested, but no;\nit's just boring, political scheming, which, at best, falls flat as a\nfilm. The production and performances were great, but the story gave me\nnothing to care about.\n"
"\n\"The Ides of March\", directed by George Clooney, was a bland and\nuninvolved watch. The focus of the movie is glitzy political schtick.\nIt feels like it has little substance or meat to it. It reminded me of\n\"Charlie Wilson's War\" - another movie with many capable actors but\nwith a vapid preachy story. Clooney here clearly uses political dialog\nand banter for his own slant on things which may or may not be\nagreeable, but the atmosphere is trite and like a television drama. How\nmany times, do we have to watch \"news channels\" set up in movies to\nsome how validate authenticity. (spoilers) While none of the acting is\nreally poor, there's little to say, and a dumb open-ended ending sort\nof leaving me wonder - OK, what was all that supposed to be? Not\nRecommended. Note Clooney himself in the movie is curiously aloof\nsupposedly a warm politician ringing phony.\n"
"\nWell, it was a good film, a good production.<br><br>The story has some ups and downs with somewhat expected turns of\nevents. The editing was solid and timing of the events - in spite of\nbeing easily foreseeable - was certainly in line with the flow. The\nScript was above average; there were a few forced metaphors though.\nBut, all in all, it was well structured production with a fluent flow\nof events and it achieves what it wants to convey in an orderly\nfashion.<br><br>However, real achievement within this movie, is how the acting of Ryan\nGosling outshines through all the other great actors like Philip\nSeymour Hoffman, Paul Giamatti and even George Clooney. Even though\nRyan Gosling is certainly accepted as a great actor now, it is clear\nthat he is destined for much more than what he has already achieved.\n"
"\nNonsense political garbage. Don't bother the acting isn't even good 2d\ncharacters.<br><br>I don't need to write a great deal about it because it isn't worth it.\nI mean Clooney liberal loon is enough to know what is going to happen.\nOf course he isn't a \"bad guy\" ridiculous.<br><br>Typical stereotyping, even down to the \"Arkansas\" Gov. With sex and\ninterns thrown in too. As if the last Arkansas Gov turned President had\nany honor.<br><br>Acting was weak, plot sucked and by mid movie it was an emotional\nHollywood fantasy \"human character\" hack job. The movie just falls\napart totally. I suppose if you are a Democrat drone you may enjoy the\nlies and propaganda that Clooney spouts off about same old tired\nnonsense. However didn't expect more glad I got it at redbox for a\ndollar.\n"
"\nNo need to watch this one. Despite a magnificent cast, their talents go\nwasted in a movie that simply will not pick up. We don't get\nsympathetic to any of the characters, and considering how low real live\npoliticians have fallen these days, what Clooney brings on the governor\nseems so harmless. There are at least 5 better presidential candidate\nmovies out there shot long before \"Ides of March\". Forget this one,\nwatch \"Damages\" or \"The Wire\" and get a bigger thrill and 10 times more\ninsight into the human psyche. Of course we already know that wanna be\ncandidates give up all their principles for power, no new revelations\nfor the audience here. ANd the \"Governor's\" speeches were pretty lame\ntoo. First thought after the movie ended was \"BORING!\"\n"
"\nGood, but not great. Interesting, but not profound. I was expecting\nMachiavellian machinations, but this is pretty tame by Mr Machiavelli's\nstandards. <br><br>Plot (co-written by George Clooney) is OK, though there are a few\nmoments which are portrayed to be of great import, but make you think\n\"So what?\". So there is a feeling of contrivance. (You also wonder if\nthe plot isn't simply a platform for Clooney's political beliefs...)<br><br>George Clooney's direction is solid. Movie moves along quite\neffortlessly and doesn't drift. Pacing is consistent.<br><br>Good performances from an all-star cast: Ryan Gosling, George Clooney,\nPhilip Seymour Hoffman, Paul Giamatti, Evan Rachel Wood, Marisa Tomei.\nRyan Gosling has a talking role, for once.\n"
"\nThe Ides of March is refreshing since it doesn't shy away from\nrevealing people's true selves despite their insecurities and flaws.\nThe movie showcases people as people, in their glory and sorrow, and it\nconjures up an interesting twist on the drama that is politics. <br><br>The casting is strong with leads Ryan Gosling and George Clooney who\nfall right into their charactersalthough I can't say the film was\nparticularly moving. The plot is also fairly bland, except for a few\nscenes, and follows a scandal and the members surrounding a potential\nPresidential candidate. Despite having great actors/actresses, this\nmovie simply fails to impress on any specific emotional or\nentertainment level. It meanders a few contentious topics and has\nsurprising moments but ultimately left me untouched after 101 minutes. <br><br>Nonetheless, the film is worth the watch. An arguably important concept\nin our lives is the state and its affairs, and a look at its\nunderpinnings is worthwhile. Hopefully you can take away more from it\nthan I did.\n"
"\nA clever and thought-provoking film that will appeal to an intelligent\naudience, although probably won't have enough action for those watching\nit just for the pretty faces of Messrs Reynolds and Clooney. Both men\nact their sock off here, as does Seymour Hoffman, in this gripping but\ndepressing tale of an idealist corrupted by his surroundings. That the\nidealist becomes what he hates in order to achieve his ideals is a\ndamning condemnation of the world of politics, and will probably\nprovoke American viewers with its implications about the American\npolitical system.<br><br>Some very memorable moments for me - the last shot; close up on Ryan's\nface and the conflict he feels - brilliantly played. Also the silent\nshot of a car as we wait for a conversation we can't hear to end, and\nSeymour Hoffman's face (and posture) when he gets out of the car. Risky\ndirecting choices that most definitely paid off. Overall, some\nseriously good actors do a cerebral story justice. An hour and a half\nwell spent in my view. Watch it.\n"
"\nIf you're in love with politics, maybe you'll find the movie\ninteresting. In short, the plot is slow to develop and once developed,\nthe plot immediately begins to fizzle. While the cast, characters, and\nacting were well done, the story left me wishing that I had chosen a\ndifferent activity or at least a different movie for the night. <br><br>Aside from the time I spent waiting for a plot to develop, the next\nwast of my evening is coming up with ten lines to write. Again, if you\nlove politics, maybe you'll find the interpersonal relations and the\ntwist of deeds entertaining. The movie does to a fine job of displaying\nhow diabolical a campaign and the game for power can became.\n"
"\nGeorge Clooney seems like a cool guy, but he didn't choose a very good\ntopic for a movie. The very definition of politics is doing whatever\nyou need to to come out on top, and nobody is surprised that it's what\nthis movie is about. Oh, somebody had an affair? Somebody went behind\ntheir coworkers' backs? Eh, just a day in the life of a politician. It\nwas honestly a very boring and predictable plot and the \"drama\" of the\nmovie was incredibly forced and unnatural. At one point Ryan Gosling\ninvited Evan Rachel Wood into his office, gives her a piece of paper he\nwrote on, asks for it back and tells her to leave. How can any of that\nbe considered important to any part of the movie? *sigh* It had a good\ncast, but very little else was memorable.\n"
"\nIt started out as a film about the process of campaigning in America.\nBut in the last minutes it turns into a regular thriller, with a\ndisgruntled character blackmailing the powerful person. <br><br>I guess the message is supposed to be that the process is so corrupting\nthat a clean-cut, square-jawed, idealistic person could turn into a\ntroll. However, the way the movie played it out, it was simply a\ndisgruntled employee blackmailing his former employer. That's it!<br><br>The idealistic person got tricked by his opponent, which caused him to\nget fired. In retaliation, he blackmailed his former employer using\ninformation he inadvertently received to get the top job.<br><br>That's it! <br><br>The only politics in the movie is there just to provide flavoring. <br><br>It's not a \"politics\" movie, it's just a regular thriller.\n"
"\nImagine a thriller category movie without a car chase, guns, bombs,\nplots to destroy the world. Difficult isn't it? and yet that is what we\nhave in The Ides of March a thriller that is tight, intelligent and\nrewarding. It exceeded my expectations even though my experience with\nGeorge Clooney films has given me high expectations.<br><br>The plot twists and turns like a New Zealand country road. Just when\nyou think you know what is to happen, something else happens and yet\nall of the twists ring true. Some are red herrings. We suspect people\nof having agendas when they do not, we discover agendas where none were\nsuspected.<br><br>In the end we are totally blown away, but even that makes perfect\nsense.<br><br>The writing is superb but the cast totally delivers without a false\nnote.<br><br>Just watch, and experience. You will not see politics as usual again.<br><br>In a word, Brilliant.\n"
"\nSeldom do you get to see a film that has such brilliant content. From\nthe seamless direction to the flawless acting, this film is all about\nthe politics of politics. It's great when you see such potential in a\ncommercial movie.<br><br>The reference to Ides of March, the monumental date marked in history\nas the murder of Julius Caesar by a group of conspirators, is made by\nshowing the election campaign of Governor of Pennsylvania, Mike Morris\nplayed by George Clooney.<br><br>Gosling plays the part of his Junior Campaign Manager Stephen Meyers\nwho is working under Senior Campaign Manager Paul Zara (Phillip Seymour\nHoffman). The plot unfolds in a very suave manner and you will be on\nthe edge of your seat from start to finish until you run into a\ncompletely unbelievable ending.\n"
"\nI'm not a Clooney fan, so maybe I'm biased (hey, I liked Batman!), but\nthis sucked. It really wasn't much more than drivel, and unoriginal\ndrivel at that.<br><br>If the intention was to make the viewer creeped out by politicians,\nthen I guess mission successful! If the intention was to make a good\nmovie that was thought-provoking - please try again. Well, actually,\nplease don't.<br><br>None of the characters were remotely endearing. The content was lacking\nand the acting wasn't strong.<br><br>I can't recommend this. Even if you're a political junkie, it's ho-hum.<br><br>For lack of a better term, it just made me feel icky afterwards.<br><br>Watch Margin Call instead.\n"
"\nThe acting is great, as one would expect from Clooney and Gosling. I\ndon't think I have much to say about acting.<br><br>However the story is a little bit dull. I was looking for more action.\nI mean it did start as if it was going to be a capturing tale, but\nsomehow after Stephen learned the truth about the intern, the story\nbecame really dull and slow-paced. I felt like the resolution was too\nfast, the story dissolved very quickly at the end. I was also expecting\nmore from the climax - there was something missing there. Ultimately, I\nam not satisfied. I have not read the original play, so I don't know\nhow the adaptation is but I can't help saying that the story feels\nunfinished. I had very high expectations before seeing the movie for\nsome reason, so I was quite disappointed.\n"
"\nYawn. Political \"thriller\" was about as thrilling as watching someone\nelse watch paint dry.<br><br>Avoid at all costs unless you like the West Wing, and even then, like\nit slowed down to a snail's pace.<br><br>There's no character development. The main character is portrayed as\npolitically naive and yet manages to play the scandal in his favour\nousting someone who has many years more experience.<br><br>Just not believable or enjoyable at all. Steer clear.<br><br>I'm finding it hard to write anything at all good to pad this review\nout to the required 10 lines.\n"
"\nSyriana, Michael Clayton and now Ides of March: George Clooney likes\ndead-serious stuff. Dead-serious plots with dead-serious characters\ndead-seriously leading us to a dead-serious conclusion. It seems some\npeople find this clever but it's mostly boring - and quite depressing\ntoo. There is more life in a Nespresso commercial.<br><br>Sadly I'm not even exaggerating, George Clooney is boring us stiff with\nhis heavy-handed paintings of our cynical world where Evil will crush\nIdealists and all the naive and innocent people. We can only take so\nmuch if it would only turn into a mind-boggling story. Ha, but no. His\nstories are just unoriginal to begin with and they just bleed it up to\na big pessimistic fatalistic ending. \"What else could have happened?\"\n"
"\nIf you're not into politics big time, than this will seem to you like a\ncollection of people - politicians - that are very preoccupied with\ntheir own selves, and that think that the rest of the world must be in\nawe with them as well. The bombastic crook type. They talk so much\nunrealistic (so I wouldn't call it stupid) philosophy, that doesn't\napply to pretty much anyone on planet Earth. Silly ! Nobody was\nactually likable to me in the movie except for Clooney, he's been\naround long enough to be able to pull something reasonable out of it.\nHe was the only one that seemed legit to me, the only character that\nhad some degree of stucture and humanity. Ryan Gosling played his part\nlike he just descended from \"Fracture\", he did exactly the same type of\ncharacter. Booooring !!!! It's time to change a few things if you want\nto stay ahead, Ryan.\n"
"\nI thought this was going to be interesting, or exciting, maybe intense\nand it was none of those things for the first HOUR. Unbelievably\ntalented cast - Clooney, Giamatti, Tomei and even the great character\nactor Greg Itzin. The most thrilling of which to watch on screen was\nthe never-disappointing Phillip Seymore Hoffman. I spent a buck-thirty\non my rental, and I kind of want my buck back. The story is about a\nvery left-wing Democrat, running against another Democrat for\nPresident. His true-believer campaign speech writer is offered a\nposition with the competitor's campaign. These leads to an unfortunate\nseries of events which makes him seek revenge. The revenge plot doesn't\nreally start up until 3/4 of the way through the movie. Too slow and\nvague for my tastes. Found my mind wandering. Wanting to get up and do\nother stuff. Ryan Gosling unfortunately could not hold my attention. I\nvery much hope other people enjoyed this movie, but I just couldn't\nstay interested. Although I did stick with it until the uneventful\nending.\n"
"\nSimply put, this movie was extremely boring. It took forever to get off\nit's feet, only to grab your interest for about ten minutes, then falls\nflat at the finish. There is no deep meaning in this movie, it was just\nboring. The characters lacked depth, the story was full of holes, and\njust about everything remains unresolved at the end. Terrible.<br><br>The only redeeming quality of this film, and simply the reason I gave\nit 2 stars was the acting was very good. However, no amount of great\nacting will save an otherwise flat and boring story that fails to\ninstill any excitement in the audience. One recommendation to the\nscreen-writer, excessive uses of the \"F\"-word, when unnecessary, only\ndetracts from the story.\n"
"\nApparently this movie is highly nerve-racking &amp; very enticing. <br><br>The work of art show cased by Ryan Gosling is remarkably outstanding.\nHis plain faced reactions make it obvious that politics is dirty\nbusiness &amp; not for the saints. <br><br>I had this movie in my watch list for quite a long time &amp; having seen\nit finally made me realize how competitive it gets between Democrats &amp;\nRepublicans in the United States.<br><br>Its a decent watch for those that adore politics &amp; want to consider\ntaking Public Relations as their college majors. <br><br>Personally, after following the recent elections, I was compelled to\nwatch this movie &amp; boy I'm glad of this wonderful decision. <br><br>Although, at certain point I kind'a grew a certain dislike for the\ncharacter played by George Clooney. <br><br>Nevertheless, a worthy flick.\n"
"\nThe Ides of March starring Ryan Gosling and George Clooney. Though many\nof the trailers have been quite misleading once watching the film. This\nis Ryan Gosling's film (as the clear lead), he is enthralling as the PR\nman who, despite his shrewdness, is blinded by the boss's charm.\nThrough the film, soon enough, the bombshell drops and it's lead\nactress (Evan Rachel Wood). Trouble is, she just happens to be the girl\nwho Gosling has been getting cozy with. The pace quickens as he weighs\nup his loyalties to the governor and the girl, as well as getting\npushed and pulled between rival campaign managers (Paul Giamatti and\nPhilip Seymour Hoffman). The acting is heavyweight, as are the moral\nquestions about the personal cost of serving the greater good, which\npropel the story with an unstoppable force. The film works due to\nseveral twists and turns throughout and there is great suspense.\n"
"\nThe movie shows that at the end you have to do what you have to do to\nsave yourself. You might have the best interest in heart but when\nothers around you play you then it's time to start thinking about\nyourself. <br><br>While I think this message is transmitted clearly enough through the\nstory line of the movie, the story moves forward quite slowly for my\ntaste. There are a lot of scenes where the dialogue between characters\nis mundane. <br><br>With regards to acting, I am not impressed by Ryan Gosling. He comes\nacross as cold and fails to transmit emotions in situations when for\nexample he feels betrayed and played. George Clooney does a great job\nin impersonating presidential speeches but beyond that he delivered a\nmediocre performance as well. <br><br>Overall, I find the movie to be a bit unrealistic and overly simplified\nin terms of how the character of Stephen Meyers achieved his revenge. <br><br>When I feel that I have wasted almost two hours when a movie ends, then\nI know that I didn't like the movie very much and that was the case\nwith this one.\n"
"\nGeorge Clooney plays a governor who is running for President. He is one\nof two serious candidates for the Democratic nomination. He is a bit\ntoo good to be true. He is adamant about the standard liberal issues\nand won't back down on them. Ryan Gosling plays his number two man\nalong with campaign manager Philip Seymour Hoffman. One day Gosling\nmakes a serious error. He goes to see the campaign manager of the other\ncandidate. This is an absolute no no. His head is on the block. During\nthis time he has a quick tryst with the daughter of the Democratic\nNational Committee. She gives him a bit of information that could throw\nthings into the septic system. Meanwhile, he is fired. Wanting his job\nback, he acts. This is really dirty politics and probably the kind of\nthing that is done behind the scenes all the time. Not a great\npolitical drama, but still very engaging.\n"
"\nI thoroughly enjoyed The Ides Of March. It is a very good look into the\ndirty side of politics behind all the handshakes, speeches and smiles.<br><br>The acting is extremely solid. Clooney and Gosling are fantastic and\nare very well supported by Phillip Seymour Hoffman and Paul Giamatti.\nAll of these four are very well developed in the movie and their\ninteractions come off as very real and very believable. Evan Rachel\nWood is also a great addition to the cast and throws a nice curve ball\ninto the plot.<br><br>I don't really have any negatives to report. If I was being picky, the\nfilm does drag just a touch in places, but not to the extent where you\nlose connection to the plot.<br><br>All in all, a very good film which I would recommend as a real life\nlook into the less crowd pleasing side of party politics.\n"
"\nTightly woven political thriller directed and starring George Clooney\nfrom a play by Beau Willimon, also starring some of the foremost male\nthesps in Hollywood, namely Ryan Gosling, Philip Seymour Hoffman and\nPaul Giamatti. No dull moments in sight as events twist and turn\nthrough the presidential primaries and there is plenty of ruthless\npoliticking going on with the plot clipping along at a good pace. In a\nway it's like the anti-West Wing. Gosling does a fine job at the centre\nof things, but why would we expect anything less, and there are great\nturns all around him that make for a highly entertaining and powerful\ndrama.\n"
"\nIf you like behind-the-scenes politics, you'll probably like this.<br><br>George Clooney and Grant Heslov's previous writing effort was \"Good\nNight &amp; Good Luck\", an excellent, A+ movie. This was extremely well put\ntogether with a sharp script &amp; great acting by all.<br><br>My only negative is that the plot is a bit cliché. This is a story that\nhas been done on paper and in real life many times.<br><br>I could go into detail, but that would be getting into potential\nspoilers. Regardless, it's an intense movie well worth watching.\nWhatever it lacks in plot surprises, it makes up for with great\nwriting, great acting; and a remarkable cast.\n"
"\nCOMMENTARY On the movie «The Ides of March» (2011)<br><br>Vasilis KILIARIS, Economist  Political Analyst <br><br>This movie reveals the truth on Politics, both on issues relating to\nthe candidates, as well as on their campaigns and staff! <br><br>The first half, at least, of the film, realistically presents the way\nthings run on current politics and the role that massive media play,\nhow political marketing is over-ruling substantive political issues of\na debate and how political cynicism prevails between candidates and\ntheir staff, even when they are coming from the same Party during the\nprimaries' election for granting the candidature to lead a country. <br><br>The same modus vivendi in politics is observed in any modern liberal\ndemocracy, including Greece and Cyprus, though in a much higher degree\nof unorganized, populist and clumsy way!\n"
"\nI love political drama, but it has to be very very realistic and well\nwritten. This film is both. Although I do think it could easily have\nachieved what it was trying to do without adding quite so much\nemotional gunpowder, I imagine that Clooney wanted to be certain that\nthe audience would be in no doubt about the mindset of the protagonist\nso he made absolutely sure of it. You can't blame him for using very\nbig letters at that point. Apart from this one flaw, I think this film\nis near perfect. A very neat and well designed story about how the real\nworld of high level politics will harden you and leave you cynical. Of\ncourse it helps when the cast is this great. You could watch Phillip\nSeymour Hoffman read the phone book and it would be interesting.\nClooney holds his own in this company. The sassy intern is very\nenjoyable to watch too. There is one scene that is worth cutting out\nand keeping she is so good in it. Loved it. Will certainly watch it\nagain.\n"
"\nAn interesting political drama! (not thriller!)... Good enough, but not\nGreat.<br><br>It deals with people and politics, and there are no heroes in the the\nstory. - That's what I liked about it; it deals with real people. The\namazingly talented bunch of actors - Gosling (what a year!), Clooney,\nHoffman, Giamatti, Tomei and Wood - do their job very well and fit into\nthe shoes quite easily. The story is good, but it could have challenged\nthe viewers a little more and the characters could have had more\ndepth...<br><br>Clooney's direction is admirable.\n"
"\n\"The Ides of March\" was an inspirationally well written, directed and\nacted film. I watched it on the plane to New Zealand and immediately\nreplayed it when on the plane back to New York. Revealing how the game\nof politics will jade the most idealistic player, I was fascinated by\nthe tricky chess game of each character as they tried to get what they\nwanted. My only complaint is that Evan Rachel Wood didn't hold up\nagainst such a seasoned and intelligent cast. Her character was sadly\none dimensional and unconvincing as well as a little void when it came\nto connecting with Ryan Gosling.<br><br>But I thoroughly recommend this film and feel its opening scenes are\ndripping with symbolism and pathos and this is a true American classic.\nGo George Clooney!!\n"
"\nI really couldn't believe it when this movie came to the end. I thought\nit was about where it should be at the end of an Act Two.<br><br>The performances and cast are great. Clooney was tailor-made to play a\npresidential candidate (as Robert Redford always was) and I hope this\nfilm hasn't spoiled his chances of doing another before he gets too\nold.<br><br>And Philip Seymour Hoffmann excels in any role and his range is just\namazing, from Capote to Charlie Wilson's War.<br><br>The background of political in-fighting is also scripted really well.<br><br>However, it was ultimately unconvincing and that was probably down to\nits too-short running time. Not enough time for soul-searching and the\nrationale behind a complete character change.<br><br>And it was totally unconvincing for a 20-year-old Molly, a serious\npolitical intern, to come on to Stephen the way she did, particularly\nafter what had just happened to her (can't say any more as that would\nbe a spoiler).<br><br>Even so, worth watching and it did grab me, but felt cheated at the\nend.\n"
"\n\"Get out, now. Or otherwise...\" Stephen Meyers (Gosling) is a young and\nambitious campaign worker for his ideal candidate Mike Morris\n(Clooney). When the Ohio primary is in jeopardy the campaign has a\ntough decision to make. When Stephen talks to the opposition and\ndiscovers a secret that could ruin Mike's chances his morals are\nchallenged. Being a political science major I really enjoy movies like\nthis. I know most people may not but I do think that this one is\ndifferent. For a movie that is basically an hour and a half of talking\nit moves very quickly, keeps you interested and is very tense. Focusing\nmainly on the dirty politics and deals made in order to get someone\nelected this will both interest you and make you wonder if this is\naccurate (which I hope it's not). This is one of the best political\nthrillers I have ever seen. The only problem I can see is that it's not\na multiple re-watcher. I give it a B+.\n"
"\nA captivating movie. A realistic political thriller with great\ncharacters, fast pace, twists and all making it quite an absorbing\nHollywood movie. Top performance by Ryan Gosling, less brilliant\nperformance this time by the otherwise great George Clooney. <br><br>A damning verdict for Obama. A reflection of American liberals\ndisillusionment with Obama and an 'Ides of March' warning for the next\nelections. The message is rather clear: You are not that different\nafter all, you have disappointed us and you are loosing those who\nreally believed in you and thought you could be different.<br><br>In short, an entertaining spot on political thriller.\n"
"\nThis is not a movie for everyone! The trailer gives a somewhat false\nidea of exactly what the movie has to offer. This put aside, it was a\nvery entertaining film! The writing was absolutely phenomenal! There\nwere so many moments where subtle comedy was worked into the overall\ndark plot. Acting was very solid throughout the film. Ryan Gosling will\nmost likely get an Oscar Nomination as well as George Clooney, and or\nPhilip Seymour Hoffman, and or Paul Giamatti for their supporting\nroles. I could also see Evan Rachel Wood getting nominated for her\nrole. Overall I enjoyed the film yet it left me wanting more. Ryan\nGosling's character drove the story by pulling you into his mind and\ntaking you through his inner battle between morals and power. As\nintriguing as this was, it stopped short literally. I get the idea\nbehind ending the story where it did but I just wish it could have gone\non. It slightly reminded me of the ending in Inception. It wanted to\nleave you guessing but in this case it left me unsatisfied. I would\nhave rated it higher if it were not for the ending.\n"
"\nAother Gosling movie, another really good movie coming your way too.\nWhile many may have expected Clooney to go deeper than he actually did\nwith this (comparisons to West Wing are inevitable), he did a good job\ncreating a thriller surrounding political (and general) ambitions. And\nwhile not completely flawless the movie has a good story backed up by\ngreat actors.<br><br>While Gosling is almost in every scene he gets supported by a lot of\ncharacters. You might not agree with his portrayal at the beginning or\nmay not be able to think his journey feels real, but I think he does\nconvey that feeling. Other than that, the political aspect may be a\nlittle too thin for most people, but as thrillers go this is more than\nwatchable.\n"
"\nFirst, I am not a Clooney fan. Second, Clooney is very idealistic, and\nhis writing is mediocre. This movie would not have been made without\nhis street cred, as the story followed like a box of donuts: mixed,\nsweet, but too much in the end. Ryan Gosling kills this role and puts\nhim in the top 5 of living great actors. Wow. He sells this role from\nhis first line. He is sheer joy to watch. But the story hit a number of\nspeed bumps that created nice opportunities for tension and climax\nresolution, but I was not sold. It would not have worked as a play:\nthey needed editing to tie the loose ends together. So good for Clooney\nto take the risk, but he has a ways to go as a writer. Down the road, I\nthink he'll look back and say, \"I could do better. On the good side,\nthe music was excellent, the story topical, and with a bit of less\nscrutiny the movie was entertaining. And I do look forward to his next\nmovie.\n"
"\nThis is an actors showcase, well crafted intelligent filmmaking in a\nthought provoking drama, that was just not for me. It's a slow burn of\na movie with the story following an idealistic campaign press secretary\n(Ryan Gosling) who works to help a politician (George Clooney) become\nthe democratic presidential nominee, however a scandal causes him to\nrethink his loyalties.<br><br>Dialogue heavy, ultimately this was dry and boring as hell. It took me\nseveral attempts to get through this and I only stuck with it at all\nbecause I kept expecting it to get better at some point due to the\nstellar cast attached and the fact that Clooney directed. In the end\neven with a couple of clever twists I was left disappointed. 11.13\n"
"\nGeorge Clooney is fast becoming a great director. Following on from the\nunappreciated Leatherheads, which I enjoyed. Comes this political\nthriller, and boy does Clooney nail it!<br><br>Plot In A Paragraph: Stephen Meyers (Ryan Gosling) is a young idealist\nwho's brilliant at communications, he is second in command of Governor\nMike Morris's (George Clooney) presidential campaign, and is a true\nbeliever. In the middle of the Ohio primary, the campaign manager of\nMorris's opponent asks Meyers to meet; he offers him a job. Also a\nyoung intern, Molly Stearns (Evan Rachel Wood) gets Stephen's\nattention.<br><br>Whilst this movie does not have a great deal of rewatchability, as I\nmay never feel the urge to watch it again. It is utterly engrossing\nwith brilliantly compelling performances from Gosling, Clooney Seymour\nHoffman and Wood. Marisa Tomei offer solid support too. <br><br>Clooney certainly knows how to make a movie with plenty of atmosphere,\nas you can literally feel the tension as you are watching the story\nunfold\n"
"\nI was keen on watching this because I read a magazine review which\nmentioned the West Wing, one of my absolute favourite shows. The movie\nhas the political credibility nailed but is not in the same league as\nAaron Sorkin's slick drama. I was interested enough to keep watching\nbecause I wanted to know what happens, but I was rather puzzled by the\ninconclusive ending. George Clooney's politician running for\npresidential nomination is believable, and Ryan Gosling as his aide\nappears to be a moral person who maybe becomes corrupted, but the story\ninvolving the intern Molly was not completely clear to me. There were\ntoo many questions unanswered. It presents a believable view of the\ndirty tricks in political campaigns, but there was a lot of swearing\nand the dark side was winning. It is not the West Wing in any way, it's\na political drama and a fairly confusing one at that.\n"
"\nI wish there was 11 (out of 10).<br><br>I don't understand how this movie hasn't gotten more wins. <br><br>It is just beautiful, perfectly crafted. I can't stop re-watching it.\nThe actors are outstanding. The central actor is a-maaaaaaaaaa-zing.\nThe girl too.<br><br>It reminded me of how many actors less skilled exist (yet I have\nnothing against those). Just brilliant acting, without need to\nover-act, all in subtlety. And if you watch it again, you can see all\nthe subtle face expressions that each actor makes, which say much more\nthan the words! Waw, these actors and this scenario : what a match!\n"
"\nBrilliantly pieced movie, start to finish. Ides of March touches on the\nnature of work a politician has to engage in and attempts to give\nperspective on the popular paradigms which labels that environment.\nClooney is able to portray his character's thoughts and feelings\nthrough their dialog, allowing the viewer to empathize with all\ncharacters and experience their dilemmas. In essence, this is where the\nmovie wins its appeal. Politics is boiled down to choices, dilemmas and\ntrade-offs and Clooney allows his viewer to experience the angst and\ninternal moral turmoil that comes with that. It is this way that we are\ngiven an interesting perspective of what it means to be a politician,\nand the title wonderfully draws on Caesar's assassination to suggest it\nwas probably always 'that way'. Ides of March is Clooney's depiction of\nwhat 'that way' is.\n"
"\n\" Ides of March\", thoughtful and provoking movie directed by George\nClooney, leaves a bitter taste. This is not a propaganda piece\npromoting the so-called, and by the tea party hacks eternally abhorred,\nliberal agenda. Far away from it. The real and ever so serious problem\nis a deeply flawed and corrupt system, very often taunted by the ruling\nelites as the\" best in the world\". So, it could be a Republican or a\nDemocrat, and it really doesn't matter that much. It's a marvelously\nproduced TV reality show, filled with people desperate for attention\nand a bit of money that goes with it. From Jerry Springer to\npresidential election. More polish, better haircuts, proper English,\nfew more teeth, but not that much different. Same lack of shame and\nshortage of dignity and abundance of cheap thrills and even cheaper\nfutures.\n"
"\nThis movie is fantastic. Ryan Gosling has really come into his own ever\nsince (for me)Drive. George Clooney was fantastic not just as the aging\npolitician but as I now see a director. He created a dark and intense\nfeel on a story that (lets be honest here) has been done a million\ntimes.<br><br>The supporting actors especially Evan Rachel Woods and Philip Seymor\nHoffman.<br><br>The story truly becomes that of a to what lengths you will go to get\nwhat you want story. If you have not seen it yet it's definitely worth\na watch.\n"

Absolutely beautiful how the movie starts and ends.. <br><br>Tha final scene is extraordinary<br><br>To bad it was ignored by the Academy..<br><br>One great movie<br><br>My vote for Best Movie\n"
"\nGeorge Clooney is a good actor, and he's becoming a formidable\ndirector. This movie is fine, but I was expecting some more. Great\ndialogues, thrilling scenario, excellent cast. Everything is fine. But\nI didn't enjoy the film as much as I was expecting. I just can't find\nwhat's going wrong in it. The story isn't that surprising. Anyway, it's\nvery entertaining, and for once, it doesn't last forever, only 95\nminutes. And it's rolling well. Maybe it's just because we, I mean\nspectators of my age (49), are used to 3 hours movie on politics. With\nan international side story. Here, we just have people who are trying\nto save their butt. Maybe that's where is my deception is coming from.\nIt's not a movie about a political candidate, but a thriller based on a\npersonal default.\n"
"\nI cannot believe this movie did not get more coverage and more hoopla.\nI watched this movie with some expectations of it being fairly good,\nbut painting a very similar picture that we have all seen many times\nnow. I have to say I was extremely surprised in a very good way. This\nis a very good story with very good actors giving very good acting\nperformances. I have to admit I/m a fan of Gearge Clooney's acting, but\nnot his politics - so you can imagine I was more than a little dubious\nabout this being a Clooney movie about the political machine. But all I\nwant to say is do yourself a favor and watch this movie. It is dynamite\n- a definite 9 out of 10...Enjoy...\n"
"\nIdes of March is a smart movie that builds the storyline little by\nlittle, step by step, sucking you in until you find yourself by\nsurprise in the middle of a highly intriguing plot, just like the main\ncharacter does. Among many other virtues, what I liked the most was the\nunpredictable events and twists the story has throughout its length.\nGeorge Clooney really knows how to dispose the pieces of the puzzle and\nsurprise the audience when the whole picture finally starts to come\ntogether. In other words, he really knows how to tell a story\nmaintaining the tension and the interest till the very last second.\nThis is a very good political drama with outstanding performances,\nthrilling moments and some exquisite shots, that make Clooney stand as\nthe very good director he has become over the years. There's also a\nclear message in the movie that I enjoyed a lot. Politics aren't for\neveryone, and this is the movie that shows you what you need to have to\nlive from politics, regardless of who you work for, a politician, the\ngovernment or a newspaper.\n"
"\nThis is not Clooney's first time in the director's chair, and his\nabilities as a director and an actor are constantly improving. While\nthe film is about the Presidential race, the action centers around\nGosling's character, and he seems to segue nicely from his previous\nromantic comedy - action adventure roles into something a bit more\nserious. His connection with Evan Rachel Wood is touching and real,\nsomething that might happen in the discreet world of politics, and his\nhypocrisy and elitist attitude is concealed in their affair. Phillip\nSeymour Hoffman and Paul Giamatti are dynamic and powerful as the\nopposing campaign managers, and Marisa Tomei is the investigative\nreporter who knows how to twist the arm of her sources. Clooney also\nwrote the screenplay. An overall powerhouse for Clooney, with solid\nacting, smooth action, and a surprising twist at the end. Sex and\nlanguage prevent this from being a family film, but the adults and\nlater teens will be enthralled by the accuracy of the campaign process.\nCollectible if you like politics.\n"
"\nSome might not enjoy this movie because they do not understand what and\nhow campaigning works. I, on the other, have done campaigning, so I was\nintrigued.<br><br>Steve's character was portrayed very good. He is slick, enterprising, a\nreal con, but was pretty much just in it cause his friend Paul was.\nThis all changes after his co-workers back stab him and Molly dies.\nRyan Gosling portrayal of this character and change of character is\nexcellent. So was George Clooney's portrayal of snake-like Morris.<br><br>I also really enjoyed the production as well. Many parts were very\nslick and smooth, almost like an old movie. The scene when Molly gets\nan abortion was presented very intimately sad, just the piano music\nmade me want to cry.<br><br>This is one of the most well done movies I have ever seen! The acting,\nthe wit, the storytelling, the message, was excellent.\n"
"\nDoes George Clooney ever sleep? Ont top of starring in The Descendants,\nhe also writes, directs, produces, and stars in The Ides of March. The\nthemes of the dirty workings of the political underworld may not\nexactly be eye opening, but it's still a pretty fascinating ride.\nClooney and his co-writers deliver something really well done, equipped\nwith freshly developed characters, snappy dialogue that may have been\nguest written by Aaron Sorkin, confidant pacing and structure, and nail\nbiting tension.<br><br>As for Clooney's direction, he does what is needed of him, and does it\nwell. The slick editing makes the movie just fly by, and his ensemble\ncast is terrifically assembled. They're essential to the movie's\ntension, creating massive sparks in their path, certain scenes being\nwhere they're so good, NOBODY outshines the other. Evan Rachel Wood is\nthe closest thing to a weak link I can find. She sometimes felt more\nlike a plot device than an actual character, but that's a small\ncomplaint to a movie that I thought was great.<br><br>***1/2 out of ****\n"
"\nThe Ides of March<br><br>Bad things always happen during March: Messiahs rise from their graves,\nIrish people are encouraged to get smashed and stabbings while eating\nCaesar salad increase.<br><br>That spring tradition of tragedy now continues with this thriller. <br><br>Determined to see Governor Morris (George Clooney) succeed at his run\nfor presidency, Stephen (Ryan Gosling) excels at his junior position\nunder the Senior Campaign Manager (Philip Seymour Hoffman).<br><br>In fact, he's so exceptional that he is headhunted by the campaign\nmanager (Paul Giamatti) for Morris' Republican opponent.<br><br>Later, a Morris aide (Evan Rachel Wood) comes forward with news that\ncould devastate the white knight's reputation, while Stephen's meeting\nwith the enemy is leaked to a reporter (Marisa Tomei).<br><br>A pulse-pounding plunge in to the political arena, The Ides of March is\na superlative study of a naïve guppy's evolution into a shrewd shark. <br><br>As for politics, it's best left to those who can afford to keep their\ngay lifestyle a secret. (Green Light)\n"
"\ni like Clooney as a director, his skill apparent in the way he moves\nthrough the setting and how the camera treats his actors, and he can\ngenerate interest and entertain well as he tells the story. this film\nis really good at that. being about the dirty game of politics playing\nat full effect in the background, i couldn't help but think about how\nit could've been a much better film had it focused almost entirely on\nStephen's story and his transition more deeply. Gosling is once again\namazing, the scene when he listens to Molly's messages and the last\nscene are great. very good writing going on in some stand-offs, and\nother lazy lines like Molly's \"we're Catholics\"..\n"
"\nClooney had a fantastic debut with Good Night, Good Luck, then fell off\na bit with Leatherheads, and is now back to form with this gripping\nthriller about political ethics and morals. <br><br>Ryan Gosling is magnetic in the lead role, and as always, delivers a\ncharming portrayal of a man trying to do right in a volatile\natmosphere.<br><br>One person mainly left out in reviews has been Phillip Seymour Hoffman\nwho is once again powerful and real. He is easily one of the greatest\nactors working today and is always fun to watch.<br><br>The cinematography was exceptional in this film and George seems to\nalways pick the top people in the business to work on his films. It\npays off, because The Ides of March is a pleasure to watch and a thrill\nof a ride to take.\n"
"\na great movie , including talented famous actors and a very good\ndirector , who is a very talented and handsome actor. there is a good\nacting in this film,especially from George clooney and Philip Seymour\nHoffman. despite having little scenes in comparison to Ryan\ngosling,they were very impressive directing of clooney was impressive\nand his role was a corner stone in the movie, he was very mature and it\nwas one of his bests Ryan gosling was a big surprise for me,he was very\ngood and controlling his scenes. He added his flavor to the movie and\nit helped well!!.i liked also Jeffrey wright ,paul giamatti .they acted\nvery well!!! . it was all about politics!!! politics politics and more\npolitics. there were no good people and bad people,it was just how to\nwin your battle, caring only for your self and your business i learned\na lot about politics from this movie. and despite all that the film was\ninteresting and not boring at all, I reacted very well with no\nblinking. i think the film is very good and deserves watching.\n"
"\nAs always Clooney has come up with a movie which does not make you\ncringe with silly scenes, violence and overacting mediocre actors.\nThough the story could have been much more meaningful and thought\nprovoking, this makes a very good watch. After all you want to watch a\nmovie and read a scripture on a lazy afternoon. Clooney has given the\ndriving seat to an able Ryan Gosling. Hope he doesn't get stereotyped\nwith this full of himself or talk less, move your facial muscles roles.\nBackground score is notable and overall a good movie. Not for someone\nwho expects over the hill dramas but suits to one who has tastes like\nwatching movies based on true stories, though this is not one\n"
"\nWhen you rate a movie it is important to measure it against what it\ntries to be and achieve. \"The Ides of March\" is a political drama. That\nis exactly what it succeeds at.<br><br>If you are an avid follower of US presidential politics and your\nexpectations when you walk into the theater is to be entertained for an\nhour and a half watching a fictional film whose focus is solely around\nUS presidential politics ... you will love this movie.<br><br>What I really liked about it is how it doesn't attempt to take a moral\nhigh ground or preach to the audience by driving the points with an\ninvisible hammer into our minds.<br><br>Look... we are all adults here. People who love political films KNOW\nthat politics are dirty and treacherous, even since the times of Roman\nRepublic and Julius Caesar 500 years BC and onwards.<br><br>We KNOW that. So, what we want is a good story set in that environment,\nand that is exactly what we got.\n"
"\nThank goodness, it's the Ides of March ! I say that because this is a\nkind of film which I like: a slow burner which leaves you satisfied,\nyet knowing that the story doesn't end there. Ryan Gosling's character\nmay start out as an idealist, but he soon learns how the real world\nworks and embraces it with both arms till, in the end, in terms of\nruthlessness and cold-eyed ambition, he out-Caesars Caesar! But, young\nman, beware! He who rides the tiger....! Respice post te, memento te\nhominem! or whatever; anyway, what I mean to say is that this film\ncries out for a follow-up which tells the further exploits of Stephen\nMeyers. I hope he goes on from strength to strength, then brings the\nwhole rotten world of politics crashing down like a pack of cards and\ncomes out smelling of roses! And, to top it all, they manage to tell\nthe story in a quiet, measured tone.\n"
"\nI don't need to write a great deal about it because it isn't worth it.\nI mean Clooney the arrogant liberal loon is enough. Of course he is\nridiculous.<br><br>Typical stereotyping, even down to the 'honest' candidate. Bleehhh.<br><br>The acting was weak, there was no real plot and by mid movie it was an\ntypical liberal Hollywood fantasy . The movie is just a total snooze as\nwell. Only Democrat drones will dig the lies and propaganda that\nClooney spouts off about same old tired nonsense.<br><br>His skills as a director are non-existent, and his acting consists of\nmugging for the camera with that stupid smirk on his face.\n"
"\nMuch as I have liked Clooney's performances (Oh Brother) and directing\n(Good Night), I found his latest effort incredibly boring and\npredictable. I walked out a few times but in between I did not enjoy\none moment of this film, nor did I hear one sentence of interesting\ndialog, or one moment that had any creative energy to it. as to the\nacting, which many reviewers liked, I must disagree in that all the\nmajor talent gave predictable performances, while the guy playing the\nprotagonist was unappealing. the plot, what there was of it, made no\nsense, as it seemed to revolve around the hardly scandalous event of\ntwo rival campaign strategists meeting. If one watches an intelligent\npolitical film like the Best Man, for example, one realizes how far\nthis genre has suffered in recent years, along with politics in\ngeneral.\n"
"\nI'm a fan of action movies, though this drama movie is a good one\nwithout a gun shot.<br><br>George was acting normally, nothing special as I expected he did<br><br>The content and flow of the film was awesome.<br><br>Ryan played excellently as a cold-blooded ambitious young staffer. I\nlike his appearance.<br><br>However, It could have been better if we had some action scenes and\nmore thrills.<br><br>In comparison with The Descendant, I would recommend this movie to my\nfriends.<br><br>So, let's watch movie fans :)\n"
"\nMy movie buddy and I spent quite some time after watching this talking\nabout what Stephen would do at the press conference. This is a good\nsign of an interesting movie and we see a lot of them.<br><br>The things that were so great were Ryan Gosling who I adore anyway\nportrays a young guy running into his emotions for what I think is\nprobably the first time. Excellent stuff.<br><br>The whole thing is just what I would imagine life on the campaign trail\nwould be like - a series of moments that just have to be dealt with in\none way or another.<br><br>A great movie, one I would watch again. Well done Ryan for having such\na huge range of talent I thought you were awesome.\n"
"\nWhen I first heard about this film I didn't want to see it because I'm\nnot a fan of George Clooney really and saw that he was writing\ndirecting and producing it. Some actors like Tyler Perry make not so\ngreat movies. But Clooney is no Tyler Perry and manages to direct,\nwrite produce and star in his own film. Basically it's a political\nmovie or whatever you want to call it. That all I'm saying. The cast is\nimpressive Ryan Gosling is perfect as the lead role too bad he didn't\nget any Oscar noms for this. <br><br>Other cast members such as Evan Rachel Wood, Paul Giamatti, Marisa\nTomei, Phillip Seymour Hoffman and Jennifer Ehle. She has very little\nscreen time sadly along with Jeffrey Wright.<br><br>This film is definitely worth checking out on DVD 7/10\n"
"\nI was in politics for 17 years. Worked at the local, state, and federal\nlevels, as an elected official, appointed official, staff, and\nbureaucrat. In my opinion, this movie is a fair and accurate portrayal\nof the game. It is not Liberal agenda, nor is it Conservative\nagenda....it is the reality of politics. And politics is an, at times,\nvicious chess match which determines how people are going to live.\nPhilip Seymour Hoffman very accurately portrays a Chief of Staff and\nthe conversations that take place are close to reality. The writer got\nthis movie correct. If a person wants to know what the game is really\nlike at election time, they need to watch this movie.\n"
"\nThis movie is about the depravity and corruption in politics, of how\ninfluence is sold for favors, all in order to win. Ryan Gosling gives a\npowerful performance as novice political staffer who learns the facts\nof life while on the campaign and then applies what he learns. The\nstory itself is not only plausible but, if anything, understated. Given\nthe series of well known and at times infamous scandals that have\nshaken the public's confidence in the integrity of the democratic\npolitical process, this movie does not really present anything new.\nRather, the movie presents a story that confirms what the public\nalready knows, that politics and politicians are open to influence and\nmake huge mistakes which can cost them the or political career. The\nquestion is: how effective is the damage control and can the mistakes\nbe smoothed over and even turned to a candidate's advantage? To find\nout the answers to these questions, watch the movie.\n"
"\nStarted off interesting enough, awesome script and intelligent\ninterplay of arguments from the various topics but then it went deeper\ninto the characters which for some strange reason felt fake. The\ncharacters just weren't real enough like the reasons behind the\ndefining moment in the plot line (wouldn't wanna explain the spoiler). <br><br>Suffice to say, the movie couldn't quite capture the character's\ntransition and growth towards the end of the movie. The topics became\ntoo obvious and overtly blunt. <br><br>Perhaps its just me who found it too petty, that there should be a\ngreater persona out of the main character. but then again, perhaps this\nreally is politics, and i'm the idealistic one.<br><br>Still a sufficiently gripping tale\n"
"\nThis movie in engaging, I will watch any movie with Ryan Gosling in it.\nThe problem with this brilliant piece of propaganda is that it gives a\nkind of credit to the US elections that is so far from the truth of the\ncircus as to be laughable. It has all the in and out of what a real\nrace may look like but the fact that American politics is 1000 less\nnoble than this and infinitely more of the bad taste that there is no\nactual left right dichotomy, i.e. that there is no actual left or\nright, would mean that this is a complete exercise in propaganda to\nconvince the average American that this is how politics are fought for\nbehind the scenes. The truth is that in actuality the winner of an\nAmerican election is agreed upon by everyone involved in the race well\nbefore hand by the Rothschild banking cartel and that this interesting\nmovie only serves as the ideal of what the nation actually expects\nhappens. If you don't mind the propaganda of this film, the sole reason\nthat it was made and you can suspend your disbelief then you will be\nfine with this whole facade.\n"
"\nBy unfinished what I mean is that it felt more like half a movie. The\nIdes of March is competently scripted and acted but really doesn't tell\nyou anything you didn't know about the ruthless nature of political\nlife. With a cast this great you're expecting quite a lot, and the\nacting is fine. It has to be said, though, that most of these actors\ncould play these roles in their sleep and only the ever-watchable Paul\nGiamatti really stands out. Philip Seymour Hoffman and Marisa Tomei\nespecially are badly underused. Unfortunately, the story builds to an\ninteresting place and then it's over. Not a bad movie, but i'd rather\nwatch my old DVD's of The West Wing for my fictional political\nentertainment...\n"
"\nWith all the big names in this movie I was expecting something really\ngreat--something well worth the price of two movie tickets.\nUnfortunately my husband and I were both very disappointed. The story\nline is very lacking, and the ending will leave you wanting more. The\nacting was superb, and some scenes were very powerful. The first half\nof the movie has you wondering what direction the plot is going to\ntake. When the defining moment finally arrives, you expect a dramatic\nseries of events as the characters twist and turn to make lemonade out\nof lemons. But there is nothing besides lemons in this offering. No\nresolution, no happy ending. If you're looking for a smart, interesting\ndrama, skip this one.\n"
"\nUpon starting, The Ides of March grabs your attention, and I'd say\ncarries it through to the end. There is a twist, as with every good\nmovie, about midway through that goes on to dominate the rest of the\nmovie, and I liked the direction it went in, however, felt that the\nmovie as a whole was not concluded.<br><br>In the end, Ryan Gosling's character has a choice to expose the\ncorruption of Governor Morris or to keep it a secret and thus propel\nhimself in the political world. As a viewer, you naturally want to know\nwhich way he goes, however, the movie ends before he can make a choice.\nI can see why this ending was chosen, as it does leave an impact,\nhowever, it is also mildly disappointing. <br><br>Overall, though, this movie was very good, with great performances,\nespecially by Evan Rachel Wood and Phillip Seymour Hoffman. I'd\ndefinitely recommend it as a well thought-out, modern- day political\nthriller.\n"
"\nBe grateful Monica Lewinsky,things could have turned out so much worse\nfor you had this movie been all about your life.<br><br>Seriously, we have George Clooney at his finest form in another\ntailor-made role for him. Running for the presidency suits our activist\nactor just fine. He is got the answers, vague as they may be, when it\ncomes to the issues, but his personal life mirrors many politicians of\ntoday.<br><br>Clooney is supported by a fine cast who show themselves as political\noperatives, elected officials participating in an outstanding sleaze\nfactor.<br><br>It would have been nice had the film ended in a more ethical way where\nthe shenanigans of these politicians are exposed as we saw, for\nexample, in 1957's \"A Face in the Crowd.\"\n"
"\nA film about the cruel price of politics. Love story as axis. And the\nlies, compromises and abdications, errors and indirect crimes like\nmodus vivendi. About power and fear only facts talks. The president may\nbe French, Romanian or Somalian. The differences are small. The mixture\nof past and future is in any situation dangerous. And reality is only\nway of small combination. The movie is not indictment or manifesto. It\nis indigestible food. Precise and result of old recipes. With great\nactors and gray air. With final open shade. A movie as a ax kick. Lead\nof gestures, gnashing of feelings. Secrets as heats of a American\nceremony. And the end. As evening rain.\n"
"\nThe Ides of March - the fateful date for Julius Caesar and now, Mike\nMorris aka George Clooney. The concept, direction, execution and\nediting works beautifully. Its 'crash course on dirty politics' gives a\nreal thought-provoking insight into American politics. Ryan Gosling\ngave a stunning performance as did George Clooney. <br><br>Whatever cinema crap Hollywood or for that matter, any film industry\naround is producing, its the this kind of cinema that 're-gives' the\nhope that this kinda path-breaking cinema is here to stay.<br><br>If you miss this, you really wanna kick your own ass.........yeah\nseriously...!!!!!<br><br>GO FOR IT......!!!!\n"
"\nI really enjoyed this movie, the acting was excellent and the plot was\nentertaining. It was a kind of cautionary tale about politics, or,\nrather, Clooney's reply to the (oft-asked) question about why he\ndoesn't actually go into politics himself.<br><br>The movie is not without its faults, though. There are some clichés\nlike the \"I'm Catholic\" line which was a little too twee and made me\nwince slightly. I also thought the suicide was a bit extreme. Was it\nbecause she would have had to work for Ben? Or was it because of the\nshame of being used by two powerful men she once looked up to? Also,\nthe new young female intern shown at the end of the movie seemed to\nhave been offered up as \"fresh meat\" to the powerful men she worked\nfor. Have I assumed too much? <br><br>Thank God for the Ida character, though. Without her, the only female\ncharacters would have been weak and victims of (potential) exploitation\nby powerful men.<br><br>Despite its flaws, I enjoyed this movie and have enjoyed discussing it,\nwhich is even better!\n"
"\nIt is supposed to be a political thriller, but it follows more the\nrules of a Greek drama. <br><br>Stephen the talented young campaign manager wants to enter the big boys\nleague in politics. Now, as every field politics has its own moral\nstandards and required skills. <br><br>To prove his aptitude, Stephen has to accomplish an initiation\nceremony, that turns out to be cruelly Spartan. <br><br>I like the political movies of George Clooney, because he is interested\nin the human aspects of his stories but still manages to not over\nmoralize things. The ides of March was not striking to me, but still I\nliked it. The characters are well played, the directing is okay, the\nstory however is a little bit foreseeable. Nevertheless, it was good to\nwatch some other kind of plot between all the shiny superhero movies\nand remakes. I definitely recommend it for watching.\n"
"\nAnother Hollywood genre with well-known dramaturgy is the election\nmovies. It's always telling how rotten it is. Intrigues, sex,\nhumiliation, lies. We all know it since long ago, but it would sometime\nbe surprising to meet at least one film politician who is a good guy or\ngirl.<br><br>You don't meet anyone here, of course, but you get 100 entertaining\nminutes, including the as usual marvelous Philip Seymour Hoffman.\nGeorge Clooney's script-writing and directing are better than his\nacting this time.<br><br>You can't say these movies are recommending for democracy, but they are\nrecommending for the typical Hollywood handicraft. In this case,\nanyway.\n"
"\nAs I saw this film tonight , in Greece, and I ' m not very well\naccustomed with the American voting system which is completely\ndifferent from ours, I have to admit that I enjoyed the film\ntremendously. I can also understand why this film is so annoying for\nthe American people and of course the critics, who don't want to accept\nthe disillusionment of the fake American Dream, but I can tell you\nthis: George Clooney is getting more mature as a director from film to\nfilm (though his \"Goodnight and Good Luck\" was excellent, too) and is\none of the (unfortunately) few American directors who are still\ncarrying the flag of the unparalleled classical American cinema, that\nis a combination of entertainment with a social or political message in\na masterful equilibrium.\" The Ides of March\" is not an easy film to\nwatch but it's made of Oscar staff, especially for its script,\ndirection, camera and performances.Thank you George! We are very much\nobliged.\n"
"\nStephen Meyers(Ryan Gosling), is a young campaign manager for Mike\nMorris(George Clooney), a governor running for President of The United\nStates. Stephen is really sure that Mike is gonna the next President.\nBut when so many scandalous incidents that connect to the campaign,\nMike is gonna discover in the world of politics, nothing is quite what\nit seems.<br><br>Such a great film, George Clooney does well as actor and director, I\nlike the way he sets up such intense moments that make you want to grab\non the edge of seat. Ryan Gosling was good, he is in pretty much\neverything, from Crazy,Stupid,Love, Drive, and this. Phillip Seymour\nHoffmann was good, so was Paul Giamatti is also good, both of them\ncan't help but be awesome in there performances. Lets not forget Marisa\nTomei and Evan Rachel Wood.\n"
"\nClooney directed this film and did a halfway decent job. <br><br>There were a couple of weak spots but overall he kept up the pace and\nkept the story interesting. <br><br>A few truths come out in this film to remind us what politics is about:\n#1 loyalty is the currency of politics. #2 the longer you're involved\nin politics the more jaded one becomes. <br><br>One of the best lines paraphrased: we don't make mistakes, we make\ndecisions, (no one decides to make a mistake). <br><br>Gosling was good as a young idealist, falling in love with Clooney's\npolitics, but that changes and that is what makes the store\ninteresting.\n"
"\nPhilip Seymour Hoffman delivered an outstanding performance! Evan\nRachel Woods delivered the right mix of sexuality and innocence which\nmade her character likable and yet an object of pity. George Clooney\nproved once again that he has what it takes to become an A list\nDirector and the acting skills to stay on the A list. Real emotional\nmoments leaped from the screen drawing the viewers deeper into the\nplot. Scenarios from this political drama could have easily played out\nin the corporate world where a thirst for power often leaves loyalty\nand morality in a dry barren often forgotten place. Realism was the\nforce of the day in this modern day drama. A sound script, an excellent\ncast, as well as all around excellent performances will probably lead\nto Golden Globes and Oscars nominations. Angelina Stevens gives this\nmust see little political thriller 2 Bravos!!\n"
"\nWithin 5 minutes I had figured out the entire plot. Somebody in\nHollywood needs to wake up because Clooney has zero clue as to what he\nis doing. Yet he keeps getting to make more movies. I watched the movie\nmainly because Giamati and Gossling are in it. Say what you want, but I\ndon't what's worse this or Up in The Air or The American. Reviewers can\nsay what they want about how those movies were artistic, but I\nguarantee if you made those same people sit through those movies again\nthey would refuse. Like usual another hyped up Clooney bomb. I honestly\ncannot think of any reason to suggest to somebody to watch this. The\npolitical plot lines are so obvious a five year old kid could figure it\nout. This is not by any means a political thriller, at best it is a\nmovie about politics and nothing more. I'm sorry great actors actually\nsigned on to this movie, didn't they read the script or did they really\nneed a paycheck that bad.\n"
