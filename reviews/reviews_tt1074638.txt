"\nWeak plot, poor acting, stupid ending, I wasted 2 1/2 hours don't waste\nyours. It was like watching Scoobie Do for adults.<br><br>It started off quite well and had it ended when he falls of the train\nit would of been fairly good, although only 15 mins long! after that it\nwas so disappointing that I almost cheered when M died, the plot got\nweaker and more far fetched with each change of location. Who was the\ngirl on the beach, why board your enemies boat to have a shower? How\nwere they captured, why crash a tube train into a tunnel, incidentally\nit was lucky all the passengers got off at the previous station!! <br><br>The Bourne trilogy knocks spots off Bond any day, there was no tension\nin this whatsoever and it was so corny, one of the worst Bond movies\never.\n"
"\nSome people thought Daniel Craig was too much like Bourne and the Bond\nstyle film had been abandoned. If you were worried about that fear not\n- Bond is back.<br><br>The film has great stunts &amp; thrills - you'll see this in the long\nopening sequence. Bond is not burdened with gadgets and still has lots\nof energy.<br><br>Ignore the plot credibility (not as far fetched as some plots like\nMoonraker) and usual level of general film fiction where it comes to\ncomputing.<br><br>All the characters are great, from the MI6 team members to the villain\n(Silva) who acts like a traditional Bond villain. It is very easy to\nprovide details and reveal the plot - the way the trailer was edited\nmeans it has not given too much away.<br><br>This film will provide thrills &amp; you will laugh more than you did with\nCraig's last two films.<br><br>Classic Bond is back and it was a joy to see it, if you are a Bond\nenthusiast there are lots of treats in store.\n"
"\nFelt compelled to sign up and write this like others as this movie just\ndoes not do what it says on the tin. All the critics reviews pointed to\nthis film being fantastic the best Bond ever.Well its not ! Far from it\ni don't know if other movie watchers are saying its good because the\ncritics say its wonderful so it must be good isn't it ? This is not a\nBond movie its not even a good action/drama movie.I've heard the\nreviews for Taken 2 it sounds awful but i think i might go and see it\nthe critics have got this so wrong. Skyfall has a poor script and plot\nthat is sidelined half way through the film.No gadgets no bond girls no\nexotic locations the whole film looked like it was shot in SD quality\nit was so grey and murky. This was the first Bond movie I've seen at\nthe Cinema since Thunderball (yes that years ago) i usually watch\nmovies on DVD/bluray but felt because of all the hype that Skyfall\nwould be worth going to see. Well its not save your money and wait till\nits on TV at least you can record it and FF the boring parts.\n"
"\nSince the site has 1164 reviews as of this writing I'll just throw in\nmy own two cents.<br><br>Two of the world's greatest actors, namely Judi Dench and Javier\nBardem, lead the way here. Daniel Craig, I thought, turned in another\nstrong performance as the droll fearless 007.<br><br>There's also wonderful support from Ralph Fiennes, as the new\nIntelligence Chairman, Ben Whishaw as Q, Albert Finney as the caretaker\nKincade, and Naomie Harris as Eve Moneypenny.<br><br>I found the film to be filled with humor and the special effects\nterrific. The movie is also very capably directed by the accomplished\nBritish director Sam Mendes.<br><br>Perhaps, my only criticism would be the grand finale which I felt was\nsomewhat drawn out and could have shortened the 2 hour 23 minute\nduration.<br><br>I was surprised at the very negative reviews on the first page of IMDb.\nI found, overall, this new Bond film to be a powerhouse and I\nthoroughly enjoyed it.\n"
"\nThis is categorically not the best Bond film ever. The pudding is being\nover egged. It begins well with an impressive chase and a fight on a\ntrain but then it all somehow falls apart. With such an impressive cast\nyou'd expect the film to be more memorable.<br><br>The running time is overlong and the final action scene drags big time.<br><br>Craig looks terrible here with his crew cut and too tight suits. Ralph\nFiennes would surely make a better Bond. Thomas Newman's score is\nunmemorable. Naomie Harris is miscast. Berenice is underused. The\nvillains plot is far too complex and makes the whole thing seem like a\nfarce.<br><br>Wait for the hype to die down and this will be seen for what it is. A\nmediocre film that sits near the bottom of the middle quality Bonds.\n"
"\nSkyfall is a special James Bond Movie. Suddenly there was a 964 Astin\nMartin and Bond said \"we're going back in time\" to M, thats very neat.\nThe story line has a car chase near the beginning, Bonds obituary shown\nin the trailer so no spoiler intended. There is Bonds road to recovery\nand testing. Bond thinks he passed by the skin of his teeth. The\nVillain brags that bond failed all of the tests, range, psychological,\nmedical other. The bottom line is that the head of British Intelligence\nsaw Bond as fit for the field. The screenplay is very good. One of my\nJames Bond short stories was called Golden train with a fight on the\ntop of a train tunnel and a sniper aiming at the train written in 2010.\nCommander James Bond celebrate 50 years of the Bond movie franchise\nwith style the most successful movie franchise ever.\n"
"\n\"Skyfall\" is loaded with jaw-dropping awesome stunts and special\neffects, one of the most beautiful and tragic Bond girls ever--the\nstunning Bérénice Marlohe, and a brilliant theme song from the\nfabulously talented Adele and producer Paul Epworth lushly orchestrated\nby J.A.C. Redford. There is sizzling homo erotic tension between Daniel\nCraig's perfect Bond and Javier Bardem's Silva, a villain the likes of\nwhich have never been seen in this franchise. Dame Judi Dench's\nmarvelous \"M\" is set up for retirement from the onset of the film.\nDench, who has portrayed M for seven Bond films--a record- -is given\nthe screen time she deserves to honor her character. While Craig's\n\"Casino Royale\" remains my favorite with its bloody and raw portrayal\nof the spy business and most tender Bond romance since \"On Her\nMagesty's Secret Service,\" \"Skyfall\" is full and satisfying and among\nthe best films of its kind released this season.\n"
"\nIf you have ever watched the classic Bonds then you will agree with my\nrating. If you have not then you don't know what a real Bond movie is\nand should watch them before you watch this. Story drops off somewhere\nin the movie and then is gone. Q really an emo Q, get outta here with\nthat. Kill off M well another mistake. Daniel Craig is well...... Oh\nyea James Bond does not drink Heineken. License To Kill was the last\ngreat Bond, yes I know who played Bond, but this was the last of the\ntrue Bond style. Pierce did an OK job, but sometimes you just gotta\nstop a movie or series being made and give up being greedy Ms.\nBroccoli. Overall I will continue to enjoy my old Bond movies and plan\nto never watch anything produced with the motive of greed over quality\nin the James Bond films.\n"
"\nThis is one of the weakest storyline. Why did the criminal go through\nall the trouble, create all the havoc, if all he wanted to do was to\nkill M? I mean couldn't he just enter USA and kill her?<br><br>If all he the havoc he created was to enter USA then I really doubt his\ncapabilities as a computer hacker, because what kind of a hacker would\nsomeone be, who can't modify his records?<br><br>Overall, a very weak plot with no suspense and just random useless\naction with very big holes in the storyline. I don't understand why\npeople like this movie. May be I am missing something but oh well, I\ngave it 1 because I couldn't go any lower.\n"
"\nI believed in the hype and those \"professional\" critics and went to\nwatch this movie and now completely regret it. What a waste of time and\nmoney!<br><br>The plot is so stupid that I thought it must be a joke, it is worse\nthan a steve siegel movie.<br><br>I swear I will never believe any critics from now on, they must have\nall been bought by Hollywood. I can't believe even NPR was touting\nabout it.<br><br>compared to this, Quantum Of Solace can almost be called good.<br><br>1) What happened to the agent's list? 2) The villain Silva was\ninteresting in the beginning, then suddenly became an idiot. 3) the\nbond girls suck big time! 4) the siege at the end is worse than \"home\nalone\"!!\n"
"\nthe 1st bond movie with Daniel Craig (casino royale) was a terrific\nfilm . the plot was great. the 2nd one (quantum of solace) was pretty\ngood. but this film was SO OVERRATED ! the bond villain doesn't come\nuntil more than an hour in the movie . <br><br>If your expectations are to watch a fun mindless, action summer\nblockbuster, then I suppose it does it's job. If you're looking for a\ngreat spy/action film, with intrigue, suspense, great character\ndevelopment, a cohesive plot, then you will be disappointed. Skyfall\ngets a little messy and it seems like there are just a bunch of scenes\nand scenarios strung together because \"they would be cool\", kind of\nlike an action-film-by-committee check-list was used. Casino Royale\nraised the bar for me, and Skyfall, just feels like a bit of a mess,\nlacking the sophistication and depth that was set-up with the franchise\nreboot of Casino Royale.\n"
"\nUnlike other reviewers, I found nothing to recommend this movie at all.\nThe plot was poor, and dialogue, such as it was, was hopeless, the\nacting stilted and suspense non-existent. You can usually tell within a\nminute or two of whether a film will be worth watching, and this one\nwas firmly in the No basket. So what did we get? It started with a\nwhole lot of routine chase stuff, culminating in Bond falling\napparently dead into a river, where we're treated to some gee-whizz\nunderwater shots of his \"drowning\". Next second, he's walking smartly\ndown the corridors of power, fresh as a daisy. How did this happen? Was\nit \"with a bound he was free\" the classic text so beloved of\nscriptwriters who've boxed their star into a corner? It didn't get any\nbetter. I kept looking at my watch, hoping it would end soon. The early\nbond movies had style. This one was a waste of space. I've awarded it a\n1/10, but would happily give it no marks at all.\n"
"\nThis movie sucks. For all the hype, product placement and promotion,\nthis Bond instalment is terrible. <br><br>Sam Mendes falters in the first reel with a slow and boring start\n(without the 007 gun barrel) that moves into a bike chase. At one point\nduring the chase, a shot where the stunt doubles face may have been\nseen, a poor and shoddy CGI face of Daniel Craig is animated over the\ndouble's face. <br><br>The CGI work is terrible and obvious, so much so, that it resembles\nsome of the blue screen work from the 007 films of the late seventies\nand eighties.<br><br>The musical score is abysmal. The comic book music apes the action in a\nway that great Bond scores transcended.<br><br>Sam Mendes is not an action director, nor does it seems from this\neffort, a dramatic director. This is the worst Bond of the three so far\nwith Craig. <br><br>I predict that the next Bond will be directed by Guy Richie. <br><br>The essence of Bond has been lost. <br><br>Bond is Dead.\n"
"\nI'm not good speech writer and tell shortly. this film is shame of\nbondiada. I see all series of 007 but this is real trash. start scene,\nmiddle and final don't have any normal connection and also to much\ncyber and nothing bond style. stupidest \"Q\", in previews series never\nsee bustard-es this \"Q\", Albert Broccoli and Ian Fleming must be\nturning in their graves, shame on you. There are so many reasons why\nthis doesn't deserve to be mentioned in the same breath as Dr No,\nGoldeneye or Casino Royale. skyfall was boring from the beginning to\nthe near end. Hope next film if you make will be much better, but don't\nmake skyfall style, this film if it's possible to call part of bondiada\nis real shame... wish you write better script for next that's all\n"
"\nVery disappointed in this poor excuse of a bond film. i never write\nreviews on movies (in fact this is my first time) but because this\nmovie was so lame i just had to warn all the other bond fans. there is\nno plot, no cool gadgets that a new young Q gives him. money penny is\nnot the same color, bond has sex with a sex slave girl just for her to\ng get shot 5 minutes later and doesn't act like he even cared. I demand\nmy $25 back and want to be reimbursed for my time and gas. i know there\nisn't much to write, or make movies about these days but you people\nneed to be more creative. no 007 can get shot off a moving train and\nfall like 150 and live. he is not super human and there was no\nexplanation of what happened. This will be the last bond film i see\nuntil i read better reviews\n"
"\nSkyfall has been deemed not only a very good Bond film, but also the\nbest ever.<br><br>I can certainly see where people are coming from with this view. It is\nwell directed, has lots of action sequences and as with all of Daniel\nCraig's outings, manages to add more depth to the character.<br><br>After their absences from the last two outings it is nice to see\nMoneypenny and Q back along for the ride (both with new faces) and Judi\nDench is on good form as M.<br><br>But the best Bond film ever? For me no. None of the action sequences\nwill live long in the memory as being the best of the franchise and\nthere are too many slow moments.<br><br>So overall, a good Bond film,not a great one.\n"
"\ni was incredibly disappointed with Skyfall. the plot felt weak as there\nwhere way to many plot holes. i hate the \"hacker magic\" that some\nmovies bring. yes it's a neat element but in this movie it went way to\nfar. too many times i felt bored, checking my watch and it was hard for\nme to believe this was a bond film. some aspects i did like: the scene\nwhere n meets q and he reveals his true appearance haunted me and made\nme squirm in my seat. the scene where you hear the English rock coming\nfrom a speaker and find out its a helicopter added a great fear element\nto make this one of the best siege scenes i've ever seen. i liked q as\na villain and his performance and those two scenes made this a solid 5\nfor me\n"
"\nGranted, Judie Dench tried to play a robot, but it's not enough. How\nthis film can get such a high score is beyond me. Some sorry excuse for\na villain concocts mind-boggling convoluted plan that involves hacking\nall London, blowing up MI6, capturing Bond, then surrendering to Bond,\nescaping -- all that supposedly to hurt and kill \"M\". I don't suppose\nhe could just walk in her apartment (like Bond did) and simply shoot\nher. And Bond who gets shot, falls off the train into the abyss, and is\neven shown drowning, then somehow makes miraculous recovery. I mean,\nseriously?! <br><br>Now I realize Bond movies aren't really supposed to be realistic, but\nthis is beyond ridiculous. This was written by an 8 year old for 5 year\nolds. The idiot plot, poor screenplay, mediocre acting. The action\nreminded me of Wild Wild West movie with Will Smith, except that WWW\nwas a comedy, and this isn't. I can't believe that I actually got bored\nwatching this.\n"
"\nAfter the first 2 DC outings as Bond, I was looking forward to this\none. However as the the film progressed, I started to get a sinking\nfeeling. This was 100% confirmed during the scenes leading up to and\nincluding M's demise.<br><br>The action sequences, great. The casting, great. The theme song, great.\nThe story / script, did someone forget it.<br><br>Like most people, I've seen all the films, most at the cinema. Like\nmost, we all forgive the implausibility of some scenes (action),\nbecause overall everything else makes up for them. Like most, we leave\nthe cinema with a feeling that we have enjoyed what we spent our dosh\non. But this time I left feeling let down, something was not right,\nsomething was missing, and in this case it was a story. Even Moonraker\nhad that.\n"
"\nAre you nuts?? Superb? Wow? What is this? 7.8 in IMDb? Who writes these\nreviews? Bond movie without gadgets? Bond movie without feeling? Bond\nmovie without proper script? Bond movie with worst gay villain ever?\nBond movie with worst act ever? Bond movie with about 20 minutes of\naction and the rest is just boring stuff. Come on? Two Hours and 20\nminutes for this foolishness? What they were thinking? I am a hardcore\nBond Movies fan and I always have enjoyed his movies.I thought Son\nConnery and Roger Moore, were the best actors. Don't get me wrong, I\nliked very much Casino Royale and Daniel's Graig performance. Quantum\nof Solace was mediocre, but Skyfall is by far the worst high-budget\nmovie ever. Not only for a Bond movie, Anyway, if you are a Bond fan I\nsuggest you skip this movie, period! (The only thing that counts is the\nopening title scene and Adele's song)\n"
"\nI do not believe this to be the best Bond film, the problem I have is\nwith Javier Bardem's performance.Up until his entrance the film has\nbeen outstanding with a great opening sequence and build up of tension\nUnfortunately I felt his performance was too camp and I found it hard\nto believe he had once been a great secret agent. Also in terms of the\nstory I found it annoying that Bond did not try to kill Silver after he\nkilled Severine.,instead slaughtering the hired help.If Bond had tried\nto kill him but ran out of bullets I would have preferred it<br><br>It would have been more visceral had Bond been more injured when the\nunderground train crashed around him .Also when Silva has a few spots\nof blood on his face after the helicopter and house blew up I would\nhave preferred to see him fight out from a pile of debris with his.\nface caked in blood\n"
"\nTechnically stunning, but it simply does not work as It used to do. Too\nmany meaningless killings and the humor is totally absent. Everything\nis simply very serious, and I really missed all the funny small catchy\nscenes that has characterized former James Bond movies. I do not\nunderstand the psychology of the bad-ass villain, certainly not his\n'homoerotic' appearance (apparently all his killings were not enough to\nmake him sufficiently psychopathic). I usually love Badem and Dinch -\nbut honestly here their acting is far from their usual standards. I\nguess I must blame the directing that has focused on shootings and\nexplosions, and missed the story.\n"
"\nMr Sam Mendes has had the nerve to take one of the cinema's biggest\nmoney - spinners and,well,spin it. In doing so he has made the first\nJames Bond film that can stand on its merits and not merely drape\nitself round a carefully staged star performance. Certainly Mr D.Craig\nis more than adequate as OO7,albeit a slightly diminished 007,a bit\nworn round the edges,but he is not meant to dominate \"Skyfall\",neither\ndoes he.Instead Mr Mendes uses an ageing Bond as a discourse on\nacknowledging the past and accepting that actions have consequences. In\naddition to this new reading of a very familiar character he has\nbrought joined - up film - making to the franchise,during the course of\nwhich there are many joyous references from \"The lady from Shanghai\" to\nIndiana Jones that had me laughing with delight;not a reaction one has\ncome to expect a Bond film,however slick,to produce. Miss J.Dench - a\nbruised and vulnerable \"M\"- gives her best film performance for some\ntime. \"Skyfall\" gives force to the argument that film is a directors'\nmedium.\n"
"\nI'm a major bond fan and historian and this film makes me sick. I\ndidn't think the indecipherable Quantum Of Solace could be beaten but\nthis is a heavy contender.<br><br>I can't add a lot to what other 1-star reviews have said. I just want\nto say that the end scene (Bond at the Skyfall Castle) is so ridiculous\nand so flawed that it's laughable. It's Home Alone for Adults - AKA\nHome Alone 3. Sadly there is no Joe Pesci to liven the mood. Just a\ndepressing, silly, unconscionably stupid plot that tries to entertain\nbut fails in every area. <br><br>No gadgets and in fact outright contempt for gadgets (did the writers\nsee any previous Bond flicks? -- this is a major part of Bond movies)<br><br>Bond seduces a girl who has admitted she has been sexually abused her\nentire life. A truly stomach-turning scene. This sweet, innocent girl\nthen gets brutally murdered in front of Bond as he does nothing to stop\nit. Never, ever, ever would Bond allow this to happen. Not only does he\nnot stop it, he shows no remorse.<br><br>Baring its heavy contender QOS, the worst Bond ever.\n"
"\nThere are so many issues with this film it isn't funny. First, on the\ntrain when Bond is shot; why doesn't the agent empty the rifle on the\nenemy she missed? Silly. In the casino, Bond loses his gun, but after\ngetting back to the top of the bridge, walks away without picking up\nthe pistol. How could the antagonist escape from his glass enclosed\nprison? The scene at \"M's\" hearing with the shootout was silly. The\nantagonist couldn't escape that. The showdown at Skyfall was equally\nsilly. Good effects, but stupid. Even if \"M\" could escape to the\nchapel, she would obviously hide and the grounds keeper would get\nseveral shots off. The antagonist would have killed \"M\" upon site\nwithout the drama. And Bond's killing him was silly. This movie is at\nbest a \"B\" movie with effects. A truly terrible Bond film!\n"
"\nIt lacks a real plot, which is known for bond movie. Sometimes its\nreally boring as when shaving of bond by Eve. It is really a gun\nfighting even some TV serials are better. It lacks the magnificent sets\nthat are usually there. No real story line. Action sequences at the\nstart are good. Moonracker is better than this movie. The villain puts\nout stunts from not known things. Daniel Greg is good. Lack story.\nExpect better from Bond Movie. For the 50th Bond movie it is not as\nexpected. Even the Burn Notice TV serial is better watching. Sometimes\nit is too slow for a Bond movie.Lots of gun fighting. The escape of\nVillain from prison is also is very unrealistic.\n"
"\nWARNING: Contains Spoilers<br><br>This is like someone dying at a wedding while letting out a huge wet\nfart right after the priest says: <br><br>\"You may kiss the bride\".<br><br>It is just an awful movie. The beginning was okay, albeit too long but\nthen I almost fell asleep for the rest of the movie. We are given no\nreason to care for any of the characters except one that gets killed of\nwhile bond does nothing to stop it.<br><br>The main villain gets killed by bond with a knife between the shoulder-\nblades which I suspect is a clever way of saying; \"Look, he got stabbed\nin the back again, just like that one time with the Chinese.\"<br><br>If you really like Bond movies or movies in general do not watch this.\nIt is an absolute waste of your time. It is boring, full of plot holes,\nweak characters and poor pacing and storytelling.\n"
"\nI tried to like it but the plot had more holes than Homeland and that\nis saying something. It is as if it was written by the Baddie (Silva)\nas he seems to know every move and every turn in advance. When he pops\nout of the tube station a car just happens to pull up for him right on\ntime. There is more chance of him winning the lottery. Everything is\njust so right on time. If he was that smart why didn't he go straight\nto his intended victim instead of wasting two hours of my time in the\ncinema! How come we have a Spaniard working for M15, for Queen and\nCountry? Maybe his parents were British! If you have seen the movie,\njust think about it. There were bits of plot just stuck in there for\nthe sake of action all the way along. If you were going to assassinate\nsomebody you would not kill everyone you met in the building on the way\nto your target. Not very professional. It is the last Bond movie I will\npay to see.\n"
"\n*************SPOILERS*************<br><br>Honestly...i never had much expectations from this new bond movie but\nconsidering the last 2 in its series and of course D.Craig,i believed\nthis would be a game changer.It was possibly the worst movie i have\nseen this year....since prometheus,which was pretty bad too. So the\nmovie starts OK with some clichéd action sequences...nothing great. So\nBond is shot but recovers and leads a life of retirement.Now is when it\ngets worse.<br><br>I wont dwell into the story much but it sucked...big time...there was\nno substance,no character development and no interesting action\nsequences...It was a wannabe movie that had nothing to\ngive...commercial Bullsh*t made to rip people off their time and money<br><br>To say it was inspired by nolan's TDK would be an insult to Mr. Nolan.\nCant believe mendes made such a bad movie<br><br>WHAT A FREAKING RIP OFF....\n"
"\nMy first viewing of Skyfall left me a little frustrated at the slow\npace in the first half. However the story did catch speed in the\nsecond, and by the end i felt it was overall slightly better than\nCasino Royale. On reflection , however, there was a lot to appreciate\nfrom this Bond movie. An ageing James Bond , with his powers in\napparently terminal decline, refuses to give up against all the odds,\neven against a fitter, though older , villain.A lot of the action is\nwithout any fancy gadgets . Similarly, M's unwavering belief in Bond's\nability to do his bit when the time of reckoning comes is commendable.\nThe reference to Lord Alfred Tennyson's Ulysses was heart touching, and\nremains my favourite scene from the movie. The movie showcases Bond as\na human being first and a secret agent next, and shows a human side of\nhim which many thought never existed. The movie has a lot apart from\njust action sequences ( which are aplenty , mind you) and that makes me\nfeel in retrospect that this is the best Bond movie I have seen in my\nlifetime (have only seen them in the last decade).\n"
"\nThis movie has so little to do with the original Bond series and Ian\nFleming would not only roll over in his grave but come back to haunt\nthe current franchise owners and screenwriters himself. This movie left\neveryone shocked at how BORING and UNAUTHENTIC this Bond flick could\nbe. I left and went to bathroom and missed nothing at all, the plot has\nso many loose ends and clichés it sickened me. The writers have killed\nBOND as we know him and everything that makes James Bond the cool spy\nwe grew to love. The only thing in the movie I liked was the house and\nthe dogs. No gadgets, no Bond car, no Bond girl, no suspense, no\ntwists, no action. A complete waste! I WILL NEVER SEE ANOTHER BOND\nRELEASE AGAIN! GO BUY THE OLD SERIES ON DVD OR SEE ANOTHER MOVIE!!!!\n"
"\nI grew up with Bond, from Dr No to Die Another Day and will no doubt\nwatch all the iterations again when shown on TV. This changed with\nCasino Royale. Gritty yes, like the everyday world around us. Bond was\nescape. Now no more humour, no more wit, no more charm. At the time of\nQuantum of Solace, I didn't even know there had been another Bond movie\nwith Daniel Craig. I was surprised to see it on TV for the first time.\nIt wasn't that good but it was somewhat entertaining the first time\naround. Then came Skyfall and it's nonsense scenario. I saw this in the\ntheatre and wondered about the pointless action, the silly hacking, the\nplot holes... When it came on TV a few months back, I didn't even\nbother to watch it again. And I sure won't go for the upcoming Spectre.\nI agree that Bond had to be updated but Broccoli's new Bond is an\nageing creep, a killing machine matching those he used to fight against\nin previous films.Rest in peace James Bond. You will be missed.\n"
"\nThis movie was long, boring and mentally painful.<br><br>The opening scene was decent action, even though a lot of it did not\nmake sense. The rest of the movie dragged on and on with little action\nand a boring plot. <br><br>I struggled to stay awake. The last 30 minutes I constantly yawned and\nshifted in my seat. If you are lucky enough to have read this before\ngoing to the show, you have been warned.<br><br>I don't understand how this movie has such high user reviews on IMDb.<br><br>I don't understand how a movie this bad even gets made in 2012.\nGranted, I know next to nothing about filmmaking and I certainly could\nnot make something better, but the people who do this for a living do\nnot have the same excuse.\n"
"\nSkyfall, the third movie starring Daniel Craig as Bond, is a sequel\nmade to be just as compelling as the older movies; but nevertheless\nSkyfall ignores the events of Casino Royale and Quantum of Solace and\ntakes place sometime later. The events of the last two movies are\nnon-existent in this follow-up as there is no given detail of what had\nhappened thereafter. Nevertheless, Skyfall manages to tell a new story\nin Bond's life and this sequel really explores the character both\nphysically and emotionally, which wasn't really done a lot in the older\nmovies. The well written script and action sequences are terrific, but\ntowards the second half of the movie, story becomes very weak, but\nthere is enough throwbacks and an explosive action-packed finale to get\nviewer's attention and the lust for another Bond sequel.\n"
"\nI am a huge bond lover. I have been watching bond movies since the\nbeginning... But this one was not good in almost every aspect... The\nolder bond movies had that IT appeal.. They had great writing,\nbelievable stories and truly sinister villains....this bag of pooh was\ntoo long, the story was awful and the main villain was not well acted\nand not scary... Least i forget that the new Q is like 15 years old and\nshould be playing with tonka toys instead of government gadgets... I\nreally hope they stop making these abominations....the bond series has\nnot been good since Goldeneye\n"
"\nI confess that I am not a Bond fanatic, but in recent decades I saw\nthem on TV and the life of a secret agent remains interesting\nphenomenon. That is why I was surprised at how much I look forward to\nthe Skyfall; brilliant actors, a brilliant director, a a decent\nscreenwriter. It's always Big Bang-type start, because they wanted to\nraise up the blood pressure of viewers and they use it thousands of\nscenarios. James Bond - survived the unimaginable. Never mind, I\nthought, it starts up and begins the film. Well, it would not start. We\nsee the new center, a description of the mission, he came to the\nmission, but throughout I thought something was wrong. The film is\nslow, the scenes are long and one-sided. Here, let me tell you: I did\nnot like the story, I did not like the way the film is sometimes slowed\ndown. All together I did not like it.\n"
"\nI wish there was a 0 rating. Confusing, meaningless plot. Are all Brits\nterse and sarcastic all the time? Judy Dench is always good, but she\ncan't save this shipwreck. Good thing I saw it on Amazon Prime. I'd\nhave walked out of the theater after paying $10. The coloring is\ninconsistent, making it irritating. There is no wit and charm. Just\ndrivel dialogue until the next shoot out. Save your viewing time and\nwatch an old Lassie. You'll get something out of that, at least. I did\nlike the use of the old Astin Martin. And they played some of the old\nBond music themes. Be thankful for small mercies! Too many scenes where\nthere is no movement on the screen and silence.\n"
"\nWhat a fvckin' shame. What a fvckin' tragedy.<br><br>If this is a Bond film then I am Sean Connery's toupee.<br><br>I have taken dumps more entertaining than this thing. What were they\nthinking by ruining all that we love about the Bond movies?<br><br>The lead actor looks like a construction worker who's been told to wear\na suit - and looks uncomfortable doing so. James Bond is an Eton\neducated, sophisticated wine expert - yet these films present us with\nan actor who's demeanour and look are distinctly British lower class.\nBasically, the new Bond looks like a construction worker or a nightclub\ndoorman. If we can't even buy into our leading mans suitability then\nhow are we to become invested in the rest of the goings on? <br><br>The rest of the goings on: Boring, lifeless garbage. A stain on a once\ngreat franchise.<br><br>- Michael LePlastique, August, 2015\n"
"\nThe only thing bond about this flick are the incidentals (his name is\nbond, he works for mi6 etc.) Everything else feels generic. Honestly, I\ntried to give Craig a shot, I really did but I shut this and casino\nroyale off halfway through. There's just nothing there to hold your\ninterest. The plot is near nonexistent, if it's in there,its so drawn\nout and disjointed you just stop caring. The characters are\nforgettable, if not down right despicable. The action is nothing you\ncan't see in a thousand other flicks. I get that they wanted to\nhumanize bond, make it more believable, but all they did is suck the\nlife out of it. Go watch a Bourne flick if you want drama and grit.\nThis has none.\n"
"\nHow this movie got a rating of 7.8 I don't know. Actually, it is part\nof an increasing trend I'm seeing on IMDb where rating scores seem to\nbe manipulated. There are quite a few movies in the Top 250 of all time\nthat very clearly should not be.<br><br>Best thing about Skyfall - the theme song. That's it.<br><br>Worst thing - the plot, or more precisely, the total lack of a plot.\nLet me be clear about this, there is no plot at all - not even an\nunrealistic plot, none whatsoever.<br><br>Instead of a plot, it has a series of half-baked, overused, puerile\nsemi-excuses to glue together a few comic-book inspired \"action\"\nsequences. Those \"action\" sequences are about as realistic as pigs with\nwings.<br><br>This reduces Bond to \"Bond good guy. Fights bad guy.\" A sad day for\nFleming when a supposed Bond movie is even worse than one of the Fast &amp;\nFurious movies I accidentally watched the other week. (No idea which\none.) <br><br>I wish there was more to comment on, but \"Skyfall\" is to movies what a\n\"Scandinavian Blue\" is to parrots.\n"
"\nI didn't enjoy the movie and found the plot lacking common sense in\nmost places. I want to highlight the following points:<br><br>How the hell does bond not die after being hit by the bullet from\nMoneypenny and falling into a river? So many illogical scenes\nthroughout. How the villain comes with so many people? This guy is an x\nagent and is obviously crazy. How did he form an army? Where did he get\nthe money? How did he hack into the most secure computers when he had\nno technical knowledge? In the scene he blows the metro train into\nBond, how come he had a bomb planted exactly there? Did he know Bond\nwas going to accost him at exactly that point? How come Bond lets his\ngirl die?<br><br>I mean, I don't want to be a stickler for logic but this one really\nlack s it. Also of course there are no thrills, comedy or\nentertainment! Unlike the previous Bond movies such as Casino Royale!\n"
"\nOh my God - where do I start? WHERE DO I START? Look, I never expected\nthis movie to be realistic, but I did not expect it to be so\nunbelievable that I thought I was watching a cartoon - made with real\nactors. I mean I nearly turned it off when that villain talk out half\nhis reconstructed face with this hand. WTF??<br><br>Oh and the $5 billion dollars in damage this idiot causes? He should\nhave been fired not praised! <br><br>And what was the point of the stupid thing? THERE WAS NO POINT!! No\npoint at all! Not one! <br><br>UGH! I will be scarred for the entire week after watching this hideous,\nridiculous, joke of a movie! AWFUL, JUST BL00DY AWFUL!<br><br>I see some people have given it 8 or more stars. ARE YOU RETARDED?\n"
"\nSo hard to come to terms that this was a sub-par movie at best. After\nCasino Royale and Qos I was expecting at least an average movie. Where\nto begin? (Spoilers coming) Him dying in the beginning with no\nexplanation how he came back, spending so much time on dialog that\ndoesn't advance the plot, a random scene with a random woman in bed for\nabout 30 seconds, killing the next 'bond' woman without even any hint\nof sadness, a horribly-horribly predictable \"final bad guy battle\"....\nI could go on and on. Just so disappointed. I'm at a loss for how\nanyone could fully enjoy this movie. Honestly, you'd be much better off\njust watching Casino Royale again.\n"
"\nI don't write reviews its my 1st review about any movie,I think Bond's\nMovies are somehow different than any Hollywood action movies,this\ncharacter contains its own charisma and action,which isolates him with\nany other traditional action hero of Hollywood,but after watching Sky\nfall with a rating of 8.1/10, i started to think why this movie got\n8,this is a traditional Hollywood action movie but it got something\nmore special that it has no story at all,Danial Craig is pathetically\nwasted in this movie.Bond without gadgets is not Bond,stop making bond\nmovies but don't don't make deteriorate this charismatic character in\nthe hands of such Franchises which know how to deal with a bond movie.\n"
"\nHearing great reviews I couldn't help wanting to watch my first ever\nbond movie. I knew it was my mistake from the very beginning. This was\na drag of a movie, and whoever said that its more emotional and\nintelligent movie was clearly kidding. I couldn't understand the\nemotional side of Bond. in the climax bond ends up at his ancestral\nhome, trying to show how he had a sad past, but in the end he says he\nalways hated the house before blowing it up. I mean WTF!!<br><br>throughout the entire movie Daniel Craig carried one single expression\nand I couldn't understand what he was trying to emote. Javier was good,\nbut he was typical villain, a poor mans Joker. Judi was also good but\nso disappointed with her choice of this movie. Rest no one is worth\nmentioning, not the babes, no one.<br><br>truly a waste of 2 and a half hours of anyones time. Whoever found it\nintelligent, please watch Dark Knight again\n"
"\nI can only assume that the DVD that I purchased, must have had a\ndifferent version of Skyfall to all the reviewers giving this film 8, 9\nand even 10 out of 10.<br><br>I have always been a viewer of reviews, but in all honesty I had to\ncreate an account just to vent my anger at having paid £15.00 for this\nmassively overrated, badly written, boring and badly cobbled together\nfilm.<br><br>This film has more holes than a tea strainer and about as much\nentertainment value as watching paint dry, but what makes this a real\nshame is that I think Daniel Craig could, with a good script, make the\nbest James Bond ever.<br><br>To sum up, save your money, ignore the hype and wait to it comes on\ntelly!\n"
"\nnonsense from start to finish.....nothing makes much sense....if you\nlike a movie that simply has everyone running and jumping aimlessly, a\nvillain that is laughable, everyone is a complete idiot and\nincompetent, and absolutely no plot, this is the movie for you...one of\nthe absolutely worst Bond movies ever.....only thing worse would be to\nbring back Roger Moore......wait for the DVD or stream it to your\nIPhone (still a waste of time and money)......next up for Bond....a Mad\nPlumber plans to clog all the toilets in London....by using 'non\nflushable wipes' ....yikes!!!! ...only Bond can stop him and his evil\nplumber apprentice henchman.....\n"
"\nI can only be brief about my experience tonight at the theater...it was\ndisappointing to say the least. A poor attempt to make a raw and darker\nversion of something that is supposed to be a tribute to a formula that\nmixes action, humor, love, drama, a display of modern technology and\nbeautiful settings and locations...almost succeeded but not quite.<br><br>Nevertheless I could see what the makers tried to do but every aspect\nthat was given attention in the movie was 'to short' and therefor\ninsignificant. For example: a Bond villain needs to have the jaw of\nJaws, a hook as a hand, a white cat or a tear of blood as a give\naway...I didn't get the villain in this movie. Maybe I was supposed to\nknow this character from a book but mainly I found the guy very\nfeminine and not very strong...apparently there was a history but there\nwas not a real attempt to have the audience hate this guy...it just\nwasn't right. <br><br>It just wasn't right...<br><br>Sorry...hope in the next three years they will keep it real and do\nbetter job...\n"
"\nI'm not one to give single star ratings just to lower an IMDb average,\nbut I was really tempted in this case. I have never seen so many plot\nholes and idiotic, contrived twists in such an expensive production\nbefore. With so many brilliant screenwriters in Hollywood, one just has\nto wonder how they could screw this up so badly. The premise was cool,\nthe execution terrible. Suspending disbelief is one thing, being asked\nto ignore your brain completely is another. Great job guys, the way\nthis is going, the next Bond film will only be watchable by school\nchildren. Even the action scenes were boring, but that wouldn't matter,\nif the film wasn't riddled with so many \"Come on now, why?\" moments. To\ntop everything off, you have the least desirable Bond girl of all time\nand a Mannipeni you couldn't care less for.\n"
"\nI have to say this was one of the worst James Bond movie I have ever\nseen. This was such a waste of time, money and talent of all those good\nactors. The only thing kept from the James Bond character is his name.\nThe man can not even order his favourite drink, he has to reach for\nHeineken. What would be next, are they going to make him wear a skirt\njust because someone will pay money to see him in skirt?! The only\nmotive in the movie is to make money of it, there is nothing else in\nit. <br><br>It's a disgrace and betrayal of the James Bond character. They are\nkilling the character.\n"
"\nThis is a dark Bond film but not as gritty, sophisticated, and elegant\nas Casino Royale. It's been a big let down since the reboot of Casino\nRoyale. Quantum of Solace and Skyfall are just awful. There are so many\nflaws in the plot and the Bond feeling just isn't there. The storyline\noverall is a very cliché and I've never been so bored from watching a\nBond movie. Craig makes a great Bond and Casino Royale is easily one of\nthe best Bond movies. But I think they've been just hiring the wrong\ndirectors since then. The cinematography is great but the direction\nisn't clear, action is subpar and the character development (especially\nthe villain) just isn't there. They might need to bring back Martin\nCampbell to revive the series. I have no idea how the heck this movie\ngot so many positive reviews from so called professional critics.\n"
"\nFilm critcs raved that this was a return to form -- a classic Bond\nfilm. That wasn't my take on it. Casino Royale beat it by miles IMHO. I\nfound it a disappointment.<br><br>The visuals were terrific for the most part but the plot was clichéd\nand full of holes. I understand that Bond films are by nature\nfantastical but the longer this film went on the less fantastical and\nthe more dull/ridiculous it became.<br><br>Daniel Craig's face looks like an immovable bag of spanners throughout\nwhilst Javier Badem's bad blond dye-job simply does not work --\nespecially when dressed as a policeman. Who thought that was a good\nidea??? Where were the Bond babes? Eve didn't cut mustard and the other\nwoman was like blink and you'll miss her. The only scene that sizzled\nended up being the homo-erotic interrogation but they didn't have the\nballs to pursue that strand so instead we got more bunkum like ueber\nEnglish Judi Dench quoting Tennyson and Albert Finney's Hoots, Mon,\nthere's a moose loose about this hoose Scottish Caretaker.<br><br>It just didn't work for me.\n"
"\nI will not write much stuff here. I just wanted to say that this was\nnot a Bond movie it was something else. Maybe the directors/producers\netc didn't watch the previous movies to see how it goes.<br><br>I wanted to say something to all those that voted 8+ and wrote comments\nlike :\"best Bond movie\" :resurrection of Bond\" etc etc. Did you guys\nwatched the same movie that I watched? Seriously someone (from the\nproduction) must have created 200 free IMDb accounts and voted\nexcellent.<br><br>Too bad nowadays everything is about the franchise and money that a 007\nmovie can <br><br>Too bad that I wasted 2 and a half hours for this B-movie.\n"
"\nAlways listened to Mark Kermode and pretty much most times his movie\nreviews would be spot on for me, but not this time. I think it takes a\nstrong person to swim against the tide with a review in a movie's home\ncountry, especially when patriotism is all around.<br><br>+NO DETAILS HERE SO THERE'S NO SPOILERS+ <br><br>This Bond isn't really Bond at all, he's a mismatch of a cretinous\nthug, Batman and The Transporter, with a dash of mummy love thrown in\nto add something else that doesn't work.<br><br>Forget glamour, forget espionage and spying because there is none and\nthis isn't Bond. Fleming would not like this Bond and it is an affront\nto peoples intelligence to say this is the best Bond movie ever.<br><br>People used to go to a Bond movie expecting gripping action and a\nglamorous escape, but for many the only escape they want is hoping to\nescape the cinema! Truly awful for all the reasons mentioned by so\nmany.<br><br>Don't waste your time or money, I did and it's annoyed me since!\n"
"\nThis movie is hardly a James Bond movie. Reduced to the level of an\naction movie. With no story, holes in the meager story, no gadgets, no\nspy thing, no substantial Villain. <br><br>It was brought down to the level of a Brainless Action, when James Bond\ndecides to take on the enemy in a non tech. manner as he is no good\nwith technology. <br><br>In a nutshell this is nothing like what we expect from a James Bond\nmovie.<br><br>Those who may have rated it better may be fond of Action Movies with no\nIQ.\n"
"\nI had to review this movie! I just don't understand why is it getting\ngood votes if every single person I speak to is hating it. Bond movie\nhas a very specific formula Attractive and British agent Womaniser\nHeartbreaker FUNNY with subtle sense of humor. Awesome cars latest\ngadgets And great plot It has to start with the best graphics and music\nHas to have at least a super sexy Bond girl and a super sexy Bad Girl.\nSkyfall should be rather called Skyfaill. No girls, no gadgets, no\ncars... Boring. You gave us a radio tracker(fist size ) and a\nfingerprint gun?... Seriously?? I love bond movies, wasn't impressed by\nCasino Royale, thought Quantum of Boredom... Oops of Solace was bad but\nthis really beats them all. Bond movie just died, can it get any\nworse?. Casino Royale compared to this was a masterpiece... Don't waste\ntime or money to watch it at movies... Btw they even managed to have a\nBlack Moneypenny. Why don't we make Naomi Campell play Liza Taylor,\nrite?..\n"
"\nThis movie is the worse of 007! Not the common action, neither the\nemotion, neither nothing... <br><br>just a creative-less film about a handsome guy that can fight without\nget a bad appearance... <br><br>disgusting for the mind! <br><br>And why in nominated for Oscar...? I think that the system is\ncorrupted... and someone is not doing the real job!<br><br>Sorry... Bud that is what I think, I think that I'm free to express\nmyself<br><br>because maybe I can't be OK... or maybe I can be OK... or maybe I can\nbe in between...<br><br>but just, see the movie and comment me back. :)\n"
"\nI thought this Bond movie was going to be one of the best i've ever\nseen. Craig as ever, fits the role really well. Plenty of action and\nsuspense from the very start with a good plot. BUT....after about an\nhour things start to go downhill. The end scene was one of the more\ndisappointing that i've seen in a Bond film. M gets far too involved in\nthis movie. Dench acts as Craig's side kick, getting into almost as\nmuch of the action as Bond himself does. Way over the top. Lets be\nrealistic....would a high ranking middle class female civil servant\nbased in Westminster really go around shooting guns at arch villains? M\nneeds to get back into his/her office where they belong! Where was the\nbeautiful Bond girl that Bond needed to protect in the final scene? The\nfinal scene has plenty of action but the scenario was corny! Worth a\nwatch but you may at the end be a little disappointed!\n"
"\ni saw this movie two weeks before. i was expecting continuation of\ncasino Royal and quantum of solace.there was no connection to previous\none, what happened to the previous one. truth is it didn't even look\nlike bond movie. the beginning was good then the movie is completely\nlost actually it became ordinary villain try to revenge the boss who\nmade his life terrible and the hero (bond?) tried to stop and fails.\nthe worst seen is the bond crying, so touching what is he aim for the\nOscar.i think they made this film just to introduce new M, money-penny\nand the scientist guy, i don,t recommend any one to see this movie. if\nyou want waste your time and money go and see it.\n"
"\nThe worst Bond movie ever. The plot is absurd and you have to check\nyour brains at the door. This movie was so bad I signed up for IMDb\njust to warn someone \"DO NOT SEE THIS MOVE UNLESS YOU WANT TO BE EVEN\nMORE BORED\". There were so many scenes that defy reality I don't know\nwhere to start. I'm not talking about ordinary reality. I mean the\nworld of Bond reality. I was surprised they didn't give him a time\nmachine and star trek teleporter to get around, \"beam me to China\nScotty\". They could have put a few Martian bad guys and you wouldn't\nhave known the difference. This movie was about the money Hollywood\nmakes from Bond movies. I just can't believe this movie got an 8 out of\n10. Is the public really this stupid or were a lot of people paid to\nwrite how great this movie was. I wish I were a real critic so that I\ngive justice in describing this mess.I'll just say if you watch it YOU\nWERE WARNED !!!\n"
"\nI won't go on about all the errors in Skyfall and there are many. And I\nwon't go on about the wooden acting (Moneypenny and Q) and stuntmen\nshowing or the continuity errors and terrible sets.<br><br>What bugs me is that this Bond isn't an escapism movie anymore and this\nBond isn't a spy, a secret agent. Most people have missed this\ndifference and though some say this is Fleming's Bond I think those\npeople cannot have read his little books at all. Skyfall's Bond is\ntotally unrecognisable as Bond. By that I do not mean that he should\nhave an exploding toupee and cloaking device, but he should be a spy\nand there should be intrigue, suspense and intelligence.<br><br>This cretinous Bond is boring, the plot is boring even with the M love\nmummy complexes added, all this stuff is very unBond and very boring.\nTrue Bond fans won't like this movie and I have yet to meet anybody who\nlikes the film, at best they have said 'well, it was OK' As a Bond fan\nand fan of Craig in Casino Royale I despair at yet another reboot when\nEon had already successfully rebooted, what are they thinking of?\n"
"\nVery sad. I took my son to his first Bond movie. I loved Bond as a\nchild. This movie was so boring I fell asleep and my son wanted to go\ndo something else. When I asked him what he wanted to do, he said\nanything. I honestly couldn't wait for it to end.<br><br>Stolen agent list? That's original. What happened to it? Did they ever\nrecover it? Did the villain have special magical hacking powers? Was\nhis mother a computer chip? You know what, I could go on and on but\nfrankly, I have already spent way to much of my life taking about this\nhorrible movie.<br><br>Was I just tired? Was I expecting too much? What do critics take before\nthey review movies? I want some!!!\n"
"\nThis film is a good example of lazy writing. The story is pushed along\nwithout any consideration of reality, logic, or sense. The writers\nwanted something to happen...so it did...with no thought of how to make\nit logically happen. Computers solve all problems and can search for\nanything! People escape from inescapable cells without any explanation\nof how they did it. Elevators are, apparently, now designed so open and\ndangerous that people can simply jump into the cable and lift area\nwithout a problem. Motorcyles can ride on the tiled rooftops of\nbuildings at 60 mph without ever running into the edge of the building.\nThe list goes on and on!<br><br>We all have to suspend some belief when enjoying a movie...however,\nthis movie takes that premise and carries it to new heights.<br><br>This movie is the worst James Bond I have ever seen.\n"
"\nWhat a weak movie! after the fascinating Casino Royale the newest film\nof the bond series is the weakest film of the Daniel Craig Bond era.\nthe screenplay and the storyline are unacceptable... sometimes there\nare so stupid scenes that I thought that can't be true. It was a big\ndisappointment from the beginning to the end of the Film. Sometimes the\nfilm is like a psycho- thriller and there are references to other films\nlike Die hard or the Nolan films which are also abolutely problematic.\nThe action scenes are without tempo and without creative elements.\nThere are no gadgets and the simple storyline gives the film not much\ntension. The film is also twenty minutes too long. <br><br>I think that Sam Mendes has absolutely failed to create a bond film. It\nwas a major surprise for me and a very disappointing experience. I love\nCasino Royale. Bond, please come back...<br><br>sad for bond fans and sad for normal viewers...\n"
"\nI dunno if you guys get this one but comparing to M:I4 Ghost Protocol\nthis was a masterpiece.<br><br>Many similarities here and there but still surprisingly good. And\nreally, back to the roots. Only few things made me little disappointed\nwith this one was bond getting too erm. weird. It actually worked.<br><br>Not too much explosions (well there are..) not too much cgi-crap etc.\nand it got cooler every minute.<br><br>Really interesting bond for a long time. Actually needs brains a bit to\nwatch this one, if you have seen them all I'll bet you get the idea\nwith this one.<br><br>This was a comeback, I waited something like explode everything, slow\nmotion effects, stupid sequences but really really inspired with this\none.<br><br>One thing I don't get the hype of this movie, it stands on it's own\ngreatly.<br><br>For bond fans: 9/10\n"
"\nThis is one of the better Bond movies as I see it. The directing is\nexcellent, as is the cinematography and music. Javier Bardem is great\nas a baddie, though he could have used a bit more background. He is\nover the top, but it suits the genre. In comparison, we get more\nbackground for Bond and M.<br><br>The plot is good and has a good flow to it, though the movie feels ever\nso slightly bloated in the beginning and the end. The action is well\npaced and free of annoying shaky-cam work. The dialogue is witty (more\nso than usual), though too much of the good stuff is given away in the\ntrailer. It definitely feels less of a Jason Bourne movie than the last\ntwo.<br><br>Location-wise, Skyfall spends more time in Britain than any other in\nthe series as far as I can recall. I like this change and it's nice to\nsee more of MI6.<br><br>In all it's well worth watching and a great Bond movie.\n"
"\nFirst time i saw Skyfall i found it boring and i fell asleep but the\n2nd time i watched it it was pretty good but not the best Bond film\never made in my list of good Bond movies sure yes but better than\nCasino? hell no. There are some pretty laughable scenes in this movie\nwhen he gets shot and falls into the water that is funny i wonder why\nhe didn't shot Moneypenny when he saw her. Anyways i think this movie\nhad everything that you need to watch in a film like this action,\nsuspense and great villains and a good script it never reaches the\nheights of the first film but it's still a great Bond film. Let's hope\nSpectre is as good as this and the last 2.\n"
"\nVery good cinematography and entertaining action sequences make this\none worth watching.<br><br>The story was rather predictable and the screen writing was mediocre\n(much of the dialogue was tedious). The idea of James Bond dying and\nthen mysteriously coming back to life was a bit silly, and how he\nsurvived was not really explained in the movie. <br><br>But on a positive note there's some fine performances by Javier Bardem,\nDaniel Craig and some of the others.<br><br>It always seemed to me Judi Dench was not the right person to play \"M\",\nbut thankfully the next one will have Ralph Fiennes in that role.\n"
"\nI thought the first Daniel Craig movie, Casino Royale was a decent step\nin the right direction after the ridiculous Pierce Brosnan period where\nBond was in full on self aware parody mode. But after QoS and now this,\nthis Bond has veered too much to the other direction. Look, if you\ndon't like Bond, then don't be making Bond movies. There's plenty of\nother scripts out there.<br><br>This Emo Bond and his ridiculous blond villain with his lame mama\nissues plot and his hipster Q who hates gadgets and his henpecking M\nand his home alone Scottish hideaway, enough. Go away already. Even his\ndour facesake , Vladimir the Putin seems to be having more fun than\nthis emotionally wrenched soul. <br><br>Please bring back the dashing, fun loving agent we all fell in love\nwith. And the rifle opening.\n"
"\nJust stop with the re-booted Bond. Does this guy ever smile? Why so\nserious Bond? Maybe if we tickle him? Does he ever say anything funny\nor clever anymore? <br><br>OK, some toys, plenty of action, etc. and it fulfills all of it's low\nambitions. But Craig is wearing thin with this whole serious actor bit.\nI like Shakespeare a lot actually, but this is James Bond, so please\njust stop making it more \"sophisticated,\" \"better reflective of the\ntimes we are living in,\" and all that other miscellaneous claptrap. <br><br>Next up--Goth Bond starring Johnny Depp. (I probably shouldn't have\nmade that last comment, since now I'm sure production will start in a\nfew months.) <br><br>Lastly, did anybody count bullets in the beginning scene? I guess they\nhaven't entirely lost their sense of humor.\n"
"\nI got the strong impression that this movie is promoting gay-hating.\nThe only apparently gay character was the villain, who made advances\ntoward Bond. This scene appears to have been introduced solely to\npromote hostility toward gay people. The writers, producers and actors\ndeserve scorn for participating in what appears to be an attempt to\nvilify a group of people through a totally fictional plot. Even though,\nin reality, gay people are probably completely innocent of being super\nvillains and molesting super spies.<br><br>Sadly, it appears that some Brits still have problems with homophobia,\nrooted in archaic Victorian priggery, from which they cannot rise\nabove. <br><br>It is particularly appalling that these people are in the movie\nbusiness where they seek to propagandize their primitive malice through\ndishonest scripts that get produced and acted out.\n"
"\nThe first Craig/Bond movies were a breathtaking, wonderful departure\nfrom the cartoon history which preceded them, where the bad guys were\ndeliberately unbelievable. Suddenly, with Casino Royale, we begin to\npull back the veil of a global organization which actually, undeniably\nexists (google Bilderber Group, the Trilateral Commission). The next\nmovie carried the investigation further, exposing the determination to\ncontrol the world's water supply. One has only to pick up documentaries\nsuch as Blue Gold and Water to realize the truth of these dangers.\nThen, suddenly, weare back to comic figures--a totally unbelievable\ncharacter, an embittered ex-agent, who has somehow amassed the money\nnecessary to finance his incredible obsession for revenge against M.\nWhat bilge. Give us back the Bond with the courage to engage in real\nworld challenges--not more Batman. The movie world is full to brimming\nwith action packed make-believe cop stories--give us something with\ncredibility in it--or has the Bond franchise been taken over by the\norganization it was exposing?\n"
"\nHonestly, I haven't been a big fan of 007 in the recent years. In my\nopinion ever since Daniel Craig joined the franchise there hasn't been\na single 007 movie to would come anywhere close to those made back in\nthe day, which were entertaining, fun and enjoyable. And its not just\nbecause Craig's portraying of Bond is totally different from what the\nprevious ones used to be (wit, handsome and full of irony and humor)\nbut also because with every next movie there is less and less sense in\nthe plot. The most recent edition beats them all from that aspect. We\ncan clearly see that it cost millions of $ to make it, given all the FX\nin the film, but I just wish a fraction of that money had been used to\npay a decent script writer. The movie has got good cast but its not\nenough to cover up the overall meaninglessness of it, which actually\nlasts over 2 hours of screen time. Gave it 2 stars for cast, otherwise\nits not even a 1.\n"
"\nHorrible movie. Horrible characters. The villain was a joke. \"Q\" was\ndisgustingly stupid. The whole thing was just BAD, and I like Daniel\nCraig in the role. Add a bad story with terrible casting and a monkey\nfor a director....you get Skyfall. The \"cutting edge\" gadget is a gps\ntracker that is included on every cell phone sold today and a \"stupid\"\ngun???? How could you get so desperately lost making a Bond Film? A\nplot with a crazy guy who wants to take over the word, action, babes,\nclever banter and a few one liners, some cool cutting edge gadgets to\nhelp Bond when it looks like his time has finally come, a couple more\nbabes, and WAH-LA...a Bond Movie! It ain't Rocket Science.\n"
"\nI heard many reviews before seeing this film and they were somewhat\nvaried though none were bad. The two main things i heard were either\n'The classic Bond is back' or 'It was better than Quantum of Solace but\nnot as good as Casino Royale'. I however thought it was worse than both\nand that the classic bond was not back. Craig gives an incredibly\nuninspired performance. The ending is reminiscent of Home Alone. The\nplot is poor and the villain seemed to replay Live Free Or Die-hard.\nThe film had Craig try his hand at a one-liner or two to no avail. All\nthis said the film did have some visual competence but, back to the\nnegativity, was shot unwell. I just don't understand what the hype is\naround Skyfall, I very much enjoyed Casino Royale and thought that\nQuantum of Solace was alright as a part two and was visually stunning\nat all times (Granted they didn't feel like original Bond films). But\nSkyfall was, in my opinion, quite terrible throughout. The plot was\nrather pathetic and i felt like i had seen it before in multiple films.\nTo sum this review up, i hated it.\n"
"\nZero Charm - Massive holes in plot - Predictable action. Aside from the\ngreat intro this Bond never gets off the ground, let alone fall from\nthe sky. Where's Bruce Willis, as this film should be renamed as a 'Die\nHard' flick. Truly awful!!! Completely misses the boat as a bond Film!\nThe charm of the Bond films has always been the tongue in cheek nature\nof them. Along with the innately debonair persona of Bond himself.\nDaniel Craig is a good actor, but lacks the charisma to pull of the\nrole of JB and is getting worse with each installment. This type of\ninane smashem up - crashem up flick is everywhere. Javier Bardem makes\na brilliant villain (see 'No Country for Old men') but his talent while\nup to par, is totally wasted here. Again, the disinction of the Bond\nfilms are diminishing into the trite, formulaic low standard of dumb\naction flicks. The franchise now has one less fan.\n"
"\nThe many reviews here have cataloged the glaring weakness of this\nmovie--so I'll just add my own personal observations <br><br>Score: the score of this movie was constantly obtrusive and shared many\nsimilarities with the Batman Begins score.<br><br>Super Villain: How long will it take Hollywood to realize super\nvillains who think of everything--and I mean everything--suck the drama\nout of movies? Judy Dench as Bond girl: yikes.<br><br>Action sequences being monitored by tech analysts: This was somewhat\ncamp-ily acceptable in a soap opera like \"24\", but now it has become a\nHollywood big budget stable.<br><br>Pre-credit action sequence overwhelming the entire movie: check!\nDisolute super hero--err--super agent--going on a bender\" check!\n"
"\nFor me a resounding YES. Here's what I think are the main problems,<br><br>1) Too much focus on M and for me she is useless in the role 2) Too\nmuch focus on Bond taking his top off. 3) Too much background music 4)\nRubbish banter, you felt the actors were embarrassed to say some of the\none-liners so the delivery was bad which made it worse. Mind you Roger\nand Sean would have just about got away with it. 5) Storyline was far\ntoo vague. 6) Film was far too long. 7) Poor Albert Finney - he was\nuseless in this you get the feeling he just turned up to get some easy\nmoney. 8) Stunts were pretty average and the baddies were wooden. 9) Q\nis rubbish<br><br>positives;<br><br>1) Dame M is dead 2) Got to see the DB5.\n"
"\nI watched this film and spend about 2 hours. the plot has so many hole\nand the stories parts were sometimes irrelevant and you just don't\nunderstand what is going on and every thing is like a mystery. like the\nwomen after bond's survival, how he survived, what did the woman was\ndoing in the apartment where the assassination had taken place how did\nshe get to the gambling scene, why did he took 4 million Euro cash,\nstupid escape plan from the last scene and ... At the end I thought\nthat that they had assumed the film was insulting its viewers. I didn't\nliked it at all. although it has a confusing atmosphere but the story\nwas stupidly simple and predictable. don't waste your time by watching\nthis film.\n"
"\nI came up a rating of 6, mostly because these films are always fun and\ngreat looking, regardless of any problems. <br><br>However, I think this is one of the worst 007 films. Here are a few\npoints:<br><br>The scenery and cinematography, as always, are terrific. This was\nprobably great on IMAX.<br><br>I find Daniel Craig to be way too serious and almost constantly pained\nin some way. Granted, in character and in real life, there were a\nnumber of physical setbacks. Past Bonds have always had some degree of\nhumor and fun, but in this film, Craig delivers a few marginally funny\nlines, not convincingly. <br><br>So many eye-rolling absurdities exist, most notably the \"Silence of the\nLambs\" -ish and the \"Batman Begins\"-ish sequences. So many scenarios\nthat are completely unbelievable, regardless of how hard you try to\ntwist them into believability. <br><br>The justification for the villain's actions are a bit silly, if you ask\nme. The character doesn't show much range. <br><br>Overall, it's just not one of the best, not by a long shot.\n"
"\nSuch an awful script. Whats worse is they have stolen bits of other\naction films but still they get it totally wrong. And there are too\nmany holes in the story to mention. How the British media can say this\nis good is just a total embarrassment. You expect it to be a bit silly\ncos its Bond, but this takes it down to another level. The set-ups are\nso implausible and the payoffs so predictable. Bad guy getting caught\nand then escaping so easily? The tube train explosion? And Skyfall is\nthe name of Bond's Scottish home? Not very likely. Plus Bond fails in\nhis mission! The worst thing is how this film's success has been\ncelebrated. Just terrible, like it was written for idiots.\n"

"\nThis is a reboot of the James Bond franchise and it could have been so\nmuch much better.<br><br>When we think about the old James Bond movies we remember borderline\ncrazy stunts and humor combined with action. Skyfall tries to be funny\nat times but only the hardcore James Bond fans will maybe chuckle a\nlittle.<br><br>For the rest of us it just becomes bad...<br><br>The action in the movie is just old, old school action. If anyone have\nwatched the Jason Bourne movies you know what I mean.<br><br>The plot is boring and you know what is going to happen almost the\nentire time, and the bad guy goes from a genius to a dumb goon. The\nsoundtrack is boring and it's just a movie you rent for a Sunday flick.\n"
"\nI really do not understand why so many people praise this movie. Maybe\nthat's marketing. \"Skyfall\" is generally very bad. The greatest failure\nin this film is about character of James Bond. Bond as we remember is\ncharismatic, charming... This movie shows him as a very serious, even\ndepressed. If no one mentions his name in movie, no one would even know\nit's James Bond.<br><br>Hacking computers in the movie is something most stupid as can be seen,\nreally offends human intelligence, as well as many other parts.<br><br>Today it seems that a lot of the criteria have changed, and so we have\na very bad movies with good rating.\n"
"\nIt started out great and ended very bad. Wait until you see exactly\nwhat Skyfall is. How ridiculous! The end game was even more ridiculous\nand extremely stupid for 007! I mean stupid!<br><br>Whatever happened to the intelligent, funny and smart ass Bond? And\nwhere are the Bond girls that didn't all have to die. I mean you don't\nhave to kill everything so we hate the bad guy. We get it! <br><br>This movie created some very good characters and instances which were\neither forgotten or negatively killed off. Not a good Bond movie.<br><br>It offered a few snickers and grins, but was overall negative and\ncompletely off the mark. It's too bad they keep making movies to appeal\nto the overly emotional rather than making a well balanced and edited\nmovie.<br><br>If you're into a really dumbed down, yet expensive and negative version\nof McGyver, this movie may be for you.\n"
"\nTerrible movie, boring from the beginning to the end. Honestly, I don't\nunderstand why this movie got so much attention from the critics and\nthe public in general. The story line is extremely poor, the acting is\ndeficient and, as several reviewers have mentioned, the movie is\nplagued by errors, bad script and lousy plot development.<br><br>We all know that Bond movies are not meant to be deep, reflexive, \"work\nof art\" movies. However, a movie featuring James Bond should be, at the\nvery least, entertaining. Unfortunately, this one was so bad that it\nfailed to provide even the lowest level of entertainment.<br><br>How did this movie get so many good reviews from the critics? This is a\nreal mystery to me.\n"
"\nI am seriously concerned about the rating given by IMDb nowadays, I\nmean 8.1 stars, are you guys kidding me I wont give this movie a 3 star\nbut what I like was a couple of dialogues, some views in the movie and\nthe SKYFALL song by ADELE. Poor storyline, No bond feel and worst of\nall no Bond Action. sorry I personally like Mendes as a director for\nhis great work but this is one of biggest mistakes done by him. This is\nmy first review,usually I don't care to write review but this case was\nsevere. Ratings a hugely misguiding people. Hopefully this helps.I will\nconsider it a serious mistake to go and watch the movie. But yes if you\nhave seen Quantum Of Solace than you can surely tolerate this one.<br><br>Thank You!\n"
"\nWhat were they thinking? James Bond and M don't have like a million\nfriends they could call upon in case of a threat? They go to the\nmountains and fight their war against a thug on their own??? 2 elders\nplus one??? I bet a figure like M, picks up the phone and orders 15 top\nshooters, without anyone gets news of it. Very dumb film. Also the\ntransmitter??? It would've been obsolete in Sean Connery times. On the\nChinese flea market one can buy classier products. The way it looks,\nthe size of it... In CR they put it in his arm, that was something.\nAlso the Macao thugs never have a gun? They go fistfight with someone\nand the fat-guy never checks for the Komodo dragon behind him???\nANNOYING!!! What happened with the Quantum Solace gang? They were\ncompletely forgotten of, although the score wasn't ever settled with\nthem. Mr White just got out and disappeared. What a letdown after\nCasino Royal.\n"
"\nDon't be fooled, this is not Casino Royale or even Quantum, but a cheap\nmess with some great actors forced to prattle and run around with no\npurpose (and if you think Craig is a crappy Bond, why are you even\nconsidering this movie?). Think the last Bourne installment, but\npossibly even more disappointing. <br><br>The only thing that saved this train-wreck from a 1 is Bardem which is\nfantastic in most of the movie, although in the end even he does not\nescape the marauding pen of the writers. <br><br>All those giving this movie 8+ stars are assuredly shills of the studio\nbehind this disaster and should be banned from IMDb.\n"
"\nNever been a big Bond fan. However Daniel Craig best Bond by far. Liked\nCasino Royale and despite my minority view preferred QoS as a film.\nAgree with many on Skyfall that plot is very poor. Silly in fact. The\nscene at the end when they try and fashion weapons is like a cross\nbetween the A Team and Home Alone. It seems to be that the film steals\nseveral ideas from other films but fails to deliver as a whole. The\nhelicopter scene at end reminds me of Lethal Weapon 2- but its done\nbetter in that film. Why would a top agent drive to Scotland with no\nweapons or back up with head of MI6 ?<br><br>And the most ridiculous thing was the Bond girl. He knows she is a sex\nslave- wants to be freed from all this- so just appears naked in shower\nlater on to take advantage of her vulnerability. Then she gets killed\nquickly.<br><br>Daft.\n"
"\nBeing a big James Bond fan I looked forward to this movie coming out,\nespecially since all I heard and saw about it in reviews were glowing\nreports about how this was the best Bond movie yet.<br><br>As far as I am concerned this is one of the worst Bond movies ever\nmade. The plot is weak, the Skyfall theme song does not live up to what\nI would call a catchy tune that would have you running it over and over\nin your head and overall it was just a boring and overly long movie. <br><br>It lacked the Bond type gadgetry that we all have come to expect in a\nBond movie.<br><br>Three of us watched this film and all of us came away with the same\nopinion, it doesn't live up to the James Bond standards.\n"
"\nI can't believe that so much money has been poured in a story so weak\nand so predictable.<br><br>I'm really disappointed, not a good movie beside the special effects. <br><br>The actors are good, is not about them, the story is just lame and with\nno substance.<br><br>Daniel Craig is good like always, Javier Bardem always fantastic when\nhe makes the part of the crazy psycho, perhaps its forte. I gave 5 to\nthe movie just for these two actors that actually would deserve more.<br><br>The only good news is that Judi Dench is finally out of her part. What\nwas she doing there? She was fundamentally surreal, put in there at the\nvertix of the politically correct era, it was obviously not her cup of\ntea, an old grandmother almost 80 years old with evidently no\nunderstanding of technology is running the most sophisticated secret\nservice in the world? It's beyond incredible.<br><br>Will wait for the next James Bond movie, hopefully it will be better or\nthe series will not survive its mid life crisis.<br><br>Being over 50 is hard for everybody, probably even for James Bond.\n"
"\nWhere is the witty charming James Bond? Instead, we got a depressed,\ngrumpy old man, tired 40-year-old agent. (He looks late 40's anyway.)\nIt would have been a good something-else secret agent movie, but not a\nJames Bond movie. A big dude sitting next to me was with his\ngirlfriend, (he was so excited before the movie started,) slept after\nabout 30 minutes all the way through the end of this movie. People\nleaving this packed theater seemed depressed after the movie was over.\nSome understandably left the movie early. It would have been good if it\nnamed something else; otherwise, people are misled thinking and waiting\nfor the charming, witty, smart, fast-pace, mysterious, sweet-talk\nBritish agent guy with unimaginably surprised gadget to show up.\n"
"\nWhat kind of Bond movie is this? Why all the psychological\nunderpinnings? They should show this movie at a Freudian analyst\nconvention. So Daniel Craig (James Bond) is the symbolic good son of\nJudi Dench (M)and Javier Bardem is the symbolic bad son of M. They all\ngo to this place called Skyfall, where James Bond was born. At Skyfall,\nthe conflict between the mother and sons is resolved. What? Why all the\npsychological stuff? Well, I didn't put it there, the people who made\nthe movie put it there. Was this stuff put in to make it more\ninteresting? To me, this is the first \"Weird\" Bond. I felt a lot of the\nstuff the movie was about had nothing to do with spying, secret agents,\nstuff like that. Because, you see, suppose you got a director like\nDavid Lynch to direct A James Bond movie. This \"Skyfall\" is what it\nwould look like.\n"
"\nSkyfall<br><br>The quandary with a British man dressed in a tuxedo is that everyone\nnaturally assumes he is a butler.<br><br>Thankfully, the dabber chap in this action movie is no footman. <br><br>Presumed dead after a botched mission to recover a list of undercover\nagents, James Bond (Daniel Craig) returns from exile to assist M (Judi\nDench) in the wake of an attack on MI6 headquarters.<br><br>Barely passing his physical, Bond's reinstated in the agency and\nassigned to the Orient.<br><br>There, he meets the mastermind (Javier Bardem) behind the stolen Intel:\nan ex-agent intent on killing M. <br><br>To protect her, Bond employs his childhood home as refuge.<br><br>Revealing more about Bond than ever before, this 23rd installment is\nnot only Craig's best, but, thanks to a tight script and accomplished\ndirector, the series' as well.<br><br>Incidentally, when visiting the home of a spy you should remove your\nshoe bombs at the door.<br><br>Green Light<br><br>vidiotreviews.blogspot.ca\n"
"\nunfortunately it seems the people who made this rubbish movie are using\nbots in call centers based in India to boost its star rating. it looks\nlike they are sending out pre-written reviews (with perfect grammar and\nno spelling mistakes) to these call centers who then create accounts\nand paste the review. some have even now changed their 'location' to\n'from the united states' as well as other parts of the world. i guess\nnow they will purposely do some spelling mistakes.<br><br>not only are they boosting this movies star ratings but they are also\nvoting down real reviews by real people who saw the movie and are\nslamming it for what it really is, just a seriously rubbish movie.<br><br>if you remove the bots this movie's star rating would be closer to 4.1<br><br>trust me on this, don't waste your money on this movie, spend the $20\non your kids instead.\n"
"\nLike the many other negative reviews out there, I went into this film\nwith great expectations. Sadly, like many other Hollywood movies since,\nthis one suffers from too much special effects budget coming from the\nscriptwriters' budget.<br><br>A rudimentary knowledge of computers would tell you some of the plot\ndevices used, are simply not possible (such as evacuating an island\novernight, since Hurricane Sandy couldn't do that either). Others, like\nbringing a sniper in to kill a person who has been led into an enemy\nlair, seem purely redundant.<br><br>To add insult to injury, the 2nd act takes a page from The Avengers\nplot (which wasn't great either) and the finale brings revenge killing\nto ridiculous levels of unnecessary complexity. A simple bullet,\nexplosive or missile, at any point, would have sufficed.<br><br>Passable, pedestrian but pathetically overrated by whatever bots are\npumping up the reviews. Watch this if you like mindless movies, yet\nhave the mental fortitude to make it through more than 2 hours of\ndrivel.\n"
"\nIt's been many many years since i left a rating on IMDb. However this\nfilm prompted me to resurface.<br><br>I was left very puzzled and shocked after watching the \"skyfall\" movie\n- everything from the poorly executed adele song in the opening credits\nto the final scene was horrible at best. Enough has been said about\nthis by other posters so i shall not reiterate the points as to why\nthis movie was terrible. The points are too many.<br><br>However what was even more horrifying was the fact that several modern\ncritics actually liked it. This leaves me feeling displaced as though\nI've stepped into the twilight zone. The very criteria of what defines\na good movie has been thrown out of the window in favor of poor\nnon-sensical script writing.<br><br>I've rated this movie a 3/10 for production, cinematography etc. If i\nwas rating it in comparison to James Bond movies in general im afraid i\nwould be hard pressed to rate it above a 1/10\n"
"\nI am a very big fan of Bond films and particularly of Mr. Craig. I\nstill believe the best Bond was Mr Connery but Craig is the best in\nnowadays. Still, I was very disappointed with Skyfall as in my opinion\nit is the worst Bond movie since Craig came! Even QofS was much better.\nSo the resume is simple, Skyfall starts nice with Istanbul and\nShanghai, Mr. Bardem is prefect, but then it somehow turns into Home\nAlone in Scotland (WTF)! I hope this movie was just a preparation for\nthe next movies to come. If not, I think it is the end of the\nfranchise! The job done by Craig was not very impressive, Dench was\npoor, but Bardem saved it all. I would like to know where all the money\nfor production went? I could not see it spent for the movie!\n"
"\nSkyfall is very different than other bond movies in many ways. It has\ngot no gadgetry except a big GPS tracking system which is an insult to\ngadgetry. No girls or actress since the villain took care of her. And M\ndies at the end. What kind of a bond movie is that?? People want to\nwatch bond using gadgets, blowing up stuff and charming women and\nstopping a villain causing some major catastrophe. But in this, the\nvillain has weird goals. He just wanted to kill M and he succeeded at\nlast though got killed too. Which sums it up to pretty weak plot and\neventually boring movie.<br><br>I regret spending 200 bucks in skyfall. Please don't watch it. It will\nruin your whole day.\n"
"\nThis movie is entirely predictable, unimaginative and most of all so\nboring... There is nothing original in this. Even Javier Bardem is\noveracting. The plot is extremely weak, like if made for idiots to\nwatch. I was waiting eagerly for the movie to finish in order to leave.\nThese 2.20 hours were a waste of my money and most of all time. Read\nsome of the other reviews for info on how bad this ease. They describe\nit so well there is no point for me to waste even more time on that\nmovie. I just don't understand what's wrong with movies now-days...\nMost of them seem to lack imagination, they fail to excite. I really\njust don't see the point to making a movie like this. For me if a movie\nis boring then everything else just stops mattering.\n"
