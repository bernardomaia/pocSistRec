my son really wanted to see this move because of the previews
i caved in and took him
the movie was very slow at times and kept you waiting for something to happen
there were times i kept thinking it was going to turn around but it just never happened
as for the ending
it was very disappointing to sit through two hours and not have one person make it out alive
at the end of the movie in a theater that was packed
you could have heard a pin drop
the only noise were comments of youve got to be kidding
not good at all
the preview was pretty much the movie
save your money and if you are really into survival movies then get it on video for a buck
im a big fan of liam neeson but come on now
you must admit this movie was horrible
probably the biggest contributor to the failure of this movie is that they showed the ending scene in the previews
since when is this ok
i went to this movie to see a glassfistwolffight and it never freakin happened
the wolves were quite fake looking not even close to realistic and the whole movie dragged on til the end when i thought i would finally see the battle i came to see and then
the screen goes black and credits start to roll
are you kidding me
you dont tease people with a hand to hand wolf fight in the preview if the movie never actually shows the fight
big disappointment
this movie was pure crap in my opinion
literally half the people shouted out at the end are you freaking kidding metalk about false advertising
how about gunfight at ok corral and as soon as they face the enemies roll credits or just as luke and darth meet up or indiana jones faces the nazis rocky enters the ring or john connor comes face to face with the terminatorroll credits directed by
and then show the conflict in your lying crap advertising as if that is what you are waiting for
at least they saved 2 million in not filming the climax of the movie
i hope the next time they film the titanic as soon as the ice hits the boat roll credits
are you kidding me
by the way i have noting against ambiguous arty films with no concrete storiesi loved tree of lifebut not when you advertise it as a fight to the death action film
most of the people heading to see this would be men looking for a survival flick
its not its an implausible and absurd waste of time
the story is so artificial it makes the june 1969 issue of the invincible iron man 32 where walks the weirwolf look like a pentagon budget report
some of the more credibility defying stunts include liam neeson in a 300 mph plane crash into the ice and emerging from the wreckage with a slight scratch on his left hand neeson wilderness expert convincing his fellow survivors that the best place to avoid ravenous wild wolves is in a dark forest jumping off 150 ft sheer cliffs jumping into icy rivers fighting said wolves with miniature airline liquor bottles
watch instead the same plot done better in the purple plain 1954
if they send fifty planes maybe theyll find us
but they wont send fifty planes because it wont matter becauseawe wont have time to wait for the one or two that they will send
that was the flimsy basis to explain why a bunch of professionals should decide to wander of into the frozen tundra and certain death rather than build a shelter and wait for an imminent rescue attempt
ergh wouldnt the plane have stuck to a well laid out flightpath since leaving base and had a gps locater on onboard
besides wouldnt wouldnt heading off to the forests be like entering the natural hunting ground of wolves anyway
this film left me rooting for the wolves bigbadmoviereviews
i went to watch this movie having absolutely no idea what it was about me and my friends were simply bored
i must say that watching this movie was a painful experience
now the film has multiple impossibly stupid flaws wolves that go over huge cliffs rivers and into the middle of nowhere to attack a bunch of people who survived a plane crash a guy that swims around in freezing water and comes out of it like it was nothing loads of people getting out of a plane crash completely unharmed and so on
but honestly i could live with all of that if the movie made up for it with at least anything
i found all of the characters either dull or totally hateable the funny overlytalkative guy was kinda likable but he died at the very start
the character liam neeson was disgusting with his no emotions depressive comments superhigh morality that didnt seem relatively real
no worthwhile dialogues pretty much no plot even the poem his dad wrote sucked
and anyway what a prick do you have to be to write a poem and put it into a frame and on your wall
this review has bigtime spoilers
i love liam and was looking forward to his next action movie but this movie started out grim and never got off the ground
im limited on space but for starters i would have liked a little more history on the wolves  its a scary movie make something up
and i got bored of watching them walk thru snow  again  and get eaten by wolves  again  but wait
theres always liams last and only friend dying not by a wolf but drowning instead
i expected a little smarter script for liam than what the hell are you doing
as his friend drowns  i mean cmooon
and then the peek after the credits  wtheck was that
it was so up close you couldnt see anything and after seeing everyone die anyway why ruin a perfectly terrible movie to tease you into thinking someone or something actually lived
okay to rent for a buck but not to pay for at the theater
expected to like it but ohso hated it
surprised by all the poor ratings given apparently by a bunch of wildlifewolfsurvival experts
guys this is a hollywood movie
let me emphasize  a movie
all this analysis on how much a wolf weighs and how their behavior is incorrectly depicted
please stick to natgeo or discovery channel programs and stay away from fiction
going by the logic and reviews spielbergs 1975 classic jaws should be given just a star or two as it has a highly inaccurate portrayal of sharks
but surprise surprise its 8 on imdb
wow how did that happen
i enjoy a movie for the entertainment value it provides
and if the film can hold my interest for about 90 minutes id say it worked
the grey definitely worked
the grey is a film that not only should be rated higher but is also perfect in its gripping storytelling
this film is extremely divisive either you will love this movie or hate it
however in my opinion this is one of the best films in cinematic history
the emotional drama between liam neeson contemplating life and death as well as his ability to convey himself without much dialogue is not only moving but also compelling
the grey is beyond emotionally draining which will turn some viewers off but the strong storytelling and message behind this film is something that more films need
the soundtrack is also superb as it adds emotion to already emotional scenes
this film should be rated higher and it is a cinematic masterpiece
this movie was excellent not to much gore not to much dramatized scenes every movie ive seen with liam neeson has been a top favorite movie that ive enjoyed the only flaw i saw in this movie believe me im not honestly great at catching many
but this one stuck out
but the only flaw i saw i dont know if this is a spoiler wouldnt seem like one to me but just in case to cover myself
ill say spoiler isnt it ironic how when they searched the bodies for their wallets
they all knew exactly where their wallets were like which pocket it was in the first time
i know if i were in that situation
id be searching 3 or 4 pockets before i found a wallet
not everyone keeps it in the same pocket
spoiler end anyways other then that
this movie was fantastic
lets start with the good points
laim neesons performance as the game hunter who takes control of the survivors is entrancing
moody intense and as bleak as the snowy wastes this movie is set in
having him play a widower gives ottway sharp edge of realism  for obvious reasons
the cinematography gives viewers a real sense of the groups isolation and desperate situation
i thought the plane crash was particularly well directed
okay now onto the not so good points
mixing philosophy with action was never going to be easy but when the roughnecks take frequent breaks from fighting the wolves for existential heart to hearts the film does stumble
this isnt helped by the pedestrian dialogue or sketchbook supporting characters
as they die one by one in increasingly depressing ways the films central message seems to be that life is painful pointless and god doesnt exist
quite a refreshing change from feel good narratives
i read all the negative reviews and thought oh no im about to watch a rubbish film luckily it was a great film no hero no happy ending just harsh reality apparently wolves dont act like that so what its a film not a documentary i thought the wolves acted just like a fox kill everything then store it for leaner times
i was hooked i was never bored i wondered how they were going to try and get awaythe scenery is great alaskan wilderness reminded me a bit of snow walker another great snow film
liam neeson acts his best in a believable role would recommend this film to anybody who wants escapism with a gritty edge to itall the actors were good and lots of wolves to boot
ive read imdb for years and this is the first time i write a review
and im going to do it because this movie is the worst that i watched in many many years
i really dont know where to beging with because you cant imagine how bad this movie is until you suffer the painful experience of watching it
in facti laughed hard during a good part of the movie because of the many ridiculous situations the characters got involved
can you imagine that the only weapons they made during the action were sticks tied to cartridges
there are hundreds of no sense scenes one after another
the feeling is of absolute absurdity
at the very end i sided with the wolfs to end as soon as possible the torture
really save your money and time from this disaster
wanted to like it but
wolves are howling with an onoff switch
wolves have leds in their eyes
wolves when the alpha wolf appears leave their pray to him
long boring senseless in the concept dialogs between the survivors
everybody has something great to say like they know we are watching them damn that was true
they left the crash scene and each chance they had to be found to start wandering around in this extreme cold because in the remaining of the aircraft wasnt safe
the final shot then when i didnt have a chance to save some of my time by escaping was when they decided for one of them to jump off from the cliff grab a tree on the way and help the others with a clothemade rope to cross the abyss
forbidden for 16 audience
usually liam neeson being in a movie is a green flag for me
this movie was so not enjoyed by me and my husband and a lot of people in the theatre
it was clicha and stupid
their use of foreshadowing made it so nothing was a surprise
in the end when it went black i thought gawd i hope the wolf won or god forbid there might be a sequel
i got the bleakness of the situation from the beginning but all the comaraderie that showed up in the dialogue was so pat
and trite
i disliked the movie intensely and spent half of it updating my fb since i felt like it was a couple of hours i would never get back
wish head left after the first half hour and gotten my money back but i was still hopeful it would pick up
id seen trailers for this movie and i dont know why but i thought it was going to be some kind of supernatural thriller i had no idea it was going to be a man vs beast film
i am so surprised by so many of the highly negative comments i rather enjoyed it ill take the point that the behaviour of the wolves was perhaps not totally accurate i dont profess to be an expert
there were enough shocks and plenty of tense moments to keep my interest wolves are fascinating animals i wouldnt like to be surrounded by them
so its not liam neesons best film credit to him though because hes starred in some awesome movies this was very different for him
i was surprised by the distinct lack of frost bite
watched the grey my favorite survival films featured an amazing performance from a stellar lead by oscar nominee liam neesontaken as ottway also featuring frank grillowarrior as john diaz dermot mulroneyzodiac as talget dallas robertswalk the line as pete hendrickthe film is a brilliant very melodramatic and tense also an amazing performance from neeson he was b
a
as usual also the film is one the best do or die also loved how ottways character used a classic poem and made it epic amazing cinematography by masanobu takayanagithe agent score by marc streitenfeldrobin hood costume design by courtney danielshooter and direction by joe carnahanthe ateam this is the best out the survival genre 910
i can accept the fact that so much about this movie was unrealistic as others have so well and humorously described
it is a movie after all
but i cant accept that the story just dragged on amp became relentlessly depressing
i wasnt asking for a hollywood ending but i kept hoping that something good would happen
or at least a final liamvswolf showdown
instead it was huh
at the end
what was the point
some reviewers mentioned a final clip at the end of the credits maybe that wouldve helped but wed ejected the dvd by then
glad we just rented the dvd amp not gone out to see it in the theater
but well have to have a little chat with the lady who recommended it at blockbuster
on the plus side the cinematography was fantastic
i find movies quite dumb often
reguardless of the cast
this was not one of those movies
i very much enjoyed it
would watch it again guaranteed
i didnt see it in theaters and i regret that
i think people gave bad reviews because they have unrealistic and unreachable standards
its worth watching even if 500 people complain it wasnt good enough for them
the only thing i didnt like was how they ends it but it wasnt anywhere near a deal breaker for me
the plot was good the acting was fantastic the wolves were slightly unrealistic but awful close for not using real wolves to attack actors
i dont think people should not put so much stock in bad reviews
go to red box and decide for yourself
its worth the money to at least make your own decision
you may love it
this movie took its place in my favorite movies if you ask why the reason is simple from the very fist moment it just grips you and you live experience the characters the scene with everything in it after the movie finishedi couldnt get out of my room without looking around first because i still had the fear in methat is what i believe a movie should make a person feel like even though some of you believe that this movie was exaggerated and it is illogicali still believe that this movie is a brilliant top quality and real movie
and for the record you have to watch this movie to see how liam neeson acts after i watch this movie  i just became a fan of him
i dont normally take the time to review films but believe it is necessary regarding the grey
i know there has been criticism that wolves dont hunt humans and a few other issues that may require the suspension of disbelief
but it is more important to pay attention to the inner conflict than the external conflict
the external conflict is like wood feeding the fire inside
the wolves are merely symbolic
and liams performance is subtle enough to be nothing short of brilliant
the film was well shot and well acted
the cinematography is effective without being distracting
one of the best films in a long time
make sure to catch this one
liam neeson stars in this 2011 thriller based on a short story ghost walker
this film starts with john ottway neeson a huntsman whos depressed over the loss of his wife taking a flight home with a bunch of oil workers
after falling asleep and waking up from a bad dream he discovers that the plane has crashed in the middle of alaska
he realizes hes not the only survivor but 6 others and they unite heading into the snowy wilderness where they become hunted by a pack of hungry wolves
john and the others get to know each other while trying to survive
ive liked this since first seeing it at the movies and liam is great in it as usual
i recommend this good thriller
the grey a catch it b after taken and unknown the grey is added into another likable liam neesons venture
the grey can be considered very close to the actual the rugby team andes survivors
actually the movie gives very nice reference to that actual event and the movie
in this movie besides the nature its actually the wolfs who are ready to kill them as they crash into their marked territory
liam neeson is fantastic as always
the supporting cast dermot mulroney frank grillo jeo anderson and dallas roberts was good
overall its an intense movie and will make you jump off your seats in some of the crazy sequences
many people will feel like being cheated in the end but hey watch for 2 seconds after credit itll answer your question
i wish i could articulate my thoughts as well as movie muse reviews at the top
i can really only add that this is my favorite liam neeson role ive ever come across which is saying quite a bit considering i am one of the biggest batman fan boys and having him play the role of a father figure to batman is saying quite a bit
i jumped more in this film than i did throughout the saw franchise
i felt like i was apart of the crew being chased
i truly enjoyed this film and it has rekindled my desire to watch quality cinema
i cannot praise this film enough from the storytelling the pacing the tasteful kill scenes and capturing how most people would react in a situation like the one on screen more specifically the character of diaz
even though they will not see this i want to thank the whole cast amp crew for making one of my all time favorite films
the grey is a 2012 american thriller film directed by joe carnahan and starring liam neeson frank grillo and dermot mulroney
the story follows a number of men stranded in alaska after a plane crash who are forced to survive using little more than their wits as a pack of wolves stalks them
the storyline sound familiar but what makes this one different is the fact that you can feel the emotions the fears and the thrills of the cat and mouse game as it unfolds in front of you you feel the frustrations of the group as they are taunted and haunted by the beasts
the graphics are brilliant and are actually the highlight of the movie you can actually feel the snow on your skin as it snows on the set
liam proved once again acting is in his blood as he takes you in a journey of a man who is lost in alaska and now is given a responsibility to make sure the group is safe as he is personally suffer from his demons
overall the movie is worth a night out and is worth your time you still feel the thrills even after you have finished it
most negative reviews of this film seem to center around the unrealistic depiction of wolves or the fact that it was too philosophical and preachy for a survival thriller
i think this completely misses the point
the grey was not a film about wolves and a plane crash with a philosophical backdrop
it was a philosophical movie with wolves and a plane crash used as a framing device
the themes of hope doubt tenacity perseverance and determination are what make this movie great
the burning question of what to do when all seems lost and how to keep going when it feels like youre completely alone is very universal and can apply to almost anyone in some form or another
the emotional ride of watching ottways and the other survivors ups and downs is what keeps this movie interesting long after the unrealistic superwolves lose their luster
this may not be the film you were expecting but its a great one none the less
i wasnt expecting much but ended up loving the movie
gripping and hypnotic
i didnt notice the flaws because its a movie
great acting very realistic acting
you have to stay for after the credits to be satisfied and get the end
heres why this was a great film every film in hollywood has been done before
theres really no originality anymore
that alone makes this a breath of fresh air and soothing
i havent seen a movie this unique in 10 years
an unforgettable amazing movie i didnt have any complaints
neeson is at his best and does a superb acting job and gives a top performance
the supporting cast is also decent
surprisingly memorable supporting actors
this will go down as a highly underrated film because people wanted action instead of art
its a really good film
10 times better than the perfect storm which i instantly found was the closest film of its kind it resembled
i suspended disbelief for the hope of a good story especially since i like liam neeson
however as this story grew less and less interesting the flaws really added up
i often ignore nonsense in a movie in exchange for entertainment
once i gave up on this film i began to pick it apart
forget the unrealistic behavior of the wolves the ending killed everything
do a little math
estimate the distance they hiked from the plane and imagine that as a radius
now create a circle
what are the odds he lands in the den
the odds are not good
throw in the giant cliff separating the den from the plane wreck and it begins to make enjoying the movie very difficult
i saw good reviews of this movie
i was excited to see this movie
however it fell very short of expectations
i was generous with a six due to liam neeson
this is one of them filmsyou get emotionally attached to its full of action and thrilling moments and some very sad
the characters are very well known as the film goes on and there personalities stand out which you dont get in some films which makes you want them want to survivethe wolves are very realistic and the graphics appearance and sets of this film is an over all stunner and would extremely recommend this for anyone
i love this film because connection you get with it because you want to watch more because all of the characters have strong personalities and families so you want them to get out of there and stay alive liam neeson done an excellent performance and is the right person for that character this movie is action packed thrill packed jumpy scenes and emotional all together makes the all round stunner
the grey
what can i say that the other top reviews havent already stated clearly
i totally agree that imdb ratings are not to judge a film by anymore
how can this steaming pile of dog poo or should i say wolf poo get such a high rating
as i wrote in the summary heading its boring depressing and completely unrealistic
the trailers completely scammed the viewers by missselling the movie
i enjoy watching liam neesons work but this is abysmal
in future i will be reading the top reviews before committing to watch a movie and you can bet your bottom dollar that it wont be the imdb rating system that ill be going by
if you want to see a real survival action movie then check out deliverance which even after 40 years kicks butt
ooh where do i start
this movie is unrealistic plain stupid and sooo boring
those superwolves are everywhere jump off a 30 feet cliff and the first thing they see are some goddamn wolves
feels like that is the only thing this movie contains more wolves
and that scene where he drowns is just awful so awful
getting stuck with his shoe between some rocks so he is 5 cm away from getting air
and suddenly when liam neeson reaches the tree all the stream all the flooding just magically stops
and he just chills the for a few minutes
and then carries on without a jacket or and freaking gloves
come on
gaah i hate this movie
2nd worst film i have ever seen
neeson is great as always but this film is so stupid that some of the people in our theatre got enough and just left
we live here in the middle of snow wolves bears and this plot needs a ufo sideline or just about anything to make it ever remotely believable
so silly that its almost a comedy
luckily my gf has a weird sense of humour and laughed a lot
even better was that this was her pick so i got no blame
mostly she reacted to the frankenwolfs and the illogical decisions the characters made
i myself am still a bit bitter that we went
ten lines is much much too much trouble to fill for a film like this but here im just adding words to fill up the space
what else
oh yes the wolves do not attack grown up people
there has been some cases ages ago where small children have been attacked and those wolves have most likely been partly dogs makes them unpredictable
wolves do kill and eat dogs even here but never people
final words really useful stuff for the mad magazine
the survivor characterisations were shallow even by the standards of an action film
the anthropomorphism depicted by the wolves behaviour was risibleas were the special effects particularly the glowing wolves eyes in the darkabout 30cm apart by the look of em
the tenets of survival in a hostile environment are protection self location try to inform potential rescuers of water food
in that order
so faced with 20c and blowing 40kts pursued by hyperintelligent enormous wolves our hero et al leaves the windbreak of the wrecked fuselage with fuel and possibly location devices and hoofs off in search of
youve guessed it food
were it not for the clichas and expletives thered be no dialogue at all no bad thing perhaps
this is the silliest film ive sat through in a long time
i only did so in the hope that it must get better than this
it didnt
how ridley scott allowed his name to be used on the credits ill never know
i was going to title this misguided hokum
but its not that good
bilge is a better term for it
this is a movie to be watched by all adventurethriller genre likers
there are many reasons for that 1
this is a movie thats has been made out of a less clicha ridden story
2
this is as realistic as a hollywood movie has been made in terms of the gravity of a situation like this 3
they have marvellously captured alaska in snow
some of the images itself invoke feelings of great despair and its sheer beauty
4
many of the reviewers have complained about how true is that wolves may actually behave that way and that men would have died more so because of severe cold environmentwhich may be true but whats depicted in the movie is also a scenario that can happen ultimately its just a movie that gives us some thrills
5
but what sets it apart from all other movies in the same vein is its believable ending
so go watch it buy or rent its dvd one things for sure you will have a different kind of movie experience
am glad that i didnt listen to all the bad reviews
in fact i had second thoughts before i booked the tickets due to the bad reviews but my wife persuaded me and am glad she did
directed skillfully by carnahan buoyed by beautiful backdrop and a gifted visual he has managed to bring back wolf phobia
liam neeson was great as usual matter of fact this a bit different movie he has done in a while
the side actors have also done a terrific job and some scenes are really heart wrenching but never the less this movie was all about survival and people who like such movies will really enjoy on second thoughts i think everyone will enjoy
pls dont go in with high expectation and a great story line this movie is not about that
my wife kept seeing the previews on t
v
and insisted on seeing it
to keep it simple its a horrible movie
just no explanations of why these guys did what they did
example they leave the safety of the crash and wreckage that provided plenty of shelter and headed into the woods knowing the wolves are in there
sure make firewood runs into the woods during the day but
weird
never leave the crash site
its common sense
the ending is the worst ending since the ending in dutch treat
the wolf is about to have it out with the lone survivor and it ends
the credits roll
everyone in the theater leaves
after the credits the grand finally of the wolfman fight
how were we to know
i just heard thats how it ends but i aint wasting more money just to see the very end
why after the movie ends and credits roll
whos idea was that
folks trust me
een with that the movie sucked
bad
its not awful it has liam neeson in it thats worth something but damn whyd he choose this lame script with predictable plot points go on without me  yeah we will because we knew you were gonna say that at some point and now we wish the wolves bonn appetite
its also got pseudo philosophy and convenientstupid plot points
e
g
of all the places in all of these wild frozen woods john agua ends up in the wolves den
or the ridiculous jump into the trees
what the hell you guys know adults might be watching this film too
its a poor plot and a bad script but it has superb cinematography and liam neeson
we knew itd be just him in the end but you know if they could have all these silly nonsensical things going on throughout the film then why oh why are we denied the pleasure of seeing an irishman fighting a wolf with mini shot bottles taped too his hand
why are we fobbed off with this pseudo intellectual what is death crap you have no integrity you proved it throughout the film why you no give us our last hurrah
this movie is yet another evidence that movie production companies are somehow influencing imdb ratings
the average rating of this movie shouldnt be higher than 6 and when i say 6 i am extremely kind
i did not have high expectations for this movie i just hoped for some brainless action film for friday evening after a long week
well it was brainless without doubt but not the way i hoped for
the whole movie is totally unrealistic from top to end
when one is watching a good movie one is sucked into the story and feels absorbed into the main character
well with this one there was not a single moment i didnt feel myself as a critical observer
all the way through i was thinking how can a script so poorly written did they think this animation seriously
this is ridiculousetc without wasting more of my time on this poorly executed film i just warn you give yourself a favor and save your moneytime from this crap
i dont understand how on earth can someone think this movie deserves 7
1 rating
spoilers
you couldnt spoil this movie if you beat it to death with an axe
by the time the end of this movie arrives and ottway is left on his own to fight the alpha male armed only with a small selection of miniature whiskies anything could have happened
it would have come as no great surprise if a flying saucer had majestically swooped down from the sky to ottways rescue
as this is my first review i was rather hoping to write something in a more positive manner
but there are no redeeming qualities
at times i found myself laughing sometimes i was open mouthed in disbelief
at least it did remind me why i now mainly watch foreign language films
the biggest issue with this movie was that ottway did not shoot himself at the start
in fact he could have done us all a favour and shot the cameras filming this rubbish
i liked to watch the movie for one because liam neeson is playing the leading role and again he did a good job
the grey isnt a movie based on reality or a true story like the movie the way back were also a group of men had to survive in the wilderness
if you like to see a suspense movie were people get picked of one by one like in alien but instead of on a spaceship the setting is alaska and the aliens are replaced by wolves
the acting in the movie is good it doesnt come over like a cheap style of movie with bad acting the only thing thats to bad is you dont really get to see the wolves that well until far in to the movie and than only a couple of seconds
dont get me wrong its still a good movie to watch ones you start the movie its easy to watch it till the end
a film out of the hollywood pipeline that seems like anything but
brutal gritty yet teeming with subtle ideas as big and compelling as the alaskan vistas that provide the films backdrop the grey is a film of barren beauty suggestive at moments of the grandeur and mystique of a tarkovsky film and clearly intended for audiences more sophisticated than those hollywood usually targets
the casting is terrific a small group of actors offering up a set of superbly delineated characters and neeson is in great form
though still early in 2012 critics will be reserving a space for this title on their top picks lists
simply i was stunned
this movie is a gem period
1010 and hands down liams best
dont listen to the critics
if you like wilderness themes survival suspense and horror then this is your movie
watch it and enjoy you will not be disappointed i promise
i couldnt understand the bad reviews
i believe this movie will someday be considered a classic
i respect those who view this as a dark existential tale about the savagery of the world and the inevitability of death
nevertheless the film left me cold no pun intended
a group of men are stranded in a frozen wilderness and eventually succumb to the cold and a ravenous pack of wolves
so what
the story is unexceptional in the sense that this is what would normally happen
yes the performances are strong
liam neeson is as usual excellent but whats the point
yes people are often quite brave in the face of death even when they do not survive
believe me ive seen it
but the film is unnecessarily negative
we do sometimes triumph over evil
im thinking of the excellent biography of lou zamperini unbroken which shows how much an individual can endure and still prevail
especially in these troubled times this is what we must tell ourselves because ultimately thats the truth
overall decent movie the acting was good not really any good character development at all i liked the main character but again there was no action and no depthaside from the depressing message of there being no god and the absurdity of life
the point of watching a movie is either to be entertained sometimes stimulate your mind this movie did neither for me who wants to leave the movie theater depressed
im not completely knocking it down because im sure some will enjoy it if they share the belief of the message the movie tries to make and as i said the acting was good
anyway
promising at the beginning
then i got disappointed
nothing to watch again
a few more survivors and a different animal and this added up to a cheap version of the edge
and i really was hoping it was like the edge just with the wolves taking the place of a giant grizzly bear
unfortunately that was not even close to what this movie was
i am not sure if this is a spoiler but the animal scenes looked to be straight out of a b horror movie
i also could find nothing to take away from movie and i dont think i can say that about any other liam neeson movie that i have ever seen
i honestly could not wait until this movie was on netflix and i was so excited that i was going to be able to finally watch the movie
however what i think was a great idea for a movie in my opinion turned out to be a huge disappointment
if i were to rate the grey on the first 30 min of its runtime it would get around 710
unfortunately writer and director joe carnahan flubbed the majority and remainder of the movie badly
spoiler starring liam neeson as a fatalistic but reserved hunter in the freezing bush after miraculously surviving a plane crash this movie is a classic example of a story likely reedited too much
dialog is wholly awful dreary boring and wandering
it meaningless and devoid of substance from the 2nd half on
the cinematography of the wolves is often subpar
the end of the movie leaves you scratching your head  while it could be realistic given the circumstances it cheapens and highlights just how excruciating the last hour of dialog has been
how this movie averages a 7 from general users and how it got greenlit into production is beyond me
not recommended
a harsh bitter introspective survival picture that wasnt at all what i expected from the trailers
what the film chooses to do it does very well  the suspense is so thick that my neck muscles remained in a stiff vice grip for hours and the constant landscape shots are aweinspiring  but those wildly successful qualities come at the expense of others
its not a story with a firm resolution which is sure to polarize a lot of viewers and most of its intentions are left ambiguous
liam neeson is his typical commanding badass self but despite a few action hero moments he makes some boneheaded mistakes and his leadership qualities leave a lot to be desired
ive read that the plot is a metaphor for existentialism which makes plenty of sense in reflection but in the heat of the moment it feels desolate and hopeless
that innate duality makes it a complicated picture to rate i wasnt oblivious to its faults but still found it a dense intriguing and enveloping experience
worth watching even if you wind up hating it
the grey is really a great movie and its plot is quite interesting
as i was watching the characters try to survive a part of me felt that i was in the movie with them hoping for salvation
the only part i didnt like is that yes the nature of the wolves and their behavior is unrealistic but i tried to forget about it and just enjoy the movie
if it was realistic the movie would have ended in 30 minutes with everyone been rescued
having the wolves behave like that provided an extra threat which made up the movie
even though the wolves werent realistic the rest of the story was
the ending was really amazing in my opinion and i cant think of a better one for this movie
i recommend this film to everyone
i watched this movie and ive heard a lot of talk about how good this film was and i wasnt disappointed
it grabbed me from the first scenes and didnt let me down
the story was well done and the scenery was just as good
i like liam neeson films and i know a lot of people dont but i dont care he was again great in this movie
i could watch it again and again and still enjoy it
yes i know that the wolves dont act the way they did in this film but again i dont care
do any of the animals in thrillerhorror movies act the way they should
no
the characters were played well too and they made me feel for them and had me wanting them to make it through their ordeals
so in summary i give this movie a solid 8 out of 10
