elysium starring matt damon is the perfect summer popcorn movie
it has everything you would want in a movie a great cast that serves their purpose and visceral special effects that might even land the team an oscar
everything including all the fight scenes were executed flawlessly
coming out of this movie i had close to no complaints
the writing was a bit dodgy in some areas but the great acting and effects quickly draw you back into the story
neil blomkamp who dazzled audiences with district nine 4 years prior does a fantastic job once again with this flick
his vision made the story very real to movie goers everywhere
overall elysium is worth every penny to watch in theater
i laughed at the box that says spoiler alert you couldnt spoil this it it that bad
plenty of action but that is only camouflage to disguise the very predictable plots all used in previous films over the years
and as for the acting i cant describe how bad it was
theres a line in it where the elysium secretary of state jodie foster says  im afraid i cant act
i fell off the chair laughing
106 minutes of your life that youll never get back
id rather be in the dentists chair for that long
ill bet it didnt take that long to write
how did matt damon agree to do this
i give it 110
my previous low score was 610
and that was dreadful
and as for the false accents
reminded me of a cross between mad max and mary poppins
could this movie be anymore obvious
we get it
america is elysium and we should let everyone on the planet in and give them free everything because apparently america has enough resources for everyone
if you are a minority you are poor creatures in need of help from white or indian fascists that also speak french
it was so over the top with the illogical premise that they should have offered pain pills beforehand
logic and common sense cried through this whole thing
dont waste your time
just watch cnn to understand how horrible an idea it is for a nation to have laws
open the flood gates and let everyone in
no laws you mean uncaring people
those poor asians blacks and hispanics are obviously not smart enough to have made it there
indians and white people only
i felt like i was being hit over the head with a liberal mallet
since my movie theatreworking friend was off today and this was the only movie i hadnt seen that was still playing that i wanted to see this was what we chose
we both thought it was better than expected with plenty of great action scenes a good scifi story and many fine emotional moments concerning a lady friend of matt damon and her daughter that he ends up helping in a big way
oh and jodie foster as one of the villains was also quite compelling to watch
things move along at quite a fast pace but not too much so that you couldnt understand whats going on if you pay close attention to the quite descriptive dialogue
so on that note i highly recommend elysium
it does have something to be questioned about
but then again
its scfi
pacific rim
kind of basic
i dont thing we need more applause
what we do need is to be asked
and at least elysium does that
are you guys willing to be pupped
are you actually in need to be reaffirmed
thats not my problem and then it does make it your problem not mine
ten lines great
lets go for it
although i am brazilian it is not about region it is about an idea
i would question elysium but i will not
in the end the love you take is equal to the love you make
elysium is a winner in this quest
if you are to watch pacific rim go for elysium
for us scfis orphans is far better enough
im hooked on good sifi and this was good
i dont think those who gave bad reviews really understood the story but if you are a sifi enthusiast you will understand and enjoy it
the special effects were good acting was up to matt damons normal high standard and the plot rolled along well
the lead lady could have been a bit more in matt damons class but not too bad
i would also have like to have seen more made of the equipment he was fitted with after all the pain he went through having it put onin him
more explanation about the space station would also have helped  the concept was well up to scratch and very believable
this director is on fire
every movie he does is pure gold and totally blows my mind
all the rich details are truly amazing and the action scenes are spot on not at all corny and literally put me at the edge of my seat
he would have done a kick ass star wars but he turned down the offer
maybe a smart move on his part
im expecting another dud star wars anyway because disney has hired george lucas as an adviser for the entire project which is the worst mistake ever in the history of film making in my humble opinion
lucas should have been put out to pasture a long time ago in a galaxy far far away
please oh please make a district 10 and elysium squeal and keep hope alive and give me a blueprint for the future
i will be forever grateful
elysium had some refreshing ideas about how the future could look like and i am positively surprised about the background story of the life on earth in contradiction to the life on elysium
it is a parallel to todays life and makes you think about how the life could be if it develops further in that direction
the visuals and the scifi elements are good
some technological inventions are ingenious like the chips that are attached to a human brain where the data could be updownloaded via a usb cable d it has some great action elements which are sometimes easily predictable
also i wasnt very stunned by the acting performances
the development of the love story is somewhat boring and lacks emotion it is unfinished and undeveloped
all in all it is worth watching for everybody who likes scifi movies
its an enjoyable film plenty happening easy to follow good case thought provoking material but it doesnt feel original
the market seems saturated with earths a mess and people live in space type films i
e
oblivion total recall etc
saying that this is the best one of these and does give you a more realistic sense of what could happen in the future has a layer of gritty reality to it that seems to give is more credibility
there are random elements to it why is a south african commandos or whatever they were stationed in los angeles just felt like that blomkamp wants something to do with south africa in there even if its irrelevant or compromises the plausibility of the film
its a good watch mind so dont be put off and enough in it to keep most film fans entertained
its johnny mnemonic the way repo men with jude law was logans run
stephen baxter does a really good job in the flood and then again deeper still in the ark showing how the government would have to develop cold heartless technics for dealing with the rising flood of people when land becomes scarce
the special effects are great and jodie foster just gives an amazingly believable heartless bureaucrat performance
i found that i enjoyed the movie as a decent scifiaction movie a great choice for friday or saturday night with your favourite snacks
the production team have really put together a believable world that you can see has evolved from our present day
the bounty hunter will end up being one of your favourite characters even though you will hate him
i was drawn to this movie because of the cast amp writerdirector amp hadnt paid much mind to the actually base storyline
perhaps its my own personal frustration at a particular scenario that has a logical reasonable outcome that is not forthcoming borne out of greed but i suppose thats the point regardless i rate movies on would i watch them again and i would this was i left wanting more amp would it sit as a favourite on top of my dvd player in readiness to be watched time amp time again
no
from an action amp scifi point of view id give it a 910 brought a new imagination level amp believability that can sometimes overshadow a movies decalogue and momentum
as an avid movie goer this movie was well rounded and basically pretty cool
the premise of the story was very interesting and although scifi it was the idea that is was believable
i thought if foster is in the movie it cant be bad
wrong
foster gives her usual stunning performance but the whole movie is ruined by way way too much violent action
glad i have a ff button
seem most movies follow the same genre of guns and chases etc
that are really old and lame
hollywood is politically against guns but they love them in their movies
what hippocrits
damon is insipid in his role
so predictable
then insight came into my head the movie is really about hollywoods pie in the sky attitude toward life
the refugees wanting to escape earth are clearly representing mexicans and the space station current day u
s
a
only the rich get the best medical treatment and the immigrants get nothing
sound familiar
wake up hollywood event the die hard liberals are sick of the same old same old
not much to say about elysium
if you watch the trailer youll be expecting a decent and entertaining scifi movie and elysium is just that
nothing new in terms of storyalthough the first 3040 min let you think youre in for something more good special effects good actingconsidering the genre overall good movie
i would like to praise sharlto copley on his performance on this one a very pleasant surprise portraying the villain
to sum up elysium isnt a mind blowing movie but its very entertaining you will get your moneys worth on this one if you go to the movies to be entertained if not elysium is still preety decent but dont expect big twists and turns its all very predictable
still a solid 710
this movie is literally one of the best movies i have ever watched
after niells district 9 i wasnt expecting much really didnt like district 9
but was absolutely blown away by this film
although the special effects were great the story line is what really grabbed me
in a society where inequality grows daily it isnt very difficult for someone like me to connect the dots and see a future state where the elite are even more isolated from the masses they rely on exploiting for their wealth
we see the same trends in every country on earth
if you havent got an entitled disposition and have had to work for an honest wage youll really enjoy this film
however if youre more like the citizens of elysium youre bound to hate it
a great ideawealthy humans have abandoned a demolished earth for a luxury space station leaving behind the poor and disenfranchised while controlling them from afaris ignored in this runofthemill scifi action flick
it should have a lot of provocative things going for it what with its socially conscious topic but the bulk of the film is consumed with lead matt damon getting from point a to point b facing obstacles all the while
by focusing on the surfeit of action so little is made of its original conceit that it feels like a wasted effort
there are absolutely no surprises in writerdirector neill blomkamps hollywood101 storytelling theres even a race to save a little girl dying of leukemia and no depth to any of the characters
damon is given little to do while jodie foster plays the villainthis might have been fun to watch if only to see her overact and play against type but like everything else that might have mattered blomkamp could care less
elysium is a primer on how to make a real action movie
the result is an original and well made aaup a formidable refined edition that keeps the emotions thread a well stylized cinematography among other things
there are science fiction movies we explain a scientific theory but at the same time there are other science fiction films whose purpose is to entertain elysium is the second case and makes it the best way
his great accomplishment cgi used only in times of need
matt damon is an actor who has good control of their careers by maintaining a balance in the roles you select
elysium fields definitely is one of the best films of the year
one of the worst scifi flicks i have ever seen
give me transformers 4 anytime
not only its childishly silly in its politics but the plot has more holes in it than a swiss cheese which tastes better
things happen just because to please the poor scriptwriter whos also the movies director  apparently he couldnt find anyone else to shoot the thing
in a fascist universe people come and go as they please
theres a whole underground society with the highest technology available
one wonders why they dont use it to cure these poor children
the ships going from earth to elysium get shot down or get in whatever the story needs
a highly trained clever technician gets hurt in a way a 10 years old child wouldnt
and then we have these heartrending memories of childhood in slomo loads of them with music of course
btw  the score is laughable
and i have never seen jodie foster that bad
shes a great actress but if she can pretend to be that bad it means genius
typical left wing propaganda against anyone who is wealthy or prosperous
it promotes immigration and socialism
matt damon yet again shows his ignorance
if all the people on earth were placed on elysium it would be a desolate waste land in a matter of hours
dont waste your time or money
this will be the last time i watch a matt damon movie
time to stop supporting liberal hollywood filth
the rest of this post is to fill up ten lines of text so i can post to this website and give my opinion due to the fact im sick of reading most others
if your tired of these type of left wing liberal movies please post a review saying so and boycott anything to due with the actors in them and directors who work on them
every thing has been said before except the completely nonsensical computer that could heal all illnesses and injuries in a couple of minutes even krugers face being blown off
grenade fragments would have entered his brain for a start so he could not have escaped brain damage
plus where were the fragments which would have been removed
the girl as far as i noted had three completely different illnesses
first when on crutches she was diagnosed with multiple broken bones even with crutches she could not have been walking then later as having seizures and also leukemia a similar computer was seen in the movie prometheus one year before so maybe they borrowed the idea from there
jodie foster was wasted in the movie as she had basically a walk on part though projected pure psychopathy in the brief time she was on screen
i wont say too much about this movie because its not worth it
i just saw a wasted concept being flushed down the drain
this movie starts with the potential of being a great franchise but ends up being the most predictable and depressing mess ive seen in ages
maybe i should give it three or a two grade because of the great intro but the fact that they spoiled this opportunity only makes it worse
this movie could have generated a real and credible critique of the human condition in a society who blindly is moving towards science fiction cynicism
no wonder donald trump became president when you see how hollywood prioritize potential
its so sad to see the whole movie industry of hollywood flush itself down the toilet with one movie worse than the other and trust me this is one of the worse
a movie with a profound message a message that holds for the future of who we are and what will be of us the human kind
division racism unable to find complete cure for the sick and those that die for the lack of food and resources
are crucial examples of what is our modern world our modern society but what really scares me the most is that that is the future that awaits us
thanks to our mentality
but there is hope that everything could change and be better thats why elysium is a great movie and example
that color is not taken into consideration but integrity and affection was
that humans are able to make the world better banishing terrorism and hate towards another
that ethnicity and religion should be a personal belief and not something that should be discriminated
an equal and safer place could mean the creation of a more trustworthy future where technology can integrate and perform but yet facilitate our lives and life more peacefully
this is a great movie
okay there are lot of mistakes or questions
like why and how and when
but this is a scifi movie d not everything has to realistic or logic
the end though or the movie is not predictable and that makes it special
i just would like to see more of elysium
but the movie was really great
i enjoyed it
bbut of course ive seen better
what i also missed is connecting with the actors
most of the time i get emotional with movies ending like this but now i just watched and thought huh
thats all
so id like to ignore all the hate about this movie
if you have time just watch this and judge yourself
if you loved district 9 and looked forward to this then be prepared for a major disappointment
could have been such a good movie with a fab basis for the story line and excellent special effects
really fell down after about an hour and i almost switched it off boredafter 1
45 hours
so pleased i did not buy this and waited for it to appear on terrestrial tv
the only connection with the brilliant district 9 is that the baddie has a south african accent
jodie foster who i love as an actor is one of the leads but she has just a bit part as a dictator who has a couple of sidekick heavies to look after her whole planet
matt damon must be embarrassed to have starred in this
i was expecting more and better than what i got with 2013s elysium
the cast wasnt bad in fact i think foster and damon gave good performances and had pretty good on screen chemistry together
the issue i took with elysium was the poor writing and sorta weak plot summary
the plot summary and execution of it was pretty run of the mill and formulaic
i wouldve appreciated a little more creativity and or originality
this movie was all around a pretty boring experience it just simply did not entertain me
jodie foster was good she looked stunning in her wardrobe and is impressively good for her age
matt damon was alright i guess he was tough in the action sequences which is nice but he lacked some when he wasnt blowing up st
the rest of the cast is ok nothing too bad
elysium couldve and shouldve been better than it is
510 for elysium
i enjoyed the basic premise however if we could colonize space then could we not also save the earth it is much harder to build a space colony and they already had the means to save all the people of earth with their technology and they just dont use it those medical ships were only utilized at the end it could have been a fifteen minute movie if they sent them in the first place
also those missiles must have some super propellant to escape the earth for the size that they are
and who would go into a radiation chamber that is primed to close
is there a police force on the colony
if the robots are programmed to not arrest citizens how could humans control crime if the robots interfere with the human officers because by their logic a citizen cannot be arrested how could these robots even preform their primary function
ultimately it was a good film but lacked in some areas for me
to say that this movie was a disappointment would be to give it more credit than it deserves
granted i wasnt expecting to find myself watching citizen kane but pigs in space would have given this pretentious load of drivel a run for its money
rich people  bad and so they set up camp in a luxurious space station far far above
poor people  the downtrodden and so theyre made to stay on earth looking enviously at the rich people above their heads
this movie probably has some pseudopolitical message going on in the background but sorry if that is indeed the case the millions spent on getting it out there went totally over my downtrodden head
and what i wouldnt have given to have seen alan rickman arriving on the space station just as things were heating up and as he looked at the carnage around him hed shake his head before telling all who would listen im off to the pub
ive been a fan of scifi and fantasy for as long as i can remember
ive seen the bad ive seen the good and ive seen life changing
elysium is not life changing by any means but it is very good for what it was trying to accomplish
very simply elysium is a class struggle between the super elite on the space station elysium and the incredibly poor everyone on earth
during the story both sides do absolutely horrible things to each other and yet at its darkest moments it does show a glimmer of what the human race is capable of when those selfish attitudes that led to such a huge class division are instead replaced by cooperation and determination
i give elysium a 9 because it isnt a perfect movie by any stretch of the imagination but it does lead to some profound philosophical questions and that to me is far more important than any visual effect or oscar worthy story
any movie that can introduce philosophical and moral dilemmas the matrix 1984 v for vendetta blade runner etc
is worth a look at
watch the movie and make your own judgments
after viewing this movie i had a twofold opinion
from one side i thought neill blomkamp was trying to show in this movie revolution inequality how dirty is our plant became with all sordid details
from another side i was full of this clicha after watching it
i dont know why but i had a feeling during watching this movie that neill blomkamp used same decorations that he used in the district 9 2009
just invited jodie foster matt damon alice braga william fichtner and faran tahir
sharlto copley only changed his costume and personality of the character
thats all
the only reason why i liked this movie is aesthetics of the elysium where wealthiest citizens belong and live
im writing this after only watching once so dont expect much detail or correct names of the characters
im a massive sci fi film buff and looked forward to this one as matt damon is a good watch
the start of this film set a great picture of the intended plot and laid a base of what could be a great film
but not long in i was thinking ahead and i foresaw the end pretty much at the start
the film felt like it started at a good pace in order to build to a climactic finale but soon became rushed and i felt the acting was hurried and too much happened in the middle of the film
the attempt of an emotional end was too reminiscent of blood diamond
there were hardly any real memorable scenes and there wasnt enough footage of what it is actually like living in elysium no twists and a pretty poor storyline and the end left me thinking is this the end or the beginning
on a positive the special effects were great
too much crammed into one film and left me thinking how tom cruises oblivion had no competition for the modern scifi
i feel a bit let down
i had high hopes for this film because of the directors previous film and the star power associated with it
but it ended up feeling so predictable and uninteresting in the second half that i left the viewing disappointed
the action was ok but i just didnt feel any vested interest in the characters
jodie fosters character was severely underused in this film that i feel she could have been played by any other actor without affecting the film
matt damon did a good job as he often does but his motivation for getting to elysium felt a bit weak
the main standout as others have said was kruger sharlto copley
he disappeared into his role and was so different from his previous roles that you could forget it was an actor when watching the movie
when i first saw this movie i was stuck with the idea that i was not going to like it
im sorry but i dont like matt damon and there he was though in a futuristic science fiction movie
so yep i began to watch the movie with low standards and no expectations
but then i was surprised by the simple but somehow efficient story by the fact that matt damon was good in his role and by the amazing way the special effects were implanted in the real environment
i really really enjoyed the special effects which were worked at a perfectionist level
not in a prometheus way but in a realistic way
the special effects we dont see in a movie are for me the best
this movie is a pretty good example of what special effects should be
the story wasnt really surprising though but sufficient
as i said earlier i was only surprised by the fact that i gently entered into the scenario without finding it boring or totally uninteresting
it could have been better but i thought it could have been worst
then it was not that bad and in fact a good surprise
i did not care for district 9 one bit when i saw this trailer for the first time i said people who love district 9 will hate this movie
and for the most part with in the people i know it is true
i loved this movie and i despised district 9
this movie was great it had everything action thrills laughs and the holy s moments
the story of the movie was well paced and did not feel like things were unnecessary
even my parents who do not like scifi movies liked this
it has a good story
it is a very good movie way better than district 9 after that movie i asked for a refund after this movie i felt satisfied
obviously a story that has been told before about rich people getting what they need while others suffer in poverty and are controlled by robots
but it was still great
damon was awesome in it and i thought the story line was convincing and enjoyable
i loved the videography the special effects and the action
it kept me engaged and watching
it made me feel anger and moved me to want to help
i was moved by the social aspect of it
jodie foster has such a limited role damon outshone her because of it
i would have liked to see her character developed a little more
maybe there is more to the story about elysium it made me want more
i love good scifi and this move is worth watching for its moral lesson
the end left me in tears
this is your pretty standard good folk versus bad folk piece
spoilers alert will try not to though the age old story of corrupt and unethical elites ruling over the masses enjoying life while others are in despair
pretty straight forward story of a blue eyed boy dreaming of a better life and ending up giving to others what he didnt get in life
there are a few misses though like how security seems to be missing entirely near the end whereas theyre beating the crap out of everyone in the beginning but other then that it keeps you attached to the flow
a real cinema piece if you get the chance however this is a pretty standard flick dont think the story is gonna leave you in a shock and awe
a late night watch
this was a film i had been looking forward to seeing since i saw district 9 and it didnt disappoint me in the sense of excitement a whole host of great action scenes and inventive weaponry all got two thumbs up
this film is an all in all good movie the only problem is it never becomes more than that it doesnt have the originality of district nine in its style or story
in a nut shell it was a robin hood story in a scifi flick but that aside the film was very well put together with a good action hero from main man matt damon but it was sharlto copleys bad guy that stole the whole show
a misscasted jodie foster might take away from some but she has little screen time so dont let that put you off
overall a great slice of entertainment
matt damon is great in this movie
it is a great movie where the plot and action is enough to keep you engaged throughout the whole film
very clever way to look at the dystopian genre which is one of my favourite genres of media
the acting on all of the characters is well done and the casting is well thought out
in just a few scenes they are able to get you attached to a girl dying of leukemia and make you feel connected to her when her and her single mom are kidnapped just for knowing the main character who is being tracked down by a secret group within the government
plans to over through the current presidency are clever but a very common plot theme so that wasnt too good in my books
overall its a very good movie that i would recommend to anyone who loves action and maybe matt damon
classic rich people get everything and can live forever
poor are doomed to death and living in slums guess what same situation is in presence
story takes part in near future
it wasnt so good but it was as expected poor invade the rich part of the world
but it has lot of action so you dont get bored at all
nice effects nice fight scenes
some unreal healing power of machines but all in all good movie
it was fairly rated with 7 ill give the same
there were some parts that could be covered and explained more
like putting exoskeleton on human like it is normal thing done every day
and story should be more dynamic but it is ok movie
if you wanna action movie without much thinking you should watch it
the film was well put together and yes i enjoyed it
but if you are going to rip off battle angel alita then why not just make a battle angel alita movie or gunnm for the purists
change elysium to tiphares mat damon to a female android gally and lack of medical care to illegal organ harvesting and
oh look
its the battle angel alita story
as i said earlier i did enjoy it and the film was well put together mr damon was well suited to this role the bad guys were suitably twisted and power hungry the damsel in distress was well insipid and boring as hell actually
but there was plenty of flying body parts explosions and all round action to make up for that
not a film i would go out and buy on dvd but worth a look see at least once
i was super disappointed with this movie
i expected a lot more
the voice over work in this movie killed it for me
the lips didnt go with the voice over throughout the movie and jodi fosters accent was very distracting
i love movies and being an actor myself i tend to be a bit critical of the simple things that should be corrected
one is the voice over
thats a simple fix that needs to be corrected before the film hits theaters
i was fixated on the mistakes and lost site of the storyline
matt damon is an incredible actor but again the mistakes take away from his performance
jodi foster is also an incredible actor but again the little things were overlooked
elysium is a great film with some outstanding special effects
but how the story was told was not okay
i didnt feel passion of most characters and the end was cheesy
when i watched the movie it was just boring i was literally disappointed the action parts was eh
this film was a total great comedown for director neill
the should of added more drama scenes and i mean seven stars sometimes in a negative way
the film has global conditions such as trash humanism health care and some other stuff i found in wikipedia
its one of those films of a dirty trashy future dramas
like walle except walle was way better in so many ways like for real
the point is elysium disappointed me i was waiting like two whole months its just the story it isnt as exciting as you think it is
since my mom easily fell asleep when she watches slow movie i rented this one for her and i wasnt disappointed
the movie is wellmade and entertaining as an action film and you can keep on watching till the end
i like the way they set up prop characters music and the quick pace of the story
however there is nothing you can learn from it
no significant theme just the plain the poor will one day fight if the rich beat them down too much
and you are born for something but the latter wasnt well supported by the movie although it tried
i didnt feel touched or moved by the connection between the main characters childhood his relationship with his childhood sweetheart and his carer and his triumph at the ending
the script is not that good
and there is much violence in the film as well sometimes unnecessary in my opinion
but which actions movies dont have much violence these days very rare sigh
in conclusion watch it if you want to enjoy a fun ride
but expect nothing precious or thoughtful
well now what to say it is bad i expected worse so i was pleasantly surprised
dont get me wrong im not saying i was happy with the movie
for the med bed we would have to be much further into the future it does an analysis on you restructures your body on the subatomic level to repair damages
really why then would the earth be in the shape it is
with that type of technology the future should be more akin to star trek with its replicators and transporters and the earth in excellent condition
there would be no need for the space station world
also the station never tried to stop the shuttle with damon yet no codes were given they were not even told it was coming why didnt the defense grid catch that
clearly a hole is blown in the head of the undercover asset and yet his brain is still functioning and they bring him back please that was such a bad plot move 2 other people bleed to death from wounds and yet this guy doesnt not even close to believable
i could go on but why wait for it to come to tv
although i had been waiting to watch this movie ever since a friend showed me the trailer after we had watched district 9 i felt that it was not exactly what i had hoped it to be
there are some plot holes and the whole leaving earth and arriving in space within a matter of minutes was to my eyes tackled a bit naively
all this is not disturbing in watching the film the effects are great throughout but the characters are somewhat poorly developed
seemingly bad guys turning into likable characters within seconds of an unconvincing dialogue
jodie foster gives a good performance albeit not her best matt damon is who he is the bad guys are very bad and the good are too good
in a nutshell i would recommend watching this film because it is a good idea but do not expect stuff you have not seen before
if i had to compare it to district 9 well
i just cant
i had been waiting for blomkamps new film since district 9 and i was not disappointed
amazing fx throughout the shots of the station are truly beautiful and so is the rest of the photography
but one of the most entertaining things are the designs of machinery vehicles and such
what could you expect really if weta is involved obviously its going to be great
sharlto copleys acting is spot on for his character bringing to life one of the most brutally likable villains i have seen in a long time
its definitely a popcorn movie do not watch expecting some life changing revelation but if spending a couple of hours truly entertained is what you want then this is surely a great film
if you are a rich person who has a heal it all machine awoudnt you rent it
ato make more money perhaps
awhy go to space
awhoudnt it be easier to build an habitat on earth
awhou feeds the billions on earth
its clear that the writerdirector has all the guilt fantasies of rich people who have never known a poor person not all poor people are mexican gangster most of them are hard working decent clean and good people
4 just because of the cgi awesome the rest included jodie fosters performance she only lacks the mustache to be a matinae villainhorrible
not to forget
you have the entire code for the survival of your habitat in only one place and with noone guarding it
i was not expecting much from this movie at all i conceded to go because my husband really wanted to watch it
whereas i am very pessimistic when it comes to new movies as usually they are unoriginal and unexciting and i hadnt seen a good science fiction in a long while
though elysium has a lot of action scenes it is still very much a science fiction film
the vision of the future was very realistic and the grit of the film gave me the feeling that what was happening could really happen
elysium is a brilliant film sometimes hard to watch but the fact that it could make me feel so emotional i think is the mark of a well made movie
if you like science fiction or action this is a fantastic movie and i highly recommend it
elysium is one time watch movie
the concept of the movie is new but plot is same as we are watching scifi movies
story has not that much power that force to catch you in every scene
pace of the movie is totally slow
the elysium that has been shown in the movie is speechless and stunning
in action everybody has done a brilliant job
movies flow is not constant that engage you till the end
climax is superb and full of action
middle part is boring
movies length is 144 hrs still you get bored in so many scenes
go and watch it one time just to relax and to see another world
if there will be more sequences on elysium than earth then it would be marvelous
pace should be fast
just like audience enjoy climax whole story must be that engaging
overallone time watch and not recommended
neil bloomkamp presents elysium or should it be district 9 part 2
the premise is pretty simple in the future the earth gets overpopulated so the rich travel to a space station called elysium where they live a luxurious life
in elysium director bloomkamp once again chooses the way of the social message masking it with a very entertaining and visually impressive action drama
nothing to blame there
the directing is fine we have many great actors a thrilling plot a true blockbuster
the thing is that in terms of model this is exactly the same movie as district 9 sharing most of its ideas only adding a bigger budget and a better cast losing like that all the originality effect that district 9 was so praised about even if it was a bit overrated at times
like that elysium is just a competent blockbuster one of 2013s best but certainly not the masterpiece many were expecting

i truly appreciate what the filmmakers are trying to tell in this jesus christinspired tale however it goes over the top with gratuitous violence and lurid maiming
know that this kind of movie could have been made without violence swearing profanity etc
i appreciate the visual details and enjoy the thought of someone saving humanity however this can be done in a nonviolent manner
know that christ is all and that christ forgives so that this movie and all movies that contain falsity are rendered safe to see
i would urge parents not to take their children to see this movie as it contains too much violence profanity and adult situations
enjoy the thought of christ in your heart and know that you are forgiven
know that this type of film goes too far in the wrong direction toward losing its way when it had an interesting premise about a man saving humanity from disease hardship and suffering
i urge hollywood to stop including so much violence into these movies and let the story lead the way
i give this 35 stars
it was entertaining
not the best not the worst
i wouldnt say wow or anything but it was a fun night out
the plot was good but predictable
the acting was decent
the special effects were so so
matt damon was well matt damon
the standard performance from a bourne type movie
action scenes were good and the bad guy was pretty tough
it really was not that believable of a movie but if you can use your imagination you can get into it
my advice
if you really want to see it rent it on dvd
you can do better
if youre really into scifi check out the new star trek into darkness
overall i give it a 7 out of 10 or b grade
