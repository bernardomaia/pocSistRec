in the way of movies  mi4 ghost protocol is another in a long line of lets fill up the screen with as much crap as we can
busy does not mean good  its boring
the same jump off a rooftop car chases crashes  fights  etc etc etc
mi4 tries so hard to take itself seriously but instead ends up one long car chase so to speak
tom cruise does his usual look at me im trying to be cool act which is about the same thing he does in every one of his movies
his team of agents also does the we look cool so watch us do these cool things
the plot if there is one about the kremlin being blown up is boring  i fell asleep halfway through and wanted to just go home
the backers of this series are beating a dead horse trying to milk whatever else they can get out of it no matter how bad the script is or how long in the tooth cruise gets
sad thing is this movie will make money because cruises name is attached to it
too many fanboys out there who dont care if a movie sucks as long as their boy or girl is in it will plunk down the bucks to see it over and over
110 bomb
glamor unbelievably expensive cars and special effects are all stars of the movie if any
the story is enough entertaining for the video game if you are below 6 years of age
the plot sadly exists but is so banal and shallow that it might fit in one sentence kill the terrorist save the world and prove that americans rule and are almighty
and they so much are since walking into kremlin is a peace of cake gathering data there is easier than getting a hot dog on the local kiosk while people from time to time are becoming cats and walking on the outside wall of the tallest building in the world
the same heroes are walking into the worst sand storm and walking out in the most expensive model of bmw
wow
if we skip all the money invested in the movie and very solid film crew along with the actors it looks like the core idea for the movie has been written by a very small child
dont get me wrong i love fairy tales but even they have to follow some logic and style
frankly the only thing that amazes me in this movie is tom cruz this guy looks the same in last 25 years
the first half of the movie is probably the best action movie of the last 20 years
it is intense well shot engaging and absolutely stunning visually
the stunts and action set in budapest moscow and dubai and are absolutely fantastic and make the movie
unfortunately the movie slows down greatly in the second half of the movie or is it two thirdsone third
in mumbai and loses itself in some common genre traps too much explaining stuff that doesnt make sense and some fairly average action
its a small gripe probably half explained by the fantastic beginning of the movie
the cast is the best of the series jeremy renner is a good addition lea seydoux is a pretty cool villain and the female lead whose name escapes me is somebody i wish i would have seen in another movie
and cruise is cruise hes the man in this saga
a great movie overall well done brad bird
dialogue was god awful couldnt make it past the first 30 minutes
i know movies are supposed to have a bit of a leeway when it comes to being believable but this was just so ridiculous
we are just supposed to believe all this insane technology exists and its really this easy to break out of a prison
come on
no way
it would happen way more then at least make it seem difficult
i saw the imdb reviews and i was like oh its rated 7
7 this should be better than i think its going to be
how is it rated this high
its like a child wrote it
walked out and got a refund
not worth the price of a ticket
dont waste your money
wait until it comes out see it for free
id say this is a very poor effort to save the franchise
i think that even mi3 was better
for god sake in the first part of the installment theyve sticked a flying helicopter in a train tunnel
was there anything that special or extraordinary in this movie except cgi kremlin explosion which was shown in the trailer and the burjdubai scene you can find some videos of basejumpers making jumps from it on the net so theres nothing that surprised me
no
absolutely nothing
theyve even tried to make two people chasing the slowriding train look exciting and funny
how retarded is that for a mission impossible movie
ok ill admit i loved that holographiccorridor thing but thats about it
and how weird it is to read all the positive reviews about this movie and people praising it as a quality comeback
personally i think this movie is very mediocre and even worse than some of the lower budget and promotion action movies that been out lately
this is the third of four mission impossible films starring tom cruise that i managed to watch i only missed the second one directed by john woo
i enjoyed each one despite not always knowing what was going on and this was no different
still with those awesome stunts and those special effects one still gets entertained and doesnt think too much about the plot until they get to the exposition which always provide somewhat of a reasonable explanation of why things happen
and really cruise still has the charisma to sell it in a believable enough way
and the woman playing agent carter is sure hot enough isnt she
so on that note mission impossible  ghost protocol gets a high recommendation from me
i loved the editing and the direction of this movie
the movie kept moving and didnt got boring at any point
tom cruise clearly shows wrinkles now but his acting is getting better with his age
it was nice to see josh holloway in the movie and jeremy renner is very good addition in the hunt team did miss michelle monaghan though
the action sequences are done brilliantly except 1 scene on the highway they made me jump out of the seat at couple of points
all in all its a very good action movie
i wasnt expecting it to be this good after watching the first trailer of this movie but this franchise is definitely not over
the story is fairly typical for a bond movie  evil megalomaniac wants to blow up the world with a nuclear bomb  and immediately gets down to work with action scenes in budapest moscow dubai and mumbai
the cast is very effective and the action scenes all deliver
credit should be given to brad bird
he uses excellent timing makes sure we know that is tom up there on the side of the building and gives us a few surprises during the scenes
but at the end of the day this movie works because tom cruise sells each scene
he is casual about the action when he needs to be he is intense when it requires it and he is a truly likable action good guy
if they had half stars i would give this an 8
5
the movie is what it advertises to be nothing more nothing less
fast paced action that flies through to the finish
movie is really good i am really upset on seeing people complaining about scientology and other crap about tom cruise as a reason to not see mission impossible ghost protocol
i really wish they empathise with that man who said whatever he thought not out of malice but thinking that ritalin is indeed a street drug and many other psychiatric abuses are prevalent in our society
he is not going to make you do anything you dont want you people should decide what is best for you
as for the movieit was a top notch action thriller with great direction cinematography cool stunts and overall a complete package
the 30 minutes of imax shot in this movie was surreal and something to behold that itself justifies the extra imax price go see the movie because its really worth it imax recommended for complete experience
mi4 is at least one act too long
but that doesnt matter something is bound to explode and wake you up
there was some snoring going on from the audience
i knew when it was a meeting scene with the characters i could take my bathroom break
when i returned theyd be starting the next mission
predictable and way over the top  but then again its tc so
hes got to do inhuman acts and look cool doing so
oh and the missile to destroy the world with
0001 seconds on the clock been done about a thousand times
lazy
tc also goes with the hoodie yep hes like 50
mi4 like a lot of other big budget movies is like a running infomercial ie apple products everywhere
hwood doesnt like old people and they sure as he dont dig ms hp and other technology that just isnt hip
this film is boring right from the pathetic title sequence and never resembles the original tv series ever
apart from a couple of nice imax scenes of dubai it is so not worth the additional price to see it at imax or any theater
definitely wait for a video rental on this one
also i actually sorta liked the 2nd and 3rd one but this film has an almost nonexistent plot
come to think about it what were the other two films even about do you remember
you will forget this film except for one or two silly scenes involving weather and high places
i would have been more excited by character development and an actual story but i guess thats just an impossible mission to pull off these days when moviegoers seem to be entertained by special effects and glitz
by the way i kept expecting daniel craig to show up and introduce himself as 007
this film is bond very light
another american who saves the world isnt a bit transparent
i mean every movie more or less from the south coast over there is all about saving the world quire boring for the rest of us living in the real world
ever tried to kill the heroic and childish thinking
bruce willis played this role well in the late 80is and it worked flawlessly but now like twenty years later it seams absurd
travel the world next time you writing a film get close to reality
like they did with the bourne identity close to earth and very well done
i mean how hard can it be as long as your not stationed in the same place with the same circle of friends
i saw this movie twice and it was the best movie i have seen in years
i am not into action movies however this was the exception
it was so amazing that i had to see it twice
i didnt see the other three films but now that i have seen this one i really want to
however you do not need to see the other three films to enjoy this film
tom cruise is one of my favorite actors and as usual i was not disappointed by his performance in the film
i thought simon pegg also did a really amazing job as tom cruises side kick
i enjoyed the part of the movie when tom was climbing the side of the hotel in dubai
it was so cool that this part was incorporated in the film
it was exciting exhilarating and nerve racking
i could watch this movie 5 million times and still enjoy it
oh my
this movie is so impressive and should be watch and it is a must
i loved all the part in this movie
it showed the globalization of technology useful nowdays and their powerful abilities of using it
its inspired me of ideas of some part in the movie
it also add luxurious places and setting which i find it very comfortable
the theme in this movie are remarkable outstanding
and two thumbs up while standing solute it
i just love it
the best part in this movie where they go dubai at burj the world highest man made building ever
i then research about the scene in burj khalifa i find it  that mr cruise actually risk his own life while acting using a real rope climbing skill and real expose to the height
i mean it is not graphics editing or camera tricks  i mean come on nowdays movie is boring using the green graphics generator cover not that realistic
most of the scene in this movie using a real hacker skill which i love to watch
i love technologies and this movie has made it sparkle
nice
great and i watch this movie over and over again
caught it at a special screening in australia
i would like to thank ign for proving me the golden opprtunity
this movie is directed in a great style and its screenplay is so fast paced that you wont feel bore for a second it is in no ways a contender for this years oscar but if there was an oscar for the most entertaining film then it would be up for it
i wont tell you its story because i will like you to go to theaters and get shocked by its story
the question may arise if this film is better than previous mi movies let me tell u sth this is the best of the series
here are some reasons u why want to catch this 1
entertaining simon pegg 2
tom cruise 3
brad birds stylish directon 4
unpredictable plot 5
for being entertained 6
for a good action flick 7
jeremy renner 8
anil kapoor 9
for a film that makes sense 10
because it is a part of mission impossible franchise dont expect it to be a ground breaking film and you sure wont be disappointed
this what the spyaction genre is supposed to be like
there is not one wasted frame in this film
the photography is beautiful
the locations are visually interesting
but mainly its the story the story and the story that drives it
the actors gives believable performances
every one of them
particularly the foreignborn
i guess that equals effective casting
the musical score is great
i applaud especially the orchestrator for a fine job enhancing the film musically
i am positive that the next installment will be on my list as well
unlike some other franchises i have no fear of disappointment
the mission may seem impossible but great movies can still be made
this one proves it
good job
is it me or at the beginning of the movie when agent hanawayjosh hollowayjumps off the roof and turns around to shoot the bad guys as he is flying backwards he looks a lottoo much like tom cruise
slow it down and see for yourself
also did anyone notice that in his last movies cruise always finds an occasion for showing us how fast he runs
great movie for fun dont go looking for great acting
even though let us hope that they continue putting money in entertaining movies like this one
and maybe throw some good acting also
why didnt they put ving rhames only for a couple of seconds
bye guys thanks for the attention
tom cruises career has been down almost every road it seems and yet the best road he has ever gone down is the action picture road and his most successful has been the mission impossible franchise
while i havent seen any of the other films i was very impressed by this one
the film has everything you need comedy action suspense a good plot and well done performances which is actually rare for an action film
the only complaint i have is the villain
not only do we get maybe five minutes of screen time with him but his motives seem a little questionable and he overall comes off as extremely weak
but the positive of that we get to know the four team members very well and like each of them and hope they all accept their next mission which i definitely will
this movie was great
tom cruise is back in action once again
this is definitely the best mission impossible yet
tom cruise acted really well in this film and director brad bird just directed his best production
this movie acted like the real thing that happens in real life
it was very realistic even though the imf agency doesnt even exist
i could tell that the people in this movie did a really good job
now this movie might seem average with the bombing of the kremlin the imf being disavowed and ethan hunt going to save the imf
not average
this movie went down into the unexpected with assassins smugglers and the u
s
government
everyone did really good job in making this film
and the soundtrack was just amazing
i am going to download it to my mp3 player as soon as possible
i am going to buy this on dvd and i hope that tom cruise will come back to act in a sequel to mission impossibleghost protocol
this movie to my opinion is the best in the series i expected nothing seeing the movies before which to my opinion were poorly made but was very pleasantly surprised
i must point out that from all the previous movies i am glad to say that finally there was some kind of plot i could follow and enjoy not some dubious scenes poorly cut and connected together
like in the movies before
this movie is full of beautiful scenic shots and great special effects and as always tom cruise does a great job of acting giving a feeling of a modern james bond
to make it short i really liked it very much and hope to see more of the sort
what was there not to like
there was the action the gadgets the cars the stunts not to mention sarcastic amusement from simon pegg
sure weve seen it all before whether it be in the mission impossible series itself james bond or the bourne series but this particular take had a real slickness and refined edge towards it
cruises consistency as ethan hunt doesnt detract from the characters relative lack of development though although there was more screen time and attention given to the rest of the crew this time a welcome change from the films predecessors
plausability definitely deniable
entertainment value impossibly unlikeable
this is simply the worst mission impossible movie i have ever seen and is among the worst cruise had acted in
looks like the production team has run out of ideas to introduce new action scenes and so many things seems dysfunctional
cruise should stop the franchise as it is taking away the good memory of earlier mi movies
the movie is bad in action doesnt seem any thrill in the movie at all and the characters it feels were given the movie script on the day movie scenes were supposed to be shot
maybe just like some other series like james bond or the bourne series cruise should be replaced which seems not possible
i really think cruise is loosing his charm and his age is catching up to him
mi4 is another irritating action movie that thinks its cool because it has tom cruise climbing on a building and concept cars
this movie lacked any type of plausible story
of course it makes its adversaries look like idiots and has a really annoying comic relief electronics man
i really hate when script writers think that making everything go wrong builds tension
tension is built by having smart characters do smart things and still the hero comes out on top
this movie makes it look like spies go into the field with lots of faulty equipment
these items would be throw away by bonds q
i guess its just par for the course for these movies the first one was the only one that carried any weight in the spy genre
tom cruise is still good when it comes to action
he fits the role of a top agent
this sequel have a good script and was only divulged in the later part of the movie when it was found out that indeed it was hunt who was protecting his wife all along
all of the actors played their part accordingly got lots of laugh too
nice work mr
pegg
ha ha
jeremy renners role is mysterious and we hope to see more of his character in another sequel
paula patton looks hot in the movie too
to top it all i like the live action scenes  no doubles equals much respect to the actors and stunt crew
there are a lot of challenging scenes featured in the film like the part where cruise have to climb up the hotel in dubai
nice locations too
very scenic
a good movie indeed
the whole series of mission impossibles have been very exaggerated and this amongst all was the one which last pleased sequences of filming were over exaggerated and random things that are impossible to estimate are shown like its a piece of pie right from the start the movie shows things that are beyond impossible  thus making it mission impossible
if you are a person who watched with all attention if you are following the story with concentration the story depicts impossibility in every way the action sequencing is terrible the storyline line is very childish things dont connect to one one another correctly its displayed in very confusing mannerseverything is way too exaggerated and artificial
the movie is just packed up with loads action sequences just to keep customer busy and in the meanwhile the story going nowhere at all
to me it was a way to senseless movie
what should i say about this movie
this is excellent movie in the franchise yet
excellent acting nice photography cool action sequences
good humour
kremlin scenes and the dubai scenes are simply out of the world and breathtaking
simon is good in his role paula fits in properly but the show stealer is tom cruise
anil kapoor is waste  they could have taken some wannabe indian junior artist from hollywood or srk for that lame role
the plot is straight forward nothing new about it just saving the world from nuclear warfare what i missed in this movie was the twists and turns that has been the speciality of mission impossible movies but still it is a best action movie of the year
there is also a reference of sequel in the movie towards the end
will just have to wait and watch just go for it
worth the wait
the movie did have a lot of thrilling moments and there were some stunning views of burj khalifa saint basils cathedral and kremlin
but there was an absolute lack of intriguing drama
one felt comedy was illtimed and not at all hilarious
mi 4 makers failed in their research on india
the emerging nation was cast as a land of humongous population of brainless people  far from truth
elite hotels in india are not at all overcrowded
let me assure anil kapoor can speak better english than that and he is a much better actor
why he chose this suicidal role beats me
all in all you wont miss anything if you avoid it
awful and atrocious abominable awful dreadful painful terrible unspeakable dirty filthy lousy hateful mean
i dont know any more words but you get it right
if you like it you are a child and a child dont know better
the sentences in this movie are so dreadful i dont know if i shall cry or laugh
i am scared because that many people like it
it is a shallow movie and sums up what is wrong with big spending movies nowadays there is absolutely no moral attached to it no charm nothing but a sofa jumping self centered guy who has lost the human touch
is it a comedy action or drama
because emotionally it is a bad roller coaster ride
the movie made me jump 4 times during the movie and that is when tom changes the scene probably for waking me up
stop making these movies tom i beg you
i work with kids and all they do is pretending to be agent hunt and kill each other in playground
i want my money back
this is a awesome movie
mr
hunt is so tactful in this movie
by this movie mr
director try to introduced viewer about varieties culture of different countries
and thats also focusable the world residence are in the nucleolus bombing threat
this is a massage about nuclear weapons security issue
and the adventure of this movie so much bravo
tom cruise is out to demonstrate a touch
when is he not
of all contemporary movie stars he may be the one most eager for constant validation as if hed curl up and die if we ever thought he was past it or merely coasting
see he can play funny and bald tropic thunder mean and murderous collateral or a nazi valkyrie if required
today cruise must prove that theres fresh life in the mission impossible franchise though in fairness the commercially underperforming third one was pretty solid
how better to do it than jump in person off the tallest building in the world
technological use are shown perfectly
in a word this is a awesome directive story
to say that the special effects in this are outstanding would be a massive understatement
this movie is nothing short of stunning throughout many of the scenes
however unfortunately and i would guess due to tom cruises monstrous ego there are many many closeups of his face throughout the film
anywhere there is even a remote opportunity to move in on his face they do
its like is this mission impossible or mission show tom cruises face
look i like tom cruise
really
i dont like him enough to look at his face closeup over and over for an hour and a half
i gave this one a 6 mainly because its so stunning but definitely marred by the repeated unnecessary use of tom cruise closeups
i saw all 4 mission impossibles but this one was the best
tom cruise did an amazing job as well as the others but the first second i heard the mission its obvious that you know what will happen
just like superman he saves the day
i would have rated it higher but all i would add is more clues that lead up to who the person is
it would keep you hanging and i love that
so in a sentence mission impossible ghost protocol is a very intelligent action adventure movie that is very predictable
i hope you agree but if you think different than that is your opinion and i am fine with that
but this is my review and i hope you respect it
i am a very fair judge of movies
i dont just say i like it or hate it out of bias
but i must say ghost protocal was a pretty good movie
it is enjoyable for anyone over the age of 13
it had a little bit of everything in it
that is what i like to see in a movie
if it is an action movie i want to see more that just action
can i see a little comedy and drama in it as well
this is kind of how ghost protocal went
not going to give anything away but it had some great scenes in the movie
its not really a must watch movie but if you ever find yourself bored give a try
whoever did the cast was good
the actors did a fantastic job and actually fit the part
i cant always say that for some movies
well done
i watched m
i
on tv when i was youngerand i loved all of the action
the hot guys didnt hurt either
but the tv show was not as good as the movies are
tom cruise is by far the best ethan hunt yet
how ever i could never do the stunts he doesbecause iam deathly afraid of high places
that is my moms opinion on the hit action movie
my opinion is i never watched the original series  but i have seen the movies all 3
and i can honestly say i loved them
although i am not quite as adventurous as tom is some of the stunts are pretty risky
i guess that is what makes him such a good action good hero especially for women
to sum it up we havent it yet seen this latest addition to the m
i
series
but from what we saw in the trailers it looks pretty awesome
not to be taken for granted your expectations are amped as tom cruise returns as imf agent ethan hunt in this fourth installment of the missionimpossible franchise
notable brad bird directs this actionadventure with vigor
ghost protocol goes into effect after the agency is blamed for a terrorist bombing of the kremlin
hunt is left out in the cold and must gather a new team consisting of jeremy renner paula patton and simon pegg to clear the name of the agency
hunt suspects members of the new team may have individual agendas but the group must trust each other to complete a mission with practically no resources or backup
exceptional scenery and special effects and becoming the norm cruise does his own stunts
but then this project happens to be the highestgrossing film of mr
cruises career
kudos to cinematographer robert elswit
the cast also features samuli edelmann michael nyquist lea seydoux josh holloway and goran navojec
you cant accuse this movie of being bland
just pure adrenaline
on steroids
mission impossible ghost protocol is the most preposterous insane and illogical film youll see this year
yet its also probably the most entertaining and exhilarating with nearly every action sequence bringing something new to the now well worn formula
brad bird the director behind the incredibles and ratatouille really knows his way around a story
the clever script constantly surprises and bird never misses a beat while following the action
the story literally does not matterwhich is lucky because youve seen it before when the action is this fun
this high octane adventure will grip you from the first minute to the last
just let yourself go and revel in 120 minutes of pure unadulterated fun
this movie owes a lot of its shining value to tom cruise
he is getting aged but his soul is backtracking when he shot the first mi
when i heard he did not accept using any stunt and did the action for himself i could really enjoy his scene at the dubai burj khalifa
but frankly speaking ghost protocol is another mi meaning nothing that special
i think mission impossible attraction is on its unpredictable story and brilliant and intelligent chase
high technique such as mask disguise and gum bomb reminded me of classic 007 movie which i liked
but part 4 ghost protocol is going way too far
i cant understand all the magics that the imf agents are using
well people are aware of what is mi like already so thats why i felt boring about those skills
nevertheless with only one stunt scene at burj khalifa this movies becomes one of the best action movie in history
i know its so lame to watch 4th part
i didnt even watch 2nd and 3rd
but i had to see something thrilling after a disappointment with boring hugo
hey who are you to judge me
lol a lot of you will say its just another james bond or bourne identity movie and ill say you are right
however mission impossible has great acting great gadget and some new magic tricks by undercover agents
its a safe bet for those of us hungry for a good movie theater night
and the film does surprise us with the substory where agents are also humans and friends and not just coldblooded brainwashed contract killers
you will remember the ending
we throughly enjoyed mission impossible  ghost protocol
possible spoiler we love to try to determine who the bad guygirl is throughout the shows and movies we watch
we were actually all wrong because for once none of the team members were bad
we were also pleasantly surprised at the lighter moments that made us laugh
the action scenes and special effects were thrilling
we loved the stunts
the team which at first glance i thought was going to be an uninteresting group was amazingly exciting fun entertaining and mesmerizing to watch
we are definitely looking forward and hoping there will be a mission impossible 5 sooner rather than later
i havent found many movies worth of a cinema screen but this was definitely worth it
i think having j
j
abrams and michael giacchino involved was a good idea as the imf redeemed themselves after the what i consider the flop of the mi3
this time the movie was what a mi movie is all about good story suspense fun special effects secrets revealed nothing over the top
everything was perfect
i was on the edge of the chair since the beginning
a couple of time i jumped on it
thats what i was expecting from the latest mi movie
tom cruise brilliant and in good shape
simon pegg hilarious at the right time
loved jeremy renner
hope this is not the last
actors seemed not to have used too many stuntman which made even more interesting
i went to theaters to see mi 4 but i was not disappointed
action has always been the high point of the mission impossible series
but this kind of action wow
the new film is essentially a relentless rollercoaster ride that doesnt give you a moment to sit back and keeps the adrenalin pumping to dizzy heights as tom cruise gets on his regular mission of saving the world one more time
paula patton jeremy renner amp simon pegg are good but tom cruise steals the show
the technology is new which gives a good support to the movie
cruises ability to perform the most death defying stunts and an abundance of sheer luck which redefines the word impossible as possible
the director managed to keep the stunts scenes pouring in at regular intervals so there is no boredom
all and all a great movie which is a must watch for everyone
today i went to see mission impossible in theaters
i wasnt expecting nothing more than a terrorist threatening the world plot
thats what i got but the thing is that it is a good plot
ethan huntcruise is back in action with a whole new teamrenner pegg pattonand a new terrorist with a bomb
i loved the creativity of the weapons and items that were used in the movie
there was technology from the older movies and new technology in this one
there definitely was a lot of good comedy lines and phrases
at times i forgot it was mission impossible it had a different feel from the other ones
i thought it was a good enough add on to the series and hopefully they make more in the future
mission impossible ghost protocol showcases a plethora of stateoftheart acrobatics that will assuredly keep our hearts also flipping and flying turbulently within our ribcage until the very end of the film
each action sequence is carefully engineered so that it places itself perfectly to give way to a next even more exhilarating scene
the highlight being the impossible now made possible
display of supernatural flight and gravitydefying sprinting on and across a building comprising well over one hundred floors
mission impossible ghost protocol attempts to balance this series of ludicrous stunts with an added tint of brainy humor made primarily possible through the character of benji played by simon pegg
additionally this movie is also ingenious through its presentation of truly mindboggling gadgetry
overallmission impossible ghost protocol brilliantly exhibits impossible stunts impossible gadgets and makes it impossible not to entertain with its kinetic grandeur
having seen most of the films playing that i wanted to see and not being impressed by the new offerings i decided to go for eye candy and leave my brain at the door
unfortunately the latter came to join me anyway and at that point everything unravelled
critics claimed that this 4th outing in the series was the best which doesnt bode well for the previous ones which i didnt bother to see
as a teen i loved this tv series with often well thought out stories
what i liked most of mi on tv was the way they used every day objects in innovating ways to great effect
but in this film we are in super effects to fill the eye especially in imax along with doubtful tools
everything in fact to try to mask an improbable story
tom cruise shows us once again his depth by playing tom cruise as usual as he did in so many films before
it gets tiring in the end
he plays this intrepid and invincible american hero who fears nothing save pretending the fear of heights to pretend to be comical
i could hardly wait for the end of this
