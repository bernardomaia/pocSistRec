this movie is utterly awful unless you are ready for a bad comedy
there are tons of flows
albania doesnt border turkey
istanbul is a magnificent city
in the movie it is portrayed as a third world country slam hole
police in istanbul have new cars
the girl doesnt have a driver license in the us where everyone drives an automatic
yet in the movie she hops in a stick stick shift cab and shows some amazing skills
so lame
shots are fired in a hotel grenades are detonated in a middle of a cosmopolitan city
and theres no police
the main character is taken on a ride for a few minutes and yet he appears to be almost next to the hotel
albanians converse in english
i was unfortunately taken to see the movie hoping the directors art director etc would have done a better job since midnight express
the scenario is full of awkward hard to be believe events like kim bombing the whole covered bazaar area which is like one of the most crowded parts of the city
while she is doing that the dad is kept by the kidnappers who were stupid enough to leave him alone for hours and let him speak on the phone
he escapes from the place just like that and then is followed by turkish police cars from 1970s
kim who was not able to drive automatic car in us right away makes all these car moves driving a stick taxi in the most narrowed streets
i also have to mention that all the women appeared in the movie were dressed in black veils i dont know why someone should explain that also turkey does not have a border with albenia
the list goes on but i dont think its worth to spend money or time
the movie was very stupid and naive
producers did not bother to make anything meaningful assuming that people will go watch it anyway
what a disappointment
nothing has remained from the realistic first part
this one is more like a naive boring drama with infrequent heroic acts of liam neeson
in fact most of the time he looks like a pompous clown trying to be serious while playing a stupid script
as in a regular cheap movie bad guys are not really bad and are very respectful to the main characters always giving them plenty of time to talk and to run away
what irritates even more is ridiculously large amount of product placement
save your time and money dont watch this movie in theaters
what an utter disappointment
like many fans of the original taken i was looking forward to a sequel to see if it could match or in any way surpass the original
i am afraid that as as sequel i am left perplexed at the lack of any tension real action and pace in the film
the villains were not as nasty as they should be after all they were seeking revenge for the slaughter of friends and family and all appeared not all intimidating
there was no sharp dialogue and some scenes bordered on the risible especially when liam neeson was trying to give directions to his daughter on his whereabouts
the finale was rushed and overall the film lacked any bite or interest
dull unimaginativeonly liam neeson kept what glimmer of hopes alive by his solid acting
however a real shame the film could not even match or equal the original
do not waste your time see the original taken and leave this sequel alone
terrible and a major disappointment to anyone that loved taken like i did
weak plot terrible action and preposterous storyline make it laughable
i know the first one was far fetched but much more believable
takes away from the first one
the fact that kim couldnt get her license and then magically can drive a stick shift is ludicrous
the fight scenes were filmed too close up to see and the albanians were made to look like total idiots by missing every shot and liam landing everyone of them
the story was slow to start and seemed filled with fluff
the movie ends without a real build up leaving you wondering
what just happened
i liked the movie but they should know more details about turkey
even my girlfriend she is from russia she told the city doesnt seem like istanbul
albania doesnt have border between turkey
budget is 45000000 how come did you find 80s police cars  even those cars not driving anymore for 20 years
i never seen before covered women in turkey like a arabian countries
in the movie every women have black cover
mostly people in usa drive automatic cars and the girl didnt pass driving test 2 times but the girl drives a manual car perfectly in turkey
how come
if you didnt go istanbul before you wont go to istanbul after this movie
it is not fair
i think taken 1 was better
as the the first movie was awesomewe were looking forward to watch this movie
but when the film was over we were terribly disappointed
i dont know where to start telling the nonsense of the scenes which were shot in astanbul
first of all turkeyta1 4rkiye doesnt have a borderlooks like a car park barrier with albenia
also albanians doesnt have a relation with prostitution as the turkish people are not tortures as well
i think its about the film makers point of view to ta1 4rkiye
the police cars in the movie were 1980 models and they are now exhibiting in tofaa museum
our police cars are recent as our buildings
but there is a huge difference between the buildings in the movie and the buildings in astanbul
director was focused in the old astanbul called historical peninsula and in this area there are so many ancient buildings bazaars and mosques
in modern astanbul most of the women does not wear veils as the men in astanbul doesnt have beards like pilgrims
in conclusion astanbul is not thisturkish people are not these
albanians are not these
this is my first time to write a review and thought of it as an obligation
yesterday i went to watch it under the impression that it will be as good as taken 1  but its not
the story line in taken 1 was more strong as it was driven by the love of dad for his daughter and of how extreme he can go to save her and that was touchy
i cant understand why do they have to involve islam into this and to show that muslims are that bad  they could have leave it open without indication to any religion just gangs
by this they tried to show muslims as if they are very bad they kidnap girls they dont keep their words which is not the fact
what did this add except falsification of the image of islam
if you are against disfavor between religions dont watch this
but if you like action  and you can ignore the story line then you might enjoy it
this movie is so ridiculous
people magically learn how to drive a car
others just burst into embassy and walk out of it as if nothing happened
and its nothing special to throw around grenades in a crowded area
also there are huge geographical mistakes
there is no border between albania and turkey
also not every woman in istambul wears a burka
this is a really bad movie
i mean i really like movies like the first part and the transporter but this is just ridiculous
actually you can see that liam nesson is really trying to play a good role but the script is so bad he just cant
the worst thing is that they have already announced a third part
since 2008 i have been watched the first taken over and over
i was expected great one from taken again
the first day of screen i went to see taken 2 but it was very awful this time
there are many objections about this movie that i can mention and it is impossible to combine all of objections here
actually i could not find any positive point to mention about taken 2
the very ugly view and different view of turkey istanbul clumsily acting from actors and actress
all the dialogue was exactly copy from first taken and there was not any new dialogue
and many other points that it is not expected from this movie which it had great background from first taken
taken 2 was not enjoyable for me at all and i think it created to get more money for producer only
taken was a rough and dirty bloodbath that defied the odds and became a smash at the box office almost recouping ten times its 25m budget and reinvigorating liam neesons career as a tough old son of a bitch in the process
it didnt have expectations to live up to making it easier to enjoy
on the other hand this followup has had the bar set at a modest height and fails to reach it
plot is never at the top of the priority list for revengethrillers so the barebones story can be forgiven what cant go unnoticed though is the awfully clichad dialogue we will have our revenge hisses the cardboard cutout villain and the muted action sequences
seemingly out of puff both the movie and neesons excia operative bryan mills meander along checking off the actionfordummies boxes but never deliver any real pulseracers
the violence is unusually meek the climactic showdown fizzles when it should burst and most visibly neeson is perhaps getting too old for this sht
first of all  story is far from persuasiveness
anybody can produce better scenario in a 30 minutes deliberation
besides acting is terrible i mean really terrible
idiotic conversations make the movie extremely boring
in addition i can honestly say that this production is malevolent
i live in istanbul please google istanbul and see what it is
you cant see those cars on the roads in istanbul they are antique
you cant see those women in the streets
producers aimed to demonstrate turkey as afghanistan like 3
world country deliberately
shame on them
nobody should use art for abuse
i condemn this kind of ideological behaviors
i have visited istanbul several times and the city shown in the movie is not istanbul or i have never been to astanbul
istanbul is a very modern crowded withover 13 million population european city
this movie is either shooted to insult one of the most beautiful city in the world or they cut the budget and casted in poor and cheap places or used cheapest tools ever
if you are really willing to know about istanbul so that you can easily understand how bad the movie was made just hit youtube and compare the real one and the unreal one
when using the name of the city in your movies you can not mislead audiences unless it is a fiction one
no this is not the worst movie of 2012 it fact there are so many other crappy movies out there that in comparison this movies is pretty darn good
but
this movie really isnt very good its predictable the acting is robotic and stiff the action scenes are almost laughable liam neeson moves like hes an old man with arthritis the bad guys are so stupid that they dont deserve to live and yet will all that said this is still kind of a fun movie to watch
the problem is i loved the original taken movie so when this one came along i went into it with high hopes and there in lies the problem
had i read a review like this prior to viewing i think i wouldnt have been so sorely disappointed
for those of you who also enjoyed the original taken let me now warn you this is a hollow shell of a sequel but as action movies go this is not a total waste either thus i rate it a 5 star out of a possible 10
how does this terrible sequel have a 6
4 on this website
have people really lowered their standards that much on movies
i mean cmon
this movie was filled with so much fake bs it was ridiculous
list go to the list shall we the fight scenes where terrible compared to the first ones fight scenes the bad guys werent menacing at all the daughter becomes an expert wheelman in 5 minutes apparently you can throw grenades in a heavily populated area with absolutely no repercussions the gun sound effects where completely wrong ex
apparently 9mm pistols sound like they shoot
45acp roundsi could not take the main bad guy seriously at all because he looked like the dos equis guy
the list goes on and on
how this movie has this high of rating i have no idea this is a 3 star movie easily
the only reason i gave it a 4 was because of liam neeson
the director and everyone involved should be ashamed of themselves for making such a terrible sequel
this movie follows on from taken 1 which was also fantastic
if you liked taken 1  you will not be disappointed with taken 2
normally sequels are not as good as the first movie but this is an exception
it shows a reality that most of the time people from the first world countries cannot even imagine such situations to be real
all actors performed their roles flawlessly
the story is really concrete and the action is one of the best
it is also good to see istanbul in this movie from a more real perspective and not the touristic image that is normally sold
the music is perfect and the sensation throughout the movie makes you feel like you are right in the thick of it
i advise you to take a deep breath
you will need it
forget bad comments about this movie
this is 10 out of 10 and a mustwatch and should be better rated on here
when i enjoyed the first taken i was surprised and although i dont normally follow the hype i thought taken 2 bring it on
oh dear
the plot is ridiculously predictable and any allusion that the film is funny or poking fun at itself is grossly overstated
this is a very poor movie with anachronistic sets terrible action movie oneliners and some shocking fight sequences
by the end of the movie i was actually angry this feels like a rushed together nonsense made to ride the tidal wave of the first movie hmm hollywood aping on the success of a popular movie by making an asinine sequel i wont hear it
despite all of this its an entertaining hour and a half just not of the quality that would bring anything like the 6
7 average rating it currently has
if this went straight to dvd or was a tv drama i would have been a bit more forgiving
a well spent 45 million dollars
i am really surprised that this movie did this well in the first weekend
movie was not that great
for sure not better than the first one
i think that movies have been so bad lately that people have let standards slip or are just so hard up for some thing that is not a comic bookremake of an older movieold tv sit com turned bad movie they are will to pay for any thing they think has some guts to it
movie scene very poor right now
where have all the goodgreat people gone
i do not want to see harrison ford in his 90s jumping around bullets in indian jones cause no one else can do it
come on people what the hell is wrong with you
i want to make sure no one gets scared off and doesnt see it
i thought it was a really good movie  if you liked the first one
the way people judge movies sucks and ill be quick and make it simple
liam neeson is still a bad ass and a great actor the story still keeps your attention even if its not as real as the other story
then as soon as it becomes tense again liam reminds you who the real bad ass is and takes care of business
they did a good job shooting the film and the story line is a good one for a second movie
not to mention you get some more cool intel on killing people and sercets of finding people
go see it  youll enjoy it
where can i start from
i dont know
i know istanbul very well and this is not real istanbul which really exits
1 all women in istanbul not in black clothes
the women views of movie belongs to 16th century 2these police cars are not original police cars
turkish police never used cars something like that
the movie has taken in 2012 but cars belongs to 1960s
3 taken and taken2 all polices are venal
horrible idea 4 ezan the song which imam sings to call people for praying is not 724 on line 5 albanians cant pass borders of turkey like that
6bryan mills is the man who has endless numbers of bullets  really
7 you cant never enter into american embassy like that at least not live
and i count many many
this movie was taken sloppy and careless
i dont advice anyone to watch
since that is assuredly what happened to audiences worldwide
the first film was really no great shakes but at least maintained a sense of consistency and reality that didnt leave viewers shaking their heads
this followup from the same writing team of luc the professional besson and robert mark the fifth element kamen just doesnt cut the mustard the cake or even the cheese
its tired trite and terminally boring and i cant really blame the new director olivier columbiana megaton
its all in that lackluster script as is always the case in duds like this one
liam thanks for the paycheck neeson brings nothing new to the table and hasnt for quite some time now and the rest of the cast is well happy to take their paychecks too
in a nutshell utterly disposable and forgettable
dont let yourself be taken as well there are far too many better films out there for you to be wasting your time with this one
here we go again with liam neesons exwife and daughter in peril from very mean albanians
this time neeson is in istanbul turkey when the father of one of the guys he killed in the first film gathers his flock of gangsters to kill neeson
his family happens to be there and so he must rescue them from the evil villains
nothing new in this go round but liam makes the ninety two minutes go by briskly and in spite of his extremely annoying offspring i was able to tolerate the spoiled brat and just sit back and laugh at the adventure
leave your brain at the door and have some fun watching the big irishman having a grand old time
very disappointing
it is supposed to be about albanian revenge towards x cia agent and played in istanbul
action
but its actually just stupid
shame on the director and script writer
at least if you really want to make money be realistic about it
place geographical locations where they are not where you like them to be
portray peoples cultures as they are not as you like them to be seen
if albanians want revenge they dont wait
they dont hold you captive not for a second
also in the end the father gives liam his word that he is going to end it but picks up the gun and tries to shoot him
that is so lame
when albanians give their word they would die before they break it everyone knows that
also i read the names of the cast members and there is not one real albanian playing a role they are all turks
anyway based on the ending i am 100 sure there is a third coming
go study some geography and international studies as a toddlers step
this the worse movie of 2012 perhaps
taken 1 was a really good one
this one is not only terrible in acting but also script
if you love the story that americans never die and with a small gun they can concur the world take your flag and march to the movie theaters
it is also full of mistakes
the point of capture and point of torture is not the same however somehow our hero in the movie counts the seconds after his capture in istanbul a city with over 20 million people and one of the largest metropolises in europe
his wife and himself are taken hostage at the european side and brought to a place in asian side
a journey which usually takes an hour but our hero remembers every second every turn and every sound of it
secondly when a prayers comes 5 times a day and lasts for 2 minutes from a mosque he uses this as one of the signs to remember where he was captured
movie shows that prayers from the mosque never ends
terrible acting terrible script terrible editing
first of all i did give this an average rating for the acting and action
it did not put us to sleep
that said this film was very ordinary with no twists or anything shocking
it had that feel of a romantic comedy where everything that you expect happens
the film just veered along smoothly and that was the problem
in other liam neeson movies taken and the other man come to mind there were twists galore  which made for an exciting movie going experience
it was clear this was along the lines of the rocky series and other brand movie series  this was made simply for a big guaranteed paycheck
not much thought went into this film
it was most likely rushed to get it into the theaters for that big payday
shame on liam neeson for this project
hopefully he stays away from hollywood greed like this and becomes relevant again in his next film
you know how police officers cant watch cop movies and physicists cant watch science fiction and lawyers cant watch well anything
nobody can watch this
it is entirely implausible
i was constantly reminded of that scene from whichever of the austin powers movies where the kid says just shoot him
give me the gun ill shoot him or something like that
anyway this movie no way
i too started to catalog all the foul ups i could not find that kind of time
oh the exwife ick
seriously ick
makes me wonder if the first one was just a fluke
bad movie
why oh why did they have to make this werent there better ways to make a buck
oh love that line from the reviewer who wrote taken 2 as original as the title
funny good line
i hope to do as well
when i first saw this movie i enjoyed only the video effects
the story was not interesting at all and it had a lot of false scenes which show negative sides of albanian people which is not true
especially the end of the movie is a total disaster and the worst thing that you guys can think of albanians
when an albanian gives the word it is saint for him and he will do whatever it takes to keep it
it is better to be dead than not to keep the given word
this is how albanians consider it and i think that the end of the movie is a wrong fact for albanian people
try not to create a bad image of the people worldwide especially if you do not know them
it is not a good thing for the communities and different people to create a bad image for other communities
taken 2 is the sequel to the successful taken film sees a similar rehashed story though set in a different location
into the film and for reasons that dont deliver bryan liam neeson daughter kim maggie grace and exwife lenore famke janssen whos facing a divorce from her current husband are all in istanbul to have a good time and unwind from the trauma of kims kidnapping
taken 2 appears to take its time getting to the action dithering away an inordinate amount of time on lenores crumbling marriage her astonishingly good relationship with bryan and bryans notification that kim has a boyfriend
the films action sequences are wide and thin and the camera is noticeably shaky in many of the scenes
the plot isnt too much nor is it all that interesting
predictable in the least
overall taken 2 does deliver in some ways but in general the film is quite boring and not too entertaining
though it isnt too long which is a plus
this movie does not offer any surprises
the plot is linear no turns in sight its as if the original film has been remade
lots of shooting car chases people dropping dead its the usual fare
neeson looks good sounds good and shoots good
he is like the unkillable hulk just like the first movie
the other actors dont have much to do
they are either running shooting or fainting
unlike the first movie this does not have any memorable dialogues not for me
if you just want to see an action flick or if you havent seen the first movie you can go for this one but dont expect too much
if you have seen the first one maybe you can leave this one out
dont watch this film unless you have nothing else to do and you want to watch another mindless hollywood film that has the same old formula super bad guys want to kill super good guy
2 attractive females in short skirts
car chases explosions martial arts fight scenes
even the end of the film is exactly the same as many other hollywood action action films youve seen i wont spoil it for you but it required no imagination at all and youve seen this kind of ending many times before
garbage film
everyone involved should be embarrassed
i dont understand why i need to fill in 10 lines of text to write a review on this website
i find that requirement ridiculous
this is my point of view and my review i should be able to write it in a few sentences or in 2 pages if i want to
the first film of taken saga was interesting and not complicated by a contorted plot
this movie doesnt have a really plot and also the action scene arent really fresh
in the first episode there was only a simple motivation that carry you into the entire movie
in this movie the motivation is forced and weak and doesnt thrill me
acting is unnecessary and also liam neeson is tired
scene actions are not realistic and istanbul dont create a real appeal like paris
maggie grace is not a child anymore and famke janssen is had difficulty with acting
everyone in this time made a sequel but it is not a rule
i hop e luc besson understand this and will not realize an entire saga with 4 or more episode
good things are many like better cinematography long action sequences maggie grace used better liam was as well as in first movie
there were so many things could have been much better like kim dont trust her father before being in trouble
liam is one man army and fight like father of rambo how
he never seen practicing boxing or doing workout but he does it very well
how
dozens of bad guys why
if mr
director you wanna convey viewers that cia guys can fight numerous bad and huge people then sorry keep bad boys at least less than 5 or 4 at time
what more i can say there should be freshness in story instead of father daughter but i think director wanna show his daughter that her father can do anything
and why a boyfriend was used
to create suspense
sorry there was waste of an actor and nobody found him suspicious
but good timepass movie
watch it
one time these two members of a bad large muslim family kidnapped a member of a good white european family
the father of the good white family killed the 2 members of the bad family
their father in turn swore revenge on the good family
because this is a male fantasy romantic suspense novel our hero is blessed with a daughter who is totally obedient and follows all orders explicitly and a wife who lays around totally passively and gets carted around like a big sack of potatoes
various adventures ensue like car chases and fights and so forth as the good white father begins systematically mowing down every single member of the bad family
finally at the end the bad father proves hes bad so the good father kills him in the exact same manner that the bad guy dies in midnight express which is also set in istanbul
then they all go to to a diner and have milkshakes
taken 2 is for those who are 13 and older and like to watch fast paced actionspy movies
the movie moves at a fast clip and holds your attention throughout
taken 2 is a good prime time movie to be watched either alone or with friends
there is a lot of killing and chasing in the movie
although the killing is done in several different ways it is not gory
i did enjoy the chase scenes
liam neeson does make a good spy character
this is a good movie for pizza instead of popcorn as you will want to do your eating before the film
you will enthralled with the film to eat during its showing once it gets going
get your buddies together and enjoy the film
i just watched taken 2 and it was ridiculous how they portrayed istanbul to the audience
i really dont understandwhat kind of obsession does hollywood have about pretending istanbul as trash or showing turkey as a primeval country
i have two theories about that one of them is they dont have enough money so they can only take scenes in lower class areas or they are extremely jealous about its beauty so they are trying to traduce on it
i think the second one makes more sense
but at least they developed themselves i mean in midnight express we were traveling with camels but in taken 2 our officers using cars from world war 2 it is tragicomic
i really dont know what is their problem
after watching taken some years back i was excited to read about there being a sequel as it was a thrilling and unexpected hit
unfortunately taken 2 does not live up to the first not even close
its very predictable and unbelievable
its not the worst film ever but i put it as one of the most disappointing
on a plus liam neesom is on a par with the first with his his certain set of skills
he is nimble in the fight sequences and makes it look like second nature
however he gained super sonic speed at one point to rescue his daughter
a lot of the scenes are very convenient and and they seem to find their way around istanbul very easily
on a plus its pretty fast paced and a short film by todays standards
if they do taken 3 they need to come up with a decent plot maybe not involving his ex wife and daughter
watch it if there s nothing else on
this is watchable but it is hard not to compare it to the first film which was outstanding
i wont go into all the plot holes as everyone else has mentioned these but there was a lot of as ifs coming from my lips as i watched this
the first one was very clever and kept you guessing but this one was not very believable as many have already said
all the acting was first rate but the director and script writer let the film down
the fight choreography was really bad and the final fights particularly badly done
over all it was a wasted opportunity to build on an excellent first film
all too often hollywood seems to push out sequels without much care
sherlock holmes iron man etc all had awful sequels in fact only the bourne films seemed to get it about right
istanbul is a city with both historical and modern buildings and it is one of the most magnificent cities in the world
it is the only city which connects two continents in the world
it is possible to see lots of sport and expensive cars in istanbul which is just the opposite of the movie
also police cars in the movie are the ones used in the 90s not today
i think the way movie represents istanbul is wrong in lots of aspects
so i wont try to explain all of them but i think this is disrespectful to mislead people about istanbul although people in this city helped them to take this movie
people should research istanbul after they watched this movie to see what istanbul is really like
i hate when reading through reviews it seems as if for most of the people there is nothing between supergood or superbad
everyone calling this the worst movie of any year clearly doesnt have any idea what a really bad film looks like
is the movie a moneygrab
propably
does it have a really good script
no
is the script terrible
of course not
is the acting bad
no way
its just not as good as the innovative as far as a movie can be innovative nowadays stuff shown in taken
you get more or less the same basic characters and protagonists and the antagonists seek revenge this time instead of just looking for girls to sell them for profit
while the action is  like in every blockbuster  as far from believable as it can get liam neeson as always shows exactly what we expect him to do godlike skill in making human lives miserable and killing everyone in his path
never judge a movie on 1 star reviews taken 2 is just maybe not worth being bought on dvd which doesnt make it a bad movie
watch it once if you can see it on tv thats all
iam very disappointedi
when i watched it i wanted to take back my wasted time and just do something else
people who enjoyed it must really have poor taste on action movies
with its unimpressive plot wryly written script and implausible lead actor its really a disappointment
i think that that schindlers listi actor doesnt even knows how to throw good punches and do adrenalinrushing fight scenes
the only moments where i enjoyed the movie was when liam neeson wasnt on the screen
shame on this movie
sadly of all the characters in the movie i think the lead is the worst
im not that into action movies and before this i cant remember a single terrible action movie
i dont really like it in general
its just an overhyped action movie with nothing really special about it
when i watched first movie i was very amusing and waited for the second one impatiently
but second movie was a mess
first of all there are some logic mistake in the film
because the girl cannot drive the car very well but somehow she managed to drive the car between the istanbul street which the most difficult street even for the best drivers for my opinion
and another mistake in the film is turkish life that is reflected in the film
because every women you see in the film has a sheet on their everywhere
i have never seen so many closed women in my life in turkey and police cars are really comedy  film productor wants to show turkey very back minded but i can say it is not like in the film
please try to be more realistic when you present a country
i wouldve felt ripped off a little had a saw this in theaters but i had a free rental so i didnt even have to pay to see it
theres some good action in this film but your intelligence might be a little insulted
it seems like they were just trying to bank off the first by making this sequel
the problem is they made too much money off this film so i could see them trying to make a third but hopefully not if they read these reviews
i didnt understand why they made a sequel so i had low expectations going into this so i wasnt disappointed
ive seen a lot of bad movies so this wasnt the worst and it was filmed good with that dark effect like the first
i very much wanted to just sit back and enjoy this movie however it contained way too many plain and simple irrational events to just gloss over
i can usually let a couple of these things fly but when they crashed their car through the embassy gates instead of stopping like any rational person would the bad guys had already crashed behind them i just couldnt take it anymore
the us marines at the gate shot up their little car with a
50 cal but somehow left it fully intact
ridiculous
another thing was that when he was trying to go back and save his wife he was somehow able to retrace his steps in such record time that the bad guys couldnt even walk out of their own building with his wife before he showed up
this movie contains many exciting parts and cool scenes but these ongoing inconsistencies with logic really detracted from my ability to fully enjoy the story
cant believe how laughably bad this movie is
the daughter who looks like a serial mom is supposed to be a virgin with an overly protective father concerned that she doesnt engage too prematurely
the bad guys are evil far easterners with minds set on vengeance
this movie is almost arty in the way it depicts prejudice on more levels than one
a meta film about the european way of regarding american religious fundamentalism with extreme prejudice
suppose im pissing off some american readers here but really this movie would be regarded as a taliban top ten had it been a guy in nightgown and turban killing off the bad guys
im amazed that liam leeson lent himself to this most ludicrous of movies
it rates the highest improbability factor of any movie i have ever seen
the daughter about to sit her driving test manages to outwit half of the police force and the villains by driving like a formula 1 expert plus stunt car driver combined
she also manages to navigate her way across roofs evading her pursuers and finding just the right chimney to deliver her missile down just on time
well it can only be a spoof but some people may take it seriously
the sickeningly schmaltzy ending is just puerile and embarrassing
dont say you havent been warned
i am living in istanbul and the day we are living i never see these kind of police cars and women wearing black clothes
the government should give the permission according to some rules like the company has to show the real views of the country not something unreal
on the other hand the second version isnt successful as the first one
the first one was very fascinate but this one is made for to make money after a successful one and when we watched it we easilly guessed what would be at the next stage
an my opinion the best scene was the view of the bosporus from the hotel room
besides that there were absurd scenes
when the albania people were passing the turkish border there were only a few government officers and a barrier
i am a turk and i havent seen so many women in my life in istanbul with black turbans as many as those i have seen in this movie
if you want to show those kind of women go to arabia or such countries
we dont have them in turkey
i believe this is a tradition for some movie makers
as i said turkey is a secular country and we are so modern as europeans and usa citizens

see hospitality and live the warmth of being in a country with so many warm people
we want to say again that if the movie makers want to give some oriental ism they have to do it in the right way and treat correctly to the country they are making the movie
after enjoying taken 1 i watched this one with high expectations
in total the movie was o
k i havent felt bored or anything but i havent watched it with passion as well
the story line was poor depending totally on the previous movie which i think it is not very charming
liam neeson seems like an old man trying to be in shape thus the action and combat scenes were short slow not so interesting and very clicha
the suspense factor were missing no original ideas
you feel like they are depending on the success of the previous movie and trying to get as much money as they can get
very poor choice of music and soundtracks like they havent put much effort into it
the trick scene the scene when he told his daughter how to find them was the most clever and interesting scene in the whole movie
at the end it was o
k emotionless without a deep meaning clicha a rip off from the previous movie and you have a feeling they didnt an effort into it anyway
