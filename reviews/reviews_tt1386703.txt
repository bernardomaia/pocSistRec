"\nThis movie is one of those remakes which is not as good as the original\n90s version. In other words it was pointless.<br><br>There is some continuing action that keeps one mildly engaged but the\nstory is weak. The Arnie version had a clear and interesting plot with\ncharm and wit remember \"Sweetheart, be reasonable. After all, we're\nmarried!\", \"Consider this a divorce\". Also the climax was grand and\nfascinating - the lack of oxygen bug eyed thing.<br><br>There are some vast multi level future cities that resemble an\novercrowded Hong Kong or Shanghai. But the chase routines that race\nthrough them are repetitive after a while.<br><br>Kate Beckinsale's character kept popping back too many times and there\nis no reason why she is so relentless. Maybe just because her husband\nis the director. It was nice to see Jessica Biel in a big budget movie\nagain. Colin Farrell plays a more regular guy than an action hero which\nis good but he doesn't have interesting lines to deliver.<br><br>Overall, see this if you want to but be warned it's not as good as the\n90s version.\n"
"\nI wish I could recall the last two hours of my life. I really thought\nthis movie would be fun - not good, mind you - but fun. A re-make of an\nold classic with an even bigger budget, better actors, and today's\nspecial effects would be worth 8 bucks. Plus Jessica Biel is sexy as\nhell. I was rewarded for my rare optimism by poor acting (seriously,\nthe robots were more engaging); clich√© dialogue (at one point, the\nvillain actually said darkly, \"Go handle it\" to his henchman); and\nunpredictable plot-turns (the audience was kept guessing what the hell\nwas going on). And these were all carefully scripted for the sole\npurpose of getting to the next action sequence - none of which had\nanything to do with the original movie. The only call-back to the\noriginal title was the appearance triple-titted hooker. No need to\nexplain how the hell a regular human came to have these mammoth\nmilk-monsters, because there are three of them. I should have walked\nout after they made their five-second cameo. I would have been happier.\n"
"\nTotal Recall - What a waste of money and talent! Unfortunately, none of\nthese 2 aspects are a part of this film.<br><br>You have high paid actors, 2 female A listers, a highly gross budget,\nand a lot of money spent for nothing! I am not sure what the purpose of\nremaking this film was for. The Swarzenneger original was a clever and\nentertaining film for it's time. If the original was bad, then I would\nunderstand why some studio would have an interest in remaking it.\nBuilding the creativity of the story. <br><br>However, the original did it's part and for what market or audience it\nwas originally intended for, the original did the trick and this is\njust a sloppy makeover. A film of this kind has but one purpose - to\nhopefully, ride the coat-tails of the original (without really adding\nanything clever) in order to try and build up the bank bucks on another\nunnecessary sequel. Shame on you!\n"
"\nWhat can i say, i really enjoyed this movie. There are similarities to\nthe original but the new twist was very entertaining. It is definitely\na special effects lovers dream come true. <br><br>I don't really understand why some people gave this movie a bad review\nwhen clearly this is much better than most of the c*ap out there. I\npresume that most of the haters are either somehow against the movie to\nbegin with or just don't acknowledge a good movie when they see one. <br><br>Overall i give it an 8 out of 10 and would recommend this movie to\neveryone. It was just as entertaining as the original albeit with new\ntheme.\n"
"\nI think the other reviewers here were too kind. The movie is\nunforgivably terrible. No storyline, no dialogue to speak of other than\nalmost-verbatim regurgitations from the original film, poorly acted,\nand utterly boring. I couldn't wait for the drawn-out affair to end.<br><br>The CGI elevators and car chase scenes were quite fantastic but with no\nstory to back-up such graphics and artificial set, there was little\npoint other than to wonder during the film why all the money went into\nthe visuals and marketing and not into plot development or storyline.\nIf just some budget had gone to the story the film could have been\nwonderful.<br><br>For those who never saw the original, I don't know how you will ever\nfigure out what this movie is trying to say or accomplish other than to\ntake some hard-earned money out of your wallet.<br><br>This film in now on my Top Ten Worst Films of All Time list.\n"
"\nIt's truly awful and you will need a trip to Rekall after watching it\nto wipe this horribly dull film from your mind after you have seen it.<br><br>Arnie's version is now a classic this is rubbish and Philip K. Dick\nwill be spinning in his grave.<br><br>There were some good moments up until the end of the car chase scene,\nbut after that this is a floater with one stupid, brain-numbing scene\nafter another.<br><br>Without putting spoilers in this review lets just say in the future the\nworld is populated by too many stupid people and robot cops that can't\nshoot to save themselves.<br><br>Also no Johnny cabs :(\n"
"\nThe story: the government of Britain is going to wage war and wreak\nhavoc on one of its colonies until the heroic American saves the day!\nSeriously, it's that stupid.<br><br>The fact that this terrible movie shares the same name as the\nmysterious and intriguing Schwarzenegger/Stone film of 1990 is an\nabsolute insult. There is no suspense, mystery, or intrigue in this\nversion of Total Recall. Both the central character and certainly the\naudience pretty well know the real situation from the beginning. So,\nrather than sharing in the doubts of the central character who, in the\n1990 original, isn't sure what is real and what isn't, we instead\nsimply get formulaic action mixed with a bit of romance. So, don't\nforget your barf bag if you dare see this abysmal stink-bomb. This\nmovie is an insult to everyone's intelligence.\n"
"\nBefore seeing this movie, I read many reviews. Many of them were giving\nthis film a poor rating, stating that it doesn't come close to the\noriginal, stating that it doesn't have this or that, etc. I decided to\nignore the reviews and form my own opinion of the movie - which is what\nyou should do as well...<br><br>First of all, in my opinion, this movie is not a remake - it seems more\nlike a Reboot. Same concept, some of the same characters, story line\nhas changed. Once you can accept this movie as a standalone and not\ncompare it to the original - I believe you will be very pleased.<br><br>Special effects are wonderful, Story was fast paced and exciting,\nactors are some of the best in the industry, and to me - it was a\nThrill Ride from beginning to end.<br><br>The only reason I give it an 8 instead of 10 is because I wish the\nmovie had been just a little longer for character development and so\nthat the movie didn't feel so rushed. Aside from that, I thought it was\na great movie!<br><br>Watch it and form your own opinion!\n"
"\nComparing this film to the original Total Recall would be like saying\nthe phantom menace was the best star wars movie ever. This film simply\nbored me to tears, and I like action movies. Even removing the back\nhistory of the original, I can't believe they let this one reach the\ntheaters with its thin plot line and unoriginal action sequences.<br><br>First off, the idea in this film is not to present you with any kind of\nreal story line (at least nothing original), or provide any semblance\nof a movie experience. It's just 120 minutes of Colin running away from\nthe bad guys with no break for a plot. Plot holes, while numerous, were\nfilled in with other plot holes and a good story was filled in with\niRobot meets Blade Runner graphics. <br><br>Now, sometimes a bad movie can at least save its face with some\n'appeal' with its stars, but they couldn't even give us that from Kate\nor Jessica. If you want me to pay for a 120 minute chase scene, next\ntime tell us up front and don't hide behind a legendary name.\n"
"\nTwo stunning brunettes that oozed sex appeal throughout. What more\ncould a man want in an action film. Jessica and Kate were stunning\nthroughout, with looks that made my heart skip a beat.<br><br>Not seen the original for many years, so can't comment on how it\ncompares. However, I thought the story line held together and kept you\nin suspense throughout. I'm sure there were a few inconsistencies, but\nnothing that poetic license shouldn't cover. The pace of the film was\nfantastic, with never a dull moment. Effects made the whole thing look\nreal (which it clearly wasn't). Robots looked a bit too much like Star\nWars storm-troopers crossed with those in I-Robot, which was a bit\nstrange.<br><br>But the best thing about this film: Two stunning brunettes that oozed\nsex appeal throughout. Only dilemma, which one to add to my \"friends\nlist\" (and who to bounce). I've decided to cheat and add them both\nunder one entry, as a threesome.<br><br>The story, CGI and everything else would make this an 8-9 out of 10,\nbut the ladies make this film at least a 12 out of 10!\n"
"\nI wasn't expecting much from this movie at the start. I had not watched\nthe original movie (with Arnold Schwarzenegger) so I didn't really know\nwhat the story was. I was expecting an overdose of action and a\nconfusing plot.<br><br>I was pleasantly surprised by Colin Farrel's acting. I feel he has\nreally improved as an actor and I thought the chemistry between him and\nco-stars Kate Beckinsale and Jessica Biel was great. The action\nsequences were fun to watch and exciting. Fast paced action sequences\nkept me refreshed and the stunning Kate Beckinsale, who you may know\nfrom 'Underworld' and 'Van Helsing', nailed the antagonist role.<br><br>The director, Len Wiseman, who previously surprised by making 'Live\nFree or Die Hard' a fantastic action film, has once again done his job\nwell. The storyline was clear and made sense, which was more than what\nI had expected. I admit that it could have been better, because the\nclimax was kind of dull compared to the rest of the movie, but\ndefinitely worth the watch.\n"
"\nOkay, a few years ago I rewatched the Arnold Schwarzenegger-Paul\nVerhoeven version of Total Recall and gave it 10 stars. So I just now\nwatched the Colin Farrell-Kate Beckinsale-Jessica Biel version and\nwhile I still prefer the previous version, this one wasn't so bad\neither. I mean, there are hardly any one-liners that Arnold did like\nthat \"divorce\" line he gave to Sharon Stone then but there is still\nthat dangerous edge that the original had that made this a worthy\nremake to watch. And the ending also provided a different twist than\nthat of the original so that was also a good thing for me. So to make\ncomparisons, I still prefer the Arnold version but this Total Recall\ngets a recommendation from me as well.\n"
"\nI'm a big fan of the first Total Recall and of Kate Beckinsale, so this\nremake was an astonishing disappointment. How could they have released\nthis garbage? <br><br>The original screen play was entertaining and contained several plot\ntwists and surprises. This remake changes almost everything about the\noriginal story for the worse. There is no Mars, no mutants, and almost\nno entertainment value in this new version. Practically all clever and\nmemorable scenes in the original movie were either removed or altered. <br><br>It's the details that count when making a good film. How could such a\nbig budget production go so terribly wrong? This remake was so boring\nand generic that I struggled to finish watching it. In contrast, I've\nwatched the original about 5 times and always enjoy it.<br><br>The only good thing about this film is that it can be used by film\nstudents as the epitome of how not to do a remake. This film is a\ndisaster of shocking proportions and compelled me to write my fist\nreview on IMDb.\n"
"\nIf your looking for a flick that each character has a lot of levels and\nof dynamics between each character then DO NOT watch this, go get then\ngo watch the descendants, or even a better movie, Silver Linings\nPlaybook. Honestly I can't imagine why anyone would say they expected\nmore out of this movie. It exactly what it promises.<br><br>The action is almost non-stop, the acting, well there actually actors\nin this remake, I still refuse to think of Governor Schwanegger as an\nactor. Collin Farrell definitely brings more the table. The special are\nof course light years ahead of the original. In my opinion the story\nline was quite different from the original, which I found to be a good\nthing.<br><br>If you're looking for an easy to watch movie that exciting and fun,\n(and let's be honest who doesn't like a girl on girl fight between\nJennifer Beal and Kate Beckinsale), then watch this movie, it's fun. If\nyour looking for Shakesspeare, not gonna get it.\n"
"\nWhile many don't understand is, the movie is depicting the main\ncharacter Douglas Quaid in his \"Recall\". Similar to the original title,\nthe plot and the accidents are ridiculous - similar to \"American\nPsycho\" - it is supposed to be ridiculous. It's a smart way of making\nmovies so it leads to discussion of weather the movie was \"artificial\nmemories\" from the \"Recall\".<br><br>I can't deny that most audiences had lost patience watching and\nthinking about movies these days because in fact they have been so sick\nof it...to truly understand a movie you have to stop watching them for\na while, having the desire and anticipation of what it might be like\nbefore you go ahead and enjoy them like fast food. Total Recall is\nquite entertaining, the minus 1 point is due to the lack of creative\nelement for fighting scene.\n"
"\nI have seen the original movie countless times growing up, this remake\ndoes it great justice. The cast fit well, the acting was great and the\naction and directing of this movie was brilliant! until the very end,\nof which was not the greatest 'end of movie battle'. Besides that it\nwas well constructed and if you had seen the original it definitely\nmisleads you to think you know what is going to happen, but you don't.\nIt was really well designed to correlate with the original but\nmaintaining its own story line without letting the lines get too\ncrossed. In order to replicate an old classic and maintaining a fresh\nnew story would not be easy. 10/10 from me.\n"
"\nAs most of everything else nowadays, another action movie with no\nchemistry or identity that stole a name of a great production from the\n80's in order to make money. Lots of money invested in a movie with no\ncontext. It's hilarious how there is no one out there to make great\nscripts like the old times. Is lack or talent or motivation the main\ningredients required to make movies today? What is it that avoids\nproducers, directors and actors to make great movies and consequently\ngreat money? Sincerely, this decade is far winning the golden globe of\nrubbish movies in a decade ever released.<br><br>Don't wast your time or money with that!\n"
"\nI was a little skeptical walking into this movie but I was pleasantly\nsurprised. Now for starters I loved the original, and pretty much every\nother 80s/90s \"futuristic world is now a $h!t hole and one guy is about\nto f*** people up\". Im glad to see movies going back to this format\n(Total recall, Dredd, In Time, etc.) because its on of my favorite\ngenres. <br><br>As for the movie its heavy on the chase scenes and loaded with 1 vs.\ninfinity situations that make for a fun night of action and not\nthinking too hard. It was a CGI heavy film, which isn't a bad thing but\nI feel they leaned a little too hard on it (something about the cars\nrubbed me the wrong way). The acting was good, Colin Farrell and\nJessica Biel worked well together but I felt a forced aspect to Kate\nBeckinsales role. <br><br>Don't go into this movie expecting to laugh, cry, or think. Go into\nready for action and nostalgia (yes nostalgia, watching it feels like\nthe 80s/90s with better acting and better visuals). I really did like\nthe movie and I think it didn't get enough credit for being what it is.\n"
"\nA lot of people watch this movie to see mutated human and mars, but to\nbe honest, forget about the first film, it was great but this movie did\na really good job using an old name but making a great action flick.\nThe action and acting was great (even though as a martial art\npractitioner i didn't think some of the fight scene was realistic, but\nim not expecting it to be a fighting film anyway). The highlight is\nreally the twists of the storyline, and the futuristic landscape and\ntaste - as a die hard science fiction movie fan, I was incredibly\nimpressed with that. All the acting was superb, Colin and Bryan did a\nfantastic job, as well as Kate and Jessica (they both are my favorite\nHollywood actress).<br><br>Anyway, this film is a must watch for any Sci-fi fans, and remember try\nnot to expect any old 1990 version before watching it - this film stand\nsolid on its own as a great sci-fi + action film!\n"
"\nIt is a patchwork of movies you have seen before. It has a 'Bourne'\ncharacter who's traveling in floating cars from 'The Fifth Element'\nwhile being chased by an uglier version of robots from 'I,Robot'. It's\nembarrassing - a futuristic movie where a bad guy wants to replace\noppressed workers with robots and thus emerges the resistance (oh boy,\nwhere have I seen this before?). Memory loss (or memory replacement if\nyou want), lots of gunfire, an individual evading every possible\nattempt to catch him...did I mention 'Bourne'? An inferior version\nthough. While the 'Bourne' series and the 'Terminator' had a sense of\nlarge spaces and time, 'Total Recall (2012)' was filmed almost entirely\nin buildings and tight spaces - yes, it's cheaply made.\n"
"\nI absolutely loved this film! I may not have seen the original and\ntherefore cannot compare it but it is brilliant. The characters are\nbrought to life by wonderful actors and although for some people it may\nbe difficult to follow, I caught on straight away.<br><br>I won't give away any spoilers but it truly is rather great. The ending\nis spectacular and suspense is built wonderfully. Action packed and\nsensitive also, this film I would recommend to anyone.<br><br>I went to the cinemas to see this, and as a huge Colin Farrell fan I\nfound no disappointment. Kate Beckinsale and Jessica Biel are also\nfavourite actresses of mine and bringing them all together made me most\nhappy. I loved the plot and how it is so compelling and intriguing.\nCould watch over ad over and love it every time. Never get bored. If\nfact, I have watched it a further 3 times after seeing it at cinemas\nand it still delights me the same. From me to you, this is a great\nfilm, you must see it!\n"
"\nI've read the original PKD story, and seen and liked the original\nmovie.<br><br>As a result, I decided to hate this movie as soon as the opening\nstarted talking about chemical warfare and The Fall.<br><br>However, I eventually managed to watch the whole thing.<br><br>Then watched it again, and a third time.<br><br>I succeeded by repeating to myself, \"It's only an action movie. It's\nonly an action movie.\" In that light, it's a pretty good action movie.\nThe art design is good, and the action is believable, and if you allow\nyourself, you'll be dragged along, kicking and screaming, into a pretty\ngood movie.\n"
"\nI saw and liked the original Total Recall with Arnold Schwarzenegger\nand was prepared for a knock-off. Instead I got exactly what a critic\ncalls a thrill ride from early on to finish. Even the plot changes did\nnot get in the way of enjoying better a remake and the meant to\nentertain as in old school matin√©e kind of movie only made it better.\nFine job by all concerned and please turn Len Wiseman loose on some of\nthese recent idiotic super-hero movies he knows how to entertain not\nsteal ideas and characters to blow his own horn and what he wants it to\nbe rather than what it is. Exceptional job by the studio in choosing\nand the cast and crew from top to bottom.<br><br>More please.\n"
"\nI never watched the \"original\" total recall movie, I guess this is why\nI liked that movie so much.<br><br>I'm not a fan of the action genre but in this specific movie I gotta\nsay that if you compare this one to other action films I've seen, this\nis one of the best.<br><br>First, the action scenes are Amazing! not just a bunch of shooting and\npunching, there's a lot of thought behind every action scene which I\ngreatly enjoyed.<br><br>Second, the characters are fun. By fun I don't mean realistic but they\nare not an insult to the audience either.<br><br>Third, the immersion of that flick, from the smallest thing to the\nbigger thing there's congruency.<br><br>fourth, the story! the story is actually pretty good! especially if you\ncompare it to other action flicks.<br><br>and fifth, the beauty. The movie is just beautiful and an eye candy. A\nreally nice science fiction fantasy movie.<br><br>I recommend this movie for everyone, it is a good movie. Just don't\ncompare it to the other movie by the same title and I'm pretty sure you\nwill enjoy it.\n"
"\nThe visual are out of this world. Literally. I would be surprised if\nthis movie gets snubbed on set design. Whomever was responsible\ndeserves a parade in his name. For the pure viewing of the sets, it's\ntop notch. No doubt about that. However, this movie lacks in story and\nacting. I'm still left wondering what the whole purpose was for the\ntake-over. Why wait? Also, travellingthrough the planet should take a\nlittle longer than a 20 minute ride. The original was much better in\nsoooo many ways. The main story was about Quaid not knowing if his\nworld is a dream or a reality was the whole enchilada. This new version\ncompletely missed on making that impact. That was really the key. This\n2012 version almost brushed right by that. Still...the visual are so\nawesome that I couldn't give it less than a 7.\n"
"\nNever went to see it in the cinema though I regret that now. I had\nbitter thoughts on how it would turn out considering the original was\none of the best action sci-fi films of its time. That said, give this a\nchance and I am sure you will like it. What annoys me is the harmful\ncomments left by many on their thoughts of this film, very unjust...\nyes of course we are entitled to our own opinion:) Its not just a\nremake, I believe it can be a new title in its own right. With\nfantastic special effects, great design, the future was well thought\nout, good acting(I had never rated Beckinsale that much before) not a\nbad script considering what Hollywood pumps out each year. The film\nflew by and anyone that worked on this film did a good job. Lose\nyourself for a good couple of hours, and when a part of old recall\nshows its self, it should put a smile on your face. The tear replaced\nthe sweat was even appreciated.\n"
"\nIf you appreciate a good action film with great effects... this will\nnot disappoint! maybe it is a remake and the story may be the same...\nto be expected...<br><br>Short review, but do not let any other reviews put you off watching\nthis film...<br><br>Colin Farrell is brilliant in his role and Kate Beckinsale is just as\ngood...<br><br>This movie combined a good plot with good acting and is very\nsatisfying...<br><br>Kate Beckinsale and Jessica Biel are both great in the film and provide\nall the eye candy needed...<br><br>i haven't given an in depth review of this movie because to get one you\nreally need to watch it...<br><br>All the negative reviews need to be ignored and this movie needs to be\ntaken as it is intended... not with a this has to totally blow my mind\ncompared to the first one as this will never be the case...<br><br>Long story short.... Watch this film!\n"
"\nIf like me you're just looking for entertainment in this movie then you\nwon't be disappointed. I was absorbed... the music, costumes,\ntechnology, etc. It was well done.<br><br>I forgot about everything else and became completely engrossed. For\nwhat I was looking for, i rate this movie highly.<br><br>I knew the story going in. I saw the original. Its a copy of someone\nelse's idea so its not a movie to judge on story, although the story\nitself is well done and brings \"it down to earth\" a little better than\nthe original.<br><br>Forget the critics trying to address these types of movies on some kind\nof artistic level. Irrelevant. You go to these to lose yourself in an\nimaginary world of the future, well made, with lots of good CGI.<br><br>They clearly spent some money on this and put it together well. This\nwas an enjoyable film which is why I give it 7.0. If you're a fan of\nthese types of movies go see it, you'll be entertained and will forget\nabout everything else for 135 minutes.\n"
"\nAs a remake or even as an original film this movie sucked, I was\nliterally dozing off less than an hour in during one of the many chase\nscenes. This is the summary of the movie to save you time: Chase scene,\n5 minutes of dialogue, chase scene, a little more dialogue, fight\nscene, chase scene, repeat until the end.<br><br>What a waste of 125 million. Hollywood blows money on worthless cgi\neffects and big named actors and completely forgets to hire good\nwriters and focus on a good story. Instead we get this tiring clich√© of\na movie that's plagued with overdone cgi, too many fight/chase scenes\nand absolutely no soul. This doesn't even deserve 1 star.\n"
"\nI just came back from watching this awful movie and let me just say it\nwas a total waste of time and and insult to the original. No story line\nand for god sake adding a touch of Australia when referring to\ndown-under as a colony would have been a little respectful to the\ncountry. The colony felt like hongkong ... well what can be expected\nfrom some American director who made such hideously mind numbing movie.\nAlso, I think it was made for Kate Beckinsale, by her husband, as in\nnot one scene did she look unattractive, despite of the grotesquely\nnever ending action scenes, and Jessica Biel looks not so attractive in\nmost of the scenes. Sorry for venting as this movie gave me a massive\nheadache.\n"
"\nThis movie is way better than the original Arnie version. It has some\nemotional moments which was completely lacking in the original.\nNevertheless to mention, the new Total Recall keeps viewers less\nconfused unlike the old version where the director had no idea how to\nend the movie. <br><br>I went through many reviews that say that the original Arnie version\nhas his best acting skills of all time. Forgive me, but Arnie &amp; acting?\nNay... Colin Farell is at his best in this movie. The action sequences\nare a treat for your eyes. I am so glad not to see the two faced\nmartians or any other weird characters in this new version. <br><br>This movie may not be the best but obviously an entertaining science\nfiction.\n"
"\nThis is the best sci-fi movie I have seen in decades. I was blown away\nby the visuals, new interpretation of the plot and brilliant sound\nscore. An amazing movie experience. My brain could scarcely keep up\nwith what my eyes were seeing, it was that good. The visuals were on a\nscale and level of realism that I have not seen in any other sci-fi\nmovie. The result: complete transportation into a dark and complex\nfuture. Like all great classics, the chemistry between the main\ncharacters (Colin, Jessica &amp; Kate) was palpable. I'm pleased to see\nthese three talented actors take their place in cinema history with\nthis classic film.\n"
"\nTotal Recall (2012) sets off as factory worker Douglas Quaid (Colin\nFarrell) has a vivid dream in which he and a woman are being pursued by\nsynthetic soldiers. He wakes up to remember that he doesn't live the\nthrilling life of a spy and that the woman beside him in bed is not the\none which he fantasizes spending adventures with. <br><br>Feeling as though his life is missing something, Quaid eventually\ndecides to visit Rekall, a company that can implant memories as if one\nactually experienced them. The only caveat is that customers cannot\nselect memories that overlap with their real lives. Quaid chooses the\nspy package, but things go wrong almost immediately. Throughout the\nfilm, we see Farrell disguise himself as an action phenomenon as we see\nhis journey as a wandering confused individual.\n"
"\nThough it boasts impressive special effects and decent--if increasingly\nrepetitive--action sequences, the re-make of 'Total Recall' is\nultimately undermined by a weak script and dull performances.<br><br>Colin Farrell, Kate Beckinsale, Jessica Biel, Bryan Cranston are all\nsolid actors, but their performances here lack energy and charisma.\nEven though the film was attempting to strike a more serious tone than\nthe original, it's no excuse for the nearly comatose acting on display\nhere. It doesn't help that the script fails to supply them with even a\nsemblance of humor or wit. Most egregious of all, it fails to do\nanything fresh or original with the premise.<br><br>Ironically, 'Total Recall' ends up being utterly forgettable.\n"
"\nVery heavy on the special effects, which are all very well done by the\nway, this film looks great. The narrative, although quite well known to\nme, was told in a unique enough for me to accept it as a new take on\nthe same story. The performances were all very good, particularly Colin\nFarrell and Kate Beckinsale. I just wish they had made Jessica Biel\nlook a bit more different to Kate Beckinsale; they look too similar, a\ndifferent hair colour would have helped! On the downside, I did find\nthe premise a little weak and that did kind of spoil it for me. It does\nlook very spectacular though and for those who are fans of the\noriginal; yes, there a triple breasted hooker to be found. Worth a\nlook; yes¬Ö Unless you're a die-hard Arnie fan.<br><br>SteelMonster's verdict: RECOMMENDED<br><br>My score: 6.7/10<br><br>You can find an expanded version of this review on my blog: Thoughts of\na SteelMonster.\n"

"\nI loved the original starring big Arnold but looked forward to a remake\nstarring Colin Farrell.<br><br>The action scenes are great, the sets are amazing with an extreme Blade\nRunner type vision of the future with mega buildings, rain, vehicles\neverywhere and nowhere to breathe.<br><br>Some of the gadgets are well wicked and the two leading ladies enjoy\nkicking ass.<br><br>BUT, changing the story to be earthbound was a big loss and the acting\nearly on was woeful though it did pick-up once the hero was in spy\nmode.<br><br>Worth watching but really it is a wasted opportunity as the film\ncertainly had the budget and the actors to be very special.<br><br>Bring back Arnie.\n"
"\nIn this poorly conceived dystopian future, that is trying to look like\na poorman's bastard offspring of minority report interbred with\nbladerunner, failing on both counts to improve on the originals. The\nVeneer of the film look like it was made for TV. Paying homage to the\noriginal by badly rehashing all the best scenes . I mean cummon, In a\nfuturistic world where lifts/elevators move like something out of \"the\nCube\", they still have a little hatch in the top. Poor Very poor!! Some\nmight have thought Arnie was too big a character in the original, but\nhe pulled it off a whole lot better than this and it has aged\ngracefully. It didn't need remaking, maybe the director crew and cast\nknew this deep down, and their heart just wasn't in it.\n"
"\nI did knew this movie is not the same as the original one. Though this\nmovie is similar to the original one it would been better if they just\nused some of the concept and made totally different unrecognizable\nstoryline. This movie's storyline is in between the old one and their\ninnovative ideas hence it is like a half remake. It cannot satisfy\nneither those expecting an extension or an upgrade of the old movie nor\nthe people who would take it as a whole new movie. The negative part of\nthe action sequences is it is tooooo rapid, the positive side it is\ndifferent I would say a new style. It would have been better if they\nmade a half way slow motion. The visuals are fantastic, them again this\nmovie also has a higher potential if they tried 3d. There is lot of\nflaws but it is still a good movie.\n"
"\nTotal Recall, the 2012 reboot version, is the mere shadow of the\noriginal. I must admit, I hoped much more from this film than it\nactually delivered. <br><br>First, the actors! Colin Farell and Kate Winslet are real actors, good\nones, I think, but the dubious script does nothing to give them\nsomething to work with. The dialogues are boring and most of the times\nit feels they are just there to lead from dull action scene to another. <br><br>Second, the action scenes! They quickly become boring and repetitive\nand just artificially make the movie longer, not any way better. I\nwould appreciate a good action movie, but the action in Total\nRecal:2012 is just hilarious, I must admit. <br><br>I would not recommend this movie to anyone, although if you want to\nwatch, how to make a bad movie, this one for you.\n"
"\nHave you seen it? No? There is likely a very good reason for that...it\nstinks.<br><br>Like nearly ALL the endless remakes and reboots that have been plaguing\nmovie goers for the past decade or so....all this is, is a heartless\nversion of the original.<br><br>It has no heart.<br><br>It has no soul.<br><br>It is a retelling of a film that we all love and cherish...and it adds\nnothing to the story. It improves nothing but the special\neffects--which held up very well over time--and in some cases belittles\nthe fans of the original...particularly in the fact that they remade\nthe movie at all, without adding anything clever to it.<br><br>Like so many other remakes it is a hallow shell of the original.\n"
"\nThis film is so boring that my mom left for soap opera while we were\nwatching together. She haven't watched the original Paul Verhoeven's\nfilm, but I have. And I found the plot so predictable that I could even\nwatch it with my eyes closed. That's when I learned that the mood music\nis absurd and the dialogues are idiotic. All the other aspects of the\nfilm are similarly inadequate, including acting, directing, and \"The\nFall\", which endeavours to break all laws of the physics. CGI and\nbackground settings are worth a star, but you don't surprise anyone\nwith CGI nowadays. Although I have managed to sit till the end, it\nwasn't really worth the effort. (Re)watching the original with Arnie is\na much better idea.\n"
"\nI have never seen the original, and so I did't go into this movie with\nany feelings of what it should be. And I'll admit that a lot of the\ncharacters seem a little artificial, and the development is not all\nthat great. And since I am not really a huge fan of the action genre,\nthis could have put me off. <br><br>But the pacing was perfect, and the graphics were something else\nentirely. It really is a perfect action movie. I mean, the scenes\ninvolving multi-tier cities, and falling through the earth blew my\nmind. The robots were awesome.\n"
"\nThis movie is actually not as bad as other reviewers think, and this is\ncoming from a massive fan of the original Total \"Get Your Ass To Mars\"\nRecall movie (1990) with Arnold Schwarzenegger, Sharon Stone et al. <br><br>It's got a great cast (including the multi-talented Colin Farrell and\nthe beautiful Kate Beckinsale), the action sequences are insanely well\nchoreographed and the effect top-notch... it's just that none of it is\nmemorable (ironic, given the title of the movie). <br><br>For some guaranteed, quick, si-fi entertainment though, this movie is\ntop notch. If you like Minority Report (also with Colin Farrell) and\nother similar movies, you'll enjoy this one. It's definitely WAY better\nthan Robocop and a bunch of other remakes that were made recently,\nmainly because they changed the story around instead of trying to to a\nframe per frame (but family friendly) remake of an classic.\n"
"\nUsually I hate remakes, this one managed to stay on my good side. The\nlandscape was different, but seemed more of an homage to Blade Runner\nthan anything else, so all I could do was forgive that on the grounds\nof shared appreciation.<br><br>The major difference between this and the original was the absence of\nMartian aspect of the story, but again, the movie didn't suffer too\nmuch as a result.<br><br>Even the fact that they managed to reduce the rating from 18 to 12 (PG\n13) didn't seem to make a whole heap of difference to the movie.<br><br>On the whole, this version had a much quicker pace, which I guess you\nneed if you want to sustain the attention of twelve/thirteen year olds,\nbut there were enough nods to the original to ensure grumpy old men\nlike me were reassured it knew its place in the pecking order.<br><br>In this instance, you'll be pleased to hear, I shall not be submitting\nthis review to Comic Book Guy's \"Worst Movie Ever\" blog.\n"
"\nThis film gives the same aura as \"Blade Runner\" without Harrison Ford\n(who as a young man was superb in it). It is a re-make of the original\n(1990) version of Total Recall with Arnold Schwarzenegger. I actually\nstay away from futuristic, sci-fi, and horror movies, and do not see\nthe need for re-makes of these. However, Colleen Farrell is very\ncharismatic with a wonderful screen presence. Yet, my rule is: Don't\nwatch these type movies before going to bed. So I am watching it now at\n9:30 am on a very snowy day. I don't particularly enjoy fear and the\nfeeling of helplessness! Young people who have not experienced a sense\nof wartime fear probably crave the excitement of these frightening,\nspecial-effect-loaded films, which make one wonder how anyone is still\nalive, and featuring their current idols such as teen-choice award\nwinner (2004) Colleen Farrell, but he is a very good actor and grows on\noldies too.\n"
"\nIt is seldom so that a remake is better than its original and then it\nis usually connected to film quality, low budget etc (e.g. I am not\nkeen on watching black-and-white mono-films, with some exceptions like\nChaplin or Lloyd). In this case, the use of state-of-the-art technology\ndoes not provide additional value to the storyline; well, Colin Farrell\nis definitely better than Arnold Schwarzennegger, but Kate Beckinsale\nvs Sharon Stone - I am not so sure... And casting Bill Nighy for being\nca 5 minutes on screen was a total waste of a talented actor. As\nregards Bryan Cranston, whose character Chancellor Cohaagen is supposed\nto be harsh and ruthless - he is not convincing, looks like an average\ntop politician. Sci-fi equipment and element fill more time than humans\nand the ending is also predictable.<br><br>In other words, cinemas-TV-Internet are full of similar and far better\nmovies. I would prefer Totall Recall 1990 as well.\n"
"\nI went to watch Total Recall a few months ago. I already read some\nreviews and found out that many people found the movie a bit of a let\ndown.<br><br>I went to watch it without any expectations, but also remembering the\noriginal Total Recall.<br><br>My conclusion is that Total Recall (2012) is good in its own way, as\nlong as you consider it a 'standalone' and not a direct remake, but it\ncertainly is not a masterpiece. Having said that, I think it still does\ncarry some weight making it a entertaining movie.<br><br>But like I said before, I think it is based on what you expect of it.<br><br>It makes it difficult to give this movie a score, but I would say 6.5\nto 7 out of 10.\n"
"\nI was always very dubious when i hear they were doing a remake as they\nare rarely as good as the original. Sadly, this is one case in point!<br><br>However, do not let that put you off the film... Had the 1990 version\nnever been released - I would be marking this film as a 7 or 8...<br><br>Its an all out action blockbuster - Dark and foreboding and based\nalmost entirely on the original novel (Which like \"The Running Man\" the\noriginal could not do...)<br><br>Sadly, there was one thing that Arnie did bring to the original that\nlacks throughout - Humour! Its what made the original a classic.<br><br>Overall, Farell is brilliant once more as is Beckinsdale (Also very\nsexy).<br><br>Not a patch on the original but a great film if you have not seen the\n1990 version and worth a watch.\n"
"\nThe previews didn't impress me at all, so I avoided this in the\ntheaters. On a recent cross country flight, this movie was available as\na choice, so what the hell! The first thing you immediately notice is\nthat Colin Farrell is hardly a half an Arnold. The first movie had an\nawesome Mars setting, interesting characters, and was a lot of fun.This\nmovie has none of that. The first movie had actual villains to root\nagainst. This movie has you looking at your watch. Watered down is an\nunderstatement when comparing movies. Had I not seen the way more\nmemorable 1990 movie, I may have rated this slightly higher. Maybe.\nThis version is 100% forgettable. Watch the original, or anything else,\ninstead of this dud.\n"
"\nMaybe the studio thought by just having good looking actors in this\nmovie they hoped to make money. It was hard to follow and moved way too\nfast . It had too much CG!! I like the action but the gun play is much\ntoo unrealistic and maybe there should have been much less of it. The\nmovie industry uses guns like they are making a cartoon and that is not\nthe way the real world works. They needed to get there act together on\nhaving too much gun play as that is Not as the world is and is less\nlikely in the future. I did like the robots but the character\ndevelopment was much too poor. I did like the way that the cars were\nrealistic as the future will have these type of cars. I did not see\nthis movie at the theater and am glad I just bought the DVD instead. It\nwas less entertaining than the earlier version of Total Recall.\n"
"\nThey didn't even go to Mars. The beginning of the movie led you to\nbelieve they would be going into space or to Mars, but they never did.\nFor those of you looking for a good Space Sci-Fi, don't watch this\nmovie.<br><br>There was a lot of action to the movie, some good scenes and graphics,\nand a lot of it seemed to coincide with the original movie, but seemed\ndull and lacking.<br><br>Their twist on the story may have been OK, had I not enjoyed the\noriginal so much. Where were the mutants and where was the Martian\nTerra-forming? Instead they just thew a bunch of robots in and said,\nenjoy! Well, no thanks, if I wanted to see a movie about robots, I\nwould watch I-Robot or Terminator.\n"
"\ni never saw the original total recall i had heard it was a good movie\nand when i see the trailer for the new one it looked good the story is\nbasically a guy who goes to recall and something goes wrong and we find\nout hes a spy this part of the movie is fine the rest is just a cgi\nparty and it seems like the whole movie is two people being chased\noverall its an okay movie with some nice action but i was hoping for\nmore from this film. oh and if you are going to see this film and you\nhave seen the original it is not the same there is no mars just the\nunited federation of Britain and Australia. and the other thing that is\nworth a mention Kate Beckinsale performance is one of the highlights of\nthe movie.\n"
"\nThis has some great futuristic effects, stunning scenes, great action,\n3-titted women and kate beckinsale being hot for a gal pushing 40. <br><br>I was mostly entertained for two hours, but it didn't have the story\nthe original one had, no mutants, no mars, no aliens, the whole air\nsupply subplot had been cut and replaced with..well...some kind of\ncolony...er..and something, something...well to be honest something I\ndon't care about.<br><br>All the action was centred around 3 people and there was plenty of it\nbut in the end what it amounts to is yet another film with great\npotential ruined by mundane good vs bad fighting sequences and a non\nexistent back-story. 6/10\n"
"\nRecalling is long overrated and in Quaid's position, incredibly\ndangerous. The remake of a sci-fi classic is turned upside down,\nliterally. <br><br>\"Total Recall\" has at first sight a beautiful chaotic look that\nresembles a cross between \"Blade Runner\" and \"I Robot\" with an amazing\namount of action for the audience's patience and delight. If one thing,\nit is definitely not boring. There is no time for questioning the\ndirection of the story, even though it has a completely different take\non the original. <br><br>I still love the 90's version by the great Paul Verhoeven, staring\nSchwarzenegger when he was still at the height of his stardom, but\nColin Farrel is not so bad as a hero trying to save the world or at\nleast what is left of it. Great entertainment.\n"
"\nAbsolutely terrible. No story, nothing but mere effects. Has nothing to\ndo with the original movie by Shwartz! Taking out few effects from the\noriginal doesn't make this weckkk any worth!!!! What the...\nWorthlessssss. I don't know English enough to fill the required 10\nlines with swear. Sorry guys. I spent money for this s..t. For nothing.\nSo bad. So ugly. How dare Hollywood actors subscribe to shooting such a\nrare piece of s..t. My wife almost fall asleep at the movie theater.\nWhy do I have to take this? I want my money back! We paid 20 bucks for\nthis throwing-out experience. Thanks for nothing, the producers, the\ndirector, the actors. Oh! So awful!\n"
"\nOkay, so you have this brilliant action movie from 1990 with a massive\nkill count, a charismatic larger than life hero, a sexy deceitful\nvillainess, TWO larger than life bad guys who chew up the scenery with\ngusto, mutants and eye poppingly (literally) entertaining special\neffects.<br><br>How can you go wrong re-making this movie? Well, you basically throw\nout all the wacky colourful aspects that made the original so\nendearing.<br><br>The characters are bland. All the good guys are so annoyingly\nwholesome. If the censors had been let loose on Arnie's original then\nyou'd probably have ended up with the 2012 version. They even have\nrobots for henchmen so those of a sensitive deposition wouldn't feel so\nbad when they get shot! I loath this safe, respectable remake. Who\nknows what Len Wiseman was thinking... Nowhere near as entertaining as\nthe Underworld movies. I think he's taken the money and run folks.\n"
"\nAll by itself this wasn't a bad movie. Decent story, acting was OK,\ndirecting was kind of poor slow and uninspired. The changes in story\nwould have been fine but not as motivating as the old version <br><br>Compared to the original Total recall and this movie pales in\ncomparison. The original was fast moving, inspired, fun, funny, full of\ngreat one liners and strong well developed characters and exceptional\nacting. Lori is evil and sexy. Melina is amazing deep and so sweet.\nQuaid is confused angry and believable. Cohagen is nasty and ruthless.\nThe goal of the first movie was so much better and acting was 10 times\nbetter than this 2012.<br><br>I watched the new one and immediately after the old. The old was so\nmuch more fun and entertaining. How could you lameify a story so much\nafter having such a superb example to build on.<br><br>Total Recall 2012 is regrettable forgettable. BLAH\n"
"\nThe director seems to have forgotten what made the original an original\n-- a smarmy blend of sci-fi, character development, humor and an\ninteresting plot. This new Total Recall has a wooden (at best) Colin\nFarrell with the wasted talents of Ms. Beals and Beckinsale. The movie\nhad great special effects, but contextually were uninteresting. And\nyes, this movie totally tried to rip-off Blade Runner's visuals, but\nwithout any of the intensity and true creepiness. I was bored most of\nthe time. The plot was 1000% predictable and knowing the 1990 original\njust made each moment worse. Why do directors fall in love with special\neffect antics? This same disease doomed Star Wars I and II ... is CGI\nthat much cheaper than good acting? Avoid.\n"
"\nIt would be better if they would call it with different name. It has\nalmost no link with previous version. Only few points are from older\nmovie with Arnie. Maybe they wanted to create a completely new plot and\nworld around it but it failed. <br><br>Prime minister or resistance leader are just few seconds figures,\nsaying almost nothing. Great potential from the robots is not used,\neven when it seems there is some special robots (the black one) as a\nbodyguard (??).<br><br>The only thing which is good in this movie are special effects, those\nare good and I like them. OK, two, Kate and Jessice and beauties but\nthat will not safe the movie. This movie is not worth to watch it. not\nsure if it is a mistake of director or writer. Wondering who can\napprove such a crap from the studio?\n"
"\nThe more a movie is predictive, the less it is entertaining. Total\nRecall is not the predictive type of movie but come on, 85% of the\nmovie is about the good guys running away from the bad guys (nice\naction, great effects though). But then I got tired of the running away\nand for one moment I almost quit watching the movie - thing I would not\nusually do for such high budget movies.<br><br>I liked the concept of Total Recall; it was engaging during the movie,\nand left me thinking even afterwards. <br><br>However the bottom line is that Total Movie is about an interesting\nphilosophical concept that was unfortunately squeezed into a plot where\nHollywood action and expensive cgi are central. Something like an\nExpendable's version of Inception.\n"
"\nIf you want to see a fun movie, watch the original with Schwarzenegger.\nThe 2012 version is just so full of plot holes, it is disappointing.\nAlso there are so many situations which are just plain unrealistic.\nImagine you have 10-20 guys all pointing their weapons directly at you.\nYou are unarmed. And you get out of there and kill them all? And after\nthat, several times you are surrounded by even more enemies with\nweapons who have free space to shoot directly at you and you always\nescape. No way!<br><br>By the way, someone commented, the only reference to the 1990 movie was\nthe three breasted woman. Thats not true. After that, where Hauser gets\npast security check, you first see an older fat woman, which is very\nsimilar to the costume/mask Hauser uses in the 1990 movie to get past\ncheck point.\n"
"\nA total waste of money compared to the original with Arnie. The red\nherrings -the original 'two weeks' exploding head decoy and the one and\nonly mutant girl three boobs who looked completely out of place - were\njust cameos copied from the original in an attempt to placate those of\nus who loved that version. It didn't. There was no Mars, no mutants,\njust blank expressions, car chases and fights in a wet, cluttered set.\nThe chosen story line was very confusing and unclear and I was\ncontinually waiting for something interesting to happen. At least the\noriginal version was filmed in good lighting, clear to watch with a\nreal futuristic, extra-planetary sci-fi tone to it. This remade rubbish\nlooked like 'storm trooper meets blade runner' but with even more rain.\nIf you must do remakes instead of using imagination to create something\nnew, then at least do a good job of it. This version grossed millions\nat box office but I bet few will want to see it twice. The original is\nstill fun to watch a dozen times over - the remake won't be. Very\ndisappointed.\n"
"\nThis is a great movie! I personally have not seen the original Total\nRecall Movie, thus have nothing to compare it to. Even so, it should be\nseen as a separate movie. I thought this movie has amazing graphics\nthat literally blew my mind. There was a very original story line and\ndepth to the characters. Though one of the characters was quite\nannoying, I felt the movie still deserved a ten. A must see in my book.\nLike I said, I don't understand how someone could give this movie such\na low rating! If you like Sci-Fi or apocalyptic genres, then make sure\nyou watch! Also, as a video game lover, I felt as though it had a very\nvideo game feel to it, which made it all the more enjoyable.\n"
"\nTotal Recall was an incredibly good movie when it hit the theaters.\nArnold made it simply awesome, one of his best movies. The hard life on\nthe Mars colony is colorful and imaginative, it brought something very\noriginal to the SciFi scene.<br><br>This remake doesn't bring anything new. Absolutely nothing. Its boring.\nPlain boring. Visual effects are off the shelf, already seen a thousand\ntimes. Characters are unimaginative and uninteresting. The story is\nweak.<br><br>In my opinion this movie is an offense to the original. Its like a bad\nparody without any purpose.\n"
"\nFirst of all I have to give Kate Beckinsale kudos for being a really\ngreat villain. She meets and exceeds Sharon Stone's bad wife. She is\njust relentless and so sharply homicidal you cannot fault her character\nfor not trying (to kill her husband). The same cannot be said for Colin\nFarrell. His performance seems lethargic at best, liked someone dosed\nhis script with quaaludes. One of the things I like about the original\nwas the humor. They really played the first one as a colorful circus\nand it was entertaining. Except for one shining moment this film has\nalmost no humor. I know that it more exactly matches the P.K. Dick\nstory but common, give us some one liners! One thing that I will not\nfault is the special effects. They are excellent from beginning to end.\nIf I only went to see special effects I would give this movie a 10. I\nwas a little disappointed and I think they could have done a lot more.\n"
"\nI don't think the director could have packed anymore running, fighting,\nand explosions in this remake. It's less relevant what the backdrop of\nthe story is, be it on Mars on Earth, the result is the same -\nmeaningless action and more action for the shake of action.<br><br>In the creative field, it's known that if you copy someone's idea,\nyou'd do it better. The movie studio may think we are outdoing the\noriginal Total Recall with this rehash combined with borrowed parts\nfrom other successful sci-fi flicks -- it's a disappointment, guys.\nIt's a typical case of Hollywood studios with extra cash and technology\nknowhow without a good story to tell.\n"
"\n...missing the one-liners though. I just hate how many people write a\nreview by explaining what the movie is about. I know what the bloody\nmovie is about. Everybody knows what the movie is about. So please stop\nwriting a plot summary. If you don't know this is another movie based a\nshort story by some dude, and the second one made having Arnold in the\noriginal then you need to talk to people more often. And don't tell you\nare writing a nutshell review that seems an essay for a college degree.<br><br>I liked this movie.<br><br>Good action. Decent acting. Great FX.<br><br>Keep the same story as the 1990 version with some differences, that I\nwon't point out because everybody here already single them out.<br><br>In my opinion the only missing thing is the one-liners that made the\n'90 version very funny. Colin was too serious and there was no sarcasm\nat all.<br><br>\"See you at the party Richter\" \"Consider this a divorce\" \"Get to the\nchopper\"....oh wait that's from Predator.<br><br>Anyhow, I liked this movie, but I love Kate B.\n"
"\nThe original Total Recall is one of my favorite movies. That's why I\ngive this movie a straight 1 out of 10. Why so harsh? Well, the movie\nhas a lot of great effects and action scenes + beautiful and capable\nactors and a great story. That's why I think it could have been so much\nmore... The whole time I thought I'm watching a bad copy of \"I Robot\"\nwith Colin Farrel, replacing Will Smith - some of the main elements\nlike cars and robots looked too much alike. I think the creators of\nthis movie could have made so much more out of this movie, but instead\nthe only thing they made better was the 3 boobs. Sorry, but that was\nthe greatest disappointment of the year for me.\n"
"\nFirst thing, if you think because you already seen the first one, you\nknow what is in this one, you're wrong. This time, you're really on a\nsuspense, the question, what is real ? Anytime, the dream can start or\nthe dream can end. There is a lot of action, good acting and the\nspecial effect are just incredible.<br><br>I was expecting something like : explosion - kiss - end. This movie was\nsurprising, I never though it would be so good. Colin Farrell is\nperfect for this new role that they build based on the first one. Kate\nBeckinsale is just soooooo badass and Jessica Biel give us a lot more\nthan what we were expecting from his character.<br><br>This isn't a basic storyline, they're running for something bigger than\ntheir lives, they're running about the truth. Very entertaining, for\nme, this movie is just so good.<br><br>If you liked the first one or you hated it, whatever, this movie is\nsomething else that everybody should see !<br><br>Have open-mind to something else than what Arnold give us, and you'll\nbe surprised of how good this movie is.\n"
"\nHow can they waste all that money on something this bad? Grey and brown\nsets with a Blade Runner complex. No story, just a lot of running\naround. And then more running around. The former wife just shows up\neverywhere. Yes I know that logic don't apply on this kind of films,\nbut some realism is to be expected, otherwise it becomes silly. And the\nacting; well, it's all right but without any memorably appearances. The\n\"original\" with Arnie and Stone are way better. More good looking, more\ninteresting, better directed, and with some humor and human touch\ninvolved. Avoid this and see the first one instead. You'll be glad you\ndid.\n"
"\nNo original thinking what so ever from Len Wiseman, he was a dog to the\nstudio bosses an done what he was told.<br><br>He completely ripped off Minority Report, Blade Runner and Inception\nany decent film fan will notice this. Jessica Biel didn't even need to\nbe in this film she has a handful of lines an the acting was just\nawful.<br><br>Was very let down to say the least. Keep your money an just buy the\noriginal.<br><br>The old saying hold through on this one \" If it ain't broke don't fix\nit \" There was no need to reboot this at all, but if it makes Hollywood\nmoney the reboots are just gonna keep on coming.\n"
"\nI HATED it for the simple reason I have a brain that allows for\nreasoning- oh! And I am older than five years of age. I need to have\nSOME semblance of reality even when the genre is sci-fi or fantasy or\neven animation. This piece of excrement was so full of plot holes and\nimplausibilities even the horribly staged/shot action sequences\ncouldn't mask the obvious failings of the Director and screenwriter. I\ncan't count the number of times I shouted in my head, \"just shoot him.\nWhy can't they shoot him\". After Bryan Cranston's failed attempt at\nrecovering the REAL Quaid, he sends the sour faced Kate B after him. At\na time when Quaid ( Farrel) was SURROUNDED by gun toting minions! Just\ntalk into your mic there and say, \"Kill him\". <br><br>There were so many of these moments I'm getting angry again just\nREKALLING them.\n"
"\nMind blowing Sci-Fi directed by Len Wiseman. This is by no means a\nremake of the Schwarzenegger TOTAL RECALL; when life gets mundane and\nboring...take the ultimate trip. Factory worker Douglas Quaid (Colin\nFarrell) stops by a place called Rekall, to be implanted with fake\nmemories to regenerate his life a little. Things go horribly wrong and\nafter the mind-bending procedure, Quaid is trapped in a \"cat chasing\nthe mouse\", spy versus spy roller coaster ride/chase. Violent and\nbrutal situations with implausible escapes. <br><br>Top dollar special effects that don't take away from the great acting\nof Farrell, and co-stars Kate Beckinsale and Jessica Biel. Ruthless and\nblood-thirsty action-packed thrills. Also in the cast: Bokeem Woodbine,\nBryan Cranston, Bill Nighy, Will Yun Lee, Dylan Smith and James\nMcGowen.\n"
"\nWell....will all the crybabies please go home! So many ridiculous rants\nabout this movie being different than the original. Shut the H**l up.\nIt's a new film for a new audience. I never saw the original and I\nreally enjoyed this movie. Great action, lots of sci-fi built in, and\nenough intrigue to make you want to rewind and look at it again. The\nleads are awesome and do a great job. Good Blade Runner vibe. I saw it\ntwice about a year apart and I'm ready to see it again - and I consider\nmyself picky about movies. Again - don't let the naysayers with all the\nexaggeration fool you (worst movie ever!!!), I think you'll enjoy this\nif you like the trailer.\n"
"\nThe original Total Recall was grounded in the premise that traveling to\nother planets through your mind was more interesting, cheaper, safer,\netc...<br><br>Well, this sorry remake trashes the original premise almost completely.\nThe action is sorely limited to a souped up, over populated Earth,\nrather than Mars. The landscape of Mars is what contributed to the\nsuccess of the original, but removing it in this outing also removes\nany chance of the film being entertaining,,,this one comes across as\nmore of an attempt at bringing a video game to life, nothing more...<br><br>This is, without a doubt, the very worst remake I have ever seen...even\nworse than Starship Troopers, which I absolutely hated...\n"
"\nPathetic attempt at pulling this movie off and getting away with it. Im\namazed the actors signed up for this movie as there are some well known\nfaces? A lot of scenes are total rip off's of the original movie and so\nblatantly so and not executed correctly which made it smell of pure\ncheese and my mind was made up very quickly that it was a cheap Re-Hash\nwhich was destined to fail because it was a copy cat of the original\nwhich everyone will obviously compare it too. It's certain death to do\na low quality budget film and expect to get the peoples opinions on\nyour side?? Makes me wonder if the Director of the film even cares\nabout the reviews and is just after a quick buck? Bring back quality\nmovies again and lets stop the misery!!\n"
"\nThis movie couldn't possibly be better than the original total recall.\nSeriously. Does everything has to have a sequel? This 2012 version\ndidn't live up to its hype but I am not surprised as most sequels or\nreboots are sub par to their original counterparts. There are\nexceptions like Terminator 1 and 2. Back to Total Recall 2012. The\nmovie was boring. Theatre was half empty. Nothing else to say about it.\nNot memorable like the first one with Arnold. The CGI nowadays is the\nmain focus rather than plot and originality, unfortunately. Not sure\nwhat else to say. It didn't live up to expectations. They should at\nleast renamed it differently.\n"
"\nI really disliked the movie. Current state of movie making is to\nportray women as SUPER humans. More intelligent, faster, stronger, more\nrelevant than anyone. Reliant on no one and egotistical to the\ndetriment of all else. The movie suffers for it.<br><br>Colin Farrell (Ireland), seems like a deer in the headlights most of\nthe time and of course the ladies took turns either saving or trying to\nkill him. Kate Beckinsale or Jessica Biel looked pretty much the same\nperson in physical size, weight, looks etc etc. Ugh.<br><br>No charm at all and just hated most all of the casting and whom ever\nwas in charge of the film continuously...the between cuts needs help as\na damage arm in one cut, is the other arm in the next cut..oh brother.<br><br>I love the 1990 Total Recall with Shwarzenegger and Sharon Stone but\nthe supporting cast were also top notch. This a 'B' movie at best.<br><br>Just another vehicle to separate your money and put it in their\npockets.\n"
"\nI remember and like the classic film with Arnold, so I was a bit\nskeptical about a remake of this and would if live up to the memory of\nthe classic ..... it does not.<br><br>If you have not seen the old one, this is a very descent movie, lots of\naction, suspense and twists in the story and what is to be believed for\nthe main character Douglas Quaid and for the audience. I have however\nseen the old movie or classic, so this is kind of a new way of telling\nthe story, with some modifications, some great new things, something\nhas been kept, but unfortunately also some things are not what they\nused to be (according to my memory).<br><br>I did like this film, it has all what a modern day total recall should\nhave, great effects, great scenery, great action and great characters\nand actors. It did also keep most of what made the classic fresh and\ninteresting at that time and there are few dull moments so the action\nand pace is great.\n"
"\nBefore watching this I had not seen the original so I can not compare.\nHowever this movie as a standalone film was a good watch. Colin Farrell\nperformed very well and so did a few others, however that can not be\nsaid for all. The story was interesting and seemed easy to read from\nthe start but I soon began to doubt my own predictions for the plot.\nOne thing that I did not like about this film is it seemed to borrow\nscenes and ideas from other films which really were too obvious and\nunoriginal. This film did have good cgi and action and brought in some\ninteresting views of the future. I would say this is a good standalone\naction film which is a good watch if you want to see a bit of\nfuturistic action.\n"
"\nOnly habitable environments left to mankind being the British isles,\nspace stations, space craft, and some place referred to as the colony.\nWho to blame for such a unbelievably stupid plot, I guess the Producer,\nDirectors, Screen Writers, and the Science consultants they consulted\nwith. The United Kingdom would have been every bit as contaminated by\nthe chemical warfare as every place else. As always those imbeciles\nthat were responsible for the average rate being somewhere between 6\nand 7 have no knowledge of what true cinematographic art is and only\nbestowed such a high rating to the movie because of the Special\nEffects, same type of people that stupidly made J.J. Abrams version of\nStar Trek so popular.\n"
"\n(49%) A largely strait-forward remake of a sci-fi 80's classic that\nswaps the hard-edged dark comicbook sense of humour and violence for\naction, action, and more action. This really isn't a bad film, and\ndespise featuring a tunnel that goes all the way through the planet,\nit's just so very ordinary and forgettable. Colin Farrell is better\nthan most could have been, but unlike his stuntman he's given very\nlittle to work with here. His support is fine even if they're given\neven less to do than even Mr Farrell. As a remake this fails to better\nthe Arnie hit, but as a decent little time-passer that for the most\npart will mildly entertain throughout, and for that reason alone this\ngets a half decent recommendation from me.\n"
"\nIf you haven't seen the original, don't watch this one. If you have\nseen the original, don't watch this one. If you haven't seen any sci-fi\nmovie before, watch \"Blade Runner\" or the original \"Total Recall\". This\nversion has some pretty nice action scenes, some famous actors and\ncopies all the nice ideas from the original only to change the\nfunniest, smartest scenes from the original. I'd give it to the\ncreator, that it is not very easy to copy a classic like the original\none, and I even get the idea of trying to copy it, because it has been\na while since the original has been aired and so younger audience might\nnot know the title, but I'd prefer it, if this attempt was anything but\nboring, monotone and very slow in the way the story evolves. Assuming\nthat the production cost are about 125 $ I must admit, I think I know\nabout 125 things, how to invest this money otherwise.\n"
"\nHow very sad. Good cast, good effects, lousy execution.<br><br>Philip K. Dick's short story, \"We Can Remember It for You Wholesale\" is\na masterpiece of storytelling. 1990's \"Total Recall\" is a shadow of the\nshort story. This film is the shadow of a shadow.<br><br>While there are several nods to, and in-jokes about, the 1990 film, by\nand large this is simply a rehash of that film with little to impress.<br><br>It did not hold this viewer's attention despite (or perhaps because of)\nan overabundance of chases, fights, and slam-bang action scenes. There\nis little exposition and virtually no opportunities to become attached\nto the protagonist. Indeed, it was as if director Len Wiseman took all\nhis film cues from Transformers director Michael Bay and did so rather\npoorly.<br><br>Watch it if you must, but don't expect much and you won't be\ndisappointed.\n"
"\nThe only reason why I give it two stars and not one is because Jessica\nBiel has a sweet body and looks good. There really is not more to say\nabout this movie. I'm just glad I saw it today on free TV and have\nsaved myself the money to watch it at the theatre 2 years ago. Jessica\nBiel has a sweet body and looks good.

"\nSave yourself the trouble and just watch the original again, terrible\nremake that didn't capture its predecessors intentions at all.<br><br>Only worth watching the first 10 minutes to see Kates booty in some\nundies.<br><br>I'm not sure why they would remake this movie with so little effort,\nwhy would they leave out the comedic value that the original had as\nwell?<br><br>I really wanted to enjoy this and went into it with an open mind, the\nacting in the original was so much more engaging and enjoyable. <br><br>Doesn't even pull a giant tracker ball out of his nose :(\n"
"\nThis film was nothing like the original. Arnold was the dominant spy in\nthe original movie. He was nearly unstoppable in the entire movie. The\nnew version, the guy that plays Arnolds role was just a normal spy and\ndidn't stand above the rest of the people in the movie. He took a\nbeating from his wife and an old man at the end.<br><br>Arnold was destroying people left and right in the original. The role\nof the new guy was just a normal guy in a sci-fi where expected him to\nbe destroying everyone in his way. Not a bad movie overall but to call\nthis a remake is ridiculous and I was disappointed every time I saw\nthis guy get into a fight with the exception of 1 scene. The rest of\nthe time he was running from a woman that kept beating him up and end\nby him barely getting the upper hand on an old man that killed.<br><br>Very sad remake...\n"
"\nAs far as remakes of great movies go, it could be worse. It doesn't\nmatch the style and creativity of the original film from Paul\nVerhoeven. This remake is made by Len Wiseman, the guy behind the\nUnderworld movies and Live Free or Die Hard. Wiseman is not a director\nI have a great deal of respect for. He believes in throwing as much CGI\nas possible at the screen, with little concern for things like\ncharacter and story. I'm also not a fan of his visual style, which\nusually means everything that isn't black is saturated in blue. Some of\nthis is because of his CGI obsession. So I have my issues with Len\nWiseman. That being said, I have enjoyed some of his movies and I did\nenjoy this one. While there isn't much about this version that's\nparticularly memorable, it is a perfectly watchable sci-fi action\nthriller. The acting, writing, directing, and special effects are all\nadequate. Kate Beckinsale is the best part. This doesn't compare to the\noriginal movie, which was a fun, thrilling, and sometimes wonderfully\ncheesy masterpiece. But you won't hate it like many crappy remakes.\n"
"\nThey are only a few remakes that a better than the original (Ocean's\n11,scarface,the departed,true grit)and of course this movie is NOT one\nof them.<br><br>The 1990 Paul Verhoeven movie is a sci-fi classic and one of the best\nmovies of the 90's.Even Arnold has says that the movie is one his\nfavorites of his filmography.Of course the movie was a huge hit (was\nthe # 2 box office champ of 1990 behind Ghost).<br><br>Now someone expected the same thing this time isn't? WRONG.<br><br>First Farell is not ARNOLD,Second Director Len Wiseman is NOT Paul\nVerhoeven,Third the script is NOT the same,Fourth composer Harry\nGregson Williams is NOT Jerry Goldsmith and final even that the SF are\nmore advanced now are NOT even equal.<br><br>Believe me stay with the original is 100% BETTER all the elements of\nthe 1990 movie are gone they are a lot of better movies like this.\n"
"\nAs a stand alone movie. This one is alright. But as a remake? Horrible.\nIn my personal opinion, they strayed way too far from the original for\nthis to qualify as an actual remake. I mean, they don't even go to Mars\nin this one and virtually the whole story took place on Mars in the\noriginal. The character \"Richter\" from the original version has been\ndiscarded all together. Quaid's \"wife\" Lori seems to assume that part.\nShe is a secret government agent like in the original version but here\nshe actually takes charge of chasing Quaid down and trying to kill him.<br><br>If you've never seen the original version then this one is alright. I\nthink it could've been better but it's not too bad. If, like me, you\ngrew up with the original Schwarzenegger classic, prepare to be\nseverely disappointed.\n"
"\nNo soul, no real interesting characters. A joke to earn money from the\npublic with low standards.<br><br>Some flirting but nothing even sexual, except mutant boobs, which are\nnot cool.<br><br>95% of this movie is filler and the acting is trash. Whoever thought\nColin Farrel was a leading man should be punished (he's a boy with\ngelled hair, more like) The coolest thing about the movie was the fact\nthat they explain \"why would the Leader attack his own installations?\"\n\"because then he can justify tripling robot production\".<br><br>Just like the US government, whenever it fails to protect people- they\nget to triple their budgets, just like on 9-11 and Oklahoma City (and\nno one gets fired). And then, the government gets to invade whoever\nthey want so the bankers and military corporations get record profits!\n"
"\nI'm not going to compare it to the original Total Recall, reviewing it\non its own merits.<br><br>It's an interesting, entertaining movie that tries to pass a social\nmessage but so weakly you'll forget about it after they shove it in\nyour face in the first moments of the movie.<br><br>Then it becomes an adrenaline race and chase with good visuals but not\nmuch more. The ending battle was actually interesting.<br><br>The plot is kind of a mess but besides having its moments.<br><br>Basically a good popcorn movie to spend a Saturday evening if you have\nalready emptied your list of must watch movies.\n"
"\nI decided to watch this because I recently saw the original on\ntelevision just awhile back, so it was fresh in my memory...no pun\nintended. This was a solid action film with scifi elements, but I\nreally don't understand why they bothered with the thin layering of\n\"Total Recall\" over what could otherwise have been a new setting. There\nwas really no need to slap the label on this except for extra press,\nbut I can guarantee the same people would have gone to see it had it\nbeen called \"Fallen Star\" or something equally different. As a scifi\nmovie it had all the bells and whistles, but I'm getting tired of scifi\nthat doesn't reach very far, doesn't try to posit the idea of a world\nbeyond our own. Earthbound dystopias are the product of writers who\ncan't fathom that things in the future won't just be the way they are\nnow only flashier.\",\n"
"\nI really don't remember anything about Arnold's Total Recall because it\nhas been such a long time since I've seen it, so for me, this was\nbasically a new movie. And I thought it was OK for a popcorn action\nflick. The special effects were good, with the flying cars, the\nbuildings in the air. So, most of earth's land has been destroyed and\nthere are 2 sections left, Federation of Britain and the Colony. The\nFederation wants to overtake the smaller Colony and move some of its\npeople there. Colin Ferrell plays, Doug, a worker from the Colony, but\nlater we learn he used to work for the federation and all his memories\nare lies. That's when the chase starts and he is \"hunted\" by his not\nreally wife, Lori, and gets into all these fights. He finds Melina whom\nhe sort of remembers and it's up to them to save the Colony.<br><br>FINAL VERDICT: It's watchable, good special effects, I think 20\nsomethings will like it.\n"
"\nIf you went in to see this movie expecting a remake of The Arnlod movie\nthen you will be disappointed. However if you wanted to watch an\nawesome sci-fi movie with a believable story line , then you are\nwatching a good movie. The movie has been panned by critics who have\npreconceived notions based on the original movie. The CGI is topclass\nand the story is more believable than the Aliens on Mars storyline in\nthe original movie. This movie charts its own path and , I'd give it a\n10 if the story action didn't include so many lives for Farrell.\nCohagen must've have at least 15 chances to get rid of Farrell but he\nsomehow waste's them all only to give Farrell one chance which he\ntakes.\n"
"\nAlthough it has a different setting as the 1990 original, i enjoyed\nthis remake quite a bit. Knowing the story, i was curious how they'd\ntwist the story. There are several winks to the original, which i\nenjoyed, yet it still is a film on its own. If you're hoping to see a\nrehash, you may be disappointed. <br><br>As for the actors, most of them did OK. I sure like a furious\nBeckinsale, even Farrell did convince me he'd been the\nbad-guy-turned-good. Cranston was playing his 'Mr White' routine, Biel\ndidn't do it for me however in this one..<br><br>The cgi was OK, a bit over the top at some times, but hey, that's what\nHollywood blockbusters are about: blingbling over story.<br><br>All in all, if you're looking for an action packed scifi action movie,\nthis one should be good enough for an evening with a cool beer and some\ncrisps/popcorn.\n"
"\nTotal Recall - CATCH IT (B)<br><br>Total Recall is a remake of popular Arnold's movie which to be honest I\ndidn't get it when they use to show it on Star movies. So finally we\nget the remake where Colin Farrell is fighting for poor in this post\napocalyptic world. <br><br>Total Recall has tones of action, sci-fi CGI effect and fast paced\nstory but the thing it lacked the most was Characterization. I didn't\nfeel any sort of remorse that this guy doesn't know who he is or that\nthese two young girls are fighting etc. Colin Farrel, Jessica Beil,\nKate Beckinsale did a good job as they are good in action and it wasn't\nsomething they haven't done before.<br><br>In the end, it's enjoyable till the 3rd act, after that it's tedious\nbut overall good time passes.\n"
"\nSo I was told that there were some minor changes in the new Total\nRecall and not to compare it to the original. So after watching I have\nto say that there were massive and pointless changes, that left gaping\nplot holes that I personally felt spoilt the story. Yes the special\neffects were fantastic and the action was good, but this didn't make up\nfor the changes to the story.<br><br>I am however happy to hear that the team behind the new Total Recall\nare now working on two new projects. The first is a remake of Harry\nPotter, with a few minor changes such as no Hogwarts, no Wizards and\nVoldermort is good and has a nose. The second project is a feature\nlength Knight Rider movie. The only adjustment to this version will be\nthat instead of a super high tech car, KITT will now be a horse.\n"
"\nI seriously think that a remake should be more well-made. Everything\nwas so clich√©d and intentionally followed a pilot (to keep the\ncharacters busy throughout the movie.) Things just followed to each\nother so well that it was hard to take the movie seriously. I thought\nthe movie would have a deeper story line, considering that it is a\nremake; but no, the whole movie was about chasing and adrenaline.In\naddition, unrealistic moments regularly appeared each 10 minutes or so,\nmaking the movie worse. Effects and fight scenes were not that good,\nonly enough to satisfy easy audience. I don't even know if this movie\neven deserves a 5, at least some actions were cool, unoriginal(i guess)\nand unpredictable (because of its unrealistic and forced pilot)\n"
"\nLet's be honest here, people totally recall (har har) the Paul\nVerhoeven original mostly for how unfeasibly hot a young Sharon Stone\nlooked in it. This remake is destined to a similar scenario, as Kate\nBeckinsale's sexy, feral action villainess is the only thing likely to\nbe remembered - Jessica Biel, quite a looker herself, has a blander\nrole and is often pushed into the background. Director Len Wiseman,\nBeckinsale's real life husband, clearly belongs to the Luc Besson/Paul\nW.S. Anderson \"let's just focus on my gorgeous wife's acrobatics\"\nschool of thought.<br><br>Loosely based on a Philip K. Dick short story (which steered towards a\nvery different, sardonic direction at the end), Total Recall is decent\nentertainment. Farrell as the blue-collar dreamer who ends up involved\nin a lethal spy game is okay; visuals are okay; set-pieces are okay.\nCue rooftop chase (the best of the bunch), car chase, factory chase,\nfirst twist, second twist, climactic boss battle.<br><br>If competent but bland sci-fi is enough for you, open wide.<br><br>6/10\n"
"\nNot as good as the original. PG-13 means you as a film maker are a\ncoward. R equals balls, the '87 Total Recall is and awesome mindless\nparade of violence and goofy effects, it has nothing to do with Philip\nK. Dick but in no way should that be a slight to the writer. The\noriginal Total Recall was a vehicle movie for Arnold Schwarzenegger and\nmade no pretense as to be anything else. While this movie pretends to\nbe closer to the source material left by Philip K. Dick its in reality\nmerely a vehicle for computer generated effects. Its a bunch of\nprogrammers saying \"look what we can do with computers!\" Film is film,\nif lit well it looks as real as life, so far no computer generated\nimage has come close to looking like real stuff. Hey, when used\nsparingly, when used delicately, computer generated images work, they\nadd to the illusion of film, when used as the majority of the movie's\nimages it looks fake. Also gun violence and gore kick ass.\n"
