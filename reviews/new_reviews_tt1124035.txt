ryan goslings at his best in dramatic roles and theres no exception here
as things unravel  that happens quickly thanks to the intense plot  gosling decides that his ambitions are so important that hell be willing willing to lose his soul
george clooney has a very strong appeal hes very convincing his acting being almost perfect
ides of march has very few flaws the twists in the plot are not predictable and overall doesnt have any problems connecting with the viewers
eventually though theres no character to empathize with the audience has the impression of a notable film noir challenging us to come to terms with what politics is nowadays
ive seen intelligent filmmaking and a provocative moral fable
i cant believe i watched it the plot i didnt get and the ending was an anti climax
i suppose its a good mirror of how politicians are 2 faced
really struggling to come up with 10 lines here to review this movie as it does not have many redeeming points about it and i dont want to give the plot away
i suppose i watched the movie thinking about where it was going and how it would end
and it ended with
what
no idea
i suppose in the states people might be kinder about this movie but i think it lacked all imagination or originality
its as if it were a copypaste story from clinton era with a slight twist
i did not think george c
did himself any favours with this movie
why doesnt this film scratch the surface
we never learn much about morris the politician outside of campaign offices and the sidelines at a few events leading up to a primary we dont know what kind of politician he is even supposed to be and we dont know what the goslings idealistic campaign manager really believes in
clooney appears to have been content to rely on recent events to develop the character of an obamalike liberal rather than to develop the story of a career both on the verge and in jeopardy and it isnt much of an emotional letdown for us when we learn the truth about morris
the story does well with the machinations in and between campaign offices with good performances by gosling giamatti and seymourhoffman but there is not much in the way of political reality here
i went into this movie with great expectations too bad
ides of march is noise signifying nothing
i expected more from george clooney
hollywood likes ryan gossling
hed better hope that they dont start to like him too much because when they do they start to put you in garbage like this
ides of march should have been a great political thriller but instead we get a predictable movie that telegraphs all of its intentions and leaves you empty
i guess george has become cynical about politics and i guess i cant blame him based on the current situation
i guess i can understand why more people havent flocked to this movie
my husband fell asleep on the first half and i was angry after the second half
the movie should have left you with something to think about like michael clayton but it didnt too bad
oh dear
considering the amount of talent involved in making this its a real disappointment
a dull story about characters i couldnt care less about doing things i wasnt interested in
its the old chestnut about american politics being a dirty business and how no one can be trusted and all the double dealing and manipulating that goes on
its been done before and better with films like the best manand bulworth
many of the characters seem to have been drawn from every political stereotype and none of them seems very believable and marisa tomeis cartoon styled journalist belonged in something like the simpsons
for fans ofthe particpants only im afraid
films and television shows about politicians all make the same mistake they focus on what we all assume goes on behind the scenes in politics and what we end up with is a predictable nonstory
netflixs pretentious house of cards is another example
the characters are corrupt and scheming leaving no one for an audience to sympathize with
no wonder nobody trusts washington
this film seems to suggest we should accept and expect dishonest showboating instead of realistic honest political discussion
this film did nothing more for me than remind me of why i generally dont vote
i was hoping for something exciting as the titles reference to julius caesar suggested but no its just boring political scheming which at best falls flat as a film
the production and performances were great but the story gave me nothing to care about
the ides of march directed by george clooney was a bland and uninvolved watch
the focus of the movie is glitzy political schtick
it feels like it has little substance or meat to it
it reminded me of charlie wilsons war  another movie with many capable actors but with a vapid preachy story
clooney here clearly uses political dialog and banter for his own slant on things which may or may not be agreeable but the atmosphere is trite and like a television drama
how many times do we have to watch news channels set up in movies to some how validate authenticity
spoilers while none of the acting is really poor theres little to say and a dumb openended ending sort of leaving me wonder  ok what was all that supposed to be
not recommended
note clooney himself in the movie is curiously aloof supposedly a warm politician ringing phony
no need to watch this one
despite a magnificent cast their talents go wasted in a movie that simply will not pick up
we dont get sympathetic to any of the characters and considering how low real live politicians have fallen these days what clooney brings on the governor seems so harmless
there are at least 5 better presidential candidate movies out there shot long before ides of march
forget this one watch damages or the wire and get a bigger thrill and 10 times more insight into the human psyche
of course we already know that wanna be candidates give up all their principles for power no new revelations for the audience here
and the governors speeches were pretty lame too
first thought after the movie ended was boring
george clooney seems like a cool guy but he didnt choose a very good topic for a movie
the very definition of politics is doing whatever you need to to come out on top and nobody is surprised that its what this movie is about
oh somebody had an affair
somebody went behind their coworkers backs
eh just a day in the life of a politician
it was honestly a very boring and predictable plot and the drama of the movie was incredibly forced and unnatural
at one point ryan gosling invited evan rachel wood into his office gives her a piece of paper he wrote on asks for it back and tells her to leave
how can any of that be considered important to any part of the movie
sigh it had a good cast but very little else was memorable
if youre not into politics big time than this will seem to you like a collection of people  politicians  that are very preoccupied with their own selves and that think that the rest of the world must be in awe with them as well
the bombastic crook type
they talk so much unrealistic so i wouldnt call it stupid philosophy that doesnt apply to pretty much anyone on planet earth
silly
nobody was actually likable to me in the movie except for clooney hes been around long enough to be able to pull something reasonable out of it
he was the only one that seemed legit to me the only character that had some degree of stucture and humanity
ryan gosling played his part like he just descended from fracture he did exactly the same type of character
booooring
its time to change a few things if you want to stay ahead ryan
i thought this was going to be interesting or exciting maybe intense and it was none of those things for the first hour
unbelievably talented cast  clooney giamatti tomei and even the great character actor greg itzin
the most thrilling of which to watch on screen was the neverdisappointing phillip seymore hoffman
i spent a buckthirty on my rental and i kind of want my buck back
the story is about a very leftwing democrat running against another democrat for president
his truebeliever campaign speech writer is offered a position with the competitors campaign
these leads to an unfortunate series of events which makes him seek revenge
the revenge plot doesnt really start up until 34 of the way through the movie
too slow and vague for my tastes
found my mind wandering
wanting to get up and do other stuff
ryan gosling unfortunately could not hold my attention
i very much hope other people enjoyed this movie but i just couldnt stay interested
although i did stick with it until the uneventful ending
the ides of march starring ryan gosling and george clooney
though many of the trailers have been quite misleading once watching the film
this is ryan goslings film as the clear lead he is enthralling as the pr man who despite his shrewdness is blinded by the bosss charm
through the film soon enough the bombshell drops and its lead actress evan rachel wood
trouble is she just happens to be the girl who gosling has been getting cozy with
the pace quickens as he weighs up his loyalties to the governor and the girl as well as getting pushed and pulled between rival campaign managers paul giamatti and philip seymour hoffman
the acting is heavyweight as are the moral questions about the personal cost of serving the greater good which propel the story with an unstoppable force
the film works due to several twists and turns throughout and there is great suspense
george clooney plays a governor who is running for president
he is one of two serious candidates for the democratic nomination
he is a bit too good to be true
he is adamant about the standard liberal issues and wont back down on them
ryan gosling plays his number two man along with campaign manager philip seymour hoffman
one day gosling makes a serious error
he goes to see the campaign manager of the other candidate
this is an absolute no no
his head is on the block
during this time he has a quick tryst with the daughter of the democratic national committee
she gives him a bit of information that could throw things into the septic system
meanwhile he is fired
wanting his job back he acts
this is really dirty politics and probably the kind of thing that is done behind the scenes all the time
not a great political drama but still very engaging
tightly woven political thriller directed and starring george clooney from a play by beau willimon also starring some of the foremost male thesps in hollywood namely ryan gosling philip seymour hoffman and paul giamatti
no dull moments in sight as events twist and turn through the presidential primaries and there is plenty of ruthless politicking going on with the plot clipping along at a good pace
in a way its like the antiwest wing
gosling does a fine job at the centre of things but why would we expect anything less and there are great turns all around him that make for a highly entertaining and powerful drama
i love political drama but it has to be very very realistic and well written
this film is both
although i do think it could easily have achieved what it was trying to do without adding quite so much emotional gunpowder i imagine that clooney wanted to be certain that the audience would be in no doubt about the mindset of the protagonist so he made absolutely sure of it
you cant blame him for using very big letters at that point
apart from this one flaw i think this film is near perfect
a very neat and well designed story about how the real world of high level politics will harden you and leave you cynical
of course it helps when the cast is this great
you could watch phillip seymour hoffman read the phone book and it would be interesting
clooney holds his own in this company
the sassy intern is very enjoyable to watch too
there is one scene that is worth cutting out and keeping she is so good in it
loved it
will certainly watch it again
get out now
or otherwise
stephen meyers gosling is a young and ambitious campaign worker for his ideal candidate mike morris clooney
when the ohio primary is in jeopardy the campaign has a tough decision to make
when stephen talks to the opposition and discovers a secret that could ruin mikes chances his morals are challenged
being a political science major i really enjoy movies like this
i know most people may not but i do think that this one is different
for a movie that is basically an hour and a half of talking it moves very quickly keeps you interested and is very tense
focusing mainly on the dirty politics and deals made in order to get someone elected this will both interest you and make you wonder if this is accurate which i hope its not
this is one of the best political thrillers i have ever seen
the only problem i can see is that its not a multiple rewatcher
i give it a b
this is not a movie for everyone
the trailer gives a somewhat false idea of exactly what the movie has to offer
this put aside it was a very entertaining film
the writing was absolutely phenomenal
there were so many moments where subtle comedy was worked into the overall dark plot
acting was very solid throughout the film
ryan gosling will most likely get an oscar nomination as well as george clooney and or philip seymour hoffman and or paul giamatti for their supporting roles
i could also see evan rachel wood getting nominated for her role
overall i enjoyed the film yet it left me wanting more
ryan goslings character drove the story by pulling you into his mind and taking you through his inner battle between morals and power
as intriguing as this was it stopped short literally
i get the idea behind ending the story where it did but i just wish it could have gone on
it slightly reminded me of the ending in inception
it wanted to leave you guessing but in this case it left me unsatisfied
i would have rated it higher if it were not for the ending
first i am not a clooney fan
second clooney is very idealistic and his writing is mediocre
this movie would not have been made without his street cred as the story followed like a box of donuts mixed sweet but too much in the end
ryan gosling kills this role and puts him in the top 5 of living great actors
wow
he sells this role from his first line
he is sheer joy to watch
but the story hit a number of speed bumps that created nice opportunities for tension and climax resolution but i was not sold
it would not have worked as a play they needed editing to tie the loose ends together
so good for clooney to take the risk but he has a ways to go as a writer
down the road i think hell look back and say i could do better
on the good side the music was excellent the story topical and with a bit of less scrutiny the movie was entertaining
and i do look forward to his next movie
i was keen on watching this because i read a magazine review which mentioned the west wing one of my absolute favourite shows
the movie has the political credibility nailed but is not in the same league as aaron sorkins slick drama
i was interested enough to keep watching because i wanted to know what happens but i was rather puzzled by the inconclusive ending
george clooneys politician running for presidential nomination is believable and ryan gosling as his aide appears to be a moral person who maybe becomes corrupted but the story involving the intern molly was not completely clear to me
there were too many questions unanswered
it presents a believable view of the dirty tricks in political campaigns but there was a lot of swearing and the dark side was winning
it is not the west wing in any way its a political drama and a fairly confusing one at that
brilliantly pieced movie start to finish
ides of march touches on the nature of work a politician has to engage in and attempts to give perspective on the popular paradigms which labels that environment
clooney is able to portray his characters thoughts and feelings through their dialog allowing the viewer to empathize with all characters and experience their dilemmas
in essence this is where the movie wins its appeal
politics is boiled down to choices dilemmas and tradeoffs and clooney allows his viewer to experience the angst and internal moral turmoil that comes with that
it is this way that we are given an interesting perspective of what it means to be a politician and the title wonderfully draws on caesars assassination to suggest it was probably always that way
ides of march is clooneys depiction of what that way is
ides of march thoughtful and provoking movie directed by george clooney leaves a bitter taste
this is not a propaganda piece promoting the socalled and by the tea party hacks eternally abhorred liberal agenda
far away from it
the real and ever so serious problem is a deeply flawed and corrupt system very often taunted by the ruling elites as the best in the world
so it could be a republican or a democrat and it really doesnt matter that much
its a marvelously produced tv reality show filled with people desperate for attention and a bit of money that goes with it
from jerry springer to presidential election
more polish better haircuts proper english few more teeth but not that much different
same lack of shame and shortage of dignity and abundance of cheap thrills and even cheaper futures

george clooney is a good actor and hes becoming a formidable director
this movie is fine but i was expecting some more
great dialogues thrilling scenario excellent cast
everything is fine
but i didnt enjoy the film as much as i was expecting
i just cant find whats going wrong in it
the story isnt that surprising
anyway its very entertaining and for once it doesnt last forever only 95 minutes
and its rolling well
maybe its just because we i mean spectators of my age 49 are used to 3 hours movie on politics
with an international side story
here we just have people who are trying to save their butt
maybe thats where is my deception is coming from
its not a movie about a political candidate but a thriller based on a personal default
i cannot believe this movie did not get more coverage and more hoopla
i watched this movie with some expectations of it being fairly good but painting a very similar picture that we have all seen many times now
i have to say i was extremely surprised in a very good way
this is a very good story with very good actors giving very good acting performances
i have to admit im a fan of gearge clooneys acting but not his politics  so you can imagine i was more than a little dubious about this being a clooney movie about the political machine
but all i want to say is do yourself a favor and watch this movie
it is dynamite  a definite 9 out of 10
enjoy
ides of march is a smart movie that builds the storyline little by little step by step sucking you in until you find yourself by surprise in the middle of a highly intriguing plot just like the main character does
among many other virtues what i liked the most was the unpredictable events and twists the story has throughout its length
george clooney really knows how to dispose the pieces of the puzzle and surprise the audience when the whole picture finally starts to come together
in other words he really knows how to tell a story maintaining the tension and the interest till the very last second
this is a very good political drama with outstanding performances thrilling moments and some exquisite shots that make clooney stand as the very good director he has become over the years
theres also a clear message in the movie that i enjoyed a lot
politics arent for everyone and this is the movie that shows you what you need to have to live from politics regardless of who you work for a politician the government or a newspaper
this is not clooneys first time in the directors chair and his abilities as a director and an actor are constantly improving
while the film is about the presidential race the action centers around goslings character and he seems to segue nicely from his previous romantic comedy  action adventure roles into something a bit more serious
his connection with evan rachel wood is touching and real something that might happen in the discreet world of politics and his hypocrisy and elitist attitude is concealed in their affair
phillip seymour hoffman and paul giamatti are dynamic and powerful as the opposing campaign managers and marisa tomei is the investigative reporter who knows how to twist the arm of her sources
clooney also wrote the screenplay
an overall powerhouse for clooney with solid acting smooth action and a surprising twist at the end
sex and language prevent this from being a family film but the adults and later teens will be enthralled by the accuracy of the campaign process
collectible if you like politics
i like clooney as a director his skill apparent in the way he moves through the setting and how the camera treats his actors and he can generate interest and entertain well as he tells the story
this film is really good at that
being about the dirty game of politics playing at full effect in the background i couldnt help but think about how it couldve been a much better film had it focused almost entirely on stephens story and his transition more deeply
gosling is once again amazing the scene when he listens to mollys messages and the last scene are great
very good writing going on in some standoffs and other lazy lines like mollys were catholics
a great movie  including talented famous actors and a very good director  who is a very talented and handsome actor
there is a good acting in this filmespecially from george clooney and philip seymour hoffman
despite having little scenes in comparison to ryan goslingthey were very impressive directing of clooney was impressive and his role was a corner stone in the movie he was very mature and it was one of his bests ryan gosling was a big surprise for mehe was very good and controlling his scenes
he added his flavor to the movie and it helped well
i liked also jeffrey wright paul giamatti
they acted very well
it was all about politics
politics politics and more politics
there were no good people and bad peopleit was just how to win your battle caring only for your self and your business i learned a lot about politics from this movie
and despite all that the film was interesting and not boring at all i reacted very well with no blinking
i think the film is very good and deserves watching
as always clooney has come up with a movie which does not make you cringe with silly scenes violence and overacting mediocre actors
though the story could have been much more meaningful and thought provoking this makes a very good watch
after all you want to watch a movie and read a scripture on a lazy afternoon
clooney has given the driving seat to an able ryan gosling
hope he doesnt get stereotyped with this full of himself or talk less move your facial muscles roles
background score is notable and overall a good movie
not for someone who expects over the hill dramas but suits to one who has tastes like watching movies based on true stories though this is not one
thank goodness its the ides of march
i say that because this is a kind of film which i like a slow burner which leaves you satisfied yet knowing that the story doesnt end there
ryan goslings character may start out as an idealist but he soon learns how the real world works and embraces it with both arms till in the end in terms of ruthlessness and coldeyed ambition he outcaesars caesar
but young man beware
he who rides the tiger
respice post te memento te hominem
or whatever anyway what i mean to say is that this film cries out for a followup which tells the further exploits of stephen meyers
i hope he goes on from strength to strength then brings the whole rotten world of politics crashing down like a pack of cards and comes out smelling of roses
and to top it all they manage to tell the story in a quiet measured tone
much as i have liked clooneys performances oh brother and directing good night i found his latest effort incredibly boring and predictable
i walked out a few times but in between i did not enjoy one moment of this film nor did i hear one sentence of interesting dialog or one moment that had any creative energy to it
as to the acting which many reviewers liked i must disagree in that all the major talent gave predictable performances while the guy playing the protagonist was unappealing
the plot what there was of it made no sense as it seemed to revolve around the hardly scandalous event of two rival campaign strategists meeting
if one watches an intelligent political film like the best man for example one realizes how far this genre has suffered in recent years along with politics in general
i was in politics for 17 years
worked at the local state and federal levels as an elected official appointed official staff and bureaucrat
in my opinion this movie is a fair and accurate portrayal of the game
it is not liberal agenda nor is it conservative agenda
it is the reality of politics
and politics is an at times vicious chess match which determines how people are going to live
philip seymour hoffman very accurately portrays a chief of staff and the conversations that take place are close to reality
the writer got this movie correct
if a person wants to know what the game is really like at election time they need to watch this movie
this movie is about the depravity and corruption in politics of how influence is sold for favors all in order to win
ryan gosling gives a powerful performance as novice political staffer who learns the facts of life while on the campaign and then applies what he learns
the story itself is not only plausible but if anything understated
given the series of well known and at times infamous scandals that have shaken the publics confidence in the integrity of the democratic political process this movie does not really present anything new
rather the movie presents a story that confirms what the public already knows that politics and politicians are open to influence and make huge mistakes which can cost them the or political career
the question is how effective is the damage control and can the mistakes be smoothed over and even turned to a candidates advantage
to find out the answers to these questions watch the movie
this movie in engaging i will watch any movie with ryan gosling in it
the problem with this brilliant piece of propaganda is that it gives a kind of credit to the us elections that is so far from the truth of the circus as to be laughable
it has all the in and out of what a real race may look like but the fact that american politics is 1000 less noble than this and infinitely more of the bad taste that there is no actual left right dichotomy i
e
that there is no actual left or right would mean that this is a complete exercise in propaganda to convince the average american that this is how politics are fought for behind the scenes
the truth is that in actuality the winner of an american election is agreed upon by everyone involved in the race well before hand by the rothschild banking cartel and that this interesting movie only serves as the ideal of what the nation actually expects happens
if you dont mind the propaganda of this film the sole reason that it was made and you can suspend your disbelief then you will be fine with this whole facade
by unfinished what i mean is that it felt more like half a movie
the ides of march is competently scripted and acted but really doesnt tell you anything you didnt know about the ruthless nature of political life
with a cast this great youre expecting quite a lot and the acting is fine
it has to be said though that most of these actors could play these roles in their sleep and only the everwatchable paul giamatti really stands out
philip seymour hoffman and marisa tomei especially are badly underused
unfortunately the story builds to an interesting place and then its over
not a bad movie but id rather watch my old dvds of the west wing for my fictional political entertainment
with all the big names in this movie i was expecting something really greatsomething well worth the price of two movie tickets
unfortunately my husband and i were both very disappointed
the story line is very lacking and the ending will leave you wanting more
the acting was superb and some scenes were very powerful
the first half of the movie has you wondering what direction the plot is going to take
when the defining moment finally arrives you expect a dramatic series of events as the characters twist and turn to make lemonade out of lemons
but there is nothing besides lemons in this offering
no resolution no happy ending
if youre looking for a smart interesting drama skip this one
a film about the cruel price of politics
love story as axis
and the lies compromises and abdications errors and indirect crimes like modus vivendi
about power and fear only facts talks
the president may be french romanian or somalian
the differences are small
the mixture of past and future is in any situation dangerous
and reality is only way of small combination
the movie is not indictment or manifesto
it is indigestible food
precise and result of old recipes
with great actors and gray air
with final open shade
a movie as a ax kick
lead of gestures gnashing of feelings
secrets as heats of a american ceremony
and the end
as evening rain
as i saw this film tonight  in greece and i  m not very well accustomed with the american voting system which is completely different from ours i have to admit that i enjoyed the film tremendously
i can also understand why this film is so annoying for the american people and of course the critics who dont want to accept the disillusionment of the fake american dream but i can tell you this george clooney is getting more mature as a director from film to film though his goodnight and good luck was excellent too and is one of the unfortunately few american directors who are still carrying the flag of the unparalleled classical american cinema that is a combination of entertainment with a social or political message in a masterful equilibrium
the ides of march is not an easy film to watch but its made of oscar staff especially for its script direction camera and performances
thank you george
we are very much obliged
philip seymour hoffman delivered an outstanding performance
evan rachel woods delivered the right mix of sexuality and innocence which made her character likable and yet an object of pity
george clooney proved once again that he has what it takes to become an a list director and the acting skills to stay on the a list
real emotional moments leaped from the screen drawing the viewers deeper into the plot
scenarios from this political drama could have easily played out in the corporate world where a thirst for power often leaves loyalty and morality in a dry barren often forgotten place
realism was the force of the day in this modern day drama
a sound script an excellent cast as well as all around excellent performances will probably lead to golden globes and oscars nominations
angelina stevens gives this must see little political thriller 2 bravos
within 5 minutes i had figured out the entire plot
somebody in hollywood needs to wake up because clooney has zero clue as to what he is doing
yet he keeps getting to make more movies
i watched the movie mainly because giamati and gossling are in it
say what you want but i dont whats worse this or up in the air or the american
reviewers can say what they want about how those movies were artistic but i guarantee if you made those same people sit through those movies again they would refuse
like usual another hyped up clooney bomb
i honestly cannot think of any reason to suggest to somebody to watch this
the political plot lines are so obvious a five year old kid could figure it out
this is not by any means a political thriller at best it is a movie about politics and nothing more
im sorry great actors actually signed on to this movie didnt they read the script or did they really need a paycheck that bad
