"\nThe whole premise of this story was flawed from the beginning. For\nSciFi fans time travel is what its all about. Its meant to be\nintriguing and full of conundrums that most importantly, some how make\nsense. All the best time travel movies have a consistency that holds\nthe idea together. This is precisely what Loopers does not have. There\nwhere so many holes in the plot that it became impossible to go with\nit. If your going to beam someone to the past to be killed why do you\nneed a Looper. why not beam them straight to the furnaces. And if you\nhave to use a Looper why rely on him to kill himself - let someone else\ndo it. Seriously this was just a few of the canyon like proportions of\nthe gaps in the plot of this flop. If Bruce was not in this i would\nhave walked way before the end. I was fooled. You don't have to be.\n"
"\ni always approach a film especially when it is classified as scifi with\nliberal suspension of disbelief. because it is only through that that i\nwas able to appreciate such scifi gems as Stargate and Fifth Element\nand many other that were otherwise written off by these so-called\ncritics.<br><br>Looper is one of those films that should be appreciated by its message\nmore than its genre. it uses the science fiction medium, complete with\naction stunts and wonders, as an apt and well-sculpted vehicle to a\nvery beautiful message of self-sacrifice and positive reinforcement\nparenthood. the film goes to extra length to make the story plausible\nand solid and the actors, including the 'rainmaker' child, did a\nmarvelous job of pulling it off.<br><br>i've always believed that the soul of any film, even as i appreciate\ngreat plot twists and great special fx and great acting and direction\n(yeah, i said great too many times!), is the message and/or portrait it\nintends to get across. Looper made a kill for it.\n"
"\nThe premise for this film is fantastic, the cast appears great, and its\na movie that wants to be seen. However, it is a major disappointment.\nThe whole concept of hit men and time-travel is intriguing- and the\nconcept of your future self being the target, even more so, but this,\nin truth, is not what the film ends up being about. In a Terminator\nesque manner Bruce Willis turns his antics in the past to a 'save the\nfuture' kill quest wanting to destroy a future-crushing \"rainmaker\"\n(whom we know very little about and have little incentive to want\nkilled) whilst he is still a child. The aforementioned has 'TK'- the\nfilms terms for Telekentic powers- and this is barely covered and feels\nlike one idea too far, almost an add on that is ultimately crucial to\nthe narrative but is not presented to us enough. In all the film leaves\nyou dissatisfied, feels clunky, and disappointing as on paper it could\nhave been so much better..\n"
"\nThe ending makes the whole experience a huge flop and major waste of\nmoney.<br><br>Despite being a real fan of sci-fi, the ending doesn't make any sense.\nIf it did happen like that then none of it would've happened in the\nfirst place as the older version would not have existed to begin with.\nSo, I am baffled that some one thought that would make a realistic or\nentertaining ending. Really?? Like trying to pin jam to a wall.<br><br>The action scenes are actually really good. Unfortunately that is the\nonly good thing about the movie.<br><br>The younger version of the character is incredibly annoying. He does\nnot resemble the older version's character at all. It is really\ndifficult to bring the two together. The younger character lacks logic,\nperception or any type of savvy. A complete moron. Again it doesn't fit\nwith the more sensible and intelligent older version that's trying to\nsave the world. <br><br>I just kept wishing the younger version would grow some brain cells.\n"
"\nThe concept of the movie was flawed from the start. \"It is nearly\nimpossible to kill someone in the future and get away with it so they\nsend them back to the past to be killed and disposed of.\" Why not kill\nthem in the future and send their remains back to be disposed of.<br><br>The movie dragged on and the ending was anticlimactic. It left me with\nthe impression that he was the young boy on the train and he too was\nfrom the future, a kind of echo. If that were the case then why did he\nnot disappear too? Why would the gold stay when Willis disappeared. His\ndisappearance indicates that he was not sent back and neither was the\ngold. Finally why would you leave a kid alive who you know is going to\nturn into the most monstrous person in history? Are we to believe that\na kid with those powers will turn himself around with the help of his\nmother? Had he changed the time line that much? The kid already turned\non of the \"gats\" into mush!<br><br>OK... It is just science fiction... bad science fiction.\n"
"\nVery disappointing film,not even The wonderful Emily Blunt or JGL could\nsave this film.<br><br>On paper it looked a great film but very little character development\nand a mish mash of films ( including 12 monkeys, The Omen and\nTerminator) reduced what could have been an excellent film to barely\nwatchable.<br><br>No characters in the film show much emotion and it really is time\ntravel by numbers with a token love story thrown in.<br><br>How this Film got so much praise is a mystery to me with Willis beating\nup everyone in sight cringe worthy like JGL face and fake nose.<br><br>Time travel,the future,the whole nut and bolts of the story are just\nskimmed over as an afterthought.<br><br>Overall very disappointing.\n"
"\nI hate to be a cynic but I have a hard time believing that the 8.5/10\nrating on IMDb is genuine. As for originality, I guess the film could\nbe described as a unique combination of other story lines but\ndefinitely nothing innovative. It moved quite slow at times and there\nare also some serious contradictions and plot holes. In the future,\nhomeless people fill the streets and the US resembles a third world\ncountry, yet all of the high rise building are brand new and\nfuturistic. The cars use solar panels to power internal combustion\nengines which would never be a possibility. In the end, the main\ncharacter commits suicide, causing his future self to disappear. If he\nhad killed himself at his younger age, the older self wouldn't have\nexisted. There are also some unbelievable coincidences that keep the\nstory moving. I am sure the filmmaker would have some complex\nexplanation but I base my realities on known science and if they have\nan alternative science, it should have been introduced.\n"
"\nFirst of all, forget the plot. There isn't any, just a bunch of half\nbaked, overdone, derivative ideas flung at the screen in the laziest\npiece of film writing I've ever seen. Visually the picture steals from\nMad Max, Blade Runner, Witness, the Matrix, Carrie and another half\ndozen, better movies. But the most unforgivable thing it does is\nde-charm Joseph Gordon Levitt. One would not have thought this\npossible. Also in resurrecting the tiresome, bullet headed Bruce\nWillis, it reminded me of why I've always hated that guy. (His scenes\nwith the Chinese broad were particularly excruciating.) All in all, a\nhorrible mess that doesn't even have the guts to follow through on its\nset-ups.\n"
"\nHaving seen the overwhelmingly positive reviews of this film, i\nmistakenly believed it would at least be a passable science\nfiction/action movie. Sadly, the so called \"science\" portion of this\nmovie is so absurdly handled i was compelled to vent about it.<br><br>If you are entertained by Bruce Willis movies of the past few years,\nthis may seem a step up in quality.But the how the hell could that\nhappen moments are so frequent that i found it to be insufferable.<br><br>The tons of plot-holes are maddening and quite frankly, an insult to\nthe intelligence of a fifth-grader.Yet, the issues of how you can come\nback in time if you have been dead for 30 years, seem to be entirely\nforgivable be those who champion this pathetic excuse for sci-fi.If you\nignore feasibility it is fantasy. Saying \"that is the reality of this\nmovie\" does not erase the absolute absurdity of it.<br><br>This is not Science fiction. It is a bad comic book movie without the\npeople in spandex. And that is an insult to comic book movies.\n"
"\nHow this movie has gotten many good reviews is beyond my comprehension.<br><br>The plot is just a lame excuse to justify the action, the action scenes\nare scarce and not very good, the subplots are even worse.<br><br>There are plenty redundant scenes. The plot switches its place with a\nsubplot. The story is easy to follow but uninteresting.<br><br>This is a very bad movie with relatively good acting. Superb acting\nconsidering the bad script. Midway into the film I wanted to stop\nwatching but I thought the ending would turn out to be all this movie\nwas not, to get such good reviews; but then I thought that would be\nimprobable. I got that last bit right; the ending was as bad as the\nrest or worse.\n"
"\nPseudo-intellectual film for the non-thinking masses...<br><br>As unattainable as time travel itself are films about time travel....<br><br>Usually, they are full of inconsistencies, plot holes and whatever. The\nclimax scene at the end of the film is a good example of how people do\nnot know how to end a film and then come up with some \"smart twist\"\nwhich of course destroyed the whole logic of the story...<br><br>It has been a while since I watched a decent science fiction, Looper is\nanother mess, similar to Prometheus. <br><br>But at least Prometheus had some eye candy, some nice special effects,\nLooper has a dry sugar cane field...\n"
"\nThis is without doubt the worst \"sci-fi\" movie I have seen in years. <br><br>First, they don't even try to explain the time travel part. Second a\nman can never go back in time without changing the future, thus\nremoving the reason for him to go back in time. Example: <br><br>On the field Joe kills himself to prevent his future self to kill Cid.\nAnd by killing himself, his future self could never have gone back in\ntime because he would not exist. So without Joe going back in time,\nCids mom would never have been shot and Cid would never have turn bad.\nTherefore removing the reason for future Joe to go back in time.<br><br>You could explain this with parallel universes, but if it was a\nparallel universe future Joe would not get the memories and scars that\nJoe gets in the past. Because it would be the other universe and the\nchanges in one universe does not alter the future in another universe.\nSo they ruined that part to.<br><br>They could have made a fantasy movie of it, explaining it with magic...\n"
"\nHow many relatives does Bruce Willis have out there? Or if that isn't\nit, what is the explanation for the popularity of this noisy waste of\neffort? Man. This movie had no story after the initial premise, so they\nthrew in a kid and a pretty mom and a washed up movie star. And I\nnoticed the cheap effect another reviewer mentioned of cranking up the\nvolume when someone knocks on a door or makes any other sudden sound. A\nshabby aural technique in a futile attempt to inject excitement and\ncover the lack of real drama.<br><br>There is no tension in this movie, though the kung fu speed editing\nhelps disguise the fact for half an hour into the film. The day this\ntacky beast opened the movies died a little.\n"
"\nThe movie lacks of sense, I don't understand why people is calling this\na clever plot!!?? I think writers should take some basic physic\nlessons, this movie lacks completely of sense of a time-line. There are\ntwo different plots and the plot is weak, the acting performance is\ngood, and the film is well realized but please the story not make any\nsense at all, is just a bad story about time travel mixed with some\naction and super powers.<br><br>If you think a little bit the movie shouldn't even exist hahaha,\nbecause the broke all the physics law and is not logical at all.<br><br>Please writers next time study a little more about common sense.\n"
"\nThe worst movie I've ever seen...And definitely not a action and\ncertainly not a thriller....The plot is very weak. Not worth wasting\nyour money on watching this movie. In my opinion burn the negative of\nthis movie. Awful Movie.A real disappointment. And the concept of time\ntravel was badly conceived. This movie is more of a romantic movie than\nthe story of a man facing his future self. Didn't expect this from\nBruce Willis. And the telekinesis thing was bullsh*t. And the movie\nmoves pretty slow. I mean it takes about 30 mins to reveal what the\nplot is all about. And the worst thing is the lack of action. There is\nnon hand to hand combat which was really disappointing. And there is\njust a 2 minute scene of Willis shooting people which ended as soon as\nit started. All in all the movie is so bad that you'd rather sleep at\nhome all day. (And BTW this is my 1st preview so its not very\nprofessional.) But had to write this to stop y'all from wasting your\nmoney and valuable time.\n"
"\nSo went for this flick coz I found the trailer interesting. I really\nlike sci-fi genre and the last movie in this genre I saw was 'In Time',\nwhich was very entertaining. Looper was not that much fun.<br><br>I felt the director's execution was not up to the mark. Firstly the\nmovie has no action scenes if you expect so. The 2nd half of the\nscreenplay is very slow, gloomy and totally idiotic. The movie actually\nhas 2 plots, 1)time travel and 2) the dangers of toddlers with\nuncontrollable telekinesis. Unfortunately, neither of these plots are\nwell executed and so it ruins the whole movie.<br><br>The climax defies all logics and the time travel has big a goof up and\nyou end up thinking, how can the director can be so stupid! The lead\ncast was OK in the whole act. The whole premise of the film is never\nexplained satisfactorily. Looper is a dismal train wreck of ideas with\ngreat potential. I will not recommend Looper.\n"
"\nI was expecting a smart sci fi/action-thriller with lots of twists and\nexcitement. This is nothing but a slow, boring mess.<br><br>Don't let the trailer fool you! The movie starts off pretty good, but\nthen it just slows down. Lots of boring dialog that goes nowhere. At\ntimes I thought I accidentally had walked into the wrong theater.<br><br>When things finally start to happen, the plot slows down again, with\nmore pointless, boring dialog.<br><br>Then towards the end, everything happens too fast. At the end, you\ndon't even care for the characters or their fates.<br><br>Don't waste your time on this one, watch '12 Monkeys' instead.\n"
"\nPromised so much and delivered so little. I have NEVER walked out of a\nmovie at the cinema, Until now.(I even sat through the whole of 'The\nLucky One') The idea of the film is great, i was very excited to give\nit a watch. But the way it was made and all the holes in the plot was\njust disgraceful!!! <br><br>Also if it was so hard to dispose of dead bodies in the future then how\ncome they shot his wife dead when they came for him?? why didn't they\nkill him as well and the film would have half as long and half as\npainful!!<br><br>RUBBISH!!!\n"
"\nThe perfect time travel movie made....not an easy thing to\naccomplish...but Rian Johnson does it and it looks so good....powerful\nstorytelling, stylish good old action and the visuals reminding of\n\"Children of Men\" is what makes this futuristic sci-fi , an excellent\nmovie........and the HEART this movie has...makes it a GREAT movie....\nDo watch it...you will be surprised....\n"
"\nThis puts an interesting twist on time travel movies. It seems that\ntime travel is illegal and only available on the black market.\n\"Loopers\" are people who are sent back in time to kill their old selves\nand other people and get gold bars as a reward and live the next thirty\nyears...or something like that. Joseph Gordon-Levitt is such a Looper,\nand he is sent back on a mission. He encounters his future self and\nsomeone who will do something horrible in the future-who is a child in\nthis present. He does things that will alter the future.<br><br>This movie features a good plot and a great cast with JGL, Bruce\nWillis, Emily Blunt, and Piper Perabo, as well as good special effects.\nI enjoyed it. Watch it if you like a \"spin\" on things.<br><br>*** out of ****\n"
"\nIt's as good a film as Bladerunner. Yes, there have been some critics\ntrying to tone down the positivity of reviews of this movie, and I\nstarted watching it expecting a B-Grade action, sci-fi flick, however,\nI was surprised that I was subtly drawn in to the ambiance of this\nworld.  The quality is there; the essential effort and attention to\ndetail has been put in. So, as a package deal it's a green light from\nme. Yes, criticism can be laid but the essential element for me is that\nthe quality is sufficient to maintain entertainment throughout.<br><br>This film is not anywhere near the rubbish pile and could even be\ncalled great, depending upon your perspective.\n"
"\nBeyond the obvious visual pleasure of Emily Blunt in farm-girl chic,\nthere's nothing but incoherence to be found in Rian Johnson's Looper, a\nmovie so chock-full of bewildering nonsense that the viewer needs to\nloop back to Blunt, or Joseph Gordon-Levitt for the girls. I watched\nthis sci-fier a week ago, and it feels as if I know less now than just\nafter the credits rolled.<br><br>I went to my best buddy, Wikipedia, to make sense of Looper by reading\nthe plot synopsis. It didn't help. Like the guy who is having his parts\nsnipped off one by one in the movie--and can see the result 30 years in\nthe past or the future or a week from Thursday--every time I try to\nfigure Looper out, there's less there.<br><br>I'm so frustrated with the time-traveling and the telekinesis and the\n30 second steak and eggs and the Chevy running in 2044 and the fact\nthat the movie makes no damned sense at all that I just have to accept\nthat Looper, which looked so interesting in the trailers, is a colossal\nwaste of time.\n"
"\nWell - I don't like time-travel-movies much because most of the time\nimo the writers screw the story up. But the high-ratings and the fine\nactors involved dared me to give the movie a try - and ofc it failed...\nFar too many holes to the plot (e.g. if the gangsters in the future got\na time-travel machine there is no need for loopers at all, just think\nabout it.) Also the movie didn't hold my attention well - too much\ndialogue for my taste which lead into the kingdom of sleepiness. The\nimplementation of the mutant kid didn't make the story better at all.\nAnother aspect are all the action scenes - uninspired and at best\nmediocre stuff. Summa summarum: imo one of the few good\ntime-travel-movies is the original movie Time Machine of George Pal\nfrom 1960 with Rod Taylor in lead. If a director or writer wants to\nrise chances for making a bad movie - he/she makes one about\ntime-travel.\n"
"\nThis movie fails already at the premise. If the criminal gangs of the\nfuture can send back people in time, and do so with very high accuracy\nfor both location and timing, then there is no need for \"loopers\" at\nall. Simply send them back to 100m above the ground, from where they\nwill fall to their death, or to the middle of the Pacific Ocean, or to\n5000 BC. Any of these options will guarantee that the victim will die\nimmediately - no need to hire a looper and take the risks that this\nentails (as seen in the movie).<br><br>The rest of the movie is the usual time traveling mumbo-jumbo. No time\ntraveling movie will ever make sense, because the concept of traveling\nback in time is physically impossible and causes all kinds of\nunsolvable paradoxes. So if you like movies which make sense and where\nthe characters behave in a rational way, stay away from this. However,\nif you like movies where you just turn off your brain and watch Bruce\nWillis shoot a bunch of people, you might enjoy this.\n"
"\nI did not like the past self killing himself and thereby killing his\nfuture self. When the future already existed, we can not roll it back!\nIf we have to, then we should bring back everything, not selectively!\nThe same way it would not be acceptable if Bruce Wills have killed the\nrain maker as he is already in the future. One can kill somebody who is\nin the present either in past or in future! If happens otherwise, then\nthat should roll back everything related with that somebody. It is as\ngood as bringing whole time back to past present. Who writes a story\nabout time traveling, should be little reasonable! Linefill! Linefill!\nLinefill!\n"
"\nFilm noir meets sci-fi as great acting, thought, and emotion combine to\nform the best kind of science fiction.<br><br>Such a powerful film!!! It's 12 Monkeys meets fire starter, just in a\nbrilliant way. The kind of movie that convinces that our small minds\nthat time travel is absolutely possible. That if there is no end then\nthere is no beginning. It illustrates perfectly how we do not change\nour patterns, and keep making the same mistakes. Then is reassures us\nthat we do have the power to change our future if we just change ONE\nthing.\n"
"\nLamest movie I have had the dis-pleasure to see in awhile. First of\nall, I thought the plot might have some merit... But the delivery was\nhorrible. The time machine was a piece of 1950's scrap metal from a\nbroken-down foundry. It just made no sense. Why would someone go back\nin time and work for a henchman in the future? Couldn't you find the\nhenchman's mother and kill her before she was born? Why would criminals\nbe the only ones using the time machine. I blocked this horrible movie\nfrom my mind, so I don't remember much anymore. What a waste of time.\nIt made no sense from a time paradox point of view. But I guess all USA\nmade movies have to be stupid these days to compete with all the other\nstupid, insipid movies that are made in Hollywood. No one can come up\nwith an original idea, so we get Godzilla part X, etc. And when they do\nit's some piece of garbage like this... If I could only go back in time\nand warn myself not to see this movie, and get my 2hrs. of life back...\n"
"\nThis movie was so very slow! Of all the movies in the theater this\nweekend, we regretted going to this one, and only did so because of the\nvery good ratings on IMDb. Who did these ratings, the production\ncompany and an army of paid zombies? Honestly! We found it to be quite\nboring and somewhat predictable. It was actually a pretty good story\nline, just way too long in getting there. And so much of the technology\nwas just not credible! For instance, going into the future 30 years,\nand the time machine looks like a contraption from an old western.\nAlso, Joseph Gordon-Levitt as a young Bruce Willis? Really? More\nimportantly was the lack of character development. We don't know\nanything about their backgrounds, likes, or how they got involved with\nthe mob. The romantic relationships were not believable, because, while\nthe women were beautiful, there was no chemistry.<br><br>If you decide to go, go hungry and arm yourself with plenty of popcorn,\ncandy and drinks. You'll have plenty of time to slip out to the\nrestroom without really missing anything.\n"
"\nThe whole plot relies on the fact of a man - a looper - who gets the\njob to kill his own self of 30 years later sent back to the past -\nclosing the loop, then. The situation opens field to a set of narrative\nand slightly philosophical questions. One just never understands why\nthe closure of the loop isn't done by someone else besides the self.\nThis option would surely make the whole situation so much easier, and\nsurely there would not be loopers tempted not to kill their self\nselves. Why didn't the big bad guy that rules the world in 2074 thought\nof this? Forgetting that basic but yet so important plot fail, it is a\nwell put together action film and Emily Blunt is beautifully filmed - i\nguess Rian liked the girl. If the narrative would go on in 2012, and\nbeing the future the time where the to-be-killed guys would be sent\nfrom, everything would be exactly the same. So, not much of science\nfiction here besides cool design cars, sophisticated weapons and a few\nmore ordinary things that don't bring anything actually essential to\nthe plot.\n"
"\nThis was one of the most boring movie's I've ever watched No real\nstoryline that you could follow without losing interest. It was very\ndisjointed and confusing, jumping back and forth without any real\nsequence. Im surprised that Bruce Willis put his name to it, but then\nhe has not had many offers lately. The directing and editing was not up\nto par and as a previous op posted, no good sequence between past and\npresent. I kept watching in the hope it would improve. It didn't. In\nfact it got worse. I wish I could find something good to say about it,\nbut I cant. After 35mins I gave up, as I was falling asleep with\nboredom. Save your money,,,,,,, it really was that bad.\n"
"\nIt's not giving anything away to say that Looper involves time travel.<br><br>The first 40 minutes of this movie are excellent with a convoluted\nstory-line that makes you think whilst enjoying the swirling action.<br><br>And then the lead characters come together in a diner.<br><br>From here out the movie drops a couple of levels and becomes a generic\naction movie where one person is trying to get another person whilst\nanother wants to stop him, along with the usual array of involved\nparties (mothers, mobsters, etc). I thought the mother figure might\njust as well have been called Sarah Connor.<br><br>It's also one of those movies where you have to fill in some plot holes\nyourself.<br><br>The acting is mostly flat and I didn't find any character that I could\ncare for.<br><br>So for me, the second two-thirds was a disappointment given how well\nthe movie started.<br><br>But if you are happy with a generic action movie, you could do a lot\nworse.\n"
"\nThe movie was just nonsense. It contradicted itself from scene to scene\nand was not very cleverly constructed at all.<br><br>But the worst thing about this movie for me is that I did not get the\nmake-up on Gordon-Levitt. I, as we all are, am capable of coming to\ngrips with the fact he is playing a young Willis, without attempting to\nmake him look like him. I did not get to the point in Superman where\nClark shows up in Metropolis and said \"No way, that's not Superman. I\nsaw him in an earlier scene, he's a different man. That can't be him.\"\nNo, my brain had enough about it to cope with different actors playing\ndifferent aged versions of the character. So the make-up is odd, and I\nactually found it took up more of my thoughts than the action/story\nitself.<br><br>The movie lacks anything that sets it apart. That makes it special.\nThat makes it interesting. Generic attempt at an action movie, with\nill-thought out Sci-Fi elements added as a plot driver, and poorly in\nmy opinion.\n"
"\nIt started out OK, but I lost interest in about 5 minutes. I thought\nthe idea was compelling (sending people back in time to be executed)\nbut then it got confusing to the point where it was laughable. Lots of\npeople running around shooting stupidly designed weapons. A child is\nshown getting shot, which was bothersome. The tender moments of this\nfilm are about as meaningful as a fabric softener commercial. Even the\ncars of the future are pathetic in this film. Maybe the director used\nup the budget on actors and couldn't hire anyone proficient for\nanything else. Too bad Mystery Science Theater 3000 is off the air,\nbecause it would have been perfect for this dog of a film.\n"
"\nI have just saw this movie and in rush to tell anybody that still not\nseen it please Don't... not only to save money but more important to\nnot make you angry.<br><br>How can the Director, the Writer to not use the common sense ?? It will\nnot increase cost. The movie assumes that its audience are stupid\nenough. All in all it is against common sense and the crews are\nirresponsible to spend money that way.<br><br>How can an old man from somewhere in the future bring tens mob to yhe\npast with all resources needed arrange everything but failed to kill\none person? 2009: LOST MEMORIES was superb. Looper is rubbish.\n"
"\nI made the huge mistake of ignoring the R rating and taking my 12 year\nold to this movie. That's my own stupid fault. Don't repeat my mistake\nwith your child. Or, for that matter, ANY adult, including yourself.\nThis bleak morsel of cinematic gristle will have you rummaging for your\nProzac in short order. Looper contains plenty of the usual, gratuitous\nsewage, including drug addiction, poverty, mindless sex, brutal torture\nand dismemberment, explosions and shootings. To this dog's breakfast is\nadded a liberal seasoning of F-bombs, urban blight, and telekinetic\nspecial effects. If there's any redemptive message here, it's \"get on\nyour knees and get right with Jesus, lest you end up in this living\nhell!\"\n"
"\nThe problem here is the script and overall way of telling the story,\nbecause the idea of filming point blank executions of so many\nindividual people close up and personal is too gross to handle. The\ndirector has no idea how to make a film watchable. He just causes\nstress which spoils the good bits, and in fact he makes me wonder if\nhe's a freak who needs an outlet for his sadism. I liked two things\nabout the whole film, and for their visual aesthetic only. Frankly, I\nfelt so disturbed by the idea of this being on general release and that\nI had seen it that I wished I hadn't gone to see it - and the strange\nfact that people have given it good reviews on IMDb makes me wonder if\nEVERYBODY is desensitized to extreme violence and I am the only one who\nknows that you don't have to kill and maim to make things exciting and\nfun...\n"
"\nThis movies starts as a good sci-fi entertainer, then quickly turns\ninto a romantic, save me mummy, remorse story.

"\nThis film is seriously just bad. At first you're drawn in, the concept\nthreatens to become fascinating; but it simply tumbles into an abysmal\njoke of a movie that ends with a disgusting cliché. You seriously have\nto check your brain at the door to even remotely enjoy this film. How\nit has carried an 8.2 rating here baffles me. Source Code it is not,\nInception it is not, Terminator it is not. I really worry about the\nfuture of science fiction considering how well this abomination has\ndone. Someone had the gall to call this movie this generations Matrix.\nApparently this generation is drastically dumber than mine was! Time\ntravel is a tricky thing to deal with. Taking the approach that since\nit's complex you're not even going to attempt to form continuity as\nthis film does is NOT the way to deal with that complexity.\n"
"\nWhat's the all-purpose standby time-travel plot? Yeah - guys getting\nsent back from the future to assassinate someone and alter future\nhistory. \"Looper\" comes up with an alternative: guys from the future\ngetting sent back to be assassinated by regular schmoes in the present.\nBrilliant, only maybe they didn't quite think it through, and half way\n(I'm not spoiling anything here am I?) they revert to plan A - one of\nthe guys from the future who's evaded his assassin (it's his younger\nself so he remembers it's gonna work) decides to bump off some kid\nwho's going to grow up to be Mr Nasty in the future. Not a heartwarming\nlittle angel kid of course, that wouldn't be right, not even one of\nthose cynical wise-ass sort of kids either, people love them too. What\nother sorts of kids are there? Oh yes, malevolent psycho kids with\nsatanic powers - that's our plot! Remember the first time you saw Star\nWars? It'll be like that, only more confusing. And probably less\nsequels.\n"
"\nThis is the first time I am rating a movie with 1 star.<br><br>I went to see this movie without any special expectations and was\nextremely disappointed. I wouldn't say much if the movie had several\nsimple (and expected) logical bug that are common in this kind of\nmovie, ... this movie however is way way below acceptable.<br><br>An extremely stupid story, not even remotely plausible, with extremely\nunnecessary stupid decisions made by the characters, weird movie\nmoments and of course many many logical faults.<br><br>This is an insult to our intelligence, I do hope no films like this\nwill be made again.\n"
"\nWhy what the hell !!!!after reading all of the other previews did you\nall see the same film !!!!!!Trust me ! this film is rubbish in fact\nsifting through rubbish would be more interesting, it really was a very\npoor, a used condom has more life .It would seem all of the biggest\nguns in the film world gun shed, were brought out on show in this epic\npile of nasty, I would have been more than happy to use one just to\nshoot the tiny rainmaker just to end it all... Apparently young Joe had\nto wear a false nose in the film to look like old Joe . Just wish that\nI had use of the Hollywood prosthetics's team as not to be recognized\nas I left the cinema !\n"
"\nLooper seemed to be a perfect metaphor for cycles and loops in the\nlives of many characters, and does so in such a way that's only\npossible in a film with this type of time travel. Character development\nis unique and makes you suspend some disbelief with the logic, and\ninstead slowly understand who one man is and who he is able to be. The\nmovie is paced brilliantly. The beginning of the movie is the only part\nwhere the exposition is told so blatantly, but for a movie this\ncomplicated, that's okay. The movie isn't about the future it presents.\nIt's about a man who must close the loop with his future self.\nDefinitely a new favorite.\n"
"\nI do love this movie, except for one of the biggest casting F-ups of\nall time. Who the heck thought it was a good idea to cast Paul Dano as\na hit-man? It literally drove me nuts to watch such a soft person try\nto play a hit-man. And then sure enough while they're looking for him,\nhe's crying like a little girl. There's a huge difference in the way\nJoe acts when his loop runs...\n"
"\nI really enjoyed this the second time round. The first time I was\nfairly Luke warm with it, which was at the actual theatre when it came\nout. <br><br>The world building was great, acting was super. Production values were\ngreat. His face modifications were pretty strange but the rest of the\nmovie was on point. I liked the overarching story and the question\nposed. The answer to the question via him deciding to kill himself\nafter they both finally found each other felt a bit self serving, but\nit makes for a dramatic story. <br><br>Overall, yeah - quite enjoyed it a second time round.\n"
"\nIn 2074, when the mob wants to get rid of someone, the target is sent\ninto the past, where a hired gun awaits - someone like Joe - who one\nday learns the mob wants to 'close the loop' by sending back Joe's\nfuture self for assassination. With a cast of so many talented actors\nyou would expect that Looper would turn much better unfortunately the\nmovie was boring, full of plot holes and it was just dumb i completely\nturned off my brain when Bruce Willis shot the window and i thought\nthat he was going to escape from the side where he shot it but instead\nhe broke the other half on his own it made zero sense, the same goes\nfor the ending and on top of that the movie just drugged itself so much\nit was so boring and it felt like a bad copy of Terminator, Back to the\nFuture and other way much better Science Fiction Time Traveling Films\nof the 80's and 90's. All this people that wrote reviews like \"this\nfilm it's original and fun\" it's neither original or fun it's just an\noverrated dumb sci/fi film with great talent wasted.\n"
"\nLooper is one of those movies that escaped me for too long. This movie\nis filled with complexity, and keeps you on your toes from start to\nfinish. The acting performances are absolutely stand out all round.\nJoseph Gordon-Levitt is superb, Jeff Daniels and Bruce Willis deliver\naccomplished performances and Emily Blunt is ever so slightly\nintoxicating. This feels very original, is packed with fantastic action\nand complex themes, and challenges the viewer in many ways. It doesn't\nfeel like there is a wasted moment on screen, which is testament to\nsolid direction and editing. Pierce Gagnan is also worth a deserved\nmention for his performance. A very real life take on the concept of\ntime travel, and all of the complexities and complications that would\npresumably come with it.\n"
"\n10 years ago I would have rated this lower but look at the competition.\nA lot of people giving bad reviews did not watch it or can't even\nunderstand a basic plot. Very simple, if they panned the movie and\ndidn't mention incest, I would exclude their review. Willis shoots the\nboy and Levitt gets a scar on his face. This for certain means only a\nfew minutes earlier in the movie, Joe had sex with his own mom. I did\nsubtract some points for this being a somewhat sloppy time-travel\nmovie. I do agree with other reviews that say the plot should make more\nsense. At the very least a little more work could have been put into\nthat. I did not like the ending but that is pretty common these days.\n"
"\nOf course there are plot holes - every film with time travel has plot\nholes. Deal with it. <br><br>But now we've got that out the way, this is an exciting, interesting,\nwell-acted, thoughtfully written film that mixes drama, sci-fi and\naction without getting muddled. This isn't one of those films that\nstarts with an interesting premise and then fumbles the execution (like\nSurrogates, for example). You really care for all the characters. Looks\ngorgeous, too. <br><br>Yet to see Emily Blunt or Joseph Gordon-Levitt turn in a bad\nperformance. And I like Bruce Willis and I don't care what you say. The\nonly weak link, I thought, was Jeff Daniels - too bumbling, and not\nsinister enough for a mob boss.<br><br>And while I'm on this, why don't we see Paul Dano in more films? <br><br>yetanotherfilmreviewblog.tumblr.com\n"
"\nI have seen this just last week when my buddy bought a DVD of\nthis.While we are watching the film I was pretty much smiling\nthroughout the film.The performances,the story and the direction of\nthis film is fantastic.That was my first thought/impression.The action\nisn't much in the film but it's all about the characters,I mean they're\njust interesting. The child actor isn't annoying nor weak,he did a\ngreat job and love the kid. The setting is well done also.<br><br>The 2nd time around,my feelings of the film is the same as my first\nimpression,I still love the film even though some people said it has so\nmany plot holes, Cause really I care only in this film is the\ncharacters and how good they've executed the whole film.<br><br>If you're a sci-fi film fan you'll love this.\n"
"\nPrepare to watch this film more than once. It has extremely confusing\nplot points that are rather paradoxical. If you look past some of the\nparts that do not make sense, it turns out to be a rather interesting\nfilm.<br><br>It definitely is a brutal film as well. There are some gruesome deaths\nthat are rather unnecessary. It is a fairly dark movie, and has maybe a\nlittle too much information for itself to handle. The acting is pretty\ngood though. Overall, the film is good, not great. Prepare to be\nconfused and a bit shocked when the film is over. It is a film you will\nneed to watch more than once, but you may find you are not interested\nin it enough to watch it twice.\n"
"\nGood, but not great. <br><br>Very interesting plot, Inception-like in its complexity. However, less\nthan full use is made of the ingenious concepts in the plot and the\nmovie flounders in sentimentality towards the end. Ending is not\nentirely satisfactory.<br><br>Solid performances by Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Bruce Willis and Emily\nBlunt. JG-L's performance is a bit off-putting though, due to the weird\nfacial modifications. The idea was to make him look like a young Bruce\nWillis, but it doesn't work. If anything, it's like the producers\ngrafted Daniel Craig's face onto JG-L's body. I kept expecting to see\nDaniel Craig mentioned in the credits...\n"
"\nWhat a ride and a bit of a mind screw. I can't believe I didn't catch\nthis in the theaters. it was so good. Lots of action, good storyline,\nstrong background on characters, and twists at every turn. <br><br>Good lord did they make Gordon-Levitt look like Bruce, it was almost\ncreepy how they were twins. From the makeup, to the way they walked and\ntalked. It was uncanny. <br><br>Break out star of the movie was little Cid, that kid was amazingly\ncreepy yet adorable all at the same time. You wanted to hug and protect\nhim while being scared to death of him. What a great little actor, I\nhope to see more of him in the future. <br><br>Emily Blunt awesome as always, love her. What a ride. What a wild ride.\n"
"\nSPOILER ALERT!!!! I gave it an 8 out of 10, but was split between a\nthat and a 7. It was a good film with some original ideas. I felt that\nthe acting was a little weak by all. A little uniqueness could have\nmade a big difference. The little kid had the most unique look out of\nall of them. That look in his eyes before all hell broke loose was\nconvincing, and I hope to see him in some future films. Bruce Willis'\ncharacter could of easily been replaced with any other actor. I didn't\nthink he brought anything unique to the film. Only thing he had going\nfor him is that the eyes looked like a little convincingly like Joseph\nGordon- Levitt's. Even to see that, I think you needed to look a little\nhard. Maybe squint a little. Overall, I liked what they did with the\nlittle kid, even though his powers seemed like it was stolen from\nX-Men, with the all powerful TK girl. I hope to see him again in the\nfuture.<br><br>Overall, it definitely wasn't a disappointment. Well worth a watch.\nSome good surprises, but it definitely isn't the movie of the year...\n"
"\nI so looked forward to this film, as I enjoy 'timetravel' movies. But\nafter sitting through nearly two and a half hours of this movie, I left\nrelieved it was finally finished, and bemused as to why the makers had\nchosen to have so many long boring scenes. The actors look bored most\nof the time, and there is some miscasting. Bruce Willis seems to have\nbeen cast as a lure for the paying public, whilst Joseph Gordon-Levitt\nis a dreary and unlikely action hero.<br><br>The story is puzzling, leaving more questions than answers, plus the\npremise is weak, which left me bemused and head scratching at the end.<br><br>As for entertainment, well its an OK film. The action, (though sparse)\nwill keep you watching, but at the end you will wonder why you\nbothered.\n"
"\nSelf-sacrifice is not worth it.<br><br>When i review a movie I think of it as it could actually happen( By the\nlogic of the universe that the movie is happening in) and time travel,\nno thank you, by no means could actually be real. There was nothing\nspecial about it, no outstanding performance or nothing.<br><br>The casting. This movie had Bruce Willis and Joseph what ever his name\nis. But they didn't even do that well, I expected more from them.<br><br>The locations/shots. There was no shots really outstanding or wallpaper\nworthy. I didn't even notice the locations, i guess the big field was\nthe best (background?) location.\n"
"\nI was surprised to see that this film received so many good reviews and\nhas a high overall grade. Although it wants to be an interesting and\nintelligent sci fi thriller, I think it fails that mission. I do not\nlike particularly acting as well. Although Bruce Willis is very renown\nactor, I do not like his acting or films he participates in.<br><br>In the beginning this film had some promising parts but quickly turns\ninto shooting action film. It is fine by me who likes those kind of\nfilms but I thought that this film was supposed to be a sci fi film,\nwhich only is a friction of time.<br><br>Altogether, I can freely recommend that you skip this film I barely\nwaited for its ending.\n"
"\nLooper 86<br><br>Rian Johnson did a great job of directing, catching every little detail\nand emotion to make this film great. Joseph Gordon-Levitt, one of my\nfavorite actors is great in this movie, capturing the older Joe, Bruce\nWillis, and the makeup department did a great job. The story is great\nand original, from what I've seen, in every aspect. Although there are\nsome plot holes from the time continuum concept, it is the way the\nstory goes so I accept it. The originality of 'Looper' is by far the\nbest aspect of it. It is fresh, new and exhilarating all at the same\ntime. You are back in the spot where you are trying to figure out what\nis going on and piecing the events together. You have to process what\nhappened and think about all that is going on to figure it out, and I\nenjoy doing that. Great praise and adoration for 'Looper.'\n"
"\nWatch the Korean film \"2009: Lost Memories\", Looper is plagirism right\ndown to the camera angles.<br><br>Why would they remake a film by the master and fail to credit it? The\nwhole idea behind remaking films is to remake something that was maybe\na good idea but had bad execution. The original \"2009: Lost Memories\"\nis a 10 top to bottom, story, script, action, actors, direction, why\ndid they try to remake perfection.<br><br>Danny Day lewis is good but when you start comparing him to the pain\nand anguish Min-Chu Park convaed in the Korean version there is no way\nto compare the two. Also I like Spike Lee and some of his work but he\nwas the wrong choice for this.<br><br>Still not sure who thought this was a good idea, it's like eating a\nMcRib when you can have Korean BBQ, which one sounds better to you.\nWatch the Korean version.\n"
"\nVery disappointing ending, just because Joe from the present shot and\nkilled himself preventing future Joe from killing Sarah does not\nguarantee that Seth would not grow up to be the Rainmaker, the kid had\na very short fuse. Very disappointing ending, just because Joe from the\npresent shot and killed himself preventing future Joe from killing\nSarah does not guarantee that Seth would not grow up to be the\nRainmaker, the kid had a very short fuse.

"\nLOOPER is such a refreshingly good American film that it's almost\npossible to forget that it's essentially a B-movie. The plot is based\non the idea that time travel will be invented in the future but will be\ncriminalised, so that the only people to use it are the Mafia, who send\ntheir victims back in time to be killed in the past by specialised hit-\nmen called Loopers. Once you accept that absurdity - and the presence\nof telekinetic powers - the film creates a simple but clever plot, in\nwhich one of these hit-men finds himself asked to kill his future,\nolder self. He fails and soon finds the mafia after him, whilst his\nolder self tries to hunt down the man who will kill his (their) wife in\nthe future. The future is well imagined in low key ways - unusually for\na SF flick, half the film is set in rural areas - and intelligent. What\nreally sets it apart though is the cleverness of writer- director Rian\nJohnson, who elevates what ought to be a generic B- picture through a\nmasterful use of music, writing, editing and image.\n"
"\nI wanted to stop watching \"Looper\" about a half-hour in. I stuck it out\nfor another half hour, then went and surfed the net, listening with\nhalf an ear while my wife continued to watch. (She didn't like it\neither.) <br><br>I could say many negative things about \"Looper\"--the premise was clunky\nand absurd; the pace lethargic; the plot unfocused--but what made me\nstop watching was that I simply did not care what happened. Both young\nJoe and old Joe were brutal assassins which hardly made them\nsympathetic characters. The stakes didn't seem important--they had to\nstop the villainous Rainmaker from wiping out the crime lords of the\nfuture and killing off the assassins. Making the future safe for crime\nisn't exactly an inspiring goal. Granted, old Joe wanted to save his\nwife as well, but she had hardly screen time so I didn't really care\nabout her either.<br><br>In summary: Didn't hate the villain, didn't love the hero, didn't care\nabout the outcome.\n"
"\nThe idea, to make a movie that is more romantic than the Twelve Monkeys\nand more philosophical than the Butterfly Effect is a nice try, but it\nfailed.<br><br>The time travel stories' basic problem is the paradox, what happens, if\nsomeone changes the past, and if it is even possible. In this one the\nconcept is different than the usual, and the more it is shown, the more\nmistakes come out. The story is also nonsense, the characters are not\nreal, skipping the reasonable choices. The writer didn't show the\nscript to anyone before filming?<br><br>It disappoints me, that kneading some ideas, action, drama with time\ntraveling can be called a sci-fi.\n"
"\nLooper wasn't a bad film, however it fell well short of its potential\nand no doubt falls into the category 'only watch when bored'. My\nbiggest issue with the film - aside from its climax being predictable -\nis the plot, which seemed confused and noticeably switched focus midway\nthrough the film. <br><br>Whilst I'm not against that if done correctly, it was the subsequent\nlack of character development that really made this film suffer. Most\nof Looper's characters seemed insignificant - you found yourself simply\nnot caring about them. This to my mind was caused by the surface level\nknowledge you're given throughout the film. That said I did enjoy Blunt\nand Levitt's performances, whilst Bruce Willis does what he does best.\nThe action set pieces are okay - nothing you haven't seen before - but\nare thankfully good enough to hold an audience's attention.<br><br>Overall a decent watch but nothing that will make a lasting impression.\n"
"\ni wish i could loop back in-time and not watch it, go firefly hunting,\nor feed some stray cats. this movie was retarded... i skipped through\nmost of it which may or may not make this review, a review, but: the\nwhole \"life runs in a circle\" thing as drawn at the very end of the\nmovie was a nice concept but with the plot and story board of this\nmovie... lame. the hinting of \"the ends justifies the means\" with\nkilling the children, added to the fact that the one who supposedly\ncherished life and love was the one who was carrying out this\nhorrendous escapade, was even more fuel to my fire of how... retarded\nthis movie was. i watched the preview again after i watched it... i\ndon't see a connection? someone please help me on that one..?..!\n"
"\nA young murderer called Joe lives a life of pre arranged shootings and\nwild drug parties,until one of his suddenly materialising victims turns\nout to be an older version of himself. How we know this is because\nthat's how the film has been advertised not because of any thing like a\nresemblance . Which bring us to the heart of my problem with the\nmovie,Joseph gordon levitt has been made up (badly)with a rubber nose\nand contact lenses to try and resemble a young bruce willis .They\nreally ,truly failed. Every single time I looked at the weird eyes of\nJGL it broke the reality of the film for me. Creepy, bright and totally\nout of place. oh dear I'm sure it was good other wise even if almost\neveryone in the cinema guessed the ending long before the punch. Shame\ni couldn't enjoy it felt like it was constantly holding up a sign\nsaying Sack the make up department\n"
"\nI'll confess to being very judgmental about films and TV shows. If, in\nthe first minutes, you see that the entire premise is absurd, I'm\nagainst the whole thing. From the minute you are told that people in\nthe future send their contracts back 40 years to be killed by over-paid\npeople who themselves are later killed, by themselves - the entire\nmovie goes off the rails. Once you ask yourself why they don't send\nthem back 10,000 years, or to the middle of the ocean - you're done.<br><br>All the rest, the TK, the Terminator rip-off, the \"One\" rip-off of The\nMatrix and others - well, it's just crap piled on crap. The time travel\nconcepts are ridiculous. Okay, so a guy is sent back and then his\ncurrent self is mutilated, which appear instantly on the older guy. So\nhow did he spend all those years without his limbs to be sent back\nintact? No, I call no way. Same with the ending. So young Joe kills\nhimself, which erases old Joe from the time line. So all the criminals\nhe killed and the loopers are okay now? How is the kid still wounded?<br><br>Just really lousy.\n"
"\nSeriously disagree with the many reviews trashing this movie. Yes, the\nbasic premise is idiotic- sending people back in time to be killed, but\nwatching the relationship between Gordon-Levitt and his older self\nBruce Willis is loads of fun, Gordon Levitt is becoming the go-to young\nactor for action flicks (\"Shutup, kid\")- he plays the young Bruce\nstupid: even after there is no reason to kill his older self, he keeps\ntrying as though it's a point of honor. Yes, the paradoxes of time\ntravel are unresolvable- EVERY movie has huge holes- don't let it\nbother you. It is so entertaining I saw it again 2 days later (very\nrare)- it helps to understand the convoluted plot- watching one\ntarget's fingers and limbs disappear as his younger self is butchered\nin the past is viscerally chilling, but I missed it the first time.<br><br>Emily Blunt is solid, sexy, and very credible; and Jeff Daniels has a\nmeaty role as mob kingpin manager of the past.\n"
"\nWow now this is an awesome great movie with story and action to excess\nin this futuristic mob movie. I must say first that I am a huge big\ntime fan of Django Unchained and was pleased with its Oscar win for\nbest original screenplay and than I realized \"wait a second where the\nhell is Loopers best original screenplay Oscar nomination\" I was\ncompletely shocked that it wasn't nominated a clever thriller with a\ngood screen writing.<br><br>If you haven't seen this movie yet go WATCH it now it is a very good\nmovie with the a great story to it. However if I had to say what the\nbest movies of 2013 were the following would be my list. 1.Django\nUnchained 2. Looper (didn't really get released in theaters in 2013 but\nwas considered a 2013 movie) 3. Argo 4. Seven Psychopaths 5. The Dark\nKnight Rises (how was this not nominated for an Oscar)\n"
"\nThis movie is excellent. If you enjoy Sci-Fi, mysterious, action-packed\nthrillers I highly recommend it for you. Joseph Gordon Levitt has\nsolidified himself as one of the decades most entertaining actors with\nthis film- With help from a perfectly casted Bruce Willis and all\naround great supporting actors. The TRUE thing that made this movie\nstand out from others was its creativity. Brian Johnson (The Director &amp;\nWriter) developed a whole new realm of reality where time travel\nbecomes an issue with people's improper use. The movie like a rope that\nyou keep following through twists and turns, which you later solve with\nthe awesome revelation of the mystery. If you love movies that make you\nthink creatively and cause you're imagination to run ramped, then you\nMUST check this movie out. Some movies I won't be interested throughout\nthe whole film, however this movie was different. Well done Mr.\nJohnson. Overall an excellently creative movie which will have you\nthinking afterwards (:\n"
"\nSince it's a time travel movie, I expected some sort of collision of\ncharacters across time, which of course is a theme of the story. When\nit happens however, there is nothing to indicate that it did. Couldn't\nthe character Joe have perhaps muttered what was happening so we would\nknow? Maybe discuss it with another character? Couldn't they have used\nfuture Joe that looked like present Joe? Or the same actor with aging\nmakeup? I do not like movies where you have to figure out everything.\nNo wait, Its not that I'm lazy. I can solve a mystery. I just need to\nknow what is and what is not, a clue to the mystery. If the wife and I\nare looking at each other saying \"how am I supposed to know who this\nis\", then the director has not done his job.<br><br>This not a silent picture, but it might as well be.\n"
"\n\"Looper\" cashes in some aspects that are really well executed: Gordon\nLevitt is touched with a very nuanced make up to make him look like a\nyoung Willis. Somehow the portrayal of a \"asphalt jungle\" future has\nthe condiments of other dystopian films, but fails to explain and\ndeploy the background of it and has only the immediate effect. And the\naction moments are curiously lacking in intensity, in correlating with\nthe characters.<br><br>Though it does play by the rules it pronounces; \"Looper\" seems to avoid\nanswering or even clearing the webs that form around plot holes. Time\ntravel is a bitch to treat, and the decision to let go of some key\nquestions seems like less of artistic merit and more of development\ncomfort. Why did Sara know that Joe was a Looper? Why did young Joe\nconvince himself on killing Old Joe while he could simply take the gold\nthat was already packed and safeguard his future by sparing himself? It\nfeels more like we do not care for the questions, than need to know the\nanswers.\n"
"\nSending someone you want dead back to the past is a good way to dispose\nof a body, but what if the person they send back is you?<br><br>Bruce is from the future, JGL is from the present, one's trying to\nchange his future, the other to retain his present.

"\nonce again critics have reviewed the director and not the film very\nmuch like Blink this is so overrated. funnily enough his middle film\nBrothers Bloom was better than this and Blink and yet it was ignored.\nVery little happens apart from Both Joes killing people, the time\ntravel is utter nonsense, to make the film work older Joe has to come\nback twice, and get this instead of being killed the first time so that\nhe gets the money and goes to china, he escapes the first time, then\nten minutes later for no reason the scene is repeated and this time he\nget killed, then we go back to young joe out to get and kill old joe.\nthen halfway through we go into another plot the shooting stops for a\nwhile and the film tries to get deep and serious. full or pretension\nand utterly boring.\n"
"\nThis is one of those sci-fi movies in which the plot just gets to\ncomplicated and there are too many loop holes. Bruce Willis is looking\nreally old and Joeseph Gordon Levitt is becoming a lead actor. I think\nhe is really entertaining in movies. JGL is Joe, a guy known as a\nlooper. He kills guys that are sent back from the future by the mob.\nClosing a looper is when the older looper is sent back to be executed\nby his younger self. This happens to Joe, but the older joe gets away.\nSo he needs to kill his older self before the mob kills him, why, I'm\nnot exactly sure. The older Joe is looking to kill the evil Rainmaker\nas a child. So, he has 3 kids that may be the rainmaker. And the\nyounger Joe picks the right house to begin with. So, you see how\ncomplicated this gets. So in the end the younger Joe must come up with\na plan to stop the Rainmaker from doing his evil things in the future.<br><br>FINAL VERDICT: I didn't care for it because the plot just got too out\nthere.\n"
"\nLooper has a couple of promising and intriguing scenes but stumbles on\nits lack of originality and emotion. Its characters are not very\nsympathetic and don't really have any good dialog, with the possible\nexception of Emily Blunt's self-sufficient but lonely heroine. Oddly\nenough, Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Bruce Willis play the same character,\nwhich translates to a JGL in make-up playing John McClane.<br><br>The implications of time travel make possible some disturbing things\nearly in the film as the concept is introduced, but the science stuff\nis abandoned in favor of a traditional gunman confrontation storyline.\nThere is also an unsettling kid with mighty psychic powers, a trope\nseen in many earlier films.\n"
"\nI was recommended this movie without discussion so when I was browsing\nfor something to watch and stumbled across this I figured was worth a\npunt, knowing nothing at all about it other than it involved time\ntravel.<br><br>Just to note, I am always sceptical about films or franchises that use\ntime travel. Sometimes its just an easy way to explain the\nunexplainable or, in the case of Terminator, milk a dead cow.<br><br>Anyho the plot of this film is utterly absurd, I have seen some reviews\non here that use the word clever and in all cases must strongly\ndisagree! I was constantly asking myself questions. So many questions,\ncontradictions, etc, etc... Awful Awful Awful, I mean I've seen some\nreal horrible uses of time travel and this is amongst the worst.<br><br>I give it 5 thou cos if you turn your mind off its a good action flick\nwith a stunning Emily Blunt in it.<br><br>Worth a watch if you ain't got nowt else to watch but don't expect a\nthinker.\n"
"\nI was really looking forward to this film, but I was disappointed.<br><br>Great actors. Fascinating ideas. Then it loses the plot completely.<br><br>It's like Terminator meets X-Men in a jumbled mess.<br><br>I'm surprised it's rated so highly. <br><br>It was incredibly violent, and therefore I found, unpleasant to watch,\nand there was nothing to lighten the mood--no wit, no humour, little\nhope.<br><br>I don't think the second storyline should have been introduced at all\n(the X-Men meets Terminator bit with the Rainmaker). It was a crazy\ntangent, and both ideas have been done much better in other movies.<br><br>It would have been far more interesting if they just stuck to the\noriginal Looper premise. There was plenty of potential there, but the\nfilm abandoned it instead of exploring it further. I really don't know\nwhat they were thinking.\n"
"\nI am not a fan of the movies based on the concept of time travel. A\nmain reason is that the idea of time travel in itself is based on a\nlogical flaw. This movie starts with scenes where the main character is\nin a cornfield, and shoots a guy that pops out of nowhere. And it is\nexplained that this is people from the future, that is sent back in\ntime to get shot.<br><br>I began to wonder if I would see a story that would explain this as\nlogical. Why would it be so difficult to kill a person in the future?\nIf people could in the future invent a time machine, wouldn't it also\nbe probable that they could invent a machine that could, for example,\ninstantly vaporize people (and kill people that way)? I experienced the\nmovie as just creating more and more logical flaws, ending with a so\nmassive logical flaw, that -i thought to myself: the writer must have\njust given up.\n"
"\nFirst the good stuff about this movie!!! Excellent plot!! new idea for\ntime travel... Good performance by Joseph Gordon Levitt!! New concept\nof TK which was a good treat to watch!!! I guess thats all!!! Now bad\nthings!!! 1. The design of time machine was same as a 50 year old time\nmachine movie!! 2. their vision of future is crap!! I mean seriously???\nonly thing that was modernized was flying scooters!! People kill each\nother for stealing a piece of cloth or something equally cheap!! but\nya, they still use FORD 150 truck!! WTF??? 3. Bruce Willis tried to\nact!!! the guy who looks best with guns and grenades, he was shown\ncrying like a baby after a kill which was no way decent or apt!! In\nshort, the only thing good about the movie was concept, but\npicturization was so so shabby and it always appeared as if the movie\nwas made just for sake of making it!!! Don waste your time!!!\n"
"\n1. Interracial sex/flirting, check 2. All characters are trash,\nHollywood's war on morality. Check. 3. Terrible action sequences with\none guy beating up 4 by himself, no problem, no reality. Check. 4. No\nkids. Remember. Hollywood hates kids, especially white people's kids.\nKids die but no one has kids. Ya no one has kids over 30 years DUH.\nCheck. 5. China is the center of the world in the future. Where they\npay slave wages and have forced abortions. FU Hollywood. 6. People\nwhisper and then there are loud explosions. Over and over. Annoying as\nhell. 7. The Asian woman cleans up the loser druggie man. Men are kids,\nand helpless, and bad. Women are wise leaders. 8. Another ripoff remake\nas others have pointed out. Made worse. 9. Weak ending. Shouldve paid\nthe writers during the writer's strike. 10. \"Organized crime\" and not\nfascist police states like what America is turning into, is somehow the\nthing to worry about in the future.\n"
"\nKilling children in movies for the shock value like this is\nunforgivable. In this movie it actually adds nothing to the plot or to\nthe movie as a whole. Its simply Bruce Willis shooting an innocent\nchild. I really liked the concept of the movie and at points it was\nclever but it is completely ruined by such a shock value stunt. Im\nactually quite surprised that this film in the uk is only a 15 because\nof this. My additional comments on this movie is that the young bruce\nwillis character played by Joseph gordon levitt is just not believable\nwhich is disappointing as he was excellent in the movie brick which was\nalso directed by rian johnson and is a really great film. It was by\nwatching brick that made me want to see more of this directors work but\nnow i am completely put off.\n"
"\nMany flaws in the storyline. Extremely violent with no real meaning to\nthat. Movies like this one destroy everything Philip K Dick has\nachieved for Science Fiction. Don't watch it if you don't want to waste\nyour time. Actions of many characters are either not understandable or\nsimply stupid. e.h. why do loopers flee from their young alter ego\ninstead of cooperating with it. the worst point is the violence - if\nyou want to see people shot, tortured, mutilated, this movie is right\nfor you. subjects like telekinesis are added like ingredients to a\nfailed salad dressing - without any idea behind it. very shameful\naltogether. a plot like this shoud not be produced these days.\n"
"\nThe many reviews praising Looper as \"intelligent\" misled me to expect\none of those very rare things in Hollywood: a consistent, coherent\ntime-travel film. But in fact this movie makes little more sense than\nBack to the Future. While I can forgive time-travel nonsense in\nfrivolous films like Back to the Future, it is excusable in a film like\nLooper with pretensions of seriousness. The basic premise, about\nlooping and \"closing your loop\", is quite clever and got my hopes up.\nBut the plot soon descends into stupidity -- the explanation of\nmemories given by Bruce Willis's character is especially dumb.<br><br>Film-makers should be forced to read some philosophy of time travel\n(e.g. the excellent work of David Lewis), and to demonstrate they have\nunderstood it, before they are let near a time travel story.<br><br>For a consistent time travel film (starring Bruce Willis), I recommend\n12 Monkeys -- so much better than this loopy rubbish.\n"
"\nConfusing and unconvincing storyline, that never really gets\nstarted,just kind of limps along and never builds a sense empathy\nbetween the audience and the characters. This is probably because\nthere's no meaningful background established to the key players - who\nwere they and how did they end up in this situation isn't focused upon.\nThe movie also has sections of unnecessary repetition, when they simply\ncould have fast forwarded in time to 30 years later. The actions scenes\nare restrained in terms of visual impact, while there's little or no\nhumor and no opportunity for the actors to shine.No captivating or\nspecial moments or even scenes where there was a glimmer of something\nmore inspiring, intriguing or interesting.\n"
"\nMy enjoyment of this film was marred by its time travel plot holes.<br><br>Spoiler alert! Firstly, the whole premise of the film is flawed. Why\nwould gangsters send people to be killed back in time only 30 years,\nsurely it would be better to send them back to the time of the\ndinosaurs? Secondly, why send them back alive, why not shoot them first\nthen send them back in time? Also, when they send the looper back in\ntime to be killed, why on earth would you send them back to be killed\nby themselves in the past? That is just asking for trouble - send them\nback to be killed by someone else.<br><br>And when the young version of the main character carves a message for\nhis future self in his arm, his future self only sees it at that exact\nmoment - surely he would have had it carved in his arm for 30 years.<br><br>When he shoots himself at the end, his future self vanishes. That would\nmean that everything that had happened in the movie couldn't have\nhappened, because he wouldn't have existed to come back in time, so his\nyounger self wouldn't have shot himself.\n"
"\nLooper had a good potential story wise. The script seemed interesting,\nbut ultimately the movie is disappointing, riddled with incoherences,\nthe most shocking one being the end of the movie itself.<br><br>The first half is too speedy and kind of muddled, therefore pretty hard\nto follow and understand all the the whys and wherefores. On the other\nhand, the second part is weirdly slow and the film loses all its\nintensity, especially once Young Joe meets Sara.<br><br>The direction is below average, the lighting being pretty bad with a\nlot of halos and a few very dark scenes. JGL is barely recognizable\nwith all the makeup and Rian Johnson certainly didn't need to be that\ndrastic to make them look alike.\n"
"\nDreadful film dealing with mobsters sending their victims back in time\nto be done away with.<br><br>Bruce Willis is one such victim, with his oriental wife taking a fatal\nbullet in the stomach. How he wants her back to life, that's the reason\nfor his actions in this absolutely miserable film.<br><br>His younger side meets a woman at a farmhouse whose child is the\nRainmaker. The latter shall change things around immensely, providing\nthat he grows up.<br><br>How did Jeff Daniels ever sign on to such a stinker of a film? He is\nthe head of the gang, ruthless, full of hair and just plain quite eerie\nto look at.<br><br>The film is violent at every turn. Willis attempts to kill all 3 young\nboys as he suspects that one of them is Rainmaker.<br><br>Simply awful. Must avoid film for people of all ages.\n"
"\nI'm just as much of an advocate of the First Amendment as anyone, but\nI'd just as soon that they circle file this movie, despite any\nredeeming virtues that it may or may not have, given its depictions of\nDELIBERATE GUN VIOLENCE DIRECTED AT CHILDREN!<br><br>I'm just as much of an advocate of the First Amendment as anyone, but\nI'd just as soon that they circle file this movie, despite any\nredeeming virtues that it may or may not have, given its depictions of\nDELIBERATE GUN VIOLENCE DIRECTED AT CHILDREN!<br><br>I'm just as much of an advocate of the First Amendment as anyone, but\nI'd just as soon that they circle file this movie, despite any\nredeeming virtues that it may or may not have, given its depictions of\nDELIBERATE GUN VIOLENCE DIRECTED AT CHILDREN!\n"
"\nI had high expectations on the movie being a big fan of sci-fi genre.\nIt started pretty well setting expectations high, then follows a series\nof mediocre actor's play, copy-paste from other movies -\nTerminator/Signs style and such (missing the originality). The movie\nlacks charm and feels like multiple pieces put together - dialogs feel\nto be taken from elsewhere (other movies), character's act in a\nextremely foreseeable way, like you know what they are going to say or\ndo. There are movies with lower quality of play and direction so this\none i would put as mediocre. I personally wondered whether to stop it\nand watch something else couple of times. If you have no special demand\nfor quality, fun and original movie that would bring you pleasure from\nwatching - you can try to watch this one.\n"
"\nThe premise for this film was interesting, but unfortunately, it was\nyet another example of lazy sci-fi writing, where the opportunity to\nconsider the implications of the initial concepts are soon thrown aside\nin favor of some fairly dull action sequences.<br><br>SPOILER - In the end, some kid with superpowers ( Damon character from\nthe Omen) defeats the combined talents Bruce Willis (doing his Pulp\nFiction hit-man character) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt ( doing his Bruce\nWillis from Pulp Fiction character), because Gordon-Levitt's character\nfinally realizes the writer didn't have enough imagination to find a\nplot device which would end the story in a satisfactory manner, so he\njust blows his own brains out. It was great acting, because by that\npoint in the film,I was really starting to feel the same way.\n"
"\nThe movie is a bit of a mixture of styles and paces. Some Inception,\nsome Die Hard, some Damien Omen. From futuristic cities to tenements to\nShanghai. Maybe that is a good thing so that everyone can find some\nmoments they enjoy. But in the end this movie is only partially\nsatisfying.<br><br>The first half hour is quite confusing. The silly shootings to close\nthe loop are irritating. The thing about time travel movies is they\nhave to be told simply and chronologically or you end up with a big\nmess. Of course no time travel story can make complete sense. This one\ntries to leave some things tied up but it still doesn't make enough\nsense.<br><br>JGL and Bruce play the same person 30 years apart. JGL's makeup to look\nlike Bruce was unnecessary and distracting. Emily Blunt is a bit too\nsophisticated looking for her role.<br><br>Not a must see.\n"
"\nI love SF and time travel movies and I like Bruce Willis so I thought\nthis might be a good movie to catch. Boy was I wrong. This movie is\ndumb from beginning to ending. It has no redeeming characters to attach\nyourself too and it is excessively violent especially toward young\nchildren. I find it hard to believe that critics and others liked this\nridiculous premise of a film. I wanted to get up and leave but I was\nhalf hoping that the movie would get better or at least amount to\nsomething in the end. Sadly it just continued on with needless\nexposition and a ridiculously predictable ending. I wish I had my 1hr\nand 58 minutes back.\n"
"\nI wasn't the only one to scoff at this scene but I probably was the\nonly one to walk out. Being that there was to be at least one other\ninstance of this, I had no choice. I have a problem with shoot 'em up\nbang-bang films to begin with. Death and destruction are just not\nentertaining to me. Not that I watch the news but how about Hollywood\ngiving us something that the public can't see 3x a day on television.\nAnd exactly which one is feeding the other? I wasn't always this\nsensitive but I'm wise enough now to see what's wrong - and that is\nclearly THE MEDIA. Joseph Gordon-Levitt is a great actor and he's very\neasy on the eyes. Making him up to look like a younger Bruce Willis,\nhowever, wasn't so easy to watch. As far as overall plot, this one is a\npredictable/ \"Have I seen this before?\" snoozer.\n"
"\nOn the surface this is a great movie. Interesting plot and great acting\nmake for an enjoyable movie experience.<br><br>That is unless you give any critical thought to the story line. From\nthe very beginning you are presented with a constant stream of time\ntravel errors and poor choices by the characters. I found it difficult\nto sit back and enjoy this film while contemplating problem after\nproblem.<br><br>While this movie has some action, it isn't as much as you would expect\nfrom a movie staring Bruce Willis. For this type of movie, I think it\nwas an appropriate amount.<br><br>I give this movie a six because everything but the story line is great,\nI'd recommend waiting until it's out on DVD, and rent it.\n"
"\nTo each their own is true but I have not been so bored by a sci-fi\nmovie, in a LONG time. I kept waiting for there to be plot. A story.\nSomething that kept me guessing. This movie never had a point. Unlike\nmany, I thought the make-up to make GL look like Bruce, was amazing.\nYou didn't see the resemblance, until Bruce finally enters the picture.\nThe movie is one big circle. The circle is ended leaving you thinking,\nwhat was the purpose?(spoiler) One interpretation could be the dough\nleft in the end, is what funded the little guy to become he he did. I\nam not here to pretend I am some great movie critic. This is only the\nsecond movie I have ever taken the time to write about. It is so others\ndo not waste their money or lower at least, their expectation.\n"
"\nThis film was a major disappointment. The trailer is promising.The idea\nis interesting, and the quality of picture is good. Bruce Willis is in\nit so you would expect a decent action film. So I went to check it out.\nThe beginning was alright, action, everything makes sense. But then, in\nthe middle of the movie it changes from action film to a boring not\nmaking any sense drama. It's like the director forgot what movie he was\nmaking and started making something else. Bruce Willis's character\nkills kids randomly, who the heck came up with that idea? At some point\nwhile the movie was still going I wanted to leave the cinema, it was\nthat bad. Don't get dazzled by the trailer and don't go watch this\nmovie.\n"
"\nI didn't really have any expectations before watching this film. I had\na rough idea of the synopsis but other than that, I didn't know too\nmuch about it.<br><br>After having watched it, all I can say is that it is one of the best\nfilms I've seen that's been made over the last decade or so. It's\nintelligent, well directed and well acted. <br><br>After having a brief look at the user ratings, it looks like the film\ndivides opinion. Some of the very negative reviews have mentioned plot\nholes. But that didn't spoil my enjoyment of this film. It pulled me in\nfrom the first minute to the very last and every minute in between was\na blast.<br><br>10/10 and I can't wait to watch it again.\n"
"\nI thought this movie was pretty good. It's interesting, with a very\nintriguing concept. At some points it can get slightly confusing, but\nstill nowhere as confusing as Inception. That is just way too much\nconfusing-ness for one movie. <br><br>This movie is based in 2074 and twenty years or so earlier, where\neverything is different. When the mob wants to get rid of someone, the\ntarget is sent to the past, where a hired gunman waits and then takes\nthem out. Joe discovers that when the mob wants to \"close a loop\" they\nsend the future self back to the past for execution. Joe finds himself\nseeing his future self in front of him, but is unable to kill him.\nWhich throws everything out of whack.<br><br>Overall, I give this movie a 7 out of 10, which in my ratings book is:\nGreat.\n"
"\nWatched Looper Featuring Joseph Gordon-Levitt(The Dark Knight Rises) as\nYoung Joe/Narrator , Bruce Willis(Die Hard With A Vengeance) as Older\nJoe ,The Lovely Emily Blunt(Young Victoria) as Sara, Paul Dano(Cowboys\n&amp; Aliens) as Young Seth,Frank Brennan(The Vampire Dairies) as Old\nSeth,Noah Segan(Fanboys) as Kid Blue, Piper Perabo(The Prestige) as\nSuzie, Tracie Thomas(The Devil Wears Prada) as Beatrix ,Xu Quing(Life\non A String) as Joe's Wife ,Pierce Gagnon(One Tree Hill) as Cid,\nGarrett Dillahunt(Raising Hope) as Jesse and Jeff Daniels (The Purple\nRose Of Cairo) as Abe . The film is awesome as it Incorporates Time\nTravel with the criminal underworld also it is brilliantly shot and\nwell told also Amazing Performances from Levitt,Blunt and Willis\nAmazing Score By Nathan Johnson(The Brother Bloom) and Writing\nDirection By Rian Johnson(Brick) Amazing Take on Time Loops 9/10\n"
"\nA modern Bruce Willis performance I actually liked. Imagine that.\nLOOPER's got a sweet time-travel hook, but it's the unwavering love\nangle the really deepens things. I can honestly say I had no idea where\nthings were going with this movie, and I like the ultimate direction it\ntook. I can see why people are impressed by Rian Johnson; the man's got\nvision and the makings of a great filmmaker. A little too much lens\nflare, although not to J.J. Abrams levels of excess. Nice eye candy\nhere too, with the pretty ladies; the foxy Piper Perabo and\nball-busting hayseed Emily Blunt. And even though the eyebrows are\nridiculous, Joseph Gordon-Levitt does a great job of mimicking Willis'\nmannerisms. Not to mention anchoring the whole movie.<br><br>7/10\n"
"\nfrom logic burps and flat-out absurdity, but I did like this one more\nthan most. Bruce Willis really sells the concept, as he does in the\nmuch different, and better, time-travel film \"12 Monkeys\". He doesn't\nresemble Gordon-Levitt very much, but the latter does a nice job\nmimicking Willis's by-now-familiar mannerisms so we don't notice their\nphysical dissimilarities.<br><br>Emily Blunt's performance stands out to me. The scene on the porch\nwhere she's smoking a make-believe cigarette (presaging a later\npost-coital scene) is a nice touch. Jeff Daniels is the least menacing\ncrime boss I can recall, but he somehow pulls it off.<br><br>Really fine cast, and a plot that doesn't have as many holes as most of\nthe genre.\n"
