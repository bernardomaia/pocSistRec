felt compelled to sign up and write this like others as this movie just does not do what it says on the tin
all the critics reviews pointed to this film being fantastic the best bond ever
well its not
far from it i dont know if other movie watchers are saying its good because the critics say its wonderful so it must be good isnt it
this is not a bond movie its not even a good actiondrama movie
ive heard the reviews for taken 2 it sounds awful but i think i might go and see it the critics have got this so wrong
skyfall has a poor script and plot that is sidelined half way through the film
no gadgets no bond girls no exotic locations the whole film looked like it was shot in sd quality it was so grey and murky
this was the first bond movie ive seen at the cinema since thunderball yes that years ago i usually watch movies on dvdbluray but felt because of all the hype that skyfall would be worth going to see
well its not save your money and wait till its on tv at least you can record it and ff the boring parts
skyfall is a special james bond movie
suddenly there was a 964 astin martin and bond said were going back in time to m thats very neat
the story line has a car chase near the beginning bonds obituary shown in the trailer so no spoiler intended
there is bonds road to recovery and testing
bond thinks he passed by the skin of his teeth
the villain brags that bond failed all of the tests range psychological medical other
the bottom line is that the head of british intelligence saw bond as fit for the field
the screenplay is very good
one of my james bond short stories was called golden train with a fight on the top of a train tunnel and a sniper aiming at the train written in 2010
commander james bond celebrate 50 years of the bond movie franchise with style the most successful movie franchise ever
skyfall is loaded with jawdropping awesome stunts and special effects one of the most beautiful and tragic bond girls everthe stunning baranice marlohe and a brilliant theme song from the fabulously talented adele and producer paul epworth lushly orchestrated by j
a
c
redford
there is sizzling homo erotic tension between daniel craigs perfect bond and javier bardems silva a villain the likes of which have never been seen in this franchise
dame judi denchs marvelous m is set up for retirement from the onset of the film
dench who has portrayed m for seven bond filmsa record is given the screen time she deserves to honor her character
while craigs casino royale remains my favorite with its bloody and raw portrayal of the spy business and most tender bond romance since on her magestys secret service skyfall is full and satisfying and among the best films of its kind released this season
if you have ever watched the classic bonds then you will agree with my rating
if you have not then you dont know what a real bond movie is and should watch them before you watch this
story drops off somewhere in the movie and then is gone
q really an emo q get outta here with that
kill off m well another mistake
daniel craig is well
oh yea james bond does not drink heineken
license to kill was the last great bond yes i know who played bond but this was the last of the true bond style
pierce did an ok job but sometimes you just gotta stop a movie or series being made and give up being greedy ms
broccoli
overall i will continue to enjoy my old bond movies and plan to never watch anything produced with the motive of greed over quality in the james bond films
unlike other reviewers i found nothing to recommend this movie at all
the plot was poor and dialogue such as it was was hopeless the acting stilted and suspense nonexistent
you can usually tell within a minute or two of whether a film will be worth watching and this one was firmly in the no basket
so what did we get
it started with a whole lot of routine chase stuff culminating in bond falling apparently dead into a river where were treated to some geewhizz underwater shots of his drowning
next second hes walking smartly down the corridors of power fresh as a daisy
how did this happen
was it with a bound he was free the classic text so beloved of scriptwriters whove boxed their star into a corner
it didnt get any better
i kept looking at my watch hoping it would end soon
the early bond movies had style
this one was a waste of space
ive awarded it a 110 but would happily give it no marks at all
im not good speech writer and tell shortly
this film is shame of bondiada
i see all series of 007 but this is real trash
start scene middle and final dont have any normal connection and also to much cyber and nothing bond style
stupidest q in previews series never see bustardes this q albert broccoli and ian fleming must be turning in their graves shame on you
there are so many reasons why this doesnt deserve to be mentioned in the same breath as dr no goldeneye or casino royale
skyfall was boring from the beginning to the near end
hope next film if you make will be much better but dont make skyfall style this film if its possible to call part of bondiada is real shame
wish you write better script for next thats all
very disappointed in this poor excuse of a bond film
i never write reviews on movies in fact this is my first time but because this movie was so lame i just had to warn all the other bond fans
there is no plot no cool gadgets that a new young q gives him
money penny is not the same color bond has sex with a sex slave girl just for her to g get shot 5 minutes later and doesnt act like he even cared
i demand my 25 back and want to be reimbursed for my time and gas
i know there isnt much to write or make movies about these days but you people need to be more creative
no 007 can get shot off a moving train and fall like 150 and live
he is not super human and there was no explanation of what happened
this will be the last bond film i see until i read better reviews
i was incredibly disappointed with skyfall
the plot felt weak as there where way to many plot holes
i hate the hacker magic that some movies bring
yes its a neat element but in this movie it went way to far
too many times i felt bored checking my watch and it was hard for me to believe this was a bond film
some aspects i did like the scene where n meets q and he reveals his true appearance haunted me and made me squirm in my seat
the scene where you hear the english rock coming from a speaker and find out its a helicopter added a great fear element to make this one of the best siege scenes ive ever seen
i liked q as a villain and his performance and those two scenes made this a solid 5 for me
are you nuts
superb
wow
what is this
7
8 in imdb
who writes these reviews
bond movie without gadgets
bond movie without feeling
bond movie without proper script
bond movie with worst gay villain ever
bond movie with worst act ever
bond movie with about 20 minutes of action and the rest is just boring stuff
come on
two hours and 20 minutes for this foolishness
what they were thinking
i am a hardcore bond movies fan and i always have enjoyed his movies
i thought son connery and roger moore were the best actors
dont get me wrong i liked very much casino royale and daniels graig performance
quantum of solace was mediocre but skyfall is by far the worst highbudget movie ever
not only for a bond movie anyway if you are a bond fan i suggest you skip this movie period
the only thing that counts is the opening title scene and adeles song
technically stunning but it simply does not work as it used to do
too many meaningless killings and the humor is totally absent
everything is simply very serious and i really missed all the funny small catchy scenes that has characterized former james bond movies
i do not understand the psychology of the badass villain certainly not his homoerotic appearance apparently all his killings were not enough to make him sufficiently psychopathic
i usually love badem and dinch  but honestly here their acting is far from their usual standards
i guess i must blame the directing that has focused on shootings and explosions and missed the story
mr sam mendes has had the nerve to take one of the cinemas biggest money  spinners andwellspin it
in doing so he has made the first james bond film that can stand on its merits and not merely drape itself round a carefully staged star performance
certainly mr d
craig is more than adequate as oo7albeit a slightly diminished 007a bit worn round the edgesbut he is not meant to dominate skyfallneither does he
instead mr mendes uses an ageing bond as a discourse on acknowledging the past and accepting that actions have consequences
in addition to this new reading of a very familiar character he has brought joined  up film  making to the franchiseduring the course of which there are many joyous references from the lady from shanghai to indiana jones that had me laughing with delightnot a reaction one has come to expect a bond filmhowever slickto produce
miss j
dench  a bruised and vulnerable m gives her best film performance for some time
skyfall gives force to the argument that film is a directors medium
there are so many issues with this film it isnt funny
first on the train when bond is shot why doesnt the agent empty the rifle on the enemy she missed
silly
in the casino bond loses his gun but after getting back to the top of the bridge walks away without picking up the pistol
how could the antagonist escape from his glass enclosed prison
the scene at ms hearing with the shootout was silly
the antagonist couldnt escape that
the showdown at skyfall was equally silly
good effects but stupid
even if m could escape to the chapel she would obviously hide and the grounds keeper would get several shots off
the antagonist would have killed m upon site without the drama
and bonds killing him was silly
this movie is at best a b movie with effects
a truly terrible bond film
it lacks a real plot which is known for bond movie
sometimes its really boring as when shaving of bond by eve
it is really a gun fighting even some tv serials are better
it lacks the magnificent sets that are usually there
no real story line
action sequences at the start are good
moonracker is better than this movie
the villain puts out stunts from not known things
daniel greg is good
lack story
expect better from bond movie
for the 50th bond movie it is not as expected
even the burn notice tv serial is better watching
sometimes it is too slow for a bond movie
lots of gun fighting
the escape of villain from prison is also is very unrealistic
i tried to like it but the plot had more holes than homeland and that is saying something
it is as if it was written by the baddie silva as he seems to know every move and every turn in advance
when he pops out of the tube station a car just happens to pull up for him right on time
there is more chance of him winning the lottery
everything is just so right on time
if he was that smart why didnt he go straight to his intended victim instead of wasting two hours of my time in the cinema
how come we have a spaniard working for m15 for queen and country
maybe his parents were british
if you have seen the movie just think about it
there were bits of plot just stuck in there for the sake of action all the way along
if you were going to assassinate somebody you would not kill everyone you met in the building on the way to your target
not very professional
it is the last bond movie i will pay to see
my first viewing of skyfall left me a little frustrated at the slow pace in the first half
however the story did catch speed in the second and by the end i felt it was overall slightly better than casino royale
on reflection  however there was a lot to appreciate from this bond movie
an ageing james bond  with his powers in apparently terminal decline refuses to give up against all the odds even against a fitter though older  villain
a lot of the action is without any fancy gadgets
similarly ms unwavering belief in bonds ability to do his bit when the time of reckoning comes is commendable
the reference to lord alfred tennysons ulysses was heart touching and remains my favourite scene from the movie
the movie showcases bond as a human being first and a secret agent next and shows a human side of him which many thought never existed
the movie has a lot apart from just action sequences  which are aplenty  mind you and that makes me feel in retrospect that this is the best bond movie i have seen in my lifetime have only seen them in the last decade
this movie has so little to do with the original bond series and ian fleming would not only roll over in his grave but come back to haunt the current franchise owners and screenwriters himself
this movie left everyone shocked at how boring and unauthentic this bond flick could be
i left and went to bathroom and missed nothing at all the plot has so many loose ends and clichas it sickened me
the writers have killed bond as we know him and everything that makes james bond the cool spy we grew to love
the only thing in the movie i liked was the house and the dogs
no gadgets no bond car no bond girl no suspense no twists no action
a complete waste
i will never see another bond release again
go buy the old series on dvd or see another movie
i grew up with bond from dr no to die another day and will no doubt watch all the iterations again when shown on tv
this changed with casino royale
gritty yes like the everyday world around us
bond was escape
now no more humour no more wit no more charm
at the time of quantum of solace i didnt even know there had been another bond movie with daniel craig
i was surprised to see it on tv for the first time
it wasnt that good but it was somewhat entertaining the first time around
then came skyfall and its nonsense scenario
i saw this in the theatre and wondered about the pointless action the silly hacking the plot holes
when it came on tv a few months back i didnt even bother to watch it again
and i sure wont go for the upcoming spectre
i agree that bond had to be updated but broccolis new bond is an ageing creep a killing machine matching those he used to fight against in previous films
rest in peace james bond
you will be missed
skyfall the third movie starring daniel craig as bond is a sequel made to be just as compelling as the older movies but nevertheless skyfall ignores the events of casino royale and quantum of solace and takes place sometime later
the events of the last two movies are nonexistent in this followup as there is no given detail of what had happened thereafter
nevertheless skyfall manages to tell a new story in bonds life and this sequel really explores the character both physically and emotionally which wasnt really done a lot in the older movies
the well written script and action sequences are terrific but towards the second half of the movie story becomes very weak but there is enough throwbacks and an explosive actionpacked finale to get viewers attention and the lust for another bond sequel
i am a huge bond lover
i have been watching bond movies since the beginning
but this one was not good in almost every aspect
the older bond movies had that it appeal
they had great writing believable stories and truly sinister villains
this bag of pooh was too long the story was awful and the main villain was not well acted and not scary
least i forget that the new q is like 15 years old and should be playing with tonka toys instead of government gadgets
i really hope they stop making these abominations
the bond series has not been good since goldeneye
i confess that i am not a bond fanatic but in recent decades i saw them on tv and the life of a secret agent remains interesting phenomenon
that is why i was surprised at how much i look forward to the skyfall brilliant actors a brilliant director a a decent screenwriter
its always big bangtype start because they wanted to raise up the blood pressure of viewers and they use it thousands of scenarios
james bond  survived the unimaginable
never mind i thought it starts up and begins the film
well it would not start
we see the new center a description of the mission he came to the mission but throughout i thought something was wrong
the film is slow the scenes are long and onesided
here let me tell you i did not like the story i did not like the way the film is sometimes slowed down
all together i did not like it
i wish there was a 0 rating
confusing meaningless plot
are all brits terse and sarcastic all the time
judy dench is always good but she cant save this shipwreck
good thing i saw it on amazon prime
id have walked out of the theater after paying 10
the coloring is inconsistent making it irritating
there is no wit and charm
just drivel dialogue until the next shoot out
save your viewing time and watch an old lassie
youll get something out of that at least
i did like the use of the old astin martin
and they played some of the old bond music themes
be thankful for small mercies
too many scenes where there is no movement on the screen and silence
the only thing bond about this flick are the incidentals his name is bond he works for mi6 etc
everything else feels generic
honestly i tried to give craig a shot i really did but i shut this and casino royale off halfway through
theres just nothing there to hold your interest
the plot is near nonexistent if its in thereits so drawn out and disjointed you just stop caring
the characters are forgettable if not down right despicable
the action is nothing you cant see in a thousand other flicks
i get that they wanted to humanize bond make it more believable but all they did is suck the life out of it
go watch a bourne flick if you want drama and grit
this has none
so hard to come to terms that this was a subpar movie at best
after casino royale and qos i was expecting at least an average movie
where to begin
spoilers coming him dying in the beginning with no explanation how he came back spending so much time on dialog that doesnt advance the plot a random scene with a random woman in bed for about 30 seconds killing the next bond woman without even any hint of sadness a horriblyhorribly predictable final bad guy battle
i could go on and on
just so disappointed
im at a loss for how anyone could fully enjoy this movie
honestly youd be much better off just watching casino royale again
i dont write reviews its my 1st review about any moviei think bonds movies are somehow different than any hollywood action moviesthis character contains its own charisma and actionwhich isolates him with any other traditional action hero of hollywoodbut after watching sky fall with a rating of 8
110 i started to think why this movie got 8this is a traditional hollywood action movie but it got something more special that it has no story at alldanial craig is pathetically wasted in this movie
bond without gadgets is not bondstop making bond movies but dont dont make deteriorate this charismatic character in the hands of such franchises which know how to deal with a bond movie
nonsense from start to finish
nothing makes much sense
if you like a movie that simply has everyone running and jumping aimlessly a villain that is laughable everyone is a complete idiot and incompetent and absolutely no plot this is the movie for you
one of the absolutely worst bond movies ever
only thing worse would be to bring back roger moore
wait for the dvd or stream it to your iphone still a waste of time and money
next up for bond
a mad plumber plans to clog all the toilets in london
by using non flushable wipes
yikes
only bond can stop him and his evil plumber apprentice henchman
im not one to give single star ratings just to lower an imdb average but i was really tempted in this case
i have never seen so many plot holes and idiotic contrived twists in such an expensive production before
with so many brilliant screenwriters in hollywood one just has to wonder how they could screw this up so badly
the premise was cool the execution terrible
suspending disbelief is one thing being asked to ignore your brain completely is another
great job guys the way this is going the next bond film will only be watchable by school children
even the action scenes were boring but that wouldnt matter if the film wasnt riddled with so many come on now why
moments
to top everything off you have the least desirable bond girl of all time and a mannipeni you couldnt care less for
this is a dark bond film but not as gritty sophisticated and elegant as casino royale
its been a big let down since the reboot of casino royale
quantum of solace and skyfall are just awful
there are so many flaws in the plot and the bond feeling just isnt there
the storyline overall is a very clicha and ive never been so bored from watching a bond movie
craig makes a great bond and casino royale is easily one of the best bond movies
but i think theyve been just hiring the wrong directors since then
the cinematography is great but the direction isnt clear action is subpar and the character development especially the villain just isnt there
they might need to bring back martin campbell to revive the series
i have no idea how the heck this movie got so many positive reviews from so called professional critics
i had to review this movie
i just dont understand why is it getting good votes if every single person i speak to is hating it
bond movie has a very specific formula attractive and british agent womaniser heartbreaker funny with subtle sense of humor
awesome cars latest gadgets and great plot it has to start with the best graphics and music has to have at least a super sexy bond girl and a super sexy bad girl
skyfall should be rather called skyfaill
no girls no gadgets no cars
boring
you gave us a radio trackerfist size  and a fingerprint gun
seriously
i love bond movies wasnt impressed by casino royale thought quantum of boredom
oops of solace was bad but this really beats them all
bond movie just died can it get any worse
casino royale compared to this was a masterpiece
dont waste time or money to watch it at movies
btw they even managed to have a black moneypenny
why dont we make naomi campell play liza taylor rite
i thought this bond movie was going to be one of the best ive ever seen
craig as ever fits the role really well
plenty of action and suspense from the very start with a good plot
but
after about an hour things start to go downhill
the end scene was one of the more disappointing that ive seen in a bond film
m gets far too involved in this movie
dench acts as craigs side kick getting into almost as much of the action as bond himself does
way over the top
lets be realistic
would a high ranking middle class female civil servant based in westminster really go around shooting guns at arch villains
m needs to get back into hisher office where they belong
where was the beautiful bond girl that bond needed to protect in the final scene
the final scene has plenty of action but the scenario was corny
worth a watch but you may at the end be a little disappointed
i saw this movie two weeks before
i was expecting continuation of casino royal and quantum of solace
there was no connection to previous one what happened to the previous one
truth is it didnt even look like bond movie
the beginning was good then the movie is completely lost actually it became ordinary villain try to revenge the boss who made his life terrible and the hero bond
tried to stop and fails
the worst seen is the bond crying so touching what is he aim for the oscar
i think they made this film just to introduce new m moneypenny and the scientist guy i dont recommend any one to see this movie
if you want waste your time and money go and see it
the worst bond movie ever
the plot is absurd and you have to check your brains at the door
this movie was so bad i signed up for imdb just to warn someone do not see this move unless you want to be even more bored
there were so many scenes that defy reality i dont know where to start
im not talking about ordinary reality
i mean the world of bond reality
i was surprised they didnt give him a time machine and star trek teleporter to get around beam me to china scotty
they could have put a few martian bad guys and you wouldnt have known the difference
this movie was about the money hollywood makes from bond movies
i just cant believe this movie got an 8 out of 10
is the public really this stupid or were a lot of people paid to write how great this movie was
i wish i were a real critic so that i give justice in describing this mess
ill just say if you watch it you were warned
first time i saw skyfall i found it boring and i fell asleep but the 2nd time i watched it it was pretty good but not the best bond film ever made in my list of good bond movies sure yes but better than casino
hell no
there are some pretty laughable scenes in this movie when he gets shot and falls into the water that is funny i wonder why he didnt shot moneypenny when he saw her
anyways i think this movie had everything that you need to watch in a film like this action suspense and great villains and a good script it never reaches the heights of the first film but its still a great bond film
lets hope spectre is as good as this and the last 2
the first craigbond movies were a breathtaking wonderful departure from the cartoon history which preceded them where the bad guys were deliberately unbelievable
suddenly with casino royale we begin to pull back the veil of a global organization which actually undeniably exists google bilderber group the trilateral commission
the next movie carried the investigation further exposing the determination to control the worlds water supply
one has only to pick up documentaries such as blue gold and water to realize the truth of these dangers
then suddenly weare back to comic figuresa totally unbelievable character an embittered exagent who has somehow amassed the money necessary to finance his incredible obsession for revenge against m
what bilge
give us back the bond with the courage to engage in real world challengesnot more batman
the movie world is full to brimming with action packed makebelieve cop storiesgive us something with credibility in itor has the bond franchise been taken over by the organization it was exposing
honestly i havent been a big fan of 007 in the recent years
in my opinion ever since daniel craig joined the franchise there hasnt been a single 007 movie to would come anywhere close to those made back in the day which were entertaining fun and enjoyable
and its not just because craigs portraying of bond is totally different from what the previous ones used to be wit handsome and full of irony and humor but also because with every next movie there is less and less sense in the plot
the most recent edition beats them all from that aspect
we can clearly see that it cost millions of  to make it given all the fx in the film but i just wish a fraction of that money had been used to pay a decent script writer
the movie has got good cast but its not enough to cover up the overall meaninglessness of it which actually lasts over 2 hours of screen time
gave it 2 stars for cast otherwise its not even a 1
horrible movie
horrible characters
the villain was a joke
q was disgustingly stupid
the whole thing was just bad and i like daniel craig in the role
add a bad story with terrible casting and a monkey for a director
you get skyfall
the cutting edge gadget is a gps tracker that is included on every cell phone sold today and a stupid gun
how could you get so desperately lost making a bond film
a plot with a crazy guy who wants to take over the word action babes clever banter and a few one liners some cool cutting edge gadgets to help bond when it looks like his time has finally come a couple more babes and wahla
a bond movie
it aint rocket science
i heard many reviews before seeing this film and they were somewhat varied though none were bad
the two main things i heard were either the classic bond is back or it was better than quantum of solace but not as good as casino royale
i however thought it was worse than both and that the classic bond was not back
craig gives an incredibly uninspired performance
the ending is reminiscent of home alone
the plot is poor and the villain seemed to replay live free or diehard
the film had craig try his hand at a oneliner or two to no avail
all this said the film did have some visual competence but back to the negativity was shot unwell
i just dont understand what the hype is around skyfall i very much enjoyed casino royale and thought that quantum of solace was alright as a part two and was visually stunning at all times granted they didnt feel like original bond films
but skyfall was in my opinion quite terrible throughout
the plot was rather pathetic and i felt like i had seen it before in multiple films
to sum this review up i hated it
zero charm  massive holes in plot  predictable action
aside from the great intro this bond never gets off the ground let alone fall from the sky
wheres bruce willis as this film should be renamed as a die hard flick
truly awful
completely misses the boat as a bond film
the charm of the bond films has always been the tongue in cheek nature of them
along with the innately debonair persona of bond himself
daniel craig is a good actor but lacks the charisma to pull of the role of jb and is getting worse with each installment
this type of inane smashem up  crashem up flick is everywhere
javier bardem makes a brilliant villain see no country for old men but his talent while up to par is totally wasted here
again the disinction of the bond films are diminishing into the trite formulaic low standard of dumb action flicks
the franchise now has one less fan
i watched this film and spend about 2 hours
the plot has so many hole and the stories parts were sometimes irrelevant and you just dont understand what is going on and every thing is like a mystery
like the women after bonds survival how he survived what did the woman was doing in the apartment where the assassination had taken place how did she get to the gambling scene why did he took 4 million euro cash stupid escape plan from the last scene and
at the end i thought that that they had assumed the film was insulting its viewers
i didnt liked it at all
although it has a confusing atmosphere but the story was stupidly simple and predictable
dont waste your time by watching this film
such an awful script
whats worse is they have stolen bits of other action films but still they get it totally wrong
and there are too many holes in the story to mention
how the british media can say this is good is just a total embarrassment
you expect it to be a bit silly cos its bond but this takes it down to another level
the setups are so implausible and the payoffs so predictable
bad guy getting caught and then escaping so easily
the tube train explosion
and skyfall is the name of bonds scottish home
not very likely
plus bond fails in his mission
the worst thing is how this films success has been celebrated
just terrible like it was written for idiots
you must see it to really appreciate how awful this movie is
you must see it to really appreciate how awful this movie is

what were they thinking
james bond and m dont have like a million friends they could call upon in case of a threat
they go to the mountains and fight their war against a thug on their own
2 elders plus one
i bet a figure like m picks up the phone and orders 15 top shooters without anyone gets news of it
very dumb film
also the transmitter
it wouldve been obsolete in sean connery times
on the chinese flea market one can buy classier products
the way it looks the size of it
in cr they put it in his arm that was something
also the macao thugs never have a gun
they go fistfight with someone and the fatguy never checks for the komodo dragon behind him
annoying
what happened with the quantum solace gang
they were completely forgotten of although the score wasnt ever settled with them
mr white just got out and disappeared
what a letdown after casino royal
where is the witty charming james bond
instead we got a depressed grumpy old man tired 40yearold agent
he looks late 40s anyway
it would have been a good somethingelse secret agent movie but not a james bond movie
a big dude sitting next to me was with his girlfriend he was so excited before the movie started slept after about 30 minutes all the way through the end of this movie
people leaving this packed theater seemed depressed after the movie was over
some understandably left the movie early
it would have been good if it named something else otherwise people are misled thinking and waiting for the charming witty smart fastpace mysterious sweettalk british agent guy with unimaginably surprised gadget to show up
what kind of bond movie is this
why all the psychological underpinnings
they should show this movie at a freudian analyst convention
so daniel craig james bond is the symbolic good son of judi dench mand javier bardem is the symbolic bad son of m
they all go to this place called skyfall where james bond was born
at skyfall the conflict between the mother and sons is resolved
what
why all the psychological stuff
well i didnt put it there the people who made the movie put it there
was this stuff put in to make it more interesting
to me this is the first weird bond
i felt a lot of the stuff the movie was about had nothing to do with spying secret agents stuff like that
because you see suppose you got a director like david lynch to direct a james bond movie
this skyfall is what it would look like
i am a very big fan of bond films and particularly of mr
craig
i still believe the best bond was mr connery but craig is the best in nowadays
still i was very disappointed with skyfall as in my opinion it is the worst bond movie since craig came
even qofs was much better
so the resume is simple skyfall starts nice with istanbul and shanghai mr
bardem is prefect but then it somehow turns into home alone in scotland wtf
i hope this movie was just a preparation for the next movies to come
if not i think it is the end of the franchise
the job done by craig was not very impressive dench was poor but bardem saved it all
i would like to know where all the money for production went
i could not see it spent for the movie
this movie is entirely predictable unimaginative and most of all so boring
there is nothing original in this
even javier bardem is overacting
the plot is extremely weak like if made for idiots to watch
i was waiting eagerly for the movie to finish in order to leave
these 2
20 hours were a waste of my money and most of all time
read some of the other reviews for info on how bad this ease
they describe it so well there is no point for me to waste even more time on that movie
i just dont understand whats wrong with movies nowdays
most of them seem to lack imagination they fail to excite
i really just dont see the point to making a movie like this
for me if a movie is boring then everything else just stops mattering
