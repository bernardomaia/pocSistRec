saw iron man 3 last night and it was superb
it was the sequel iron man 2 should have been but wasnt and the perfect extrapolation of life after avengers assemble
the set pieces are suitably awesome and the acting performances are uniformly excellent from the leads right down to the tiniest bit part theres a jewel of a cameo from a guard that upstages even downeys comic timing
the script gets the balance between the epic and the personal just right and sir ben delivers two performance for the price of one and both are genius cant say more  spoilers
mr downey jr also manages to show even more of the complexity of tony stark
just when you think theres no more to be fracked out of that particular mine he goes deeper
the writer set out to deliver a fun story and thats exactly what it is
it draws you in from the first moments and doesnt let go
what more could you possibly want
iron man three came as a pleasant surprise better than the second installment its a perfect blend of comic book superheroics and big screen sensibilities
robert downey is at his best
the writing helps
so do the fx which are 100 believable
even seeing the human chain dangling over the cape fear river when the movie was being shot here didnt prepare me for the sequence its mindboggling
this was one of the few times that watching the movie was as much fun as reading the comic books
everyone involved deserves a pat on the back
the scene following the end credits was by far the funniest and the best of the tag scenes
and stan lees cameo as a lecherous old man watching a bikini contest was great
hollywood finally got one right
its not as same as the previous ones
but a must watch
the movie is well directed well poised
this movie deals more with the human emotions and the separation from real love because of the involvement of machines in the life of a human
movie tags along well and well keep it to your seats till the very end
i have not given it a 1010 because the plot could have been a slightly better
but nevertheless the movie is awesome and a must watch
a complete family thriller
acting  1010 direction  1010 plot  810 climax  8
510 action  1010 thrill  910 cinematography  910 vfx  1010
overall  910
enjoy it
must watch
this is the best super hero movie i have ever seen
it was complete in every way with the humor and plot and characters
robert downey jr
plays tony stark perfectly and the plot twist in the middle is great
i had no complaints about this movie
this film is the best movie by far of the iron man series and of every series of super hero movies
it has the action and scifi content the dramatic content as well as the humor to almost classify it as a comedy
this movie also proves that tony stark does not need the suit to be a successful hero he can more than handle thing with only his wits and his knack of creating things
this was one of the best films i have ever seen
these nerd purists make me laugh
it doesnt follow the comics it doesnt follow the previous stories it doesnt
blah blah blah these nerds should talk about what this movie does
the movie is a success in every sense of the word
huge box office amazing effects great enthralling clever storytellingthis film has it all
if you like the iron man movies you will love this one because it is simply the best of them
downey is so fun to watchhe can take any line and make it funny quirky or touching as the moment merits
paltrow is also funa great match for tony
the villains are amazing to watchthe cgi fire effects the constant surprisesall good fun
see it nowthe best marvel movie to date
iron man 3 it should have been the finest one according to the trailer
i had expected much more though didnt left me disappointed and is an indeed amazing movie
the awesome action in the film is worth a watch
though the plot was not very strong i liked it very much
the house party was yet a new mindblowing element in the movie which leaves the audience amazed
the acting by robert downey junior and gwyneth paltrow was also splendid
the few jokes made me really laugh out loud
some parts of the movie may leave the audience bored but it is highly recommended to watch this one for rdj fans and iron man fan
being a marvel movie 57 minutes after credits there was a little joke about tony telling his story to bruce banner
that one was yet amusing and a bit of waste of time
you can judge from my rating 9 out of 10
how much i loved this movie
watched it yesterday and and found it simply awesome
i have seen earlier sequels of iron man too and i think this was pretty amazing it not the best and most importantly i found it an advancement over others
the movie has a wow factor especially in some scenes including the one in which he saves people falling from the sky
i also liked the idea of controlling his machines probably the right word for those suits that too not just one but so many by his brain
one of the movies where you can see it is not just actors but overall crew technical team designers and directors are making the movie great
cast wise everyone played a pretty good role but there were two who stood out  one of course robert and another ben
overall superb job and hope we get to see some more action better movie in iron man 4
everyone is complaining about the villain in this film and about how it wasnt a real villain and that they didnt follow the comic books and i some what agree
they dont follow the comic books exactly because they everyone would know what would happen
i read the iron man comic books and i love what they did with the film
but while everyone is getting mad at the villain i think they are missing the point
i and maybe it was just me thought 3 was more about tony and how he grew from this and his problems
while the villain was apart of the story i just think it wasnt supposed to be all about the villain
this film looked at what was important to tony his suits or an actual life like with pepper
there is a lot of action but i think people need to look past that and see that there is a lot more going on then just things blowing up
it was a lot different then the other films because you actually saw tony on a struggle that wasnt so easy to overcome while also dealing with himself which you didnt see in 1 and 2
this is the awesomest iron man movie of all
its great
it has everything funny parts action i mean lots of action it has even a time to cry parts by that i mean the ending fireworks
whose idea was that blow away all the iron mans
the writers did a great work except the ending the fireworks using iron man aw come on
robert did a great job
nothing is missing
it continues avengers which is great
little number of mistakes goofs and bloopers unlike avengers
tonys car is same audi r8 but in iron man style its awesome
shane black did a quite a good job
as the rest of the team congratulations on a great work
and of course it would be better if you put obama in iron man suit except president ellis
im just joking
the movie is great now we wait for more marvel movies
i was looking forward to see what happened to tony stark and iron man especially after the events of the avengers and while i enjoyed it i felt the whole movie was a bit overlong but the ending knocked it out of the park
i will watch this again as it is rare to find a movie i will watch a second time anymore
do not let he comic book fan boys and smart marks talk you out of seeing this movie
a fantastic movie that will help lead these marvel characters into phase 2  so bring your family to the theater and enjoy and exciting movie
although just a little bit of an improvement over iron man 2 this now makes me really look forward to thorthe dark world in november
the biggest hit of the summer was disneys iron man 3 which made 408
6 million domestically and 1
2 billion worldwide
huffington post i guess the people who didnt like the movie didnt understand the complexity of the plot
it was twisted and so unpredictable thats what made it so interesting
i was so relieved to not have to sit through another formula film
in the dollar theater now and your still able to see it in 3d
it was packed in the theater and it has been out for a long time
i was really pleasantly surprised
considering i havent seen the first 2 i thought i might be lost but not at all and the technology was so incredibly fun to watch
the action was not to long and drawn out and it was funny to
must see
i must say that i believe that this is the best film in the iron man franchise
downey was on top of his game once again as stark
saw this in 3d and should say that should be the only way that this movie is viewed
an epic movie experience for an epic movie
i would really like to say that guy pierces character was very convincing
sir ben kingsleys mandarin was very surprising
other then that i would definitely see this movie again
it was bigger then life and the action scenes really had my on the edge of my seat for the most part
if you havent seen this movie then go
if you have seen if and liked it see it one more time
watched this flick yesterday on big screen and really enjoyed it
r r tony stark alias iron man affected with ptsd sets out on finding and r eliminating mandarin and afghan terrorist who is spreading terror in r the usa and who interferes in iron mans life
tony is also faced with r a psychic who is trying to use gene control over significant people to r achieve his wicked purposes and soon surprises are on the way for r tony all of which he has to handle
r r the film is simply action packed
stunts and effects all around 2 r hours and has lots of cheeky dialogs too
rdjr is of course the best r actor and the film is directed so well that even without watching the r prequels one would understand it well
r r the film also seems to be influenced by bollywood as evident from the r posters of the hero and his counterpart and of course other things r which are quite obvious in the movie
r r action and special effect fans  watch it only on big screen and only r in 3d
i thought the film was really good but the only negative thing i have to say the actor who played the mandarin and the president was really not good at acting apart from that the acting was brilliant especially the actor who played tony stark
id just like to say the mark 42 iron man suit was amazing
and the person who made the suit for the film has a an amazing creative mind
please bring another film out just to make the iron man film come to an end for example making tony stark die
or a bad guy detonating a nuclear bomb that is going to kill millions of people and tony and the bad guy have to fight to the death and tony has to stop the bomb detonating and ends up killing himself just to stop the bomb
this is one the greatest movie which come in 2008 and is part or iron man 1 and iron man 2
both those movies were also very good and entertaining movies and both movies earn lot of money also like wise iron man 3 is also is a very good movie and full of entertainment
all the actors have done very good job for making the movie blockbuster
the science fiction which was used in this movie was of very good level and we see this kind of action in very less movies these day that is why this is the one of the greatest movie which was come in 2008

i had the pleasure of watching the film premiere last night and it blew me away
the film delivers in both storyline and visual effects
from start to finish you are thrown in to lots of action twists and turns
this film will not disappoint all you hardcore marveliron man fans
there are some big twists which really make this film that bit more exciting
for me the most impressive part of the movie were the visual effects which you would expect from such a film as this
they really push the boat out with huge explosions gun fights and all the usual extras
i do believe this will be one of the biggest films to date
definitely worth an 8 out of 10
i really wouldnt bother with this one
the plot was a bit all over the place and really doesnt grab you i wondered out of the screen half an hour from the end went to the loo checked my phone etc and probably wouldnt have bothered going back in if my partner hadnt still been in there
the script was really cringey lots of lame oneliners but not much else
there werent really any likable characters in the film and the ones which had potential to be likable were barely in it
typical cocky guy saves the world type thing nothing we havent seen a hundred times before
few random unnecessary sexist bits girls in bikinis playing table tennis
girls in lingerie etc
so clicha and cringey
lots of plot holes which i wont go into in case you are going to waste your money but in general it was just messy and lame
and kinda boring in a way
the main beef i have with this film surrounds the directorial choice to use the mandarin as a total foil instead of the true antagonist
perhaps a candidate for one of the worst ideas ever by the mcu
obviously the director had little affinity to the original iron man story or he would never have attempted such a thing
and yet i thought they picked the perfect actor to play the mandarin too
such a disappointment that they wasted his talent especially since the antagonist aldrich killian was a laughable substitute with a nearly spooflike backstory and shallow motivations
to add insult to injury they write the plot where tony spends basically the whole movie out of the suit and then has him totally destroy all his remaining suits at the end for some fireworks
overall id give it 5 exploding iron man suits out of 10
for the last year ive felt that the massive success of the avengersaand i mean its artistic success not its box officeawas a doubleedged sword for marvel
after all wouldnt the individual character films feel a bit
small after that
im3 attempts to use that to its advantage by making it smaller on purpose
its a character study with a bit of spectacle slapped on and i do mean bit
while the third act does follow the standard stuff go boom
formula the first two thirds of the film keeps the action rather conventional with one notable exception
to make this work you need an actor who can hold the audiences attention
thankfully im3 has the ultimate ace in the hole in robert downey jr
but even his unmatched charisma can merely spackle over the films many flaws
the story is weak the stakes feel small and it just never builds any momentum
there are a lot of things to like here
the aforementioned rdj some sharp dialog a scene stealing turn by ben kingsley and a jawdropping twist
unfortunately the sum of im3 is less than its parts
good  special effects and surrounding sound mix in cinema and miguel ferrer cameo always reminds me robocop bad  everything else  screenplay dialogue runtime villainssoundtracks casting the budget the connections with avengers and previous iron man movies
result  1 billion at the worldwide box office and i hope lots of rotten tomatos
tagline unleash the stupidity behind the title consequences not even sure willing to watch avengers 2 or other marvel movies
maybe gonna give a chance to thor 2 thoughand make second thought on upcoming robocop remake if they do not push the button too far from the original
the movie should of been called tony stark i for it has nothing to do with the two previous iron man movies
as others have said they wasted the mandarin character turning him into a joke
most of the story is about tonys inner demons boring
then they try to make the movie kid friendly by introducing a childs part to help tony as he once again is lost in the rubble which is his life
really thought that is why he made pepper his girlfriend
was utterly disappointment with this release seems like it was rushed and thrown together because the story line is barely coherent
dont waste you time on this wait till one of your friends buys the dvdblu ray borrow it from them and then help them by trashing it
iron man 3 is better than 2  even more so is disappointing  the film simply spoiled the villain mandarin  even the actor ben kingsley competent robert downey jr
is great as always the end of the film that appears carol iron man is cool  this film marvel commits more absurd script error at the end of tony stark takes the shards of the body and ceases to be iron man more in the movie avengers  age of ultron he simply appears with fighting armor and worse than the film does not explain  something the film does not account what happened to pepper potts if she was cured film does not explain  iron man 3 is better than 2  has some fun scenes more contains several errors and some forced scenes in addition to having the worst villain of the film universe marvel
note 5
5
a new director takes on the reign to the iron man franchise shane black
iron man 3 is better than iron man 2 but not on par with the first iron man
the film is a little darker and more serious than its predecessors but not by much
entertaining adventure some cool action sequences with some surprises lets get right to the surprises
1 of the notable twist was ben kingsleys supposedly role of the mandarin wasnt really the mandarin he was just an actor with substanceabuse hired by the real villain to fake it
ben kingsleys talents were wasted
as a long time comic book fan ive gotta say that was truly a disappointing twist in the movie disgusted by it
and thats that
iron man 3 has gotten a lot of hate over the years and still does and i understand it completely but the reason why i loved it is because we all got shocked at the movie theatre because the trailers didnt spoil half of movie cough terminator genisys amazing spiderman 2 avengers age of ultron fantastic four and many more cough
the whole thing with the mandarin i found it pretty clever and it shows us again why ben kingsley is such an amazing actor and i loved the fight scenes and the effects and mark 42 was such a badass suit they even turned pepper into a badass chick protecting herself but the biggest thing that made iron man 3 better than iron man 2 in almost every way is that he is more tony than iron man in here since it shows that he can defeat people without the help of his iron buddy he is a clever dude and he uses his brain to fix things and stop threats and thats why iron man 3 is a great movie in my opinion
main focus of writing a review 1
dont spoil the movie  spoiling a movie means telling somebody what happens before they get a chance to see it i guess thats bad like somehow people are incapable of figuring out before hand what will occur in the movie hollywood a word synonymous with formulaic repetition and you just cant abide somebody spoiling the plot for you even though its a plot you have already seen in ten other movies
with that in mind here is the review for iron man 3 too many villains and none of them do anything child actors are awful all humans despise child actors why do we continue to employ them also where the fck is iron man
nobody cares about tony stark thats why the movie is called iron man you have an iron man movie without iron man in it sht might as well call it iron man 3
at first i was mad because the mandarin not being real and of course the villain was like not good enough but after a while when i was thinking about the film i really saw the big plot there
imo they tried to show how a mare man deals with the life after the big event from the avengers
ofc he is tony stark genious billionaire
etc
etc
but his experience so far is nothing compared to the othersthor hulk  captain america
after all i like how the movie showed his struggle with accepting all that happened
it was funny action was good and overall a solid performance
big movies are coming up and we should look at the movies marvel universe as something new and not to compare it with the comics and the animated movies
i am really looking forward with great expectations and a chill for the next movies and how they will show thing and what innovations will they present to the public
cheers
we have seen what the ironman is capable of in ironman1 ironman2 and the avengers
his powers intelligence attitude and so on
but in this movie we see the weaknesses of him and how he overcomes them to save the world and live up to his name
i would say that this movie is a marvel version of the dark knight rises
the movie is good in its own way but has a few flaws like the weak ironman suits tony starks stupid idea of announcing his address to the world so that the enemy can attack him tonys negligence causing him to be the root cause to the origin of the mandarin making ironman look so beatable in the action sequences etc
except for these flaws the movie is great
this film was a nice entry in the ironman series although probably not the film fans of the comics would of wanted
being both a fan of the films and comics i was perched on the fence with this one
first of all the cast were great downey jr is a brilliant tony stark and i thought the film was quite amusing in places a great film for the casual fan
although maybe fans of the comics should give this a wide berth
when i read that the extremis storyline was going to be the basis of the film i was excited but this film doesnt retain the dark brooding tone that i would come to expect from such a story arc
the mandarin character gets put through the ringer as well and could be seen as a bit of a middle finger to the fans although kingsley is pretty funny
anyway my least favorite film of the series but still a good enjoyable film
should have kept the same plot and story line of the real mandarin and the 10 rings
kingsley put on an outstanding performance as the villain at least for the little amount of time he was
would have been smarter to keep him as the mandarin and move along with the 10 rings storyline
very disappointed or else this movie could have gotten a 10
for the mandarin being starks arch nemesis i just thought kingsley could have given us a heath ledger worthy performance which makes or breaks a movie
and no dis respect to guy pearce but he was doomed the second they fell from the story of how the mandarin came to being and with kingsley doing such a great job
bad directing
black could have had a real winner instead let his ego get in the way of a great what could have been
after having seen im3 last weekend i thought it was at least as good as the first but better than the second one
it was about the same as the avengers
what some of the reviewers fail to remember is that the studios make movies to make money
explosions special effects and or stars sell tickets therefore making money
star trek the motion picture is a perfect example
the trekkers myself included wanted the reunion of kirk spock mccoy and the rest
the special effects and sets pushed star trek beyond the boundaries of tv
it wasnt a very good movie but people went to see it for the stars and special effects and it made money
this show was ok
the questions i had was was this a love story action flick or a movie to find ones self worth
dont get me wrong but the graphics were great but how many machines does one person need
where were they since they can sense danger when the house was getting blown up
oh yea getting blown up
while in all this everyone comes out unscathed
reading the other reviews i would have to agree on some parts
im says the suits only for him but man he dressed almost everyone in the movie with his suit
as well im can defeat aliens advengers but can not take on these earthling experiments
i would have to agree with comedy in a movie is ok but how that was displaced in the movie confused movie goers on what type of scriptmovie this really was
whats with the kid helping him find himself
but in the end some pretty cool stuff presented him frm im nice car
overall the story was so so clip after the credits was well presented amp already awaiting the dvd version as it would have the commentary to explain everything
this was a good movie not great but definitely good
the misuse of the mandarin was a hard one for comic lore lovers to swallow
it was also hard to understand how pepper became so aggressive in the end
why was the armor so weak and got destroyed like tin foil during the climax of the movie
tony was going through suits of armor at the rapid rate during the finale
my question is with the large sum of money made off this film more than doubling what it cost to make why have they not green lit another one
i know he is going to be in avengers 2 but i figured they could start moving forward on iron man 4 too
anyone know why they havent
is is because of the price tag that rdj has demanded for reprising the character
seems worth it if he can double a figure like 200 million
the movie was great in all but the story caught me by surprise
i loved the action and the special effects but it got me kind of confused about the mandarin villain and seeing tony stark blow up all his suits at the end
it was different from the other iron man movies and that was what i liked about it
i was amazed how they tried to relate the avengers to the movie and telling you all that tonys been through
the iron patriot was a perfect idea to put in this film and seeing tony with a new iron man suit
it felt pretty intense at some parts of the film and i think thats what made all the difference because the last two films didnt feel as seriously intense as this film
it makes you think at the end tony doesnt want to be a hero anymore but something tells me he will return
thats definitely making me look forward to the avengers 2
overall it was a great movie and especially for marvel fans
if youve seen the previous iron man movies this is a must see to the sequels before it
great movie wicked sick action and as always tony robert downey jr
delivered an amazing show with spectacular incitement into the life of playboy billionaire and therapist
great movie with thrilling ending
overall robert made an excellent role come true and aspire but yet again in this reproducing film
in the movie your seen with tony struggling to adapt to his new life after the feature duo film with great role characters captain america hulk hawkeye black widow and god of thunder thor known as avengers
tony does so with his new suit and new armoured iron men
iron man 3 is the typical loud pointless third chapter in a superhero trilogy
why oh why do they throw everything but the kitchen sink at you and expect it to work
especially galling is the writers borrow from the dark knight rises phew putting the superheros alter ego on camera for 70 of the movie
then theres the business of everybody gets to wear the iron man suit which dilutes and cheapens the whole premise
as soon as the bad guy or his minions smash the armor to the point of nonoperation another suit flies out of the sky and clamps itself to the hero or the heros girlfriend or his buddy or the paperboy if hes nearby
finally the villain is
well i wont spoil it if you havent seen it
in the early comics the mandarin was iron mans luthor or dr
doom his main nemesis
this movie portrayal is an outrage
even the stan lee cameo was not good and over in a blink of an eye
on the plus side gwyneth paltrow is gorgeous
okayi checked out the long anticipated iron man 3a and i gotta be honest i wasnt impressed
it started slow and then it only got slower
because of the leisurely pace my movie partner crashed before half time
i purchased 3d because everything else was sold out
it was seriously 3d at the beginning but became a regular movie early in about a3 4s of the movie was not 3d
the story was okay spoiler mandarin wasnt even mandarin
i give it a 6 and the codec wasnt even worth waitn for
im not surprised by ironman 3s big box office opening
all the places and times i tried to get tickets to were sold out
my main issues are with 1 the slower than normal story line and 2the scheme to use the mandarin to pull in ironman fans and 3 the high price for 20minutes of 3d
i walked into this movie expecting a lot and i walked out very disappointed
this movie is terrible
i would not recommend it it was just plain bad
although the cgi and animation was great the plot the acting and the stupid corny jokes just ruin the film
iron mans armor falls apart all the time
and if tony can just call s robot and make an army of iron man suits attack the extremist soldiers
why on earth is tony stark iron man anyway
if he could to that the whole time why even have tony in the suit
god and the whole mandarin not being the villain and having killian be the villain was so expected
not a good plot reveal
and pepper killing killian was also really dumb and completely shut done any chance this movie had of being any good it also ruined iron man its like trying to be so feminist but really it ruins the superhero motive
this movie sucked
i just got home from seeing this film and i have to say while it is miles better then the second movie it really was not a great movie
i felt there were a lot of plot holes
now i do think its worth stating that all super hero movies have plot holes but this one more than most
in this movie it seemed like they focused on one thing he can do with suit  make it come to him he did this about 10 times in the movie
this focus made the other powers of the suit fade into the back
another point i feel the need to share is they didnt go into the antidote enough and all the sudden he breaths fire
was just crazy and out of no where i think a lot of explaining is needed for the antidote
to sum up this movie had plenty of plot holes too many bad guys to care didnt make sense and didnt explain enough but was entertaining to watch i think a solid 6 is a generous
the movie is just not good
i was not happy with it
it got too much money
all the awards it got nominated for and money it got was just not cool
fans hated it
i did too
i was just plain upset about what happen to the maderin
marvel ruin a character who could have been just as popular as the joker or loki
look at the trailers
it looks like its going to have a dark tone
when you see the movie it has waaaaaaay to much comedy
i could not understand it well because so many people were just laughing and i could not hear
plus people were laughing at stuff that were not even funny
these girls behind me were just plain annoying laughing win nothing funny just been said
also i was not happy with war machine not keeping his old suit
its overrated and ignore the credits
310
i find movies to be constantly going downhill iron mans trilogy has gone from bad to awful
robert downey jrs awful portrayal of iron man through his arrogant simply irritating nature and the lack of chemistry he and gwyneth paltrow have together all blend together to make one very mind blowingly average film
its boring its cheesy and its predictable
its just plain poor
is it really too much to ask for a marvel film that in some way challenges the superhero series of batman
because at this point its out of hand maybe the bar has just been set to such a high standard by the batman series that anything else just fails to match up but they could at least make an effort
very much struggling to find anything positive to say about this movie in some of these types of movies you could at least push for some good action scenes to somewhat disguise a horrible storyline and an even worse script but it lacked even that basic need for a good superhero film
dont start to watch it you could spend 130 mins doing about 130000 better things
this is not an iron man movie
tony is in the suit for maybe 15 mins tops
most of the movie is slapstick and rjd throwing out one liners
there are so many things wrong with the movie
no building tension as none of the attacks are on screen
you only see the one incident at the theatre caused by happy
it would have been better to see escalating attacks around the globe and a building threat
the mandarin was a total throw away after building up the ten rings over 2 movies
maya was a wasted character
she would have been interesting had she been tonys first love who came back and caused friction between him and pepper
instead she was a one night stand and there was no emotional weight to her heel turn
it was ridiculous that tony had 40 sets of armor but the only one available to him during the attack on his house was an experimental model that didnt work
in addition he then spends the next hour of the movie investigating without functioning armor
really
he has no armor at stark tower
very disappointing movie
when they made the first iron man i was like man
they have to make more
then they made iron man 2
it wasnt a bad movie it was just not up to or close to the first movies standards
well my friends the third was not as good as iron man 1 but it was up there
i feel like iron man 3 is at least the second best in the trilogy
as far as making the film goesnot gonna spoil anything look out for all the foreshadowing
you will also be hit with a little comedy
kind of like all the iron man movies
there isnt much i can say about iron man 3
i did like the action sense of the movie
i did contain a lot of action and it did live up to its title of being an action movie
also like the first one
throughout all the iron man films robert downey jr
s tony stark was always my favorite actor
i cannot say the same for 3
gwendolyn paltrons pepper pots was mine in this one
she acted very well
overall iron man 3 was a good movie that is most definitely a movie worth watching
however it still cant beat the first
if the teasers make you incredibly curious about this movie i would say you were right
at first when i watched the trailers i was pretty excited to go see it
however the movie was a failure
fight scenes were so complicated at least in 3d to catch up
even the scenes were blur and you wouldnt understand who was doing what
the best fight scene was the last one where iron man suits were teared apart
the storyline was also a stupid idea for iron man
firemen around what the hack seriously
oh girls looked pretty hot with their fire abilities but there were only 2 of them so it is still a waste of time to watch
i think this would be the worst to publish as iron man 3
i guess i just hate female characters in marvel movies
they just constantly get in the way and never die even if they should
i know that robert downey jr enjoys playing his quirky tony stark but this movie showcased that quirkiness way too much i
e
the second third and fourth pirates make the same mistake for johnny depp
the story had a nice setup and the action was of course first rate but it just to me falls flat because some of the story elements that didnt fit together
if youre going to have the main character have angst about something then at least explain more thoroughly what he has angst about and then allow him to work through that in the end
this movie introduces tonys anxieties but really they dont make any sense and he doesnt really resolve them in the end
i also really didnt care for the great reveal of ben kingsleys character why too cartoony and dumb
so all in all ok but not great
hope they bring the avengers back soon and im personally waiting for thor cause he and loki are a much better team than tony stark and rhodie
the suit breaks way too much in iron man 3 it is as if the writers and director never saw the previous iron man movies or the avengers
tony stark is only in his suit about 10 min
in the whole movie and every time he puts on a suit it is broken off in about 5 seconds
a truck is able to completely knock the suit off in this movie and a little boy is able to pull of the finger of the suit
in the previous iron man movies it shows the supremacy of the iron man suit by being hit by a missile and not having a mark being hit by thors mighty hammer and thors lightening and withstanding the damage as well as a long fight against alien creatures in the avengers
it was if the suit was made of plastic in iron man 3 it was ripped off so easily
i think he went through at least 40 suits in the movie
very good movie
most people on here ripping the movie seem to be the comic book geeks who were upset that the mandarin was not portrayed as he was in the comic books
one person was upset that they didnt display his ten rings
really
sorry they didnt have tony in his suit enough
i enjoyed how they displayed tony as vulnerable
yes he does have anxiety attacksand he can overcome them within a few minutes
in response to another person on here who said that anxiety attacks could not resolve so quickly
the reviews and complaints about the movie on here is comical
great movie great movie
just saw iron man 3
what a snore fest
iron man 2 and even 1 is better
from the director the brought us kiss kiss bang bang
what you have never heard of it
no worries hardly no one has
while kiss kiss bang bang
is in itself a great arthouse movie why in the world would they give such an important franchise into the hands of a novice in the actionadventure flick
oye
would have rather have the john favalora directing rather than shane black
he is a better writer than a director
and if it was not for the cinematography of john toll the movie would have been flat
if it was not for the saving grace of cinematography the movie would not have as successful
so why is the movie make insanely large amount of money at the box office not to mention all of the dvd blu ray toys video games and merchandising and licensing
because of all of the hype that it got from the other two iron man movies and avengers and thor movies
lets start by describing this flick with one word
an absolute disappointment
the movie stayed true to its origin with strong action scenes and special effects with peppered in comic relief although it came off more as a comedy than an action film
kids will love this movie none the less but anyone over the age of 10 who has any taste in good movies will agree this movie was a let down to the series and marvel especially
the story line was terrible and in no way stays true to the comic series involving the mandarin
this movie had all the potential in the world and fell short in every category
my suggestion is save your money and if you enjoyed 1 amp 2 as much as i did avoid ruining the entire franchise by not watching this movie
