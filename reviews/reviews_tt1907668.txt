"\nFlight will rank alongside The Lost Weekend, Leaving Las Vegas, etc as\none of the classic films about alcoholism. It features, in my view,\nDenzel Washington's greatest performance to date. It is so easy to\noverplay a drunk but extremely difficult to get it right and Denzel is\nspot on and totally believable here as an alcoholic. Also, not many A\nlist actors would play such an unsympathetic character.<br><br>Perhaps the biggest surprise is Robert Zemeckis's decision to do what\nis basically a character study. However, as shown in his previous films\nwhat he brings to the table here is to ensure that as well as studying\nthis flawed character, we have a thoroughly gripping and entertaining\nmovie. In addition to Denzel's standout performance, all the other\nperformances are great. John Goodman balances the drama with the right\ndose of humour. Go and see it, but not on board a flight!\n"
"\nFLIGHT is a great film! In a day and age where almost all Hollywood\nmovies try to thrill us with special effects and gore, FLIGHT 'soars'\nwith extraordinary acting and a story that will change lives. I went\nnot knowing really what to expect. A drama about a crashed airplane,\nright? Well this film is much much more. It is truth. Truth about life.\nTruth about addictions. Denzel Washington does an awesome, believable\njob as an alcoholic airplane captain, struggling with his addiction and\naccusations after the plane crash. John Goodman plays an interesting\ncharacter and provides some laughs. Without giving too much away, I\nwill say that if you like drama movies or Denzel, go see it. If you\nare, or know anyone who is struggling with an addiction of ANY KIND...\ngo see it! It just might change your life. 9/10 A+\n"
"\nBy now you know what the movie is about, so I won't rehash.<br><br>What you have here is the anti-Sully Sullenberg. Denzel is incredible\nas the best pilot you don't want flying your plane, or do you?????\nTough questions and tough decisions as Denzel deals with, or doesn't\ndeal with, the aftermath. You pull for him every step of the way, but\nthe problem is which way do you pull? The visuals are very good,\ngripping, scary. I felt like I was hit hard in the chest while watching\nthe plane.<br><br>Make sure the little kiddies stay home, but you need to see this movie.\nI hope the Academy hands Denzel the Oscar.\n"
"\nExcellent character study about a troubled individual. As an airline\ncaptain myself, it is very difficult to sympathize with someone who\nwould put his passengers in constant danger by being a chronic\nsubstance abuser.<br><br>But, it is a very high credit to Denzel Washington to make you care\nregardless. His fearless performance is why Washington is one of the\nworld's greatest actors! I am so very happy to see him take on a\nchallenging part like this, after doing so many roles he could do in\nhis sleep.<br><br>Robert Zemeckis turns in his least Zemeckis-like film ever, getting out\nof the way and allowing the script and the actors to do their parts.\nThe film gets seriously sidetracked with the two appearances from John\nGoodman, but Goodman has spent his career just popping up and giving\ngoofball performances, so no surprise there.<br><br>All in all, very good work on all counts, plus the ending works.<br><br>******** 8 Out of 10 Stars\n"
"\nThis was the strangest movie I've seen in a while. The beginning is\n?close to an hour? of some AMAZING flight crash sequence scenes. The\nrest of the movie is about a man's fight with alcohol and drug abuse.\nGet it on Netflix, watch the 1st hour, go to an AA meeting, come back\nand watch the last 15 minutes. You won't have missed a thing! The\nacting was good - but the story is advertised as being about a plane\ncrash, when it's more about man's struggle against himself.<br><br>The beginning scenes are supposed to depict a man with deep feelings\nfor a stewardess - instead it looks like he's hired a hooker, so it\ndoesn't quite jive later in the movie. More details on the\nreconstruction of the jet, show some of the simulator footage of what\nmay have happened when other pilots tried to land, show NTSB reviewing\nthe black box etc, would have kept it more in line with the advertised\nplot. The correct advertisement would be \"An egotistical,\nself-centered, alcoholic, drug addict makes an amazing jet plane\nlanding - see how he feels about that!\"\n"
"\nWashington gives what is nothing less than a performance of a lifetime\nin this tension filled film dealing with a pilot wrestling with inner\ndemons. The aviation sequences are stunning and the crash one of the\nmost breathtaking ever filmed. The director is highly gifted and his\nskill and passion are clearly evident. The script is superb, with\nintelligent plotting and sharp dialog that captures reality. It is,\nonce again, Washington who shines here above all else. His power as an\nactor is what truly gives this movies its fire. His portrayal of a\nsubstance abusing addict/alcoholic is painful to watch because of the\nhumanity he brings to the part. It is a tremendous accomplishment and\none of the finest studies of addiction ever filmed.\n"
"\nThis is hands down one of the worst movies ever, the only good part was\nin the trailer, the rest is just one long painfully dull story about a\npilot that can't admit he has a problem with alcohol and the people\nthat care about him trying to get him to see it. Don't waste your time\non this one. It was a huge disappointment, lots of nudity but to no\npurpose to the story, what little story there is. I usually love Denzel\nWashington and his movies, his acting was good but it was the story or\nlack thereof that made this so bad. It's a long movie, 2 hours and 18\nmin of boring. The AA groups will like the promotion, but really who\nwants to watch some guy coming to grips with his addiction so slowly\nand stupidly, sigh truly bad.\n"
"\nDenzel Washington shows us yet again that he is one of the premier\nactors of the past 25 years. His convincing portrayal of an alcoholic\nis downright painful to watch, and I mean this in a very good way, it\nis such a believable performance. He is the pilot of a plane that\ncrashes, yet his skill as an aviator saves almost all of the\npassengers. The aircraft is clearly in need of an overhaul, but it's\nhis drug and alcohol addiction that comes prominently into question.\nWith a great supporting cast, including John Goodman, whose character\nlights up the screen in the few scenes he's in (and someone he's worked\nwith before, 'Fallen' in 1998, and with the Rolling Stones' music\nfiguring in both films!) and Don Cheadle, a much more straitlaced\ncharacter than Mouse, from 'Devil in a Blue Dress' ('95) where he\nplayed opposite Denzel. Kelly Reilly is also wonderful as an addict who\nbefriends Whip (Denzel). Great characters in a well told tale.\n"
"\nDenzel gives a high-flying (pun intended) performance as Whip Whitaker,\na commercial pilot who may have a drinking problem, but he'll certainly\nbe the last to know. Directed with restraint by tech-whiz Robert\nZemeckis in his first live-action effort in more than a decade,\n\"Flight\" is a gut- wrenching film with its power grounded in its lead\nperformance by Mr. Washington. He too acts with a restraint unseen in\nhis Oscar-winning work as a bad cop in \"Training Day\", instead opting\nto bare his soul with his eyes. Man, those are some heavy, storied\neyes. And they should be. From the film's riveting opening crash\nsequence (Zemeckis' time to shine) to its gripping court-room ending,\nwe take a saddening journey through Whip's life as it spirals out of\ncontrol faster than a full-pitched plane in a nosedive. At times a tad\npreachy, but ultimately satisfying, you can go ahead and reserve a seat\nfor Denzel on a direct flight to the Oscars. And it would be a cryin'\nshame to not mention John Goodman's knockout turn as a drug dealer. Wow\nhe's brilliantly funny!\n"
"\nIf you are planning to see this movie because you think it is about an\nairplane crash and this crash provides the momentum for the plot, you\nwill be sorely disappointed. Flight is a film about a man coming to\nterms with his addiction to alcohol.<br><br>I am a social worker and really interested in addictions, so watching\nthis movie was very interesting for me. Denzel Washington was\nphenomenal as a man with a serious alcohol problem. The plane crash\nultimately becomes a catalyst for him to realize that he is an\nalcoholic and that he needs help. <br><br>The actual plane crash scene is amazing! I was on the edge of my seat\nfor the whole thing. The scene was well directed, produced, written,\nand acted. <br><br>All in all, I highly recommend this movie. However, if you are looking\nfor a high paced, action filled movie, this isn't going to be it. There\nis a lot of drama and a fair bit of action, but again, this movie is\nnot about the crash itself--it is about how the crash ultimately makes\nthe captain come to terms with his addiction.<br><br>Hope you enjoy!\n"
"\nThe movie started out great! Witty, entertaining and had you on the\nedge of your seat. The entire plane scene was excellent from the action\nand acting to the photography. Sadly, it was all downhill from there.\nWhile Denzel's performance was good, it was unoriginal. As an\nalcoholic, Nicolas Cage did a far better job in \"Leaving Las Vegas\"\nthan Denzel. The character of Nicole went no where ... Her storyline\nnever materialized. Basically, Nicole's character appeared to be an\nafterthought that got interrupted mid thought. The best part of the\nmovie was John Goodman - two brief appearances that were highly amusing\nand added some life to a coma-esque movie. Still confused as to what\nall the hype is about!\n"
"\nA good, solid story about the fall from glory of an arrogant pilot. It\ncan be seen as a metaphor of addiction. Substance abuse makes you fly\nhigh, but you lose track of your limits and people around you start to\ndislike your self-centered attitude. Some of those people are lost\nforever; others may still be around to forgive you.<br><br>The plot itself is about cocky airline pilot Whip, who manages to save\nmost of his passengers during a disastrous flight from Orlando to\nAtlanta. Despite (or because) being high on cocaine, Whip successfully\nperforms a daredevil move and lands the plane on a field. There are six\ncasualties though and legal actions to follow.<br><br>Whip is in full denial of his addiction to cocaine and alcohol and\nmanages to alienate everybody around him. Linked to the main story is a\nrather unnecessary subplot involving a female addict. Satisfactory\nending.\n"
"\nMany say that this is Denzel Washington at the top of his game; I tend\nto agree. Washington plays Whip Whitaker, a senior airline pilot that\non a wing and a prayer makes a miraculous. albeit, crash landing on the\nway to Atlanta. Nearly everyone aboard is saved, as Whitaker's training\nand skills help him avoid a mid-air catastrophe. Waking in the\nhospital, Whip finds out that he is a hero, but as the crash is\ninvestigated it comes to light that his lab work reveals alcohol use.\nHis future and reputation are at risk. As more government scrutiny\nunfolds, Whitaker is forced to not only face his demons, but the honest\ntruth as well. Compassionate as it is compelling. Washington brings\nrealism to the forefront and is helped with fine performances from\nco-stars Nadine Velazquez, Don Cheadle and Tamara Tunie.You don't\nrealize the movie is well over two hours long. Drug and alcohol use\nalong with some nudity and intense action makes FLIGHT rated R.\n"
"\nFLIGHT is one of the worst movies I ever saw. <br><br>I rate a 1 of 10.<br><br>But, it gets a 10+ on the unrealistic/unbelievable scale - both for the\nevents and the characters. <br><br>As a pilot I can say that it's one of THE worst aviation movies ever\nmade, if not THE worst aviation movie ever made.<br><br>The flying scenes are so absurdly ridiculous that I literally laughed\naloud at them.<br><br>Even the character interactions are hard to believe. Sometimes I wonder\nif the producer actually thinks that people are so gullible. But, after\nI read the reviews for FLIGHT, I realize that they are.<br><br>It boggles my mind that so many people so highly rate this movie.\n"
"\nDenzel gives a performance that was truly Oscar worthy and solidifies\nhim as one of Hollywood greatest actors. It is another performance that\nhas you wishing for another ending no matter how many times you watch\nit, and as one that owns the Blu-ray of Flight I have watched it\nseveral times so I know.<br><br>The story is brought to life by great performances and terrific\nchemistry. The supporting cast brings their \"A\" game as well. Even in\nthe \"low\" points in the movie you don't want to miss a second because\nof the brilliant portrayals of these broken people trying to find their\nway through the tragic events that are their lives. <br><br>It is an interesting character story about people trying to rebuild and\nfind redemption after coming to the realization that they are broken.\nHollywood should make more movies like this!\n"
"\nDenzel Wahington once again reminds us why he's such a great actor in\nthis drama. Flight is not a film about planes or a pilot's life, but it\nis an amazing character study about the demons of a man. This man,\nportrayed almost flawless by Washington in an award worthy performance\nis a man of addictions trying to overcome these. And that is what the\nmovie is basically about, a man trying to fight his disease and how the\npeople around him react to his actions. What's so great about the movie\nis how you actually sympathize with the character of Denzel Washington:\nI mean there are literally many times during the film when I actually\nwas talking to Denzel in my head like \"Oh don't do it man, don't drink\nthat stuff, come on\" And I believe that says a lot about the movie,\ncause you actually care for the characters in this. Flight has great\nperformances, a great story and it is beautifully told. Robert\nZemeckis' epic comeback, indeed.\n"
"\nDeserves a watch. There is not much to the movie that pulls you to\nwatch it again. The character is portrayed in a bad way. You feel that\nhe deserves everything bad that happens to him. It is because he had no\ncontrol over his life. Denzel has done a great job. The plane scenes\nwere very well made. There are lot of characters in the movie who\nweren't used much. It just focuses on the main character. Many\ncharacters were not used. The choices the character makes are\nquestionable. You are left to think how foolish the character really\nis. Even an addict would feel that the movie is just too much. There is\nlittle believable. The director had so many things to assume for the\naudience that at one point you really feel the movie is just made to\nfeel dramatic. This spoils the mood of the watcher.\n"
"\n\"Flight\" is movie that, albeit having scenes involving a flight, is\nabout a man more than an object. The plane crash is just an excuse to\nbring the story of Whitaker's life, which is full of problems, like\nalcoholism, drug addiction, bad parenting, etc. This story felt\nparticularly touching for me, considering I have lots of relatives with\ndrinking problems, so if you also do, be prepared to see something kind\nof heavy. Denzel Washington's acting is OK but, in my opinion, the one\nwho steals the show is Brian Geraghty; the scene in which Whitaker\ncomes into his hospital bedroom proved that Geraghty KNOWS how to\nperform a serious scene, mixed with a lot of feelings. Directing and\nsoundtrack are just regular, and maybe that's why \"Flight\" doesn't seem\nto impress spectator in any moment. I believe that a stronger directing\nand a louder soundtrack could have made this film a lot better. All in\nall, this isn't anything remarkable and the ending may be a let down\nfor some, but it's an entertaining picture to be seen and reflected\nabout.\n"
"\nI had high expectations for this movie before I watched it. I'm a fan\nof Denzel Washington and this movie was highly reviewed and nominated\nfor two Oscars. I'm also a fan of the director Robert Zemeckis. I was\nmildly disappointed. The beginning of the film was very interesting.\nThe plane scene was action packed and had me at the edge of my seat. I\ncouldn't wait to see what would happen next. However after that, not\nmuch happens. The last 3/4ths of the movie is basically just Denzel\nWashington's character getting drunk all the time despite being\ninvestigated for flying a plane while drunk. I found it very difficult\nto relate or sympathize with his character. I guess he redeems himself\nin the end and owns up to his behavior, but by then I had lost interest\nin him and the film in general.\n"
"\nRather than the straightforward action film I was expecting, Flight is\nreally a character study of one mans addiction. <br><br>The crash scene is very well done but this is really a small part of\nthe film. The remainder of the film is taken up with the crash\ninvestigation as the case against the pilot grows.<br><br>The film is carried by Denzil Washington who plays a refreshingly\nflawed anti-hero. Your sympathies for the character swing wildly\nthroughout the film which is something you don't normally get in glossy\nmovies. It is always absorbing as the case builds towards the\nconclusion of the investigation. I know some people did not like the\nending however I found it to be very satisfying. <br><br>The only real negative for me was a strange and wildly over the top\ncameo from John Goodman which I found out of place with the rest of the\nfilm. <br><br>Flight is an intriguing film with a superb lead performance from\nWashington and well worth watching.\n"
"\nI am not an addict, but I won't lie about lying. This movie has a\npotential to touch each one of us. A pilot who bears the guilt of\ndeaths of his crew members, tires, and fails to fight his addiction but\nin the end embraces the truth. Simple yet so bitter a truth. The burden\nof lies upon lies crushes our souls, and this movie gives us courage to\nbreak free. There is also an implicit explanation of the addiction that\nmost try to turn away from. Hiding truth from our own selves is one big\nreason for continuous pain. Watch and you will agree. An astounding\nacting, a superb roll-on story and a wonderful end. A must see drama\nthat we all live in. My vote 8/10 straight!\n"
"\nThe trailer and Poster of the movie looks great. The movie starting is\nalso great. the main highlight is the part in the plane the small\ndetails where the director had worked such as drinking the drinks in\nthe flight etc. But after the crash the movie goes bit slow. The after\ncrash is all the drama related to the hospital scene and the place\nwhere the pilot meet his new friend. After that the drama gets bit\nboring for me as its confusing . The only interesting part is that\nwhere the pilot mention he is alcoholic and had drunk that day. On\naverage 6 stars is good ratings as it lacks of action except the flight\nscene and also the drama is not so good despite of the good actors.\n"
"\nI'm addicted to this movie specially the first scene and the last one.\ni watched these scenes nearly 10 times! sorry for my English first :)<br><br>OK, what makes me confused is the following: well, what i understood is\nthat the pilot lost the control of the tail and those little things in\nthe back sticked to the down position which made the plane to dive. and\nthen he rolled it to make that sticked thing to be up so it will do the\nopposite (trying to elevate the plane). OK that makes sense. but after\nthat he rolled it back again and the plane didn't dive. i really can't\nunderstand it and i wish if anybody has an explanation to email me here\namranababneh@outlook.com<br><br>I'm not an engineer or sth :P i'm a medical student. thanks\n"
"\nThis film is totally contrast throughout there are moments of absolute\nbrilliance and also moments where I was so bored I wanted to turn the\nfilm off because I was bored. Denzel Washington stars as a pilot which\nlands a crashing plane while under the influence of Alcohol and the\nfilm documents the trials and tribulations he must endure throughout.\nNow I must say first Denzel Washington completely deserved his Oscar\nNomination for his performance as his performance is the part of the\nfilm that you follow and he is the character that the audience needs to\nconnect with. The side characters are all believable in their role and\nare superb in their performances. To properly describe this film the\nopening part where he is in the plane crash is heart stopping and\nfantastic but then it also stops and slows down a lot which is the\nboring part and then it becomes heart wrenching and tense towards the\nend of the film which makes this film a great film but not to the level\nof other similar films like The Wrestler.\n"
"\n\"Flight\" is one of those films that has you in the passenger seat to\nwatch a journey of emotions and personal drama to unfold. All in the\nend it reveals truth no matter how painful it is or isn't. The man\nDenzel Washington is Whip Whitaker a hotshot airline pilot who after a\nnight of binge drinking and drug snorting in which in a hotel room he\nhad sex with a hot sexy colored bra wearing flight attendant named\nKaterina(Nadine Velazquez)miraculously lands his plane after a\nmalfunction. Still this landing first looked at as heroic was clearly a\nbad accident it cost lives and plenty of injuries. And you guessed it\nquestions arise as with any drama it seeks the truth still this drama\nis a character study of redemption and truth seeking. It shows the\nstruggle and courage of one man and that's Whip Whitaker who admits his\nguilt and struggle as ending with the discovery of truth is what\nmatters most.\n"
"\nPowerful, moving movie. Probably the best movie on the effects of\nalcoholism since \"Leaving Las Vegas\" in 1995. <br><br>Original and unpredictable. The actual aim of the movie is not apparent\ninitially - it looks like surviving disaster movie, then a romance.\nEven once the true aim is known, you don't know how it is all going to\nend.<br><br>Not perfect though. Certain scenes just seem superfluous. The\nrelationship angle seems badly developed, and almost unnecessary. Some\nscenes, especially any involving John Goodman, seem to glorify Captain\nWhitaker's addictions.<br><br>Good performance by Denzel Washington in the lead role. Not sure it\ndeserved an Oscar nomination, but a good performance nevertheless. Good\nsupport from Kelly Reilly, Bruce Greenwood and Don Cheadle. John\nGoodman possibly overdoes the cool-stoner-dude shtick.\n"
"\nI already wrote a review for this film and for some reason it was not\napproved by the IMDb crew for reason not understood by me. Or explained\nto me for that matter, it would be nice for IMDb people to explain why\nthe do not approve a review.<br><br>To focus onto the film.<br><br>I love Danzel Washington, he acts so good and he is an interesting\npersonality.<br><br>Plot is very interesting and common in the airline industry. As I write\nthis review planes are constantly landing at the wrong runways all over\nthe USA, I guess to many airports. ;) Pilot do snap, they like\nstewardesses to have sex with, they drink, they sometimes use drugs, I\nloved scene when Danzel Washington is checking the oxygen mask. Sniff,\nsniff checks. Oh yes that O2, what a feeling! I loved scenes of the\nairplane crashing, very realistic and well done. All in all you should\nsee this film, it is very interesting, talking about airlines, pilots\nand those cute flight attendants.\n"
"\nAn airliner pilot crash lands a passenger plane that goes nose dive and\nprotects almost all on board which everyone calls a miraculous\nsurvival. The plane obviously goes down due to technical failure, but\nthe investigation reveals the captain had consumed alcohol and his\nalcoholism and stupendous flying capability get questioned. After a\nlong time, I have been able to watch a genuine drama that tells a\nmodern story; and \"Flight\" makes a lot of justice in that aspect.\nThough it involves the survival game and many improbabilities,\npsychological aspects of characters are revealed instead of stunts\nwhich makes the story awesome. Besides, the film is filled with nice\nperformances notably from Denzel Washington for which I expect a\ndeserving Oscar after \"Training Day.\" Except few unpleasantness the\nfilm carries of modern aridities, the film is really engaging and would\ndefinitely make you think. So I give this film two very enthusiastic\nthumbs up.<br><br>Rating: 2.5 stars out of 4\n"
"\nAlthough it seemed a bit lengthy and seemed to wander a bit too much in\ndirections that made it hard for me to stay interested,I really enjoyed\nDenzel Washington's performance as demon battling airline pilot Whip\nWhitaker.Denzel never fails to impress in anything.He's that good.His\nperformance of the main character is what kept me going.I cared about\nwhat happened to him and was hoping the ultimate outcome of the film\nwas a suitable one.Thankfully it was.There are no more real highlights\nto brag about here.As I said,the film otherwise ran a little too long\nand went into some areas that made the story fall flat.Thumbs up for\nDenzel.\n"
"\nBeware ! The trailer make you believe that the film is about the plane\ncrash and the captain's trail ! It is a scam : the movie is about\nalcohol addiction , and a mediocre one. Maybe the acting is good, but\nyou seen this kind of addiction story too many times. Nothing original\nin this script. The 5 points I gave are for the first 30 minutes which\nare entertaining. The rest of it is a waist of time. If you want to see\nan almost boring and obviously unrealistic movie (I can't believe that\na Boeing pilot did not have blood test periodically) about a alcoholic\npilot, than go. If you want to see a movie about a pilot's trial or an\naction movie avoid this one.\n"
"\nThis is a very unrealistic movie concerning the aviation part as well\nas the alcoholic part. If something is wrong with the\naircraft-stabilizer and you can not control the pitch-attitude you will\nnever be able to control the pitch all of a sudden when you fly upside\ndown. And a drunk pilot is flying better than a healthy and fit pilot\ntrying to do the same thing in the simulator? Also: if you'r a strong\nalcoholic as this pilot you will never be able to leave the booze alone\nfor 9 days without any help. And during the final hearing he only has\nto respond \"yes\" to get off the hook. How many people would do/say the\nsame thing as he does? But besides this all the movie is slow and\nboring. Only the first 15 minutes are interesting (the crash) and the\nminutes of the NTSB-hearing. The whole dramatic middle-part could have\nbeen shortened by the half to make this movie at least not as slow as\nit is now. A disappointing movie and almost a waste of the time\nwatching it.\n"
"\nPositives: Denzel and Robert Z. both have great body's of work\ncinematography good, supporting actors good<br><br>Negatives: Wasn't much build up in supporting actors which left me not\ncaring as much as I hoped for Denzels character. <br><br>The redeeming scene at the end I felt came way too late. It felt like\nit was shot later then tacked on in hopes of drawing in the audience at\nleast at the end.<br><br>I realize alcoholism is a repetitive cycle but good grief was it ever\nin this movie. It seemed we just kept watching him attempt to quit but\nwith different backdrops.<br><br>Hopes: Faster draw into the redeeming aspects of the character would\nhave helped me champion for him. The flight scene just wasn't that\ngripping. What was the deal with plane at his Dads place if we never\ngot to see Denzel fly it. Maybe he should have flown to Jamaica.\n"
"\nFlight is a great movie with an amazing story,a terrific cast and some\ngreat characters.Denzel Washinton delivers a fantastic,inspired\nperformance as Whip Whitaker,and its also great to see Robert Zemeckis\ndirecting a live action movie again,after years of doing that creepy\nanimation in The Polar Express.<br><br>Whip Whitaker (Denzel Washington) is an airline pilot and a serious\nalcoholic,he saves the lives of 96 passengers on a plane while he is\ndrunk,but trouble begins on figuring out the planes malfunctions.<br><br>-9/10<br><br>-DILLON HARRIS\n"
"\nUpon originally seeing the trailer for this (Aside from getting excited\nas i always do when one of my top 5 fave actors of all time star in\nsomething) I thought it would be a total up in the air type film\nrevolving around an epic plane crash. Sure their is an epic crash (Due\nto the amazing job done by the film crew it looked totally real)\nhowever this story revolves about pilot William \"Whip\" Whitaker\n(Washington) a divorced heavy drinking/partying who has with that life\nstyle surprise surprise a drinking problem. This movie tends more to be\nabout addiction and how it is more a disease then a problem. Kudos to\nJohn Goodman who i thought was simply brilliant as Whip's drug dealer\nHarling (Laughed at how he presented himself you have to see the movie\nyourself to see why) Aside from that most of the all-star cast did\npretty solid acting jobs.<br><br>With award season almost under our noses i can definitely see this as\nbeing a strong contender with Denzel more than likely garnering yet\nanother statuette for his shelf at home in the best acting dept.\n"
"\nExcellent features: - performances by Denzel Washington (!), Keilly\nReilly, John Goodman<br><br>Good features: - performances by the rest of actors<br><br>Not so good features: - the plot. It is too slow at times, and becomes\ngradually predictable. There are also unrealistic moments, especially\nthe hearing scene - persons tend to \"sober up\" after dramatic events,\nbut not in this manner. Washington's and Reilly's characters are too\nplain anti-addiction patterns, but thanks to the actors' talent, they\nare still pleasant to follow.<br><br>Nevertheless, the movie is worth watching, and Washington will probably\nget a Academy Award nomination. Good luck!\n"
"\nI was expecting another Denzel Washington paint by the numbers starring\nvehicle like he had with Man on Fire, Fallen, Ricochet and a number of\nother films. But this movie almost reaches the same heights of his\ncareer as some of his best movies like American Gangster, Training Day,\nMalcolm X, Glory and so on. He always does his best performances when\nhe plays flawed people and not just perfect do the right thing good\nguys.<br><br>It didn't hurt that the actress who played Catalina in My Name is Earl\nprances around naked to start off the movie.<br><br>Movie just had a very good overall cast with Kelly Reilly, John\nGoodman, Bruce Greenwood, Don Cheadle and Melissa Leo in support.\n"
"\nHow amazing is when the director wants you to hate the main\ncharacter... and at the end they want you to love him because he gives\na lesson of live to his son... like the common American hero... One\nmore time, is the story about a man who gets drunk every day, uses\ncocaine... no matter where! In his home, in his job. The viewers can\nonly hate him because they see themselves in that plain, suffering that\naccident but just after having seen how many drugs and alcohol the\npilot had taken... During the film the director wants you to change\nyour mind because at least HE LEARNS THE LESSON and stop with that\nhorrible life and began to teach others how drinking and drugs is a\nkind of chains for everybody. Remember kids: say NO to drugs and\nalcohol! Anyway, I like the professional work of Denzel Washington,\nonce again.\n"
"\nI thought of this film being in 2 parts. The first part was the plane\ncrash. I thought it was well done. It was scary and keeps you guessing.\nFirst there is a shaky take off, then the plane clears it and it's\nclear skies, then it goes out of control. Exciting.<br><br>Afterwards is the second part of the film, the more serious part, which\nis following an alcoholic. It turns out the pilot, Whip, is an\nalcoholic and was drunk on the plane but mechanical failure is what\ncaused the crash. But that don't mean he can't get in trouble too. The\nending was unbelievable because I don't think a life time liar would\njust tell the truth like that.<br><br>Also, John Goodman has a cameo as Whip's supplier of anything. He was\nsomething else.<br><br>FINAL VERDICT: I liked it and Denzel Washington was good and deserved\nthe acting nominations. Check it out.\n"
"\nThis is a classic example of where the trailer is not only better than\nthe film, but is also a total misrepresentation of it. From the outset\nI actually thought I was watching a different film than the trailer\npromised.<br><br>Advertised on iTunes as a 'tense, nail biting and tense thriller'\nFlight refuses to deliver, other than the plane crash scene, which is\nin itself extremely well made, compelling and rather terrifying\nviewing. <br><br>The remainder of the film is overly long, dull and predictable with the\novertones of drink and drugs rather tasteless.\n"
"\nThe first part of the film was awesome. The rest, not so much. The\nflight and crash sequences were fantastic. But then. The film turned\ninto a standard character arc about addiction. It was all done very\nwell, with good acting by Denzel Washington and Kelly Reilly. Also good\nwere Don Cheadle, and John Goodman, who seemed to have come from a\ndifferent movie. But people need to get their drugs somewhere. And how\nlovely was Nadine Velazquez? Wow! But come on, the addiction thing has\nbeen done to death. I don't mean to be offensive, but I have seen it so\nmany times that it bores me. I gave it a better score than it really\ndeserved due to the cast and the production values.\n"
"\nI love Denzel Washington. I don't mind that he grits his teeth, steels\nhis gaze and does that funny tongue in cheek thing. If that's his\ntoolkit, it's a good one and playing a flight captain fits straight\ninto it. But this is not his finest hour.<br><br>This film starts out looking like a gritty moral dilemma, an heroic\nstory with a twist. It ends up leaving you feel drained of interest,\nwith only a dull anger replacing suspense, concern or hope.<br><br>One or two funny and unexpected twists, but ultimately succumbs to\nHollywood treatment, leaving a sense that the Director didn't get to\nsay what he wanted.<br><br>It draggggggs for a good 70%of this film.<br><br>Goodman, not Washington, carries this film, but is used far too\nsparingly and feels like he's walked in accidentally from the\nneighbouring studio.\n"
"\nMuch as I like thrillers, especially films involving planes, I was\ndisappointed in \"Flight\". This was not much of a thriller - not much\nsuspense here. Without resorting to spoilers, let me simply say that I\nfound the plot riddled with clichés, and oversimplified improbable\nsituations. In particular the ending was so banal, so neatly tied into\na pretty ribbon, that it ruined any saving graces the film had for me.\nPerhaps I am too cynical, or too unfamiliar with the effects of\nalcoholism to be that sympathetic to the \"hero\". This film left me with\nthe feeling that it could have been much, much better. Nevertheless,\nhaving said that, kudos to some good (but not stellar) acting, although\nit was hampered by unfortunately weak writing and and even weaker plot.\nThe plane crash was the best film portrayal I've ever seen. Fearful\nflyers, be forewarned!\n"
"\nGreetings from Lithuania.<br><br>\"Flight\" is a great movie. Terrific performance by Denzel Washington\nand great supporting stuff from all involved around. This is a movie\nmaking at it's best. The opening sequence is breathtaking and also it\nhas amazing production. Flight, a terrifically exhilarating film, hits\nall the right notes as a thriller and as a complex drama. A large part\nof the praise for this film goes to Zemeckis' professional direction\n(hey, this guy's roots are in Lithuania!)<br><br>Not usually we see great addiction dramas with performances like in\n\"Flight\". Outstanding, A must see.\n"
"\nThis movie's about the long spiral coming between the period when\nsomeone exceeds any limits and when he acknowledges that he needs help.\nA valid dramatic material, not only about addiction and recovery. It\nshows how a decent person will do terrible things when drunk and shows\nthe power of compulsion. In a way the story's very predictable. Flight\nis well-made motion picture but not funny or entertaining and offers an\ninteresting twist, in addition to raising two fascinating questions.\nWhat if the pilot had been sober, would the tragedy have been worse?\nAnd, conversely, was it the alcohol/cocaine cocktail in his blood\nenabling him to risk 100 people? To sum up, a different kind of movie\nfrom director Robert Zemeckis.\n"
"\nNow, I didn't like the plot ending. The screenplay is great. but there\nare so many loopholes in this one that it loses a star. I give it nine\nbecause:<br><br>the music is good, and the message that this fine flick gives out is\ncredible. Denzel is so amazing in his role as the callous pilot that it\nmakes you sit through the tedious 138 minutes. Characters, I think were\nlittle over-baked at times but John Goodman is grabs the limelight.\nThis is some fine cinema but the the best plot as there are so many\ndefects with the loneliness, inspiration, drive-out, carelessness, drug\nabuse, et cetera - these aspects were, I think, not defined as they\nshould've been.<br><br>Bottom line is you need to watch this if you want a peek into one of\nthe cataclysmic situations our real world has experienced, FLIGHT\nCONTROL DISASTER!<br><br>WATCH OUT FOR: Denzel Wahsington &amp; Kelly Reilly<br><br>Can be watched with a typical Indian family? 90% NO<br><br>Language: Mild | Sex: Implied sequences | Nudity: Strong | Drugs:\nStrong | Violence: Mild | Mouth-Kiss: Yes\n"
"\nIt is amazing to me that you can take a chunk of metal, mixed in nuts\nand bolts and attach some engines and you can fly pristinely across the\nsky. More importantly are the pilots that guide these crafts through\nthe air. Flight is quite a movie, it chronicles the self assured pilot\nWhip Witaker (Denzel Washington) as he takes the controls of a typical\nflight from Orlando to Atlanta. Along the way, the flight hits some\nturbulence and begins a free fall. Whip keeps the calm and uses all his\nskills to guide the craft. The scene is riveting and I caught myself\nclosing my eyes, is it going to crash or not? After the big event the\ninvestigator come in and seek a scapegoat, was the incident caused by\nmechanical malfunction or pilot error. This movie is full of suspense\nand is one hell of a ride.\n"
"\nFLIGHT (2012) ***1/2 Denzel Washington, Kelly Reilly, Bruce Greenwood,\nDon Cheadle, John Goodman, Melissa Leo, Tamara Tunie, Nadine Velasquez,\nGarcelle Beauvais, Justin Martin. Washington gives a superb performance\nas a barely-functioning alcoholic pilot whose heroic act of saving his\nairliner from a catastrophe leads to an criminal investigation and has\nhim on a path of salvation or self-destruction. With the unlikely aid\nfrom recently sober heroin addict Reilly (sublimely perfect) a fellow\ntraveler and questionably moral support from colleagues (Greenwood as\nan airline rep and Goodman as Dr. Feelgood enabler), Washington's\ntroubled anti-hero has some stumbling blocks to overcome: namely\nhimself. Craftily and cannily directed by Robert Zemeckis (welcome back\nfrom the dead zone of motion captured animated crap) and an unorthodox\nscreenplay by John Gatins incorporates state-of-the-art CGI (one dilly\nof a plane crash-landing) and moral turpitude.\n"
"\nI thought this would be about Denzel Washington being 'clean' and\nhaving the crashed based on unfortunate circumstances, but I was wrong.\nDenzel is an idiot in this movie, even though he's a nice guy. I loved\nKelly Reilly's character a lot, and I loved the cancer patient who was\nonly around for a few minutes. Don Cheadle was fantastic as a guy who\ndoes his job even though he hates his client, and Bruce Greenwood is\ndecent. The movie was okay at best, but I'm happy that movies can still\nbe made without being taken from anything. The special effects for the\nplane crash were just amazing though, and watching it near the end was\nso cool. If you like Denzel, you'll probably like this movie.\n"
"\nThis first section is for American readers and/or others who are prude.\nThere is nudity in this film! I was actually shocked to see that, not\nbecause I had a problem with it, but because I never thought the movie\nwould start this way. So if you have a problem with nudity (you\nshouldn't, but I know some do and that's OK), be aware of that fact!\nThe rating should indicate the reason for it getting an R, I'm sure.<br><br>Having put that out of the way, let us concentrate on the essential.\nYou might have read about this movie and might have a picture how this\nis. Denzel Washington might be one of the few people who will be able\nto blow away those expectations. Plus the movie might not exactly go\ninto the direction you think it will. It's really about one character\nand the journey he takes (no pun intended). If you can stomach it (the\ncharacter can, kind of), then this will be very rewarding (hopefully)\n"
"\nWhat a disappointment this movie turned out to be. Viewing the trailer,\nI had high expectations. With Denzel Washington in front of the camera\nand Robert Zemeckis behind of it, I thought that \"Flight\" looked to be\none of the most promising movies of today. \"There's no way that this\ncan be a bad movie\", I thought. Well, unfortunately, it turned out to\nbe a bad movie.<br><br>The first half- hour was fantastic! A very memorable opening scene\nfollowed by intense action. At this point, \"Flight\" was living up to my\nhigh expectations. All of a sudden, it plummets, literally. The action\nstops and the movie turns into one of the most long-winded movies of\nall-time. The runtime is just over two hours but it feels like four, it\nwas that boring. I kept faith that it would pick up again at any minute\nbut it just didn't. <br><br>I'm still a fan of Denzel Washington and I'm going to continue watching\nhis movies in the future. But I won't watch \"Flight\" again, that's for\nsure. I'd like to give it more than three stars for the rating but I\njust can't because it doesn't deserve it.\n"
"\nThis is another dime in a dozen ... and it seems that one sure way to\nget an Oscar nomination will always point towards playing an alcoholic,\nan addict or a prostitute.<br><br>Denzel does not disappoint and gives a decent portrayal of an\nalcoholic. Sadly it is no longer original. To spend over two hours\nlooking at addicts and alcoholics is sad in any case. What makes this\nparticularly boring is that this has been done umpteen times before and\nbrings absolutely nothing new.<br><br>Leaving Las Vegas with Nicholas Cage and Elisabeth Shue was the first\n(and best) in its kind. This is EXACTLY the same script. The only\ndifference is that Denzel is a pilot ... they should have called it\n'Leaving the Airline' or better 'Copy Leaving Las Vegas!'\n"
"\nThis movie has a strong cast, headed by one of my favorite actors.\nAfter some needless frontal nudity and lurid scenes from the drug\nunderworld, the film gets to the crash sequence that put the bodies\ninto the theater seats. But that is the high point of this story.\nAfterward, the plot meanders around, detailing the seamy excesses of\nits main character and doing little else, until it reaches its highly\nunrealistic, highly unsatisfying climax. I thoroughly disliked Denzel\nWashington's character, which shows, I guess, what a good job he did,\nsince I like the actor himself very much. But his skill isn't enough to\nredeem this dud of a story. Halfway through the climactic scene, I\nrealized what was coming, and I felt very much ripped off, as though\nI'd been treated to a preachy and inferior remake of \"Days of Wine and\nRoses.\" Gratuitous nudity, f-words, and grungy bathroom scenes\nnotwithstanding, it's still at bottom just a corny endorsement of\nAlcoholics Anonymous. I cannot recommend this movie.\n"
"\nNo matter the decade, a lot of actors worth their salt feel compelled\nto mine the depths of the abyss that is alcoholism - Jack Lemon in\n\"Days of Wine and Roses,\" Nicolas Cage in \"Leaving Las Vegas,\" Jeff\nBridges in \"Crazy Heart,\" to name just a few.<br><br>The trouble with this one, perhaps unique to me, is that it's not the\nDenzel Washington I want to see on screen. I want the Denzel with the\nswagger, the one who chases a runaway train before it takes out a town\nin its path and who relieves Gene Hackman of his command on a nuclear\nmissile sub before a war is started and who swears vengeance on the bad\nguys who kidnap the little girl he's been hired to protect.<br><br>I want the Denzel who's in control, because the world can be a pretty\nscary place, and it's good to know there are people out there - people\nyou don't even know - who will come to your rescue if the situation\nwarrants it. I should have left after the crash sequence.<br><br>For more reviews, visit http://samoncinema.blogspot.com - a blog for\npeople who like movies and dogs.\n"
"\nThis movie is not. <br><br>The ending was unbelievably bad. How many times have we seen that? The\nend of Straw Dogs with Dustin Hoffman comes to mind, only less so.\nThere are scenes where the acting is just awful, including especially\nthe breakfast scene when Cheadle appears for the first time. Setting up\nthe status of the investigation to inform the audience was like being\nspoon fed, and by wooden, inept characters. And not in a good way.\nGoodman, while intended to be over the top, was playing crazy for the\nsake of playing crazy. Not genuine, not believable, not good. I love\nthe guy, but that character was terrible, and terribly delivered.<br><br>Juke\n"
"\nThe only reason why I'm garnered up 4 stars for this is because of the\nfirst 30 minutes leading up to the interesting flight scenes which are\nreally gripping and due to Denzel's awesome performance. I have no\ndoubt that Denzel totally rocks in acting, but I really prefer him in\nthe more action roles like \"Training Day\" , \"Safe House\" , \"Out of\nTime\" etc. The movie takes off really well... until the \"Flight\"\ncrashes ..literally. After that, it's total downhill. I never figured\nout the requirement of Kelly Reilly in this movie. The movie would be\nexactly the same without her. OK, I am wrong here... the movie would be\nBETTER without her. And of course, the way it ends is soooo\ndisappointing. I feel they could have done much more with this movie.\nIf you really want to see Denzel's acting and waste time, I suggest you\nwait for the DVD.\n"
"\nMovie was interesting until the end  the most stupid \"goody 2 shoes\"\nHollywood self-righteous **** I've ever seen.<br><br>As usual Hollywood sticks \"God\" into most of the film, to please the\nGod fearing sheep apparently  instead of making a great and realistic\nmovie.<br><br>Damn, such a disappointment. If you want to watch this movie, do\nyourself a favor and don't have any expectations after half an hour or\nso  because no, it's not going to get better.<br><br>I'm so mad that they ruined a great movie that I give this a 1 star.\nBut it should get a 6.5 or so, I feel they wasted my time after half an\nhour onwards though.\n"
"\nFlight takes the real life crash of an Alaska Airlines plane and turns\nit into a story about alcohol and redemption.<br><br>The fiction is hard to take. It is not possible to control a plan with\nthe jackscrew snapped and the elevator pushing down - which is what\nhappened with Alaska. But Denzel pulls it off, you watch.<br><br>Aside from the complete unreality of the plane \"flight\", the movie just\nlags on and on. In a way, this movie promotes drug use. It says cocaine\nis good for recovery when you're on a major beer and hard liquor binge.\nImagine someone watching and trying that theory out for real - and\nlosing.<br><br>I also couldn't figure out why a heroin addict (they are everywhere in\nfilm and TV these days) was at an AA meeting. Last time I checked,\nheroin doesn't let you do anything but more heroin. Like I said, this\nfilm, quite possibly, is a promo for drug use.<br><br>To sum up, it's hard to like the character here, and when you don't\nlike him, it's a bad sign. I really wanted flight to be good, but it\nwasn't for me. 3/10.\n"
"\nFlight stars Denzel Washington as Whip Whitaker, a pilot who can fly a\npassenger jet through the eye of a needle even though he's downed\nenough alcohol to put Haystacks Calhoun on his keester.<br><br>Whitaker is no stranger to other mind-altering substances. He\napparently can drink ten gallons of 150 proof hooch, fall asleep, then\nget himself back on his feet by snorting several lines of cocaine. And\nwith all those drugs swirling around in his liver, he can expertly\nmaneuver a disabled airplane upside-down (to be clear, it's the\nairplane that's upside-down. Although the Whipster could likely fly it\nstanding on his head). What a stud!<br><br>However this is a pretty good movie. You'll really enjoy it if you\nfirst dispose of your jaded negativity.\n"
"\nIt might not be the smartest movie ever. It might not be the most\nrealistic movie ever. It might not be Denzel's best performance.<br><br>But I'll be damned if someone didn't have a good time watching this\nmovie. Not too many clichés (except for the bloody Rolling Stones\nsoundtrack), a seriously involving personal struggle, a truly unheroic\n(and how many times do you see that in American movies anymore)\ndepiction of a man losing grip with his self and reality. And of course\nJohn Goodman, no need to justify this.<br><br>When it comes to rating a movie, there's a question to be asked: \"would\nyou see it again?\"<br><br>Any time, I answer.\n"
"\nFlight is a really really provocative movie. It's an epic story of a\nman that is torn in the inside. Denzel Washington's performance is\ntextbook. He's amazing, breathtaking. Throughout the movie, he's the\nmost hateful character in my opinion, but at the same time he's a hero.\nA really well balanced movie between two extremes. A movie that\nbalances between divine and devastation. <br><br>He's probably the worst and biggest enemy of himself. He's many things\nbut when the lies pile up that much, and when time comes to show if\nhe'll once more let everyone down, he makes the right decision and gets\nrewarded for it. A reward that is not material in nature but more of a\nmoral one. <br><br>This movie is highly recommended. Highly!\n"
"\nThe Opening flight scene off this movie is really really awesome. They\ncan me make feel like i am sitting on that plane, it makes me stop\nbreathing for a second. Then i said WOW! inside the coffee shop without\ncaring about the others people eyes. But after that the movie cannot\nkeep the tone of it. <br><br>So after the flight scene the movie was so boring it made me feel like\ni just watch some normal dramatic scene which i can find in the other\ndrama Hollywood movies. The movie will make you think that next scenes\nwill be great like the flight scene but actually in the end it is not.<br><br>So if you plan to find some movies that very excited and easy so\nunderstand i would not recommended this one, but if you want to see\nsome dramatic movie that you might drop a little bit of you tear this\nmight be your answer.\n"
"\nThis is mostly a showcase for Denzel Washington and the airplane\nscenes, but it works. Washington shows up for a pilot's duty after a\nwild night of sex, booze, and cocaine, and, after the plane hits\nturbulence, makes a heroic effort and manages to crash land it with\nminimal loss of life and damage and is praised for his efforts.\nHowever, things change after an investigation.<br><br>I think this movie shows how people can rise and fall and can be both a\nhero and a goat in the public's eye, especially after much scrutiny.\nWashington's performance was first-rate, and the cast was good, and\neverything works. It might not work for everyone, though.<br><br>** 1/2 out of ****\n"
"\nIn the beginning, i thought this movie was really going to be boring\nand depressing, because all we are seeing is, a man taking drugs with a\nlot of women. However, the scene where the plane was going down and\neveryone was panicking, my eyes were glued to finding out what happened\nnext. I was pretty shocked that a man who took bad drugs, was able to\nland a plane safely without killing everybody on board, except for the\nsix victims who were unfortunately killed. This movie really reminded\nme of the dramatizations shown on Air Crash Investigation. <br><br>I was so convinced, Denzel Washington's character was gonna tell his\nguilt to the court in the end of his drug taking. This movie really\nshows how pilots can be easily lead on taking drugs which can be\ndangerous for their health on harming themselves or others. If you are\nreading my review of this movie, please make sure to watch what you\ntake and don't bloody fly the plane!\n"
"\nA very well executed film, in my opinion. Acting is great from Denzel,\nDon, and various others later on. The realistic portrayal of the plane\ncrash done the film a huge credit. It kept my heart out to Whip until\nthe climax. The struggle of an alcohol addiction was done out very well\nin this film. Denzel does a great job at showing all of that, and also\nat the climax. The film does throw in some spots of humour, to balance\nout the bleak subject, in the form of John Goodman. In the end I feel\nthe film touched on some great issues of denial, blaming, and\naddiction, and shows hope through addiction. A film I would definitely\nwatch again.\n"
"\nI just watched this film again after a few years. One of the hallmarks\nof a good movie for me is if I get something more and perhaps a little\ndifferent take on it upon seeing it again. This fits that criteria for\nme. As a pilot myself I like the aviation sub plot.<br><br>This is one of Denzel Washington best performances IMHO. He is a\nfavorite actor for me and deserves more attention for his work. The\ncasting was excellent. Kelly Reilly has a certain kind of style to her\nacting and she fit the Nichole part well. The acting in this film is\nterrific by nearly all of the characters and makes it worth watching\nmore than once.\n"
"\nI am a huge fan of Denzel as I find him phenomenal in action, drama,\nhorror and suspense. This one was no different. Great story line and\nprogression of the end results. It started great with a plot bar none\nthat I am sure anyone who has flown has thought about. However, I found\nthe end abrupt that left a lot of loose ends I thought would have been\ngreat to follow through on. The main female flight attendant I felt\nneeded following through. I get he did not want the blame pinned on her\nbut her role in the beginning and at the funeral I felt required giving\nher more credit then she was given. Would I watch again, sure. Would I\nhave paid to see this in the theater, I would have been disappointed if\nI had.\n"
"\nThis guy is a functioning alcoholic and he has a flight problem that\ncauses a life problem for some of the passengers. Gradually he comes to\ncases with his life long problem with booze and drugs. He's a gifted\npilot and he gets away with his shenanigans for a long time. The reason\nthat Washington was so good at this role is because he very likely is a\nstoner in real life. The opening shot features a beautiful actress\nstark naked, so that's an extra bonus. Later on it's another junkie\nchick who is there to illustrate something or other. The scene with the\nAA meeting makes me glad I don't attend anymore. But I still have\nalmost 11 years. I also never operated anything but a dice layout when\nI was stoned, so, no worries there. In closing, this movie is okay and\nI have watched it twice. Fortunately it was not that memorable so\nwatching it the second time was fairly interesting.\n"
"\nI like Denzel Washington and was looking forward to watching this\nmovie, it sounded quite interesting and rang a bell that it might be\nloosely based on real events. But early on I started to \"have a bad\nfeeling about this\" which just got stronger until I found myself\nyelling \"what rubbish!\" during the very predictable and truly awful\nlast 30 minutes.<br><br>I can't criticise any of the players, I think they all acted their\nparts well. But what a terrible trite script. What nonsense! So much of\nwhat happened just clearly wouldn't have happened the way this was\nwritten. I despair. It's rare that I come away from a movie feeling\nthat my time was robbed, unfairly taken away from me, but in this case,\nit was.<br><br>Avoid.\n"
"\nThis is amazing Everybody most see<br><br>Thanks Denzel Washington Denzel Washington <br><br>This is a big movie Denzel Washington did a great job! This film starts\nout looking like a moral dilemma, an heroic story with a big change<br><br>Story: Very well. A bit obvious, but that is not always bad.<br><br>Cinematography: I really know nothing about the art except what I like.\nI found this done well.<br><br>Acting: We knew Mr. Washington would be superb, but the supporting cast\nwas also superb.<br><br>Fantastic!!! Every body must see it\n"
"\nI expected more. Denzel's acting was great but the story left much to\nbe desired. We could have had a close to real like story but it\nstrayed. It went well until we find Denzel able to drink massive\namounts of alcohol and yet still be alive. He was also able to elude\nthe press for days and all the while boozing it up. He apparently had\nfew friends except for Nicole he found while smoking in the hospital.\nYes, we see much time in denial.<br><br>The role by John Goodman seemed to be an after thought cameo appearance\nwith high billing as the over the top drug provider and friend.<br><br>As for the ending, I have never seen a hotel refrigerator stocked with\nsuch alcohol and again he would not be alive if he had consumed it all.\nBut we see him coherent after a few snorts of cocaine. Why did the\nwriters do it this way? <br><br>It could have been a much more complex closer to real life story of a\npilot with an alcohol and drug problem dealing with the tragedy, the\npress, the investigation, and strained personal relationships.\n"
"\nThe first 20 minutes of Flight are fantastic and riveting. Denzel\nWashington gives an amazing performance of an alcoholic airline pilot\nwith incomparable flying skills, who gets caught in a sticky situation.\nThe rest of the cast, including Don Cheadle and Bruce Greenwood, are\nrock solid. <br><br>Unfortunately, after the first half hour or so, it begins sliding into\na color-by-numbers, overly formulaic script that contains more\ncoincidences, improbabilities, and absurd events than any script should\nbe expected to withstand. Then adds quite a bit of schmaltz on top of\nit.<br><br>I won't give away any details, but will only say that those\nimprobabilities grow so extreme that by the last 20 minutes of the\nfilm, it's absolutely groan worthy. And it's a shame, because Mr.\nWashington gives such a strong performance, and Mr. Zemeckis is a\ntop-notch director. However, it seems that no matter how much the\nscreenwriter or director wanted to do an edgy movie, they both find a\nway of cleaning it up and sanding down any rough corners.\n"
"\n'Flight forces you to view the safe crash from another perspective'\nthat's what I summarised the movie with. In the first few scenes of the\nmovie you see a drunk pilot saving a lot of lives, but still losing a\nfew. My reaction immediately was: \"What a great pilot, saving so many\nsouls\". The movie however, suddenly turns dark and forces you to view\nthe crash from another point of view; from the dead passengers. Even\nthough, technically, the plane was not in 'tip-top' state and not ready\nto be flown, the pilot wasn't in good state either. You, as a viewer,\nslowly start to realise the technical problem wasn't even the biggest\nproblem: the pilot was. As the pictures start rolling by you realise\nthat \"the pilot wasn't great, he wasn't good.\" He pulled some nice\ntricks to keep most passengers alive, but still, putting so many lives\nat risk is even a bigger problem. The slow realisation, as you can call\nit, is one of the strong points of this movie. Even though I don't\nthink Denzel Washington is one of the best actors there is, he did a\ngreat job with this film. An outstanding job.\n"
"\nI could not have been a defense attorney. I have a masters degree in\nTheological Studies so my brain is not that bad. People say I talk well\nenough so my speaking is not that bad either. But human nature is so\n$%&amp;^#'ed up that I would have been in the courtroom screaming and\ncrying and throwing things and threatening judges and prosecutors and\nplaintiffs and plaintiff's lying families, etc. I would have lowered\nmyself and been as bad as everybody I was judging. Robert Zemeckis\ndisturbed me at the end of this movie like he didn't even in What Lies\nBeneath, and it had nothing to do with Denzel Washington flying the\nplane upside down, and it had nothing to do with his drinking problem.\nEVERYBODY AROUND DENZEL WASHING IN THIS MOVIE NEEDED SOMETHING I will\nnot preach about today. For Christ's sake. And I mean EVERYBODY.\nZemeckis gets it. Mankind is evil.\n"
"\nWho would have thought that Robert Zemeckis would be capable of making\na film of such emotional power? A lot of that has to do with the script\nand the fantastic performance by Denzel Washington. Kelly Reilly was\noutstanding too in her role of companion to Whip. Her character is\ncompared to Desdemona in an Othello reference near the start of the\nfilm, which is ironic as I had the pleasure of seeing her play\nDesdemona in a production of Othello in a London theatre. Anyway,\nFlight is a very powerful, emotional character study of a man who I\nwould call a \"functioning alcoholic\". The reason why I only gave this 9\ninstead of 10 stars is that the ending felt a bit trite. However, I\nwould highly recommend this film to anyone, the flight scene was\namazing and you really felt like you were on the plane about to crash.\nWatch and enjoy this near masterpiece!\n"
"\nFlight is one of my best dramatic movies ever. This movie remind me\nabout the nature of all human beings. Which being weak and always\nseeking for pleasure. Whip Whitaker, played by Denzel Washington an\naddicted pilot who find a problem in his plane which led the plane to\nfall. With the good judgment of Captain Whip he could crashes the plane\nin an empty field and saves many lives. However, six people died cause\nthe crash. The investigation indicated that captain Whip was drunk\nduring the flight. And he may have a life sentence. And then begin the\nstory. The story of struggling between being in the real world or being\nin the unreal world. As expected from Denzel Washington the acting was\nmagnificent. On the other hand, I think the plot was a little bit\npredictable. Otherwise, I enjoyed with the special effects. Especially\nin the plane scene. And I can't forget about the amazing ending.\nExtremely, I recommend this movie\n"
"\nHi, This movie is awesome. Even if I have never fly a plane this story\nstroke a chord.<br><br>All the characters are top notch, and the moral story should be \"drug\nand alcool doesn't necessarily make you a bad or not efficient person\".<br><br>Unfortunately the film maker though that a little brainwashing was\nrequired for our hero....<br><br>Anyway, good movie. By the way I don't advocate alcool or drug use, but\nthe conclusion is just too narrow minded. What could have been an\npowerful film turn out into a politic correct movie, which is quite\nsad.<br><br>That being said, none of the actors are guilty of that.<br><br>Thanks, Si Cadaver\n"
"\nAfter many times of trying to watch this movie, I finally managed to\nwatch the whole thing. I'm a Robert Zemeckis fan. I was really hoping\nthis movie would measure up to his past work. It definitely through me\nfor a loop. I was jolted by the crash scene as I found it very intense.\nI honestly thought that the co-pilot had pressed something that caused\nthe malfunction. When I really learned what happened, I was shocked.\nThis movie, however, is VERY slow in the middle part. It seemed like it\ntook forever to get to the ending. I kept waiting for something to\nhappen and was annoyed. I do like this movie, but it's not a favorite.\nI thought it was thought-provoking - much like an action thriller\nshould be - but tiresome after a while. I do recommend this movie but\nbeware that you're going to have to be patient!\n"
"\nAll the bad reviews that I read are essentially written in ego maniacal\nfashion. All the good reviews are by people who detect the societal\nmoral dilemma within in the film. If you are a commercial pilot, and\nthe crash is 20 minutes long, do not base your entire review on the\nplausibility of the crash, because believe or not, the movies is\nabsolutely not about that. Neither is solely about his drug addiction.\nIt seems to suggest how criminal lawsuits can be rigid to a man's\nstory, only looking at facts, not giving weight to desperation versus\nmal-intent. Its an audience splitter. Have to write on more line to\nfill the requirement.\n"
"\nI avoided this show because the concept did not appeal to me. How could\nI empathize with the main character as portrayed in the trailers. Boy\ndid I do myself a disservice.<br><br>Story: Very well written. A bit obvious, but that is not always bad.\nDialogue: Well written and acted.<br><br>Cinematography: I really know nothing about the art except what I like.\nI found this done well. It supported the story and did not detract. <br><br>Acting: We knew Mr. Washington would be superb, but the supporting cast\nwas also superb.<br><br>So, if you are tired of super hero movies and more flash than story\nthis movie is for you. While it is not Casablanca it is very well done,\nand one of the closest modern movies that provides that type of story\ntelling.\n"
"\nThis is an awesome movie with deep stories of family, professionalism,\nfriends, heroism, and addictions. The \"R\" rating is very accurate. I\nknow some partial viewers who may not have previewed it well enough and\nwere disappointed and stopped the video. The story is much deeper in\nthe relating of the addiction traumas than the plane crash heroism and\nsadness. Expect flashbacks to the excellent flying maneuvers and\npassenger and crew reactions. More to the movie than the early flight\nscenes and aftermath. It reminds me somewhat of \"Pulp Fiction\" on a\nmore believable sense for many folks. I saw this video from a library\nDVD. I was pleased with John Goodman's acting, comedy, and high speed\ndelivery.<br><br>Denzel is great in all facets of the complex character and a thought\nprovoking conclusion.\n"
"\nFrom the trailer, you might think this is a special-effects laden\nblockbuster with a bit of court intrigue and a heroic outcome. Which is\ngreat because the masses need fooling into watching what is, in actual\nfact, an intense and ultimately beautiful portrayal of one man's\naddiction his journey to a conclusion. Washington truly does give the\nperformance of his life. Washed-up, slightly tubby, convinced of his\nown lies and self-centred, his character is a hero and arch villain in\none. Zemeckis has directed some of the biggest movies of the past 30\nyears and yet this film is most closely related to one of his least\ncommercially successful - Contact - in that it takes a huge,\nspectacular theme and surrounds it with carefully crafted stories of\npersonal failure and spiritual success. Beautiful, moving and really\nreally unexpected.\n"
"\nI'm a Denzel's biggest fan, I watched this movie with high\nexpectations, but unfortunately it was a disappointment ! it contains a\nmessage for the alcoholics and the community, but for me, this message\nwas presented in the most cliché way possible. the struggle with\nalcoholism was fascinated, with a touching and mind blowing performance\nfrom Denzel. The story in general was good, but the ending was more\nlike a high- school essay written by a teenager to make every thing\ngood. It was confusing, for me, life doesn't make sense, and there is\nno ultimate good in it, in this movie, a man, who was really a\nsuperhero fell into the illusion of common sense, he made a very stupid\ndecision at the end. The writer can reach to that message in a more\nclever, out-of-the box way, but he, the writer, intentionally took a\ndirect and a trivial approach. at the end, Denzel's performance was\namazing, the plane scenes were very professional, the overall\nstory-line is OK but the ending ruined everything.\n"
"\nThis film has brought denzel back to his brilliant best after his\nrecent below standard performances in unstoppable and safe house, he\nplays this character like no other actor could, with heart, emotion and\nsheer sincerity, Goodman who doesn't appear often brings the laughs and\nthose head nodding moments, johns character is wrote similar to one he\nplayed in the big lebowski but that is definitely not a bad thing, the\nfilm itself told a great tale of one mans fight to become a better\nperson and the realism of his mistakes in life, it delved deeper than i\nthought and showed addiction in a way that only trainspotting could\nrival, great performances from the cast alongside a wonderfully told\nstory makes this a must see in 2013.\n"
"\nAn excessive alcoholic pilot makes a successful plane crash and\nheroically saved almost all people on board. But later during\ninvestigation of that flight, he starts to fight against his dark\ndrunken nature to disprove his intoxication as the cause of crash.\nZemeckis is superbly back to the real mainstream world after a long era\n:p The storyline is excellent and bears a deeper message about the\nprohibition of alcohol and drugs!!!! The flight-crash scene takes too\nmuch engrossment to make thrilled :p Denzel Washington appears again at\nhis best. He provides a super-notched performance to play a perfect\ntipsy role and solely carries the plot with elegance :D\n"
"\nI saw this with trepidation after reading the main page's review on\nthis film of 1/10 not expecting much, but to be honest, I was most\nmoved by it overall. Yes it starts brilliantly with the plane bit, and\ndoes get kind of drag in the middle, but it all sort of came together\nat the end. Quite moving, and funny in places. There's an all star cast\nin this so you kind of expect it to be big and I wasn't disappointed\nhence the 7/10. Brilliantly acted by Denzel and a must see especially\nif you're a fan of his art. Well recommended by me. Enjoy. And watch\nout for Denzel's short term gf in this. She's only had bit parts in\nEnglish TV and pulled off a great performance.\n"
"\nDenzel Washington is really the pillar that holds this movie up. Had it\nbeen anyone else, this movie would fail. The film is okay, and not a\nbad watch by any means but lacks much needed details. <br><br>Instead of focusing on the details needed, they put in details that\nhave nothing to really do with the plot or add to the story. They also\ndon't really go in depth of how the plane actually started falling\nuntil the last 15 minutes, and by then it was really dragging along.\nGreat concept but poor execution. <br><br>I felt like I wanted to stop watching at about the halfway mark, but I\nkept watching. The movie takes off well, but falls flat in the middle.\nThe ending picks back up slightly as our main character takes a turn\nfor the worst. Generally, however, he isn't a very likable character,\nand I feel that plays a major role in why I didn't enjoy this film a\nlot.<br><br>Is it worth it to see in theaters? Possibly. I'd recommend you get this\nfilm on BluRay or DVD when it comes out because its definitely not a\n\"must see\" film of 2012.\n"
"\nIt was an intense movie. Flight grabs your attention from start to\nfinish and challenges our thoughts, beliefs, fears, cares and moral\nconscience. <br><br>It is a compelling story showing heroism in an individual trapped and\ndying to be free. \"Freedom is not about doing what we feel like doing\nbut accepting what is true\".<br><br>It is not for the faint of heart but a movie that shows heart. It is\nnot about taking the easy road but turning around and making a\ndeliberate change for the best. Flight is a compelling movie and\ndelivers a simply message that freedom seeks the truth.\n"
"\nThe film presents an ethical dilemma of the ill-fated flight as a\nstruggle between truth, gratitude and friendship unfolds. You'll\ndefinitely walk out of this movie with something to talk about when it\ncomes to ethics. Whether you think \"Whip's\" character is a good guy or\nbad guy it's hard not to cheer for a guy who saved dozens of lives but\nthen feel contempt for his seemingly unshakable vice. <br><br>As others have mentioned, the crash sequence is one of the best opening\nscenes in any film. It's arguably as riveting as the beach storming\nopening in Saving Private Ryan. The movie focuses heavily on Whip's\nalcoholism and substance abuse. He struggles to abstain from drinking\neven when it made clear to him that it could cost him his job and his\nfreedom. <br><br>In the end, Whip does what many will consider to be the right thing,\nbut doesn't really give the reason as to why. He had strong feelings\nfor one of the deceased crew members but whether he comes clean to\nprotect her honor or because he's tired of lying is not quite clear.\n"
"\nI loved this movie even though it was different than what I expected\nbased on the trailer. The plane scene was intense, but was not the main\npart of the movie. The characters in this film were fantastic as was\nthe acting. Denzel did a fantastic job in this movie, as did Kelly\nReilly. They were very convincing in the roles they were in. I felt\ndeeply affected by this film and was so glad that I saw it. The\ncinematography was also very good and I was impressed with the\nattention to detail. There were a couple of editing errors, but nothing\nthat took away from the overall film. I gave it only an eight due to\nthe nudity and a few too many unnecessary f*** bombs.<br><br>I would highly recommend this movie, especially if you like character\nfilms.\n"
"\nThis is a great film, it was very entertaining and very dramatically at\ntimes, but most of all it was very well acting from all and especially\nWhip Whitaker played by Denzel Washington is a great character.<br><br>It is actually the performance of Denzel that really keeps this film\ntogether, it is very nuanced and balances out the plot and story that\ncould have needed a little more work I guess.<br><br>Very realistic, well you hope nothing like this happens to you. Very\nentertaining, in the way that it is good acting and intense the follow.<br><br>Basically a great film, because of a lot of things, so you should watch\nthis if you haven't already, it has a lot of interesting aspects.\n"
"\nAs a 40+ year professional pilot, I can almost always manage to watch\nand enjoy any movie that involves airplanes, but this debacle was so\nawful, I couldn't make it all the way through even after trying on 3\nseparate occasions. The plot, the acting and the script were just\nabysmal, other than that it wasn't too terrible. At least I didn't pay\nmoney to watch this abortion. I can't understand why directors don't\njust go ahead and hire a professional pilot to consult when they make\nmovies about airplanes, it would be a minor expense and would help to\neliminate the idiotic and embarrassing mistakes they all seem to love\nso much.\n"
"\nA good performance from Denzel Washington as the alcoholic flight\ncaptain starts with him having a sex scene with a 10+ bodied white\nprostitute, bushy beaver and all, and getting up in the morning for a\ncouple of hits of liquor before he goes to work. Unfortunately, it's a\nshitty day and his 'plane soon flies into a nightmarish storm and\ndevelops problems that eventually, after a hair-raising few minutes\nthat might put a few million Americans off flying ever again, Denzel is\nforced to fly upside down to try to rectify them. Finally, he wakes up\nalive and is rushed to hospital where, horror of horrors, he faces an\ninvestigation. There is a way out by blaming it his dead co-pilot, but\nhe does not take it and confesses to alcoholism, getting a heavy prison\nsentence that will wreck his life. The movie is really about alcohol\nand not flight, and the title should really be changed. A good outing\nby Back to the Future director Robert Zemeckis. It apparently made $60m\nprofit.\n"
"\nHaving found myself in the middle of situations created by alcoholics\noften during my life, I found Denzel Washington's portrayal of such an\nalcoholic spot on. From accentuating an amazing single accomplishment\nto the utter denial of his condition, I believe he was spot on. He is\nsuch a good actor, willing to play a heavy with a soft edge, yet stay\ntrue to character, that at times it is hard to dislike him. I truly\ndisliked his character throughout; his arrogance, self satisfaction,\nand smugness really aroused my senses. If there's a criticism, it's\nmore with the formulaic plot, the deck stacking, the carelessness of\nthose who surround these people. Nevertheless, when one's greed and\nother motivations play a factor, they can lead to unpredictability, so\nI guess this is forgivable. This is a movie about contrition. When one\ngets to the brink it can go either of two ways. Decide for yourself if\nit works.\n"
"\nThis is not an amazing movie, nor is it a bad movie. It is enjoyable\nwith all actors involved portraying believable characters.<br><br>The strongest parts of the film are the first 30 minutes and the last\n30 minutes. Your brain can switch off during the middle as it is quite\nboring and doesn't impact the ending. True it does build the story\ntowards the climax and develops the main character but overall who can\nmiss it and it won't make any difference.<br><br>Of particular note is the hotel rooms scene near the end. Really funny\nand brought back memories similar to a friend of mine known also for\ntheir 'vices'.\n"
"\nAt best, I was only mildly interested throughout.<br><br>Washington was good, at times. The first scene, the drunk scene at his\nfarm and the scene at the AA meeting in jail at the end were the best.\nMany times actors squeak through a nomination based on a couple scenes.\nSometimes even one. But he was not consistent throughout.<br><br>One of the complaints I've heard is the character was not likable. I\ndidn't see that. Drunks can be extremely selfish. But there were many\ninstances where he was not. A few where he was actually kind.<br><br>The hearing at the end was very anti-climatic for me. It didn't help\nthat they played that scene at the Oscars before I saw it. But he\nadmitted his guilt very matter-of-factly. Not original. And I didn't\nneed anymore after the following scene at the jail, much less the\nprison cell and the kid visiting.<br><br>And there wasn't really a middle act. The crash scene was less than\nstellar as when he turned the plane upside down (which may be\naccurate), it just seemed silly in movie terms.<br><br>I'd miss it. Washington was not a good enough draw.\n"
"\nFlight is one of the better movies released this year. Its a emotional\nmovie and I think it served this movie well.The entire cast was great,\nthat you can't say for a ton of movies that have been released\nlately.The story it's self flowed evenly thru the movie.I haven't seen\nto many negative reviews of this movie and that's a good thing.It shows\na lot of reviewers and movie goers know a good movie when they see\none.For the few negative reviewers of this movie , I bet Hangover 2 and\nTransformers are movie master pieces in their eyes.And that's really\nsad.I hope Hollywood producers and directors take more time to release\nmovies with better story's, plots, and drama.\n"
"\nIt's amazing a director like Zemekis didn't search any help from a\naviation expert to do this movie. The scenes from airplane are a all\nbunch of crap. This is almost unbelievable. Getting full power after\ncutting off the engines??? If the stabilizer was blocked in a full down\nposition how did the airplane stabilized in level flight in the end?\nspeed-brakes with no hydraulics??? flaps and gear, no hydraulics???\nPerforming passengers speech out of the cockpit? I don't think so. No\nprocedures in the cockpit??No checklists?? What kind of airline was\nthat? Dear Zemekis there are millions of pilots, with families and\nfriends and airplane enthusiasts around the world.Don't assume\neverybody is stupid about aviation issues.\n"
"\nStupidly, I watched this on a plane.<br><br>While an incredibly good movie, it was frightening movie to watch, it\nwas hard not to imagine my pilots doing the same thing Denzel was.<br><br>That said, now that I'm safe on land, I loved the progression of\ncharacter and how he slowly drags everyone around him down with him. It\nwas an incredibly acted and directed movie.<br><br>They also are seemingly very realistic, you can't just go cold turkey\nwhen it comes to drugs and alcohol, as he tries to do multiple times.<br><br>I'm sure there are other movies similar in style to this one, but thus\nfar in my life it seemed very new and the depressive nature of\nstorytelling really kept my attention. <br><br>Overall very impressive on all accounts.\n"
"\nYou watch movie for first 10 min and you can be sure that this movie is\ngoing to be exhilarating. A great start of the movie with Denzel a\nheavy alcohol addict rides the plane. Ride doesn't start smoothly and\nvery soon plane develops malfunctioning and then Denzel Washington\nbeing the pilot of plane, makes a great attempt to avoid the full\ncrash. And being an alcoholic and drug addict, how is he gonna prove\nthat its plane malfunctioning not him responsible to the plane\ncrash.Though it gets slightly boring in the middle, it makes up toward\nthe end. Other characters doesn't really make an impression and Denzel\nsteals the show. Overall a great act by Denzel and a treat to watch.\n"
"\nOne of the things I hate the most about modern films is that they\nsometimes try to sell them as something they're not.<br><br>This film is a very good example of that because watching the trailer\nyou tell yourself that this is a movie about a miraculous plane crash,\nand that the plot is going to be about how it was possible that Denzel\nWashington saved all these people. I was expecting anything, really,\nthey even could've throw in some paranormal events into the story just\nfor the sake of a plot like the one presented in the trailer. <br><br>Truth is, this film is miles away from it's advertisement. It has\nnothing to do with thriller and mystery, and the plane crash is only\nhere to set up the real subject of the movie : the main character's\nalcoholism. I do have to give this film some credit for a very\nrealistic and well- showed plane crash scene but this was still a big\ndisappointment. Hope that trailers will change one day and actually\nsell a film as it is.\n"
"\nA great movie, riveting from the first scene to well, the last 15\nminutes or so.<br><br>The biggest let down for me was the typical Hollywood, politically\ncorrect ending, which in my opinion is very unnecessary and counter\nintuitive. Had the movie ended on the moment captain Whitaker walks\ninto that NTSB hearing, it would've been just as effective and probably\nmore moving.<br><br>As for Denzel Washington's performance, there's no doubt he's delivered\none of the best in his career. He literally held the movie together\nsingle-handedly; you'd struggle to find a scene without him in it. It's\nlike watching a heavy weight champ at work, he knows exactly when to\ndeliver a punch and where to deliver it to. I'm glad to see him finally\nback in this kind of roles after so many forgettable ventures in the\nlast 10 years.\n"
"\nFirst of all: I expected an action movie with one of my favorite actors\n(Dezel forever!!), but I got a drama about a hero with a massive\nalcohol problem. The action sequence (flight catastrophe) is only\nshort, but nevertheless very intense. The rest is about the\ninvestigation of the flight catastrophe and about how different people\nhandle their addictions. As I worked for some time with alcoholics I\nthink I know a little bit about the whole subject. This said, the movie\nis open, direct and without pathos. It shows reality and Denzel is\nwonderful as ever. Therefore the 8 points. But definitely no action\nmovie!\n"
