"\nI'm not going to sugar coat it: this movie stinks. After the\ngut-busting hilarity of the 2009 original, this comedy franchise has\nbeen struck down with a severe case of sequel-itis. The carbon-copy\nsecond instalment was stale for the most part yet still managed a\nhandful of laughs thanks to the general funniness of Zach Galifianakis'\nsocially demented Alan; this episode however, is almost completely\ndevoid of humour. The writing has become increasingly reliant on the\nnatural charisma of the headlining star trio - with the plot here being\nlaborious and woefully lazy - and the irritating Chow (Ken Jeong), the\nweakest link in part one, inexplicably gets even more screen time to\nscreech and make our eardrums bleed. If it weren't for an amusing set\npiece atop Las Vegas' Caesar Palace hotel and a best-for-last gag\nduring the end credits, I would've given this the one star treatment. I\nwas desperately hoping this series would regain some form and finish\nwith a bang, but unfortunately the wolf-pack's last adventure barely\nmakes a whimper.\n"
"\nThis film should have been put in a recycle bin to make some plastic\nDixie cups from. 4 or 5 plastic cups would have been a much better use\nof the material. Its hard for me to believe Cooper and Helms agreed to\nparticipate in this abomination.<br><br>Trouble with this film is its for a 12 or 13 year old, but you need to\nbe 17 to get in and see it. Also the few chuckles in the audience\nsounded like they were from a 79 - 80 IQ patron.<br><br>If you are a 40 year old adolescent or have a room temp IQ you may find\nthis amusing. A level beneath fart jokes, this expletive laden\nnon-script couldn't give anyone a chance to act even if they had the\nskills.<br><br>I wish I'd have spent the 90 minutes reorganizing my garage or deleting\nold emails - and I'm not kidding at all. Hope this saves you an\nexcruciating time (and $) this holiday weekend.\n"
"\nI decided to go and see this film as I am a fan of the first film in\nthe franchise - the second was not enjoyable, but I had hoped the\nconclusion would be a return to form. I was hugely disappointed by the\nlazy script, cruel tasteless gags, and the predictability of the film.\nI love comedies, I have a sense of humour, but I only laughed once or\ntwice. The cruel animal death 'jokes' killed the mood of the film. They\nwere cheap and quite shocking. I know these films are supposed to be\nshocking, but it is not clever or witty to make jokes out of serious\nissues like cockfighting - I didn't want to watch a rooster get slowly\nsmothered by an imbecilic Asian man. I wanted to enjoy a fun experience\nlike I did with the first Hangover film. Mr Chow is a hugely\nirritating, monotonous character, whose only purpose seems to be to\nhurl out nonsense at every opportunity. The Hangover Part III will ruin\nthe experience of the first film for you - if you want a film that is\noriginal, and good fun - avoid this shameless grab for cash. I can\nhonestly say this was a chore to watch. 1/10\n"
"\nI am so disappointed. i absolutely loved the hangover parts 1 &amp; 2, and\nwas so excited about the 3rd installment, even going to see the\nmidnight screening, but was so let down. I still don't even understand\nwhat the writers were trying to do? were all the comedy writers in\nHollywood all sick at the exact same time this script was being\nwritten? Worst of all, No One was Hungover! How can you name a movie\nthe hangover, when it involves no drinking, stupidity or a hangover?\nthe only part i can honestly say i loved was the short after wedding\nskit after the credits. THAT is the movie i wanted to watch, along with\neveryone else in the cinema from what everyone started screaming at the\nscreen. Please make that into an 1 1/2 hour long film to regain the\nhonor of a hangover movie, coz what i watched, was dismal at best.\n"
"\nI could not believe how unfunny this movie was. I kept waiting for even\na single joke to land. It was like they forgot what makes this kind of\npremise funny in the first place. It was truly awful and easily the\nworst movie of the year. The only laugh it got was when my wife and I\nboth looked at each other and laughed that the movie was so unfunny.\nShame on you cast and Director of the Hangover III. I want my money and\ntime invested back. I texted all the people I love and care about and\ntold them not to see this movie. This isn't even a rental. The title\nshould never be mentioned in public ever again. THE WORST! As I am\nwriting this I am still amazed how unfunny this movie was. It was like\nlistening to a story from your grandma about how she went shopping at\nthe grocery store...BORING!\n"
"\nI thought this movie was 2nd best possibly 1st in the trilogy. I hear\nthe term \"no hangover\" that's why it sucked or it was lazy or unfunny\nbut it was a serious drama/comedy the hangover series has a deep story\nin 3 it all comes together the movie was great I have no clue why\npeople hate it but I recommend it. its a good time. also the hangover\npart 3 had a lot of original things from the first one so when people\nsay it what out of plot or unoriginal then there Solly mistaken great\nmovie though I hate all the hate on it doesn't deserve the hate it was\nwell done. it even had done good at the box office and some decent\nreviews so are these hate reviews all from one spam mer or?\n"
"\nTo me it seems they borrowed a plot from another movie/script and\nreplaced the characters with the ones from hangover 1..to get It's\npurely trying to milk out the characters for as much of our money as\npossible. Realising they have run out of ideas for a similar hangover\nmovie. They just borrowed a script somewhere and try to cash in on its\nfamous predecessors. A quick heists before people realize what the\nmovie actually is. A con movie.<br><br>The funniest bit is the Giraffe sequence...but thats only at the\nstart...not even part of the actual movie. Simply an amuse bouche.<br><br>The rest of the movie doesn't have any hangovers in it or really any\ncomedic moments. Just a straight crime-caper trying to be funny.<br><br>Sad sad end and showing the true colors of the makers and participants\nof this movie.\n"
"\nThis movie. Was simply hilarious. A lot of people expected a bit too\nmuch from this Movie, but me personally did not. I have to say, it\nliterally ended with a Bang. People are not thinking about how\ndifficult it will be to make a Hangover III as if you could imagine\nyourself, the Director would be thinking what would be the Hangover\nabout?<br><br>This story has a great twist, and it is best of for you guys to watch\nit yourself spending a couple of coins on the tickets and ''wollah''\nenjoy.<br><br>10/10 Loved it! Specially the End! ( Comes after the Credits, don't\nleave your seats ).\n"
"\nDid anyone actually get drunk in the movie? Why so many gratuitous\nkillings? The only similarity between this rag and the previous\nhangover movies is the actors. Just an awful movie! Don't even rent\nthis thing when its released. I expected more from the \"Chow\" character\nbut was greatly disappointed. Alan? What happened to this character?\nActually none of the characters were as developed as the last movies.\nThis is a major problem because we came to see the third installment\nhoping for a continuation of the previous two and were totally let\ndown. The best parts of this movie must be in the blooper scenes or on\nthe cutting room floor. As I'd mentioned, don't even waste your time\nrenting this when it's released or buying it for that matter.\n"
"\nRight, i'm going to keep this review short and sweet. I went to see\nthis film the day after its release. If i'm honest, I didn't have high\nhopes as part 2 was such a flop. This is not the case for part 3! <br><br>Personally, I thought this was a film of two halves. The first half was\nextremely funny and had me laughing throughout. The second part\nsummarised the film, whilst lacking in the volume of the comedy, it was\nstill present. I definitely would recommend anyone to go see this and\njudge it for yourself. Personally, I am going again in the next few\ndays, that is how much I enjoyed it! I thought it was better than part\n1, but that is my opinion. Go see it for yourself and you will see what\ni mean!\n"
"\nI think people have forgotten what movies like this are all about<br><br>If you want to laugh go see it, laughs are guaranteed ,if you have a\nsense of humour you will. If your uptight and pretentious it's not for\nyou. Go watch something else . If you loved the first 2 you'll like\nthis one . The first 2 are hard to beat but you'll laugh all the same.\nI love the catch phrases. <br><br>To keep it simple its all about Alan , Chow and the wolf pack. Poor\nDoug never gets a start probably because he's boring .Well worth a look\n.I loved it , don't be turned off by the Doug's of the world. There are\ntoo many negative people sharing their opinions.<br><br>Very funny we came out smiling can't beat that\n"
"\nThis movie was not a bad movie at all. if you are willing to kick back\nfor an afternoon and enjoy a flick, this is the one. there is not a\nwhole lot of expectations for this movie. Yes the first one was great\nand the second ( which wasn't bad either even though it was a copy and\npaste)barley made it through. this one takes on a whole new journey\nthat gave a decent conclusion and we get more in depth with the\ncharacters. this movie still had decent comedy and a good story with\nreferences from the first 2. even Chow has more screen time and we get\none more wake up scene at the end with another misfortune. just watch\nit and don't expect too much.\n"
"\nReally?? Terrible?!?!?! it was amazing! If it was even about a\nHangover, then you guys would be mad saying \"It's exactly like the\nfirst\" that's what the whine on number 2 was about! It has a great\nplot, a great story, great actors HILARIOUS ENDING AFTER THE CREDITS!<br><br>And a great ending to the wolf pack journey. It doesn't has a lot of\nsexual material, so it goes where the average R rated hit movie dares\nto go, with hilarious material without being fully sexual. And it has a\nlot of fresh new jokes that wasn't from the first (unlike number 2)<br><br>It's like 21 jump street! Just don't listen to what we think, watch it\nfor yourself!<br><br>Then, you can fuss about it OR enjoy it, completely your mind ;)\n"
"\nThis was absolutely my favorite of all three. With lots of good punch\nlines and funny expressions, this movie delivered a nonstop-laugh!<br><br>Alan and Mr. Chow was in the spotlight, and the story about them two\nwas so incredible well thought about. Mr. Chow the mean and\nstraightforward china man manage to steal all the gold from Marshall\nand Alan helping him without knowing. It's just so hilarious!<br><br>When it comes to acting, I believe they all have developed their\ntechniques and have become really good actors. Bradley Cooper, Ed\nHelms, Zach Galifianakis, Justin Bartha, Ken Jeong and John Goodman\njust to mention the leads of the movie - ONE word, brilliant! This\nmovie is for anyone who wants to have a mega-nonstop-laugh.\n"
"\nI thoroughly enjoyed this movie!! While it was not as good as the\nfirst, It still was a very funny and enjoyable movie! If you Like the\nhangover series, you will like this film. Zach Galafinakis once again\nstole the show, and MR CHOW was also brilliant. Again I do not know why\nthere are so many negative reviews. Of course this is no Oscar winner,\nbut it was still a great comedy movie in my opinion. I enjoyed it a\nlot, and have watched it several times since first seeing it! Do not\nlisten to all of these negative reviews, go and watch it! I have come\non IMDb so many times to check a movie and see all then negative\nreviews, and almost pass on watching a movie. Don't let this happen\nwith hangovver 3! Excellent film. 8/10\n"
"\nZach Galifianakis is now super annoying. When this started, we were\nlaughing at him but his shtick is now tiring. They needed to downgrade\nhis antics from mean-hearted to just simple stupidity. I know Todd\nPhillips is saving it for Alan to grow in this movie. But it started to\nhappen too late.<br><br>Bradley Cooper and Ed Helms seem to be going thru the motions. We miss\nthe face tattoo. They needed to do something to replace it.<br><br>Ken Jeong is actually doing something serious. In the first two, he was\nlovable bad guy. From the first moment as the naked guy in the car\ntruck, we thought he couldn't do much damage. But in this one, he is\ncausing real damage to the group.<br><br>John Goodman is doing a new character Marshall. He's a new bad guy\nlooking to get Mr Chow for stealing his gold. So he kidnaps Doug to\nforce the group to catch Mr Chow for him. It's rather serious, and not\nthat funny.<br><br>It was good to see that Alan finally grow up, and dealt with Mr Chow.\n"
"\nThe wolf pack is back. This time they are going in to take care of one\nof their own, Alan (Zack Galifianakis). He seems to have a lot of evil\nin his life and they want him to realize that he needs to cleanse\nhimself of his life of drugs, bad decisions, and bad company. All is\nwell until Mr. Chow (Ken Jeong) appears back on the scene. This time he\nis a man on the run and this makes for another mayhem adventure. Lots\nof actions pack scenes where the gang gets close to the edge and back.\nDoug even sparks a new love interest in Cassie (Melissa McCarthy). Lots\nof funny scenes and low brow references that have become a hallmark of\nthe Hangover series, there is even a bit of a teaser for a continuing\nof the series in the end credits, so stay tuned. Could there be a\nHangover IV? Who knows but for this one the wolf pack boys are back in\ntown.\n"
"\nThe Hangover Part III Review <br><br>The truth is that Part III of this decent trilogy was pretty good, but\nnot great, and definitely not awesome. I too was lured to the cinemas,\ndue to the fact that there was a lot of controversy (and of course, a\nlot of advertising) to see if that film was good or not.<br><br>The cast was pretty good, with Zach Galifianakis returning -of course-\nand giving a great performance as the funny and weird character of\nAlan, who is actually why a lot of people went to the cinemas for.<br><br>The story advanced pretty well, with no actual \"Hangover\" this time,\nbut with a bunch of nice story twisters and clever lines.<br><br>Unfortunately, the film didn't have the charm of the first film, the\nfilm that introduced us the great company of the \"Wolf Pack\" but I\nbelieve it was better than the second film, because the story\nprogressed better, and the actors were more direct and lovable.<br><br>6.5/10\n"
"\nShort and simple this movie is boring i laughed 3 times in this movie\nand that was small laugh. Except the last minute is great all other 99\nminutes kinda sucked. Don't go into cinema watch it at home. I hope it\nhelps if you don't believe me go and see it but you were warned.\nBecause i don't have anything good to say about this movie and i must\nwrite more text i will say this movie is good if you are drunk.<br><br>As with its predecessors, Part III is built around hugely improbable\nevents which trail along in the wake of the path through life taken by\nthe hugely unbelievable child/man Alan (Zack Galifianiakis), and this\nis both the the greatest strength and the greatest weakness of the\nseries. In the first film, the character was funny and what happened\nwas funny. In Part II, less so. Part III is actually quite dark and,\nwhile there are some laughs, mostly this could have been filmed as a\nstraight crime drama.\n"
"\nWell, as a good cinema fan I get very disappointed with the Part III.\nPart I and II were really great, excellent, original and they deserved\na big 10 for elevated the comedy films to a new and higher level of\nquality. But Part III that's nothing to do with the truly essence of\nHangover film concept. For me the best scene of this Part III is after\nthe first credits in the end! Can you believe in that? That's a scene\ntruly Hangover! I'm sorry to the producers but the rest of the film is\nbad with only a few little things of the genuine Hangover because there\nweren't no surprise scenes, it was very forced jokes. They could keep\nthe same story and do a better End with this team.\n"
"\nThose guys should stop it already. its not funny anymore. never was. <br><br>Well.... maybe was... once. The 1st movie was kinda good and it feels\nlike a fresh idea. But now, its just another pathetic effort for some\ncash grab. The wolfpack didn't give us something new here. the action\nscenes weren't good either. Its just like when peter jackson decided to\nbring up a mere, small, simple, short story of a little hobbit into a\nmuch much much longer-than-needed trilogy. but, that's fine.<br><br>While this movie.. not. stop it. Not everything should be made a\ntrilogy. Not this one.<br><br>And where is mike tyson?\n"
"\nYou could call this the Mr. Chow show. That is because everything from\nthe plot too the punchlines all rely on Mr. Chow. This makes it punch\nless. <br><br>John Goodman is almost totally wasted and then gets wasted halfway\nthrough by Mr. Chow who seems to be threatened by the chance John might\nget a real punchline.<br><br>The blue ray DVD has a lot of extras including a joke about re-casting\nZach. Unfortunately Zach has his worst outing of the series.<br><br>The film goes straight down faster than you can fall off Ceasar's\nPalace. <br><br>I haven't see Chow like this since Purina. They forgot that America\nruns on Dunkin.<br><br>Where is Mike Tyson? We need him chewing on Chow here. Beheading a\nGiraffe would be clever except Zach does it for no real reason other\nthan to cause Jeffrey Tambor to drop dead. After these 2 die, the movie\ngoes with them to the grave.<br><br>At least the pregnant hooker does not get any Hallow Weiners, just the\naudience gets a hallow film. Think this series of films has run it's\ncourse.\n"
"\nOkay first of all. I don't understand all the negative comments. People\ncomplained that the second movie was basically the same exact thing as\nthe first. Now you have people complain that it's different. You can't\nhave it both ways. That being said, yes it was better than the second\nbut by no means better than the first. Instead of flash forwarding to\nafter the hangover and retracing their steps, the wolf pack go on a\nmore traditional \"beginning to end\" journey. It wasn't predictable\n(Chow made sure of that), it had some pretty dark content/humor (hello\nit's rated R), but most importantly it was FUNNY. I was laughing\nliterally the entire movie. Appearances by John Goodman and Melissa\nMcCarthy were just the icing on the cake. All in all - go see it/rent\nit/buy it.... Whatever. And P.S. there is an actual \"hangover\" moment\ngenuine to its predecessors - but you have to wait until after the\ncredits to catch it!\n"
"\nI felt the first one was good, by the third movie they ran out of gas\nand ideas and just milked, very lazy work on behalf of the writers. Not\nworth watching in theaters best to wait until it comes out in DVD,\nthere was no creativity even the second was better. The movie did not\nprovide any fresh or new ideas, it lacked a good plot and it when it\nended I said to myself this is it? I was expecting more out of the\nmovie. It seems like they just rushed to get it done and finished and\ncollected a pay check no passion in the movie at all. The first was was\nthe greatest and the second one was pretty good but the third one\nbombed completely.\n"
"\nLook up \"Phoning it In\" in the dictionary and the definition will now\nbe: \"Not caring a bit about the quality of your work as in he writers\nand actors in Hangover III.\" This flick was worse than bad. Not only\nwas it completely unfunny (unless a decapitated giraffe or killing dogs\nmakes you giggle -- which also makes you a psychopath), it was\noffensive and stupid. The only reason I went was to see glimpses of my\nhome town of Las Vegas. What a complete waste of time and money. Avoid\nthis piece of crap. The actors should be ashamed of themselves for\nagreeing to participate in this exploitive piece of excrement. It is\nonly going to hurt their future careers, I certainly will not go out of\nmy way to see any of them in anything again. P-U. What a stinker.\n"
"\nThis is the most humorLESS film I've ever had the displeasure of\nwatching. Aside from the racism throughout, it just screamed of\n\"milking the cow\". The actors phone it in, the writing is remarkably\nlazy, and the audience has been there and done that.<br><br>This film can only appeal to morons because it's repulsive to anyone\nwith an average brain. It actually hurts to watch these guys on screen\nwith their lame/vulgar jokes. Have you ever had a what if discussion\nthat defied all sense of plausibility and reason? This is exactly that.\nNothing makes any sense. I wish these people would stop making bad\nfilms that will no doubt inspire other filmmakers to also make similar\ncrap to cash in. It's so bad, I think it harms society.<br><br>There's nothing to see here. It's a total waste of time.\n"
"\nThe plot fits the \"Hangover\" title, but not because the events occurred\ndue to a wild party, but due to the events from the original. I love\nthe performance of John Goodman. The very last scene was the most funny\npart. Asides from those two points, the movie fell flat. There were no\nlaugh-out-loud moments and some of the jokes fell flat (i.e.\ndecapitation). Did Bradley Cooper even want to do this movie? He acted\nas if he was just going through the motions. Melissa McCarthy is\nshowing up everywhere, so I understand why they added her to the movie,\nbut she didn't add anything to it. The movie focused way too much on\nChow, portrayed by Ken Jeong, and NOT the \"Wolfpack.\" If you were\nbruised from Part II and are debating whether to go to the theater or\nwait for it to be available at home, I recommend you wait to watch it\nat home. There are too many movies out or coming out that are worth the\nticket price.\n"
"\nSo I just came from seeing the 10:30am showing at Arden Fair and I\ngotta say all I could think about was walking out and having a\ncigarette. Yes, the movie had its few funny lines, but NOTHING like the\n1st or 2nd that were FULL of comedy. Not a bad movie, meaning I've seen\nworse, but NOT the can't catch my breath comedy I've come to expect\nfrom the trilogy! The actors did great as always but the story-line did\ntoo much and made the \"funny guys\" almost extras to a poor movie. I'm\nsure many will run off to see this movie as I did BUT if I knew then\nwhat I know now, I'd wait for it to come out to the Redbox for $1\n(SERIOUSLY). The upside since a refund isn't an option is I'm hoping\nWalmart lowers the DVD price of HO2 to $5 to complete my collection,\nsince I'm clearly not interested in buying #3. Your welcome in advance\nLOL...No,seriously! #RefundWanted\n"
"\nI thought that the Hangover III was a really good movie. From my\nopinion, there were many scenes that were really funny. Some people\nclaim that there are inappropriate scenes where sex and drugs are\ninvolved but from just hearing the name \"Hangover\" that should not be a\nsurprise. If you enjoy comedies I would recommend you to watch this\nmovie. I would not say it is one of the best and funniest movie I have\never seen but it is sure one of my top 10 on my list. However, it lacks\nthe charm that made the first Hangover movie so good. This movie would\nbe a perfect movie to watch when you are ridiculous hangover and feel\nto relax and watch a really good and funny movie.\n"
"\nBradley Cooper while sitting in a Tiajuana Bar says \"What the f**k am I\nwatching\". And that sums it up.<br><br>If this were a stand alone movie and there was no \"Hangover\" it would\nbe judged as an mediocre action comedy. Because \"Hangover\" set the bar\nand \"Hangover 2\" lowered the bar, this effort runs a distant third.<br><br>After a few jokes and light hearted moments of killing the giraffe, and\nAlan's father dying which you know from the excellent trailer, things\nturn. It is hard to remember anything funny once the fighting cocks are\nintroduced. The smothering of one under a pillow set the tone for the\nrest of the movie.<br><br>The charm of the first \"Hangover\" is missing. Alan adds a few moments\nin a forced scene with the child that was the baby in the original.<br><br>If shooting people is your idea of funny you might find a laugh. There\nis one anti-Semitic joke attempt that just thuds. If you miss the wolf\npack look for the original on a platform that comes into your home. It\nis amazing how good this makes the original \"Hangover\" look.\n"
"\nThey should have stopped after 1, though 2 was not terrible. This one,\nhowever, was simply a way of sucking more money out of the series, and\nthey got some of ours (though fortunately at matinée prices). There are\nsome laughs, but not nearly as many as you'd expect, and they've turned\nChow into too significant a character. He was much funnier in the\nshorter role in the original. They've also put too much emphasis on the\nsuspense portion of the plot (an it's not particularly suspenseful at\nthat). Alan's character moves from being that of a naive innocent to\nsomething far crueler and darker, which I didn't enjoy either. The\nfunniest part of the movie, and the one that takes you back to the\nappeal of the original, occurs after the credits start to roll, so\ndon't run out in disgust once they do.<br><br>If you really want to see how the series ends, save yourself some cash\nand wait for the video release. Wish we had spent out money on\nsomething else.\n"
"\nI thought this one was better than the second sequel but of course, the\nfirst one is still the best. This movie doesn't even have a \"hangover\".\nIt's just about the same characters and revolves around Alan. The movie\nbegins in a disgusting way, with Alan decapitating a giraffe. They\nreally shouldn't have showed that.<br><br>Any ways, Mr. Chow has stole some money from a gangster and the\ngangster believes the Wolfpack is the way to find it. He holds Doug\nhostage and wants the guys to bring him Chow. They track down Chow and\nrob a house and get back stabbed and then go back to Vegas. And even\nmore hi-jenks ensue. Alan even meets a lady.<br><br>FINAL VERDICT: It was OK, had some funny moments, but I don't think\nanyone expects it to be as good as the first one.\n"
"\nSo first thing straight, this movie is the 3rd part of the Hangover\nseries but unlike the first two, there is no Hangover and the a similar\nstory line, where they try to remember what happened! Right here\neveryone looses their mind!<br><br>But if you look at it closely, it's actually better this way! There is\nstill the chemistry, specially with Chow, and throughout the movie you\nwill laugh &amp; smile! Also the ending was hilarious giving an open spot\nfor a maybe Part 4! You should definitely watch it, if cynical, at\nleast at home.<br><br>9/10\n"
"\nWhen I saw this movie I was excited to see it The Hangover part 3,yeah!\nyou would think right? but when I saw it was humorless, no plot and\nlast but no least NO hangover it was just trying to get money from Chow\nwho was even goofier in this one, haha. I mean I think they could of\ndone it a lot better. Bradley Cooper didn't seem happy to be in this\nmovie at all! The acting was OK you could say. The plot was all over\nthe place and like I said sadly no hangover just a completely pointless\nplot. it could've been better about 100%. The Audience wants to see a\nhangover not something else of course that is why it's called The\nHangover. The scenes could've been better as well as the set and the\nscene where they were sneaking into the penthouse with the light\nflickering on and off and the way the camera was displayed was like\nwhat?!\n"
"\nDo not waste your hard earned money on this load of garbage. Just\nbecause you enjoyed the first movie does not mean this one is worth\nseeing. Honestly, don't even see it out of curiosity, you will have\nwasted your time. All the remotely funny parts are blatantly shown in\nthe trailer, and the rest of the movie is a somewhat serious gold heist\nin which nothing is funny. I gave this movie a 5 because at least the\nproduction value was good and Todd Phillips at least tried to veer off\nfrom the original two scripts. I have seen some terrible movies in my\nday, so I reserve my god-awful rating for god-awful movies. But um,\ndon't see this movie. It's garbage wrapped in lies.\n"
"\n-endowed when selected to be shown in the buff than then the men in\nsomething such as BOOGIE NIGHTS or FORGETTING SARAH MARSHALL? Don't the\nguys that hang out in the HANGOVER series have any self respect? What\nkind of message do they think they are sending to the world--which\naccounts for more than half of the eyes on the screen for any U.S.\nflick--when they denigrate American manhood in such a fashion? Perhaps\nit would not be so bad if such a bon mot came out during the first five\nor ten minutes of a feature. But when it the very last image of the\nentire film that the audience is left with, it is underlined with an\nimportance that otherwise might not be attached to it. Further, when\nsuch a joke from Mother Nature involves one of the five main\ncharacters, it carries a lot more weight with the rest of the universe\nthan if it was just some extra's lame inch. With all of the potential\nthreats currently facing America, we cannot afford to let our guard\ndown, as the HANGOVER people do. Who'll have the last laugh now?\n"
"\nI made the huge mistake of getting my hopes high for this movie.I\nwaited the whole time to see a humorous scene where i could laugh like\nthe other parts of hangover but instead it ended with a very\ndisappointing note.Maybe I had my hopes too much for this sequel.Its\nnot a comedy movie but instead its genre should be drama. The only\npositive part about the movie is Mr. Chow (Ken jeong).He just stole the\nshow from the wolf pack totally.If there is a hint of smile in your\nface after seeing the movie is because of this guy. I wonder what would\nhappen if his role wasn't characterized properly. Overall my rating is\nvery low for this movie because Hangover was one of my favorite movies\nof all time..... :(\n"
"\nLets face it. There was never any for sequels for this concept. Part 2\nproved it and in part 3 they seem to accept it by announcing they quit.\nThe movie revolves around thrills and action which work to a small\nextent by themselves has its funny parts but never really goes anywhere\nrather it goes downhill and by the end i wasn't expecting anything good\nso i wont say it let me down. I personally feel the Chow was a bit\noverdone here. Don't know the idea but it never really worked for me.\nDon't go by the hangover title. Its a misfit. Just average thriller\nwith a little humor here and there. At best worth a watch on TV if you\ngot nothing else to do on a weekend. Else skip this one.\n"
"\nThis could easily be my favorite of all 3. The plot, story-line is\ngreat and keeps you interested. You already know, and empathize with\nthe characters if you'd be following from the beginning.<br><br>I was a lil skeptical, just bc I though HO II, was pretty terri-bad.\nThis picks up kinda where two left-off, just hilar. Also, you know they\nare going to \"end\" the series, and they did such a good job at getting\ncloser.<br><br>Also, hat-tip to screenwriters, etc., bc this one doesn't have anywhere\nnear the \"shock\" value humor that 2 and 1, relied so heavily on.\nInstead, it's actually pg-13'ish, and you can tell they weren't going\nfor over-played locker-room humor, but rather but some effort into the\nscript.<br><br>All in all, it's awesome and definitely worth seeing.<br><br>Oh and Alan (Zack G.,) by far has the best lines in the movie, he's\namazing.\n"
"\nWow! What a delight! Fun! Fun! Fun! Laugh after LAUGH, this on the\nheels of the HUGE disappointment from Man of Steel. The story is such a\nfarce, but the lines and acting are just pure adult humor! And we can\nsure use some of that in this crazy world today. Compared to Due Date,\nwhich I liked--cause RD Jr. Is just too irresistible for me, this is\nongoing hilarious!! And the comedy timing was so keen by all the\nactors. I loved it. Wanted to stay and it again! I would go see it\nagain next week, but I think I'd better save $$ for the DVD and be sure\nto get digital copy for my iTunes library. I have The Help and Due Date\nin iTunes, which is so great when your on an airline and try to watch\nsome dumb movie on a 8in screen from 15ft away--I can watch something I\nlike right in front of me. Thank you Hangover III!!!\n"
"\nIf you're a fan of this series.. You'll surely gonna relate to it &amp;\nfind really funny. Movie has its moments where you'll laugh out loud.\nAn it's a fun flick to with with friends. And it has nostalgic value.\nPerfect end to a series. A heartfelt movie made professionally &amp; it\nreally has soul &amp; it has its own value.. Which make it more likable.\nWhen you're drunk or high, man you can't miss this one.. :D\n"
"\nThe Hangover Part III in my opinion was wronged in criticism, was\nmassacred for no reason , the film is much higher than the second film,\nsecond only to the first , the plot tried to be different, and in fact\nis quite different from other films, they do not have a hangover this\nfilm, and Doug back to being a key part , Chow still have more\nprominence in the plot, and along with Alan are the characters that\nsteals the show , they both are the funniest characters in the film ,\nthe soundtrack is good , the cast is the same, the direction is already\nbetter than the second film , I found the 30 minutes very good early ,\nafter the film of a fallen , and the last moments of the film are very\ngood in my opinion , the Hangover Part III is better than its\npredecessor , and is second only pro first film with a simple script, a\nlittle different from the others , I thought this movie was massacred\nby the critics without deserves. Note 7.8\n"
"\nWhereas the first two movies were hilarious and full of outrageous\nsituations and really twisted comedy, then this third installment falls\nway short of its predecessors.<br><br>\"The Hangover Part III\" is nowhere near the first two movies in\noriginality and storyline, which were a disappointment. The comedy was\nscarce and far in between. I actually wasn't laughing much throughout\nthe course of this movie, unlike parts I and II.<br><br>Sure the reprising actors were doing good jobs with their characters as\nestablished in parts I and II, but they had very little to work with in\nterms of plot, script and storyline. And it was a cumbersome anchor\naround the foot of the movie.<br><br>If you stick through the end credits, you will get to the best part of\nthe entire movie, ironically as it is drawing to an end. And that was,\nin my opinion, how this movie should have kicked off and progressed\nfrom that absurd scene.<br><br>\"The Hangover Part III\" was a major disappointment.\n"
"\nif it is the last (who knows), but it wasn't as funny as the previous\nones, yes there are still a lot of laughs and it is entertaining, but\nthe hangover is missing in this one.<br><br>I don't know if that's what's really missing, the hangover part I mean,\nbut there is something taken away by it not being there. I understand\nwhy they have skipped that part and maybe made this more of a closing\nargument and for that it works out well, but I guess I just wanted more\n:)<br><br>We just wanted to be entertained and surprised like the first movie,\nnot in this lets make it more outrages and unbelievable kind of way.\n"
"\nAlan, Stu and Phil are set yet again to save Doug by finding Mr Chow.\nSo there are three things about this movie that I really didn't like.\nFirst, there was the same plot about Doug missing. Damn, that guy must\nhave played only for a few minutes at the beginning and at the end to\nevery movie. Secondly, there were no jokes. Maybe the third hangover\nwas not meant to be a comedy, because it was more like an action\ngangster movie, which is not necessarily bad, but its the third movie\nof a successful comedy series, why change that? And finally, there was\nno hangover. Why call it that and then replace it with a whole new\nstoryline? That doesn't make sense. So, the movie mainly concentrates\non Alan, and his character, another puzzle to solve that will never be\nsolved as the movie never goes deep enough to actually deal with its\ncharacters. So, 4 out of 10.\n"
"\nThe film is really loved by millions. It does not often happen. Many\npeople watched the film, there is a great desire to continue it. And\ndespite the fact that the creators are not in a hurry to shoot a\nsequel. Many people continue to ask them about it in different ways.\nMany people remember the feeling of pleasure at watching and people\nwant to experience it again. The film carries a sea of positive energy\nhere and fun. The film is not over, and another part needs to be done.\nAlways with their favorite characters. Hold a vote for a good movie.\nAnd suddenly we hear the filmmakers. Vote for the hangover 4! We are\nsure to hear it. http://hangover4.com\n"
"\nI believe that haters missed the scene after credit.It was so awesome.\nGrab a DVD guys.The main theme has indeed changed a lot. However there\nare adventures as the old movies. But there was no hangover,but here\nwas super cool scenes in the movie. The Caesar's Palace scene was one\nof the best scenes in the movie,totally hilarious. The scene which the\nboy get shades is LEGENDARY. I loved this movie. All characters were\nfunny. The movie deserves at least a 6.8. Its cool AND haters who\nmissed the post credit scene. It would be better if you grab a Unrated\nDVD and watch THAT scene.The movie name is \"The Hangover\" but the\nproblem is that there wasn't any hangover in the movie and that's what\nmakes this one a lot less funny than the previous two\n"
"\nIt was not as good as the first. He had high expectations for this\nmovie, but when I went to the cinema to see it, hoping for more, do not\nsay that was not good, but I missed most of history argument. The film\nfilm still managed to get the whole room to laugh, not to mention the\nactors that are a spectacle. But I was curious to know what happened at\nthe end. The actors are comic, where during the whole movie make us\nlaugh, the story is very basic, but not counting on it makes us laugh,\nChinese is a mesh, which makes us laugh so stupid, and I am just\nwriting all gibberish to fill sausage, because it is ten lines need to\nbe able to pass it, if it has some connection. Because at this point I\ncould write ten lines.\n"
"\nWell, this one was different. I was worried it'll be another twin\nbrother of the original movie. But it was nice to see something new and\nawesome and they ended the trilogy very nicely. I loved the way it\nconnects with the first part, and re-entry of some characters from it,\nespecially Tyler/Carlos.<br><br>Todd Philips has experimented a different making style, which does not\nmatch up with original essence of the series, but it was worth a shot.\nPerformances of the cast does not require any special words.<br><br>Overall, I loved the movie. Saw a lot of bad reviews on this site\nitself but I tend to disagree with all of them. This one is a fine\nconclusion to a good trilogy.\n"
