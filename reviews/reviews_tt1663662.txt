"\nI just watched Pacific Rim on the first day/time slot of premiere in\n3D. Yes, I am a geek. But that is not the whole point. If you had the\nexcitement of watching anime movies of robots vs monsters in childhood,\nthis is perfect movie for you. The Kaiju monsters design reminds me of\nGodzilla's villain monsters combined with Cloverfield monster,\nxenomorph (Aliens), and TRON. As for the Jeager robots, I'll let you to\ndecide whether they are good or very good. :)<br><br>To watch this movie I needed to change my mindset to be like a 10 ten\nyear old robot geek child, like 29 years ago. Because if not, you will\nfeel a lot of question marks and disappointment through this movie. The\nstory is quite predictable. The plot and pace are simple enough for\nchildren to understand. And the nerd and geek professor appearances are\na bit annoying for me. But hey, that what is all about: to celebrate\nthe childhood memory of robots vs monsters.<br><br>Overall, the movie is great for robot vs monsters anime fans. It's not\neven close to that horrible Michael Bay's Transformers.\n"
"\nI have been following this movie for a while now. Largely because of\nthe two main actors Charlie Hunnam and Idris Elba and I have to say I\nwas not disappointed at all. Watched it in 3D (I have always strayed\naway from 3D before because I just didn't think it was worth spending\nthe extra cash) but this time I do not regret my choice at all. It was\na visual feast.<br><br>Action was on point. The story flowed well (this is a blockbuster after\nall, we aren't going to compare it to an art house film). For me the\nactors embraced their roles very well and the visuals were magnificent\n(thank god once again for the 3D). Everything just felt right!<br><br>Being familiar with Guillermo's past work I would say this is his best\nyet. His imagination is wicked. So if you are looking for great\nentertainment and a little something to wow you, this is the movie for\nyou. <br><br>Bravo. Two thumbs up.\n"
"\nDecided to go see after reading so many user reviews of 8, 9 and 10.\nAbsolutely love movies in this genre as well other movies that Del Toro\nhas directed (e.g. Pan's Labyrinth, the Devils Backbone, Hellboy) I was\nexpecting to be blown away - and yet, at one point during movie husband\nand I contemplated leaving. I don't understand how so much money can be\nspent and effort not made to create coherent script with believable\ncharacters. I can accept campiness if its done well - but the two\nscientists for example were just ridiculous.<br><br>The amazing visual effects were what kept us in the theater - but just\nbarley. Could clearly see Del Toro's mastery in the creation of the\naliens and Jaegers.\n"
"\nFor the first time in many, many years with this movie I was taken away\nfrom the problems in my life and went to a place where those things\ndidn't register anymore. It was almost magical. I had to keep reminding\nmyself about the bad things in real life, but then a new robot vs\nmonster battle happened and all the sudden that didn't matter any more.\nTotal escapism done with excellent design attention and detail. Thank\nyou GDT. You have to be an artist and a science fiction geek to\nappreciate this. I came out of the movie and realized all my problems\nwere still there but I was also hearing the theme music in my head. Got\nthe DVD now and I escape that way. Channel your inner six year old,\nlean back and enjoy.\n"
"\nKABLAM, A 10/10 Pretty much one of the best movies out this year.<br><br>I'm sorry, but anybody who didn't enjoy this movie because of its\nshamelessly cheesy storyline and acting is a gigantic tool-bag and\nthat's all there is to it. I have absolutely no clue WHY people were\nexpecting the next God Father, or Citizen Kane from a movie where giant\nmonsters show up and the first thing the military does is build EQUALLY\nGIANT ROBOTS to punch them in the face. Cut that out, folks. Don't go\ninto the movie WANTING to hate it. Give it a chance and enjoy the\ncolorful and zany adventure.<br><br>JACKSON BROWNE OUT\n"
"\n7.1. Who is voting up this shite? It's awful! 10 minutes in and I was\nbored stiff. As in STIFF. Charisma bypass actors. Fabulous CGI. No\nPLOT!! Any film that needs to start with a long, turgid, spoken intro\nbefore it starts is an utter failure IMHO and this is no exception.<br><br>Film is a visual medium. If you can't introduce it without a dumb vocal\nintro (as with Oblivion) you are set up for a fall. In this case a\nmajor fall.<br><br>I need substance with my spectacle. This has none. <br><br>IMDb ratings are becoming a complete JOKE! Utter crud. If you have a\nbrain then avoid like the plague!\n"
"\nThis movie is one of the best I have seen in a long time. Everything I\ncan think of is incredible in this movie. From the incredible CGI\neffects to even the awesome soundtrack this movie does no wrong. The\nonly negative thing about the movie is the length, but with the amount\nof information and depth they put into the movie, one is amazed by how\nshort the movie is compared to what it could be. Not once did I look at\nmy watch and think \"When will this be over?\", like I do with most\nmovies over 2 hours long. The fight scenes are very well done in this\nmovie. You expect a fight scene between a 250 foot robot and a 300 foot\nmonster to be cheesy and in your face but they aren't. All of the\ntechnology is explained very well and the camera angles are ones that\nallow you to see everything going on. I highly recommend that everyone\non this site go see this movie now. Between the incredible visuals and\nthe intense soundtrack you will almost be wishing this plot was real so\nyou can hop in a Jaeger and kick some Kaiju ass.\n"
"\nI was hopeful going in from a review I read but it could have gone bad.\nInstead it went great. You know that the humans win - of course.\nInstead of making up some twisted plot you get interesting side\nstories, some surprise, good acting, good fights and an attempt at\nrealism. The scientists were good for comedy without being annoying. I\nonly recognized one actor so I saw some new people who were great, like\nElba and Kikuchi. A part of the opening is how so many countries worked\ntogether but there is no message that would serve no purpose but would\nbe heavy-handed.I didn't see any of the Transformers movies; I will\nmake a comparison to Independence Day.\n"
"\nI had seen the trailer dozens of times and with each time I wanted to\nsee the film more and more. It wasn't a let down! It's absolutely\nstunning, even the monsters are beautiful(in their own gruesome way).\nThe director Guillermo del Toro did a fantastic job! The acting and the\neffects are amazing. I loved the details that were put into the\nfilm(rust on the Jaegers;chipped paint on their Jaeger suits,so on). My\nfavourite Jaeger is Gypsy Danger(a bit too obvious,eh?). Another thing\nI love about the film is the unique way of showing aliens. The aliens\nare obviously from another planet but they come trough a portal that is\ndeep into the ocean,they are intelligent despite how they look and\nabove all they clone themselves and send clones to do the \"dirty\" work.\nThey are truly unique. I strongly recommend it to anyone who loves\nrobots and monsters and the everlasting battle between good and evil.\n"
"\nI have been following this movie for a while now. Largely because I\nthought it would be like the transformers franchise. Watched it in 3D(I\nhave always strayed away from 3D before because I just didn't think it\nwas worth spending the extra cash) but this time I do not regret my\nchoice at all. It was a visual feast and you cant imagine a movie\nbetter than this for visual effects/dialogue delivery.<br><br>Now the real highlight of the picture, the visuals are overall shiny\nand snazzy. The designs of the creatures and robots are palpably\nmarvelous. As the special effects move these heavy giants, the action\ndid something better than just blowing up stuff. Although explosions\nand loud noises are not actually flaws(It's about giant robots,\nc'mon!), but a real good set piece needs a decent and genuine\nfortitude. In the midst of the noises, you will always get the sense of\ndanger to the Jaegers, mostly because there are human pilots beneath\nthe ravaging machines. It effectively made those sequences electrifying\nand the monsters terrifying than you would expect.\n"
"\nAlmost a great Movie-liked it really with the theme sets and the way\nsoundtracks and directions fade in for the screenplay apart from the\nMonster and robot thing may seem to be childish to some still the way\nthe movie theme in 2020 how Humans adapt to use technology wise as per\nthe circumstances is well depicted. The way the action is choreographed\nis best even if its a robot fighting- The fights seems like more Human\nto a Monster and it was Stylish. Movie rating as per my thoughts is\nperfectly 8.5/10. The Storyline that makes the Human world to be almost\nresponding to a catastrophe even though its strange from normal-the\nMovie is perfectly scripted. Sometimes have felt that instead of\ncreating this as a sequel let this Movie remain as a legend or\nevergreen movie of all time and it perfectly deserves i guess.\n"
"\nEasily my most favorite movie in last few years. It's like Batman\nBegins of \"big fighting robots\" movies. Beats Michael Bay's\nTransformers trilogy on many levels. Actually it beats most of the\nlatest \"invasion\" sci-fi movies on many levels. The movement of the\ngiant robots feels very real thanks to the excellent visualization and\nsound mixing. The main music theme *is* present every-time when it's\nneeded to build that feeling of justification and awesomeness and it's\nepic presence is appreciated by the little boy in me watching the\nmonumental scenes with eyes glued to the cinema canvas. It's *maybe*\nnot taking itself very seriously, and characterization is quite flat,\nbut the \"threat\" still feels more serious than in movies with similar\nthemes. I couldn't get rid of the wide *cheshire cat grin* on my face\nwhen I was driving back home. It was *that* good. Thank you Guillermo\ndel Toro.\n"
"\nAfter seen, Man of Steel and Evil Dead (remake) I didn't thought that a\nmovie could even get to the toe of them. But wend I saw Pacific Rim\nyesterday I knew I saw wrong.<br><br>Pacific Rim is the best movie I have seen this year is action, the\nstory is great the fighting scenes are mind blowing. The Monsters and\nrobot looks are great. <br><br>The direction , music, editing all was right and perfect. The acting\nwas great. <br><br>I really can think of anything I didn't like about it if one of the\nthose films that are meant to be seen.<br><br>100/100\n"
"\n10/10. This is an absolutely magnificent movie! I have seen hundreds of\nfilms and this movie is only the 6th that I have awarded a 10/10 to.\nAll this year, I had been anticipating the release of Snyder's Man of\nSteel, with Pacific Rim coming in at a distant 2nd for my \"Most\nAnticipated of 2013\" list. Not only was this movie better than Man of\nSteel, but I am now prepared to say it is one of my favourite movies of\nall time! Not being impressed by Del Toro's Hellboy, I was a bit\nanxious when he was directing a movie about giant robots fighting\naliens, but my fears were aside with an impressive first trailer. Ever\nsince its release, I have always considered Transformers: Dark of the\nMoon to contain the best action in any movie (say what you will about\nMichael Bay), but that has now been figuratively shat on by Del Toro\nproving that there is a healthy middle- ground between heart-pumping\n\"mindless\" action and the making of a great movie. Giant robots\nfighting enormous aliens - it's not just for meth-heads anymore...\nIncredible film!\n"
"\nLately movies that claim to be monsters and action have proved a\ncomplete failure, and, to be honest I thought this was not going to be\nthe exception.<br><br>Any change to see a real action movie with almost unstoppable battles\nmonsters, and a dose of special effects so amazing you just leave you\nwith your mouth open.<br><br>Of course, not everything is good, but entertaining plot is somewhat\nsimilar to that of other films: The hero gets a big pain that leaves\nthe battle, then when the world needs the triumphant return finds the\nlove of his life between the two due to the bad, the nearly died, and\nfinally live happily ever after (like a soap opera).<br><br>We must clarify that thanks to special effects, battles, and good\nperformances, the plot is not uncomfortable. I really think it's worth\nwatching.\n"
"\nPacific Rim is a movie for people who get distracted by shiny objects.<br><br>There is no plot, no suspense, no drama, no humour, no attempt at\ncharacterisation . All there is, is a big pile of CGI and a script that\nlooks like it was written by a four year old.<br><br>There is LOTS of cgi. Its not very good CGI and it completely fails to\ndisguise the fact that the movie is idiotic and lazy, with nothing to\noffer anyone except the completely undiscerning viewer. The film even\nhas much of the action taking place in poorly lit environments to\nattempt to describe the lameness of the effects. <br><br>The actors do their best, but even Idris Elba, whose work I normally\nenjoy, is completely wasted in this trash.\n"
"\nTook a chance on this actually stupid movie whereby you would have to\nbe stupid to believe any of it.The premise that if you build a giant\nrobot to fight a giant monster and then punch the monster like it was a\ntitle bout is ridiculous, and an insult to your mind set. why spend\nbillions to build these robots only to fire cannons at them from close\nrange. the thought that you would power this giant robot with the\nthoughts of two separates minds is staggering.I found it to not be\nworth a tenth of the money spent to see the hype. I would call it\n\"Godzilla vs Transformers \" for a Saturday morning kid show . but to\ncough up $50.00 for 2 adults and 2 kids to see this movie,is just not\nworth it.My opinion was not the only, my wife and kids hated it too.\n"
"\nOMG the adrenaline is still pumping through me!!!! Pacific Rim is\nbeyond awesome!!! I was wide eyed, open mouthed and trembling with\nexcitement all the way though, and I am GUTTED that right now I'm not\nwith like minded folk because I really want to play Kaiju and Jaegers.\nI would be \"BAM!! BAM!! BAM!!!\" and doing the moves and rolling around\nfor hours!!! I am really envious I'm not a child because I wish I could\nbe justified in having all the bedding, toys (so not only could I play\nat K &amp; Js physically with my friends, I could have fun for hours\nplaying fights alone with my merchandise) and maybe some pyjamas too.\nLove it soooooo much!!!!!!!!!!\n"
"\nAn explosive action/fantasy film!<br><br>Pacific Rim was a great adventure to watch, it was intense for the\nmajority of the whole film and had me on the edge of my seat! It was\nbattle after battle, with a mix of struggle, technology, and personal\nconflict. The film felt long (in a good way), was not cut too short,\ndid not leave too much out, and did not drag on.<br><br>I enjoyed every minute of the film, it had beautiful graphics, crushing\nmusic, and even though I had not watched a trailer or done prior\nresearch, I could immediately understand what the plot of the movie was\nand where it was going. It was a fast paced adventure that put humanity\nat a disadvantage and forced us to rise above or be wiped out.<br><br>A basic war story on Steroids when Men take on creatures from the great\nunder in order to preserve Earth.<br><br>- Best seen in IMAX if possible, worth the extra $!\n"
"\nPacific Rim has everything I expect from a quality, smart action movie. <br><br>The effects are perfect and the design of the Jaegers and Kaiju are\ncreative and on par with previous Del Toro's visual feasts like Pan's\nLabyrinth.<br><br>The characters are very likable with special mentions to the great\nperformances of Idris Elba, Rinko Kikuchi and Charlie Hunnam.<br><br>Rinko Kikuchi in particular is very talented as she makes her character\nadorable and bad-ass at the same time. Ron Perlman is perfect as\nHannibal Chau.<br><br>The fight scenes and accompanying music are adrenaline ridden and\nbreathtaking. The scale of the battles between giants among a crumbling\ncity is epic as it should be.<br><br>And speaking of the soundtrack, it has one of the best music I've heard\nin recent years.<br><br>A instant classic and a movie experience all movie lovers deserve to\nwatch.<br><br>Side note: I would throw all my money to watch a Pacific Rim x Godzilla\nCrossover.\n"
"\nPacific Rim recipe.<br><br>Sieve a handful of Transformers into a bowl and stir in a dollop of\nMighty Morphin Power Rangers. Whisk briskly whilst adding the content\nof any given Godzilla film (preferably 'B' quality Japanese original),\nbut any good organic Kaiju will do. Add to a pan with a little Iron\nGiant and a good handful finely chopped Manga. Bring to frantic, hectic\nboil.<br><br>Transfer to oven-proof dish and bake for 2 hours 11 minutes and update\ntemperature to July 2013ºC. Expect concoction to increase in size 300\nfold.<br><br>Serve hot, sprinkled with ground corny and a a good dollop of fresh\nsilly.<br><br>Result. 100% deliciously awesome treat. You'll want more........<br><br>And like me, once sampled, you'll be heading out to the shed to start\nwork welding your first Jaeger.\n"
"\nSuch a refreshing action movie. Unlike many action movies nowadays that\nare based on well known comic books and books and we always know the\nstory and the element of surprise is not really present. This movie\nhowever I went in with just seeing the trailer and omg hands down the\nbest action movie I have seen in a long time. The story line was great\nit went into correct amount of depth and was not just action action\naction. It starts off with a great action scenes and then takes some\ntime to build the plot. Then it goes into awesome action scenes and\nalso had a great ending. Definitely worth watching in 3D. I know that\nthis movie was filmed in 2D and converted to 3D for the theater. But\nbecause of all the large objects the 3D effect really made it seem like\nwe were in the movie. Also the soundtrack was amazing for pumping you\nup.\n"
"\nTotally loved it. An awesome film with STUNNING visuals. Seeing those\ngiant robots walking in the sea alone is worth ticket's price. Del\nToro's passion and perfection speaks for itself. Not in a single place\nyou find the CGI or visuals lacking. CGI is so damn perfect which isn't\na small feat given that it's a film about giant robots fighting giant\nmonsters. And man do these robots look beautiful and awesome? Like a\npiece of art. And they are done so perfectly, each and every movement,\nevery little detail, has been given attention. These giant robots\nreally put all what we have seen in Transformers to shame. The action\nscenes are jaw-dropping and are so brilliantly choreographed, without\never going over the top. It's a pity that this film couldn't do well on\nbox office while every other crap coming out every day makes tons and\ntons of money. I sincerely hope Del Toro gets to make a sequel.\n"
"\nThis was everything that a summer action film should be. Stunning\ngraphics, a unique story line, solid plot, solid acting (though this\nwas likely the weak point) and a very well paced movie. I found myself\nin sheer awe of many of the CGI scenes. They were really, really well\ndone. Stunning in fact.<br><br>This movie could have actually been a 9 or 10 with better acting and\ntweaks to the script. That said, this was an absolutely entertaining\nfilm that is sure to be added to my personal video library. It will be\na great \"demo Blu Ray\" for any home theater enthusiast.<br><br>BTW, Idris Elba was the stand out of the actors. He did an excellent\njob. A couple of the others were also solid, but no one rose t Idris'\nlevel. Had they hired better actors, this could have been even better.\n"
"\nJust terrible. Really, truthfully, I promise you  terrible. I had to\nconsider if 1/10 was too harsh but thinking the film through i\ngenuinely can't justify giving it a 2! We know that special effects\nexist and they can pretty much do anything these days  so, big deal.\n(I didn't even think they were that special to be honest)<br><br>I was squirming in my seat, anxious  waiting for it to end (it wasn't\na quick death either, I can tell you).<br><br>This is a B-movie in 2 years. We'll be poking it with a stick and\nlaughing at it. <br><br>In summary  run for the hills.\n"
"\nThis horrible excuse for a movie is the epitome of everything that is\nwrong with film-making these days. Style over substance. Visually\nstunning but devoid of everything else that makes a good film.<br><br>Idris Elba was horribly miscast as was practically everyone else and I\ncan't honestly say I have ever watched a film that was so empty and\nvacuous, so bereft of anything approaching a good performance. It's\nalmost a credit to say that every facet of the movie was so utterly\natrocious.<br><br>By far the worst thing Guillermo Del Toro has made or ever will make\nand I'm sure he'll look back on it and think 'what the hell was I\ndoing?'<br><br>It pains me to say that Transformers 2 was better which tells you\nabsolutely everything you need to know. Avoid this clichéd CGI tripe at\nall costs. Having a colostomy bag fitted would be more fun.<br><br>I would give it a negative mark out of 10 if I could. If this is where\nfilm-making is going, we're all going to hell in a handbasket.\n"
"\nUnlike some, I had no problem with the high concept of the piece:\nTransformers vs Godzilla. It had a lot of potential. And when the movie\nconcentrates on what we are all here to see (giant creatures and robots\nbeating on each others with oil tankers and smashing through\nskyscrapers) it is very successful. But when things get quiet... less\nso. Too much time spent on \"Top Gun\" like fighter pilot shenanigans.\nNot enough nuance in the characterizations. An ultra linear plot with\nfew attempts to confound expectations. The acting isn't bad - and isn't\nrequired to be great in this sort of film - but it is nothing special\neither. Sort of universally \"meh\". Good for a Blu Ray rental.\n"
"\nI was pleasantly surprised by this film. When I first heard about\nmachines fighting giant monsters I figured it would be ridiculous and\nit was. Luckily, it was a good kind of ridiculous. Being a fan of\nmovies like Godzilla and an avid anime watcher helped me to pull\ntogether the various components of this film. I would have enjoyed it\nif they had put more time into explaining the development of the\nmachines more. It felt like they rushed through that portion.If I had\none main criticism, it would be that the cheesiness level was very\nhigh. Other than that and the occasional bad acting it was fun watching\nthe high definition fight scenes and pretty cast.\n"
"\nI can recite the lines in the trailer; that's how much I looked forward\nto this movie. But I fell asleep while watching it, literally. So\ndisappointed. The comments made by people around me always start with\n\"horrible story\" and end up with \"perfect special effects though\".\nTruth to be told, I can totally foresee that, for nearly all action\nmovies follow this trend. But I was wrong. There is no single twist\nsurprising and the actress really can't act! What's wrong with her\nface?! She does not know how to smile, does she? Then the robots. Come\non. These huge machines are unable to leave deep impression on\naudience. The fighting scenes are of great chaos-sea water, buildings,\nrobots and monsters mix with each other so that I could only tell that\nsomething is moving in the screen. The finale eventually adds the last\nawful stroke. The only thing of this movie worth keeping is the theme\nsong, boosting work efficiency.\n"
"\nNot a boring moment the entire movie. We have seen our share of\napocalyptic alien movies, but this one has enough uniqueness to still\nkeep it very interesting and entertaining. <br><br>Stunning visuals and great storyline! Not perfect, but still great and\nif part 2 happens, I will be going to see more! You know a movie is\ngood when it can stir your emotions. This one did for me.<br><br>Highly recommended! Note, I also loved Pans Labyrinth<br><br>Go see it! I rarely write reviews but loved this one so much I just had\nto spread the word about it<br><br>Amazing!\n"
"\nHere's the recipe: Take Cloverfield, Transformers, Battleship, and as\nmany clichés as you can possibly find. Now and crush them all together.\nSpread that out on any old worn-out story. Now add excessive shaky-cam\nand pouring rain in every scene so nobody can focus on how terrible it\nreally is.<br><br>Fortunately I didn't care much about what I might be missing as it was\nsimple-minded and predictable. I just wanted to get out of the theater\nand salvage what was left of my day.<br><br>I yearn for a return to some truly excellent science fiction. This\nisn't it. We seem to be stuck in a rut where impractical machines with\nas many moving parts as you can possibly render aim to keep our minds\ndistracted rather than engaged and immersed as science fiction should\nbe.\n"
"\nI enjoyed this movie very much.The plot is well done and the acting\nvery convincing. Special effects very well made. 2 hours of action!! I\ncan't wait for the 2nd part! Great work of Charlie and Rinko, I love\nRinko! She is beautiful here and personally I would like she to show\nsome more skin, because she has a great Asian body very wheel toned and\nathletic. For me, it seems like the movie was well think before its\nrelease. Each scene has a purpose and is very enjoyable. I was\nforgetting the great acting of Idris Elba, an English actor that I\nrespect very much due to his performance in police series and in\nPrometheus. Excellent choice of actor in any case. Even the doctor,\nscientific, technicians, etc all they were very well chosen for this\nmovie. I recommend you to see it if you are looking for well\nentertainment. Congratulation to all the people who made possible this\naction movie!\n"
"\nOK, so going in, I didn't know what this was aside from \"big robot\nfight\". After I heard the word \"kaiju\", I knew it was a Japanese\nmanga-style tale. And it hit just about every single cliché from the\n\"Kaiju\" genre of anime and manga.<br><br>Not that thats a bad thing, especially if you don't normally watch\nJapanese media. <br><br>I can understand why so many if the American \"professional\" critics\nhated it. They don't understand the culture it comes from. Ironically,\nthese same ideals used to dominate American media decades ago, when we\nweren't all emo about being a powerful nation.\n"
"\nexcellent movie..... a must watch action packed thrilling and\ndefinitely a visual eye candy for the young generation............ yeah\ncertain flaws are there and its obvious.....for many this movie isn't\nperfect and totally respect their opinions... but still can promise a\n100% thrilling and action packed experience... individual performances\nare good enough for the movie but its the battle between the monsters\nand the hunters that will attract you... expected a bit more battles\nbut still the special effects and story line is strong enough to get\nyour attention........ despite its flaws definitely a 10 on 10 movie\nfor me... don't miss this movie as its worth watching at least once...\n"
"\nthis movie really rocks and keeps u occupied for 02 hours . Stunning\nvisuals , giant robots look really giant . <br><br>The Very feel of a giant robot walking is super cool . Idres Alba\nstands out in film. his looks and dialogs were excellent. The best part\nis in middle of film having emotional feelings and don't want to spoil\nit. <br><br>it is a true cinematic experience especially in 3d .and to watch it in\nhome TV screens will be disgrace to this movie.<br><br>Hope the Sequel or Warner Bros next projects show much more\nimprovement.really anxious to watch movies like these in future\n"
"\nTo sum this movie up in a few sentences, I can state the following\nthings:<br><br>- The basic idea is really great. <br><br>- The story built on this great idea is decent but mediocre at best. <br><br>- The dialogues are pretty much ridiculous. <br><br>- The plot is bleeding from several wounds. I won't give a detailed\nlist of them for a reason that can be described in six letters: IMAX 3D<br><br>Because boy, despite all of its flaws, the thing is as gorgeous as it\ncan get! Beautiful, jaw-dropping, mind-blowing cool, extremely\nenjoyable.<br><br>I probably wouldn't have liked it watching it on DVD or without 3D\nbecause when only the story remains, it's quite week. But with 3D it\nmade me sit for two hours like a little kid, eyes sparkling.<br><br>The conclusion is: lean back, put your 3D glasses on and have fun!\n"
"\nI wish I could give this movie a lower rating. Everything is terrible,\nstoryline, acting, cgi, everything.. Do not waste your time. I wish I\nhad not. I do not believe there was any forethought into the technical\naspects of the movie. Produced in an age of drones and wireless\ncommunication, why would there be a need for manual pilots that\nactually have to run in place driving huge mechanisms to control\nmovement. Why would they 'feel' when the machines arm is ripped off.\nWhy would this fight not be with nuclear weapons instead of trillion\ndollar bipedal robots. Why would you need to 'drift' two separate minds\ntogether to control one. Ever heard of Mechwarrior? Kids play that crap\nin their basements on a controller with two sticks and six buttons.\nWhat a damn waste of time and imagination. I wanted to like it, by the\nend I just wanted to say I finished it, and now that I have, I want my\nmoney back :(\n"
"\nAt first,it makes feel it like the copycat of Japan Manga - Eva\nEvangellion: Zero.But at last i feel it had its own style to plot the\nmovie. The director cleverly edited the ideas from Eva and make it\nbecome its own movie. It makes me unbreathable from the beginning of\nthe fight against the kaiju. The visual effect of the movie is also\nwell done. The kaiju seem nice and real.The story line is also well\nplotted. I feel Rei is alive when i see the role of Mori appears in the\nmovie. The beginning and the ending of the movie is well established. I\ncant believe that I see Eva goes to the movie and no longer stay in the\nanime version. Finally, a well edited version of Eva Evangellion. Hope\nthe second episode will even better than first. Great work, masterpiece\nof sci-fiction/ fantasy movie.\n"
"\nI approached this movie expecting to see lots of action and out of this\nworld special effects and that is exactly what I got. The movie keeps\nyou at the edge of your seat from start to finish and it does away with\nboring sub plot lines that have become the norm. If you're looking for\na love story or a deep thought provoking movie, you will not find it\nhere, this is a fun, save the world, kick-ass action packed flick and\nit does that very well.<br><br>I really don't understand why other reviewers are giving it low scores\nfor doing exactly what it set ouu to do. You don't go to watch a love\nstory and complain that there isn't enough action, so why do you go and\nwatch a \"robots Vs monsters\" movie and complain that the plot lacked\ncomplexity? <br><br>If you want to watch a good action flick that delivers pure adrenaline\nfuelled mayhem minus that mushy crap that they seem to be putting in\nmovies all the time, then you'll love this. Want something else, find\nthat and watch that.\n"
"\nThis Movie is so freaking Awesome even thought i didn't know the\nexciting of this movie until two weeks before it being released and i\nwas not a fan of Del Toro or giant robots vs giant monsters but when i\nsaw this movie i loved it very much<br><br>the acting was OK 7/10 the characters really makes you care about them<br><br>the visual effects were awesome 10/10<br><br>the plot was great 8/10<br><br>but i had a little bit problems with the movie like why there is only\non female character in the whole entire movie!<br><br>and why didn't gypsy danger start the fight with that sword that he\nhave<br><br>but just for your information the action sequences in the movie lasts\nfor like 40 minutes!!!!!!<br><br>overall:Best Robots vs monster movie in the history you can even see it\nwith your family\n"
"\nOne of the best films I've seen this year. A unique blend of Japanese\nmecha and kaiju that pays homage to those films, Pacific Rim is a film\nthat not only dazzles the senses, but it's also a human story at heart\nand that's the most important part of any film that has the fate of the\nworld hanging in the balance with epic battles at the forefront. I\nfound this film MUCH BETTER than the Transformers films. Though those\nfilms had epic action scenes, the big difference is that you can\nACTUALLY see the action; no quick-style-MTV-ADD-riddled editing. The\naction flows organically along with the story, which is both exciting,\nfresh, and well-acted. Some of the characters were underdeveloped, but\nthe leads are impressive with great performances throughout.<br><br>Pacific Rim is one of those films that simply make you say, WOW!!! A\nreally fun time at the movies and a nice change of pace from the gritty\nblockbusters in theaters now. I hope they get a sequel going because\nI'm really excited to see what their gonna come up with next.\n"
"\nStory?Did you call it a story?I think it is just an excuse for\nmarvelous giant robots vs giant monsters battles.Pacific Rim isn't\nreally telling a story,however,it's realizing our childhood dreams.When\nthe Japanese monster movies were hot,many kids must had dreamed of\ngiant monsters.Due to the limit of technology in the 90's,monsters were\nno more than plastic toys destroying model cities with dumb\nmovements.But I remember that my childhood friends and I talked about\nmonster movies each time we played together and the fun pretending to\nbe monsters smashing things and got punished for that.I guess boys have\ninborn interests in monsters. After seeing Pacific Rim,I couldn't help\ncrying. Isn't it what we dreamed of when we were kids?Giant monsters\nsmashing a city to rubble,giant robots punching monsters with a fist\nbigger than a bus and hero saving the world again.All in one,all in\nalmost realistic CG which gave me an illusion that monsters were alive\nand kicking. Pacific Rim is the best monster movies I've ever\nseen.Please support the movie or monster movies will extinct.\n"
"\nThis film will go down in history as \"that robots killing aliens\nmovie\". It's just so epic. When I first went to the cinema I was really\nsceptic. I thought it's just a movie created to make lots of money,\nbecause of special effects.<br><br>Turned out I was wrong. It wasn't about the effects, it wasn't about\nthe fights, it was much more. It will be something you will remember\nafter a few years. It will be something you will watch again and again.<br><br>There is something for everyone. For the geeks - beautifully designed\nrobots and the monsters were very interesting, unique and familiar at\nthe same time. Epic battle scenes with much details, looking realistic.\nFor women - you have a lot of hot guys showing their bodies. You have a\nuniverse worth exploring. And it's not only serious business, you will\nhave a few laughs. But on the other hand, you might shed a few tears,\ntoo.\n"
"\nI really looked forward to this movie when it was announced. I'm glad\nit was worth it. I won't go into detail regarding the plot, I would\nlike to relate the feeling I had while watching this. Saw it in 2D and\nit was a spectacle in it's own accord. Giant behemoths dealing punches,\nsuperimposed over general population, produces a feeling of wonder and\nawe that, I'm sure, del Toro captured unerringly. Adrenaline powered\nspeeches and last minute heroics really made me feel like child again.\nI had the whole cinema cheer and boo at the screen on various\noccasions, and the demographic was from 3 to 93 years of age. Feeling\nis similar to Ridley Scott's \"Gladiator\" through out. It's what\n\"Transformers\" and \"Godzilla\" SHOULD have been. No better way of\nspending your afternoon than this. Just go watch it...\n"
"\nI didn't really expect much, coming into the IMAX theatre, as I had\nbeen advised. I feared of a plot that may have been lacking, a director\nwith a few mishaps like Hellboy, and a budget that was focused all on\nCG. The CG was basically all I was banking on to make this film one of\na kind... Then, minutes into the film, it hit me -- IT IS AWESOME!!!!\nThe plot is well-rounded, with a good focus on characters and the\nsituations surrounding them; the action - intense, and the film was put\ntogether beautifully. <br><br>What got me most excited was that this could start a revolution of\nman-operated robot films!! If they could do this, they can do Voltron,\nMazinger-Z, Voltes V, Gundam, and nothing would be able to stop them!\nJust think of the possibilities... They're endless!\n"
"\nBefore watching PACIFIC RIM I noticed it had a lot of critics really\nhammered down on it and truth be told it really wasn't that bad. Then\nagain I stopped listening to critics a long time ago. Although many\nwould agree it could be somewhat overblown with special effects but it\ndid have a decent plot. The acting wasn't the best but also not the\nworst. All the effects were very nicely done and the fight sequences\nwere very engaging partly because the film established what was at\nstake before them.<br><br>All in all, PACIFIC RIM isn't as bad as critics say it is in fact I\nthink they might have been too harsh. The best way to see PACIFIC RIM\nis probably without expecting to much and to judge for yourself if you\nlike it or not. For me it was good and better than expected and I would\nrecommend it as a better alternative to a lot of other films out there.\n"
"\nWhile watching this movie, I was reminded of a couple of films and TV\nshows from my youth, first was any of the original Godzilla films, the\nsecond, a TV show Ultra Man. The FX were way better here, but, it just\nmade me think of them. I found the film entertaining, no Oscar winner,\nbut, it was good. Some parts kept you on the edge of your seat, of\ncourse, rooting for the good guys.<br><br>I also had to think that mankind would have or could have thought of a\nbetter defense/offense weapon than giant robots. To bring a fight into\nthe city would have cost trillions of dollars, perhaps Quadrillions of\ndollars. Okay, I'm reading way to much into it. Watch the movie, you\nwill enjoy it.\n"
"\nThis film starts of with a monologue that explains in twenty seconds\nhow big monsters start appearing from the sea and destroying\neverything. The only defence against them is to kick their heads in\nwith massive robots. Cool! Starting so quickly out the blocks I\nexpected this to be a fast paced action movie.<br><br>It really isn't. About every film element ever used, runs its course\nbefore the inevitable big battle. You get a fall from grace, a rivalry,\na training period, a love story, forgiveness, reconciliation, etc. etc.<br><br>The battle sequences are epic, the monsters and robots are amazing,\nKids especially will love them, and the action goes on and on.<br><br>The dialogue is cheesier and hammier than a 60 foot pizza monsters, and\ncoupled with the extended scope of this film can make watching it\ngruelling if you are not instantly gripped.<br><br>This will keep any kids gripped for hours (nearly three of them) but if\nsci-fi isn't your thing get comfy and bring a pillow.\n"
"\nPacific Rim is Transformers on steroids, meets Godzillas father who is\nfar more superior. The film has Action that has never before seen its\nMINBLOWING!!! The film is a visual mastery... The film is a slow and\nclichéd in parts, but this film is pure cinematic entertainment so you\nforget the few hiccups. The films story is about how how monster called\nkiagges come from the bottom of the ocean and are destroying the world.\nHumans than create jaggars, robot machines to combat the monsters.\nOverall it a must watch for all who love action and sci fi films!!!\nAlso i recommend you watch the film in 3D because the film is way more\nappealing when you feel like you are in the battle ;)\n"
"\nI will keep this short: I was so surprised. I went expecting a cut\nabove the usual action movie, but I was amazed at how terrific this\nwas. The screen play seems to be a collection of virtually every war\nmovie and monster movie cliché imaginable--all of which is obviously\nintended. It's like an intelligent and witty Transformers film, if you\ncan imagine. The film does not try to be trendy and it avoids witty\ndialog, TG. The stock characters are given stock lines to say, and they\ndo it perfectly. For example, the eve-of-battle speech.<br><br>At first I was wondering if the director knew that the film was just\none cliché, in-joke or film reference after another. There was no doubt\nthat he knew, after I saw the \"Coolant Low\" warning.<br><br>The 3-D and IMAX were distracting. When (not if) I see it again, it\nwill be in 2-D, which is at least one dimension more than most summer\naction films lately.\n"
"\nAbsolutely best action movie so far this year, there is something\ndifferent from other boring, same old story movies like Transformers,\nIron Man 3 franchises. Not so good story and not so meaningful that\nwhere the alien came from and the actions taken from human, world and\nhow they are fighting them but start up, action scenario, no boring\ndrama made movie something different and very excited, that team play\nand showed whole world, human, technology power you probably accept\nthat best movie so far human against alien, second biggest monster\nmovie as i remember after Godzilla and soundtrack in every scenario\nmatched so. After all hadn't time to think about root cause and other\nthings watching the movie for 2 hours :P\n"
"\nThis movie had all the elements to be an amazing movie. Giant robots vs\nmonsters, what's there not to like. However due to some to a complete\nlack of intelligence in the putting together a decent story line, this\nmovie was just sad.<br><br>Horrible, HORRIBLE Australian accents, bad acting, and robots that\ndon't use any weapons until they're being defeated. Why would a robot\nuse towers, cranes, cargo containers and a cargo ship as weapons WHEN\nIT HAS A BUILT IN SWORD! How ridiculous stupid.<br><br>How people this dumb get to right a script and how dumb people are\nwilling to pass this through truly amazes me.\n"
"\nWarning- DO NOT under any circumstances, pay any extra money for this\nmovie. Not 7 dollars, not 3 dollars, not 1 dollar. But if it is free on\ndemand, then you can pay for it. This movie is an absolute waste of\ngood film stock that the producers made in order to \"make their nut\".<br><br>There is no plot, no character development, no story and no rhyme or\nreason to it. The character which the black actor, Ilba plays,\ncommander or the flight squadron, comes across as a handicapped idiot.\nThe main 2 characters,Raleigh Becket and Mako Mori, appear to be in\nhigh school the way they relate to each other. I wouldn't even think\nthis movie would be good for a fourth grader to watch. After all most\nfourth graders liked Star Wars, a movie which this film is far, far\nbelow. Maybe a first grader could watch this movie and take some\nbenefit out of it.\n"
"\nI must be honest.. After watching this movie I felt bad for not\nwatching it on the big screen! Simply put this movie is filled with\naction packed awesomeness!! If you're a sci-fi buff or anime buff or\neven a rpg buff you'll love this movie even more! Don't want to spoil\nthe movie for anyone so I won't go into details but from beginning to\nend this movie had me in the edge of my seat! I'm not one to buy hard\ncopies of movies because I don't like rewatching them since I already\nknow what's going to happen. Lets just say I'll be ordering a blueray\ncopy. Plus I want to help support movies like this! Oh forgot to\nmention if you like any of the mech assault games or even have interest\nin the upcoming titanfall game you'll love this movie!!! But also if\nyou like no bullshit action packed movies. ;)\n"
"\nBefore going to see Pacific Rim I had read quite a few mixed reviews. I\nreally was sort of ambivalent about going to see it, even though I am\nquite fond of big action and monsters.<br><br>We opted to see it in IMAX 3D, which got a thumbs down from me (3D\nfilms should be filmed in 3D to really pull it off. Conversions are\njust weird in my opinion) but others in my group thought it really\nenhanced the action so use your own discretion.<br><br>After sitting through the movie, I have to ask... \"WHAT IS WRONG WITH\nYOU PEOPLE??\" I can't for the life of me figure out how folks could\nhave issues with the movie. I thought it was a brilliant homage to the\nGodzilla movies of yore with a healthy dash of the fun of Anime robots\nbut beautifully filmed and well acted by everyone involved. This is\nprecisely what a summer popcorn movie is supposed to be. Just all kinds\nof exciting.<br><br>The action might be too much for the under 10 kiddos. I don't recall\nany excessive use of language or inappropriate sexual situations.\n"
"\nI'm not going to give any summary of the plot line, as much of it is\nderivative from enough films we've all seen before. The dialogue is\nsimplistic, the acting cast little better but it's a CGI-fest.<br><br>Don't go into this film thinking you are going to find any new great\ngem. It's part-Godzilla, part-Avatar, part-Independence Day and so on.\nIt looks good, but there's hardly any good story. I was mostly bored.<br><br>Some are going to like this a lot, as evidenced by the surprisingly\npositive reviews from the professional critics. Many others will just\nfind it to be a passable action sci-fi thrill. I've seen much better\nelsewhere, and think you will have too. Up to you.\n"
"\nThis movie is what would happen if you gave an eight-year-old one\nhundred million dollars and told him to make a film. Nothing makes\nsense about this movie. The entire thing is ridiculous, from plot holes\nto simple visual errors. But at the end of this movie, you won't have\nthat feeling of wasted time. It's like watching a Transformers movie\nthat has a purpose. If you ever wanted to witness a life-sized\naction-figure world with silly robots, impossible technology, watch\nthis movie. All around family fun, one of the few \"silly and pointless\"\nmovies I'd allow my kids to watch. This is just good old fashioned\nentertainment.\n"
"\nI thoroughly enjoyed his movie fro start to finish, even the comical\nparts which in an other film would have been out of place. I initially\nthought it was the follow up to cloverfield. But filmed totally\ndifferently but i think I am wrong about that. <br><br>There were some lines/ designs throughout the film which plays homage\nto star Wars, but done in a way which enhances the film.<br><br>This is a film that can be watched so many times over the fight scenes\nare great but are grounded by the actors. If the film has one problem\nit is the main character sounds a bit punch drunk and the acting is a\nlittle wooden but Sean slater (eastenders) is great apart from his\nslightly dodgy accent and Luther is awesome as always. It all ties\ntogether so undoubtedly thanks to del toro's direction and story\ntelling which left me putting some pieces together which is clearly\ndeliberate. There will hopefully be a sequel.\n"
"\nI don't really think there's a spoiler to this -- we all know the\nheroes will win in the end. Until we get there, though, this movie is\nchock full of almost nonstop action, with plenty of robots vs. monsters\nfighting all the way through. <br><br>If you've come for the moving storyline, touching pathos, or Jane\nAusten dialogue, you're pretty obviously in the wrong place. Yes, it's\na bit formulaic, and if you're looking for the Academy's next darling,\nmove along. However, if what you're looking for is a sci-fi actioner\nwith imaginative monsters, great special effects, good futuristic tech,\nwell done battle scenes, and lots of robots and aliens, then this movie\nis or you. <br><br>With the exception of a little profanity, it is totally suitable for\nthe boys (mine are 6 and up) who were on the edge of their seat\nthroughout and absolutely loved it.\n"
"\nI didn't dislike this movie; giant robots against giant monsters is a\nfun idea that isn't like anything else being done right now. But the\ndialog needed to be smarter. I think there is more going on with the\ncharacters than I picked up from one viewing--I gotta believe Del Toro\nput in some layers you have to dig for. But on the surface, it comes\noff like some of the sillier action movies of the early 80's. Some\nnotes for the sequel: 1. Hire a writer that speaks the language the\nfilm gets made in; 2. Get someone in there that understands color\ndesign--maybe you could sell some toys if everything wasn't all the\nsame shade of blue-gray; 3. Don't bother having the giant robots throw\nthe giant monsters when they're fighting in water. It doesn't hurt.\nShow more damage. It's cool when body parts break off. Kthnx, j.g.\n"
"\nOverall a good watch, switch off brain and get the pop corn and the\nbeers in. This is a typical American 'we can save the world don't\nworry' action film. And yes the effects are spectacular and yes it is\n'Godzilla fighting Transformers' so should be every kid born before the\n1990s dream film. if you like that sort of thing fill your boots.\nHowever there are a few minor niggles that confused me a little, such\nas why do they stop building these giant machines and then build a\nwall? You have just seen these alien monsters walk through several very\nlarge steel buildings without breaking stride and then someone says\nlets build a wall to stop them, no weapons are added to this wall its\njust a big wall..... That seems very stupid if you ask me and I am\nproved correct when a wall is breached within 2 minutes. Also where do\nthey get all this steel, titanium etc from? And why do the heads of the\nmachines have to drop onto the body in such a spectacular way......\n"
"\nPoor script, even poorer acting and no sense of direction throughout!\nThe problem with this film is that the characters just aren't\nbelievable and you need some credibility to pull off an action yarn\nlike this. For all its faults, 'Cloverfield' held my attention much\nmore than this tired effort. I watched it with my 17 year old son, who\ngave up on it about 1/3 of the way through. I must confess that I\nalmost followed him as the first half has very little going for it as\nit tries desperately to make us care about the characters (and little\nelse). The two scientists are the least believable of all and I got\nseriously annoyed with the both of them! It picks up a little in the\nsecond half but not enough to pull you back in. All in all, a tired,\nboring, noisy mess. I'm amazed that the film is so highly rated by\nothers here. Oh, I almost forgot; the CGI is passable but only just.\nIt's destined to be forgotten!\n"
"\nIf I want a video game I'll buy one. Good thing this was free last\nnight on HBO. I almost turned it off several times but for some stupid\nreason I watched it till the end. (Nothing else on Saturday Night TV).\nSpecial effects couldn't save this piece of trash. Though Ron Pearlman\ndid give a decent performance. The main characters were far from\nbelievable and the story was a rehash of other video game movies. I\nwould best call this Transformers under water. In fact the entire movie\nwas underwater drowning in the ineptness and lack of decent dialogue.\nPredictable right to the end. A better ending would have been every one\nof the hero's were kill and the aliens ruled, which of course would\nreally happen if some life form actually wanted to live here.<br><br>I give it 10 Barfs and only 1 Thumbs up. A movie for idiots, no thank\nyou.\n"
"\nWell that was two hours of my life which I will not recover.\nFortunately I did not pay to see this absurd oeuvre, but borrowed the\nDVD from the local library. But this is what kids now spend their\nallowance on??<br><br>Too many things to comment on, but among them are: how can only 8\nhelicopters lift one of these robots, when they weigh 2500 tons? Why\ndon't the kaiju's attack en masse, rather than just one or two at a\ntime? Why can't the robots be controlled remotely, rather than risking\nthe lives of 'pilots'? Why not simply shoot a missile (using all those\nhelicopters) down the kaiju's throat when it inevitably opens up to\nmake a loud roar?\n"
"\nIt has a good score here on IMDb, but again it proved to be highly\noverrated. I gave it a 5 because it would have been much better, and\ncontains no serious logical mistakes. It looks like the creators wanted\nsome easy money, so they mixed everything together: robots, some\nfightings, aliens, etc... But. The story is poorly written, and\nbasically follows a well known, and unbelievingly boring, and\npredictable path. No surprises at all. It's like nowadays no one really\ncares to write a good and exciting story, they concentrate only on the\nCGI effects, and they think the rest is not important. They copy-paste\nit from other movies and that's it. Apparently it looks working,\nsadly...\n"
"\nThis was an overall great action sci-fi flick. I absolutely loved the\nCGI and fight scenes, especially those underwater! Highly recommended\nto anyone who likes a decent story line with mediocre character\ndevelopment. Very little sexual nature to this film, but loads of\nviolence. My concern with the film and story, is that there wasn't much\ndetail spent in the early days of the Jaegers, or better yet the full\nstages of the kaiju. I believe that if Pacific Rim had been made into a\ntelevision show (perhaps even better if it happened now!) showcasing\neach kaiju battle and follow around the crews of each Jaeger, that a\nlot more people could enjoy the wonderful idea behind the film and\nstory itself. But hey, it's just an idea\n"
"\nIt took two sessions for me to watch this drivel. I fell asleep about\nhalf way through and had to see part two the following day.<br><br>As far as I can make out this is about giant sea monsters vs\ntransformers. Charlie Day and Burn Gorman play the gravediggers from\nHamlet, badly. The two stars of Sons of Anarchy prove that they can't\nact their way out of a paper bag.<br><br>Meanwhile Idris Elba puts in an embarrassingly bad performance (\nImagine the key speech from Gladiator written and delivered by Worzel\nGummidge.) Action has been replaced by acres of CGI that might satisfy\nan eight year old but will fail to impress sentient beings evolved\nbeyond the level of igneous rocks.<br><br>The only redeeming feature of this film is that it is, at least, better\nthan the pretentious and unoriginal nonsense that was Pan's Labyrinth.\n"
"\nThe similarities between Pacific Rim and Sharknado go far beyond their\nlithe, telegenic screenplays and nuanced character-driven plots.\nPractically Shakespearean in their world-views and intricate family\ndynamics, both movies will keep you on the edge of your seat as plot\ntwists have you guessing right up until the end on the big \"who done\nit\" question. Oh certainly, first-rate special effects added to\nwell-crafted acting with so many layers of emotional depth you'd think\nits respective sea creatures were pipe-lined straight from Citizen\nKane, or perhaps The Godfather, or maybe a bit of both. Really, who's\nto say which picture will garner the most Golden Globes or Academy\nAwards this year. My bet's on ILM's splendorous work in Pacific Rim\nalthough I've got to say Sharknado's sharks really projected tremendous\namounts of fear-inducing horror that weren't quite the equal of the\nmore anime-inflected denizens of Pacific Rim. I suggest you see both\nfilms in a double feature and decide for yourself.\n"
"\nUnfortunately I expected too much from this movie. Main reasons for my\ndisappointment: The characters are too simple and easily psyched\nespecially when it comes to the two professors (Dr. Newton Geiszler &amp;\nGottlieb). The enduring fights between them are flat and listless and\nbecome very tiring during the movie.<br><br>In my opinion many of the actors could do a lot better. Best examples\nare Ron Perlman or Idris Elba who we know for better acting. Their\nroles are not deep enough for high performance acting anyway.<br><br>The Story is weak and very predictable. There are too few surprises and\nno suspense at all. Good example is the story of Mako Mori. Viewers\neasily know what is going to happen and what her part in the movie will\nbe.<br><br>From my point of view they just stringed many special effects together\nto distract from the simpleminded storyboard. In total the movie seems\nto me like a cheap copy of transformers mixed with a cheap copy of\nGodzilla.<br><br>I would not recommend it at all.\n"
"\nI really loved Charlie in Green street hooligans. His charisma\ninfluenced the attention on the screen every time he was on. IMHO\nbetter than wood, but this one... he wasn't good. He can't play\nrelentless hero. It's just not him. This movie has some great effects\nand decent back story, but he can't (at least for now), play the main\nroles similar to these ones. Loved Charlie Day and Ron Perlman (but I\nlike them in every movie), though they seem too out of place. If this\nmovie was shot in \"Batman\" style, it would have been much better. Never\nthe less, it still worth to watch. At least once. Del toro can create\nspectacular scenes, but at least in this case, not a good actors\nchoice.\n"
"\nPacific Rim -&gt;&gt; It was a great,spicy,delicious, a-bit-bore 3D DISH made\nby mixing Transformers &amp; Jurrasic Park in HONG KONG.<br><br>Seriously man how much destruction you can expect within a movie after\nwatching a film like Man of Steel..this movie seriously surpassed\nMOS..this was a DESTRUCTION MAHYEM.<br><br>Too much loud..too much action..too much DINOSAUR vs ROBOT but in a\ngreat FASHION...loved it.. if y'all like Hollywood with loud bang you\nwill also have a great time.<br><br>Too much loud..too much action..too much DINOSAUR vs ROBOT but in a\ngreat FASHION...loved it.. if y'all like Hollywood with loud bang you\nwill also have a great time.\n"
"\nI was surprised that this movie didn't do well at the Box Office. Not\nonly because it is done by Del Toro, but mainly because it is really\ngood. And it seems people like it generally too (see rating here on\nIMDb, currently ranking at 7.6). So why didn't it perform? Tough to\nsay, but seems like people didn't want to watch it at that time, so\nmaybe the release date was off.<br><br>You can't tell with those things though, so I'm pretty sure this will\ndo much better once it hits the video stores/markets and sells/rents\nlike crazy. The movie deserves that. And not because it is a great\nmovie, but because it is very entertaining. Predictable and filled with\nclichés, Idris Elbas performance alone is worth the money! Sit back,\nrelax and enjoy the show\n"
"\nIts a well rounded movie, it has great action, hints of humor at the\nright moments, and has a little bit of everything. Unlike most movies,\nI like the female main character's personality and how she is portrayed\nin the movie. I also like how she's Asian. They don't over sexualize\nMako or the relationship between her and Raleigh, which I enjoyed a\nlot. I loved the relationship between the two, how deeply they\nconnected and how their relationship developed. They don't over\nemphasize things in the movie, which I really liked. They give you just\nenough to be satisfactory and hint at the rest, they don't overwhelm\nyou with certain aspects of the movie. This movie isn't mind blowing,\nlife changing, or touches your heart and pulls at its strings, but\noverall it was enjoyable and entertaining. It was a nice movie to watch\nand nothing about it really frustrated me or made me want to change it.\nIt's like Goldilocks and the three bears, it's the porridge that's not\nto hot and not to cold, it's just right.\n"
"\nShort and Sweet This isn't Romeo &amp; Juliet, War &amp; Peace or any Epic\npiece of fiction like those. It is a big budget smack-down. The battles\nin the cities around the world are pretty cool, but i would have\nenjoyed a more international flavors to it. But that's just my opinion.\nTransformers/Godzilla mash up, with shadows of Japanese robot fighting\nstories. The Jeagers (Robots) themselves have plenty to look at on the\nbig screen, in some shots you get a good, if quick look at the\nmechanics inside, Sort of like the brilliant work done on the First\nlive action Transformers movie.Characters are light and not completely\noriginal but what is nowadays? Good special effects and plenty of\naction.... a few nice non action character scenes to remind you of the\nstakes. Music is alright but not rousing. I give it 8/10\n"
"\nThe Good: The action sequences was spectacular, I loved it!! The CGI\nwas epic and not cheesy like World War Z! Guillermo Del Toro brought\nthe Jaegers into the big screen with strength and action. The Kaijus\nlooked awesome! The relationship between Raleigh and Mako. Hong Kong\nlooked fantastic in this movie! The fighting between Jaegers and Kaijus\nin the ocean while it's raining. The storyline was something we haven't\nseen for a long time. It felt like a Japanese film with great action.<br><br>The Bad: The characters needed more story. Not much to say...<br><br>Go watch this film with your friends and have a great time!! Rating:\n9.25/10\n"
"\n\"OK\" story, if over the top; good effects; another film in the \"America\nsaves the world\" series. <br><br>Features the worst \"Australian\" accent of any movie I've seen - Robert\nKazinsky should fire his dialect coach and listen to the actors around\nhim - Max Martini had me (an Australian native) fooled - didn't pick\nMax as a New Yorker. Kazinsky sounded South African, via Europe, via\nIreland and somewhat American (or Canadian?) - with a hint of Aussie\ntwang making irregular and obviously intentional appearances. Which\nwouldn't have been an issue if both father (Martini) and son (Kazinsky)\nused a similar conglomerate accent.\n"
"\nThis movie was the worst movie. I have ever seen stone. I hated it so\nmuch that I'm going to write the worst review for it ever. It is not\neven worth mentioning. I'm just trying to write enough lines here now.\nI don't even care anymore. I hope this is enough. For f's sake. I wish\nI could just go on forever and ever. I wonder how much more long now, I\nreally don't feel like doing this anymore at all. Taking way too long\nnow. I wonder can. I speed this up anyhow. Oh my god, you are f with me\nain't ya? I need to write like this ten f lines, what a f bull s is\nthis, this movie doesn't deserve more than one line if even that. Could\nyou please just let me go already, I want to go back home. Please, I\npromise I won't tell anyone, I just really want to go now, I promise.\nI, I'll do anything, just please can I go, it's hurting me, please, let\nme just go now.\n"
"\nThe current note 7,1 for Pacific Rim on IMDb.com is another example\nthat new generations are writing the history of cinema or at least the\nreviews.<br><br>On the positive note, the effects are superior and there are some\nreference to Godzilla and H.P.Lovecraft. <br><br>On the other hand, there is nothing memorable about the plot apart from\nseveral CGI sequences. But even they were interesting only if you're\ninto special effects. All members of the crew offer sub-par\nperformance. At times it seemed as if some of them weren't even trying\nto act but rather spout the lines in front of the camera.\n"
"\nAs \"science\" fiction this is infantile. Like the new Star Trek, and\nTerminator Salvation, Battleship, and many others, the special effects\nare great but the plot and the acting make this a \"real life\" comic.\nThere is no effort at all to offer a plausible basis for the plot\nelements. The entire movie is an insult to the intelligence, but it\nlooks good. I guess that's what it takes to rake in the big money these\ndays.<br><br>The characters are shallow, spoiled, egotists who try to be larger than\nlife heroes but end up looking like reckless children let loose in a\ntoy factory. If these are the best humanity has to put up against its\nenemies, it makes you want to root for its enemies.\n"
"\nA visual treat, I must say and a fairly good movie. Seriously I\nexpected something bigger from the director who made me believe that\nfairy tales could be serious in Pan's Labyrinth. The movie certainly is\nbigger technically but falls behind novelty. Everybody has known\ntransformers, battleship etc.., and not again with this combats. I've\nseen these animated combats way before in 1998 when I played metal\nfatigue game. Actors did a fair job sailing along the script and I\ndisagree with the other reviewer who was telling that actors were bad.\nThe first 10 minutes was excellent and I felt like 'm gonna see\nsomething like District 9 but the movie lost pace in the middle and got\nhighly predictable (something like a lunch with a good soup and a bad\nmain course). The bottom line is that the movie is visually appealing\nwith nicely written dialogs to match but falls behind any new essence.\n"
"\nIf you want some uber fantastic CGI, action packed, monster pounding,\nrockets blasting, loud booms and explosions then you'll love this movie\nbecause it does that VERY well. If you're expecting a deep and well\ncrafted story, you'll be a bit disappointed. The strong point of this\nmovie is the struggle of the human race against all odds. The courage,\nbravery, and comradery that everyone has to go through to make it\ntogether. It displays a lot of inspirational moments and makes you\nremember who you are as a human being, weak and fragile. We may not be\nmuch alone but together we can overcome anything. An inspirational\naction packed robots and aliens movie in summary. Not a romantic or a\nmovie filled with plots and twists. Movie is obviously geared towards\nyounger audiences.\n"
"\nI don't even know where to start with Pacific Rim, the story wasn't\ngreat, but it was really cool, the visuals are amazing! the monsters\nlook really bad ass, the acting is really good, the fight scenes are\nshot really well like it's not all shaky and crazy in your face like\nMichael Bay's movies, i spent most of this movie with my jaw on the\nfloor, i guess the only bad thing i can say about it is after the 1st\npart it takes awhile to start again, watch it you wont be disappointed.\nBut don't worry it's not all mindless action, like the plot isn't great\nbut it's cool enough to suck you in, the only thing you need to know\nis, it's kinda long, so if you don't like long movies, don't see, but\nit's worth it.\n"
"\nPacific Rim is an amazing visual treat for lovers of CGI and all those\namazing graphic jargon I know not of. <br><br>The story line is very plain and uncomplicated (I am saying that as a\ngood thing). If you are expecting an Alfred Hitchcock twist of a movie,\nthen you should go find an Alfred Hitchcock movie.<br><br>It is simply huge machines against huge monsters. I was skeptical at\nfirst, following my disappointment with Transformers (all of them). The\nmachines look amazing! The camera angles are on point and the combat\nscenes could not have been shot any better. Maybe a little less light\ncould have improved some scenes but overall the movie delivered what it\npromised to deliver. Stunning graphics. I liked the music and sounds\ntoo.<br><br>The low points for me were the overused hero clichés and speeches in\nevery movie you see. Additionally I believe Charlie Day's character\ncould have been better. His 'frightened' look was not the best.<br><br>In a nutshell, go see the movie expecting nothing mind-blowing (like\nthe Usual Suspects); just something eye-ploding!!!\n"
"\nI felt compelled to write a review on this movie, if only to save\nanother human being from suffering through it.<br><br>I find it almost unfathomable that someone or some studio fronted the\nmakers of this movie almost $200,000,000. It could in my opinion have\nbeen put to much better use.<br><br>It was a mish mash of every tired &amp; clichéd hero vs villain movie ever\nmade &amp; I am more than surprised at Guillermo del toro for having\nanything to do with it.<br><br>It is not surprising that not only has it failed to recoup the money\npumped into it by the studios but that it is actually running at a\nsignificant loss.<br><br>Don't get me wrong, I am a huge sci-fi fan but this trash is more\nfitting of the \"patriotic\" garbage that is churned out by Gerry\nbruckheimer &amp; co.<br><br>Save yourself the time, life is too short. I'm only sorry I can't give\nit a minus score.\n"
"\nI was lucky to catch an advance screening of Pacific Rim &amp; I went into\nPacific Rim excited, ready to see Giant Robots take on 3000 ton\nmonsters &amp; left completely satisfied. This movie turned out better than\nI expected, Pacific Rim is the best summer movie so far. The action\ndelivers, whenever there's a kaiju/Jaeger fight scene you wont be able\nto take your eye's off the screen. Great visuals. Good plot. Solid\nacting. The character development is fair. Pacific Rim is overall a\nfun/good time movie that will bring out the inner 9 year in ya. If\nyou're going into Pacific Rim expecting an Oscar worthy performance &amp;\nplot, well sorry... Guillermo del Toro hit it out of the park with\nPacific Rim &amp; as I mentioned the visuals are great so definitely give\nthis one a look at in 3D &amp; if there's an iMAX near your area GO FOR IT!\nP.S stay for the after credits.\n"
"\nIt has been a long time since I saw a movie in a theater that actually\nexceeded my expectations, but Pacific Rim really did.<br><br>Everything fits in this movie: the storytelling, character build - up\nand - oh man - the special effects. It's not easy to make a fight\nbetween a robot and a gigantic monster seem real and thrilling, but\nGuillermo does it. I was on the edge of my seat, heart throbbing during\nsome of the battles.<br><br>It's not just blunt action, hopping from one scene to another without a\ndecent story behind it to back it up. This is something we see too\noften lately, but Pacific Rim makes a beautiful exception.<br><br>Keep up the good work Guillermo, I hope this one gets a follow - up as\nit deserves. Can't wait to see that one.\n"
"\nDo not do it.Do not waste one second of your time watching this\ngarbage,cut the grass watch paint dry anything but if you do feel the\ninclination to watch you have been warned .Bad acting cliché after\ncliché.No storyline,No feel for the characters I thought I had been\nback transported back to the seventies B movie.Words fail me as to how\nbad this movie is.How it gets the rating it has is beyond me.Cant put\nany spoilers as you cant spoil it any more than just watching\nit.Imagine the worst movies you have ever seen and put it to number\n1.trying my hardest to say anything positive to say? .maybe one good\nthing is you know what words are coming next before it is delivered!!.\noh and the top gun scene lol if you watch it you will know what i mean\n"
"\nThis movie showcased probably the most awe-inspiring, realistic Mecca\nspecial effects I have ever seen. Utterly amazing.<br><br>Unfortunately, they have also succeeded in making the movie boring,\nboring, boring. They somehow managed to stuff into this movie pretty\nmuch every single Hollywood cliché, character stereotype, utter\npredictability, unfunny comedy relief, and UN-heart-felt emotion.\nDespite the stunningly realistic special effects, this movie felt\ncompletely fake. Perhaps, many viewers can tolerate fake movies as long\nas there is compelling suspense and drive to hold one's interest. I am\nsad to say, this movie presented near zero suspense or drive. It's\nactually a mystery how the makers of this movie managed to kill off all\nfun and excitement given the awesome effects available to them. Couple\nthat with the lack of a single compelling character, we have a movie\nthat should have been so much more...\n"
"\nGuillermo Del Toro has an amazing visual sense. His movies are\nbeautiful to watch. However this was visually interesting but otherwise\nshallow and plot less. This felt like a live action version of Neon\nGenesis Evangelion. The character were all 1 dimensional archetypes.\nOther than fight scenes in CGI - which I didn't find that interesting,\nthere's not much to the film. There was not even an interesting\nbackstory on the Kaiju. Their dinosaur form and adaptation to battles\nwas kind of interesting but wasn't explored. The entire plot and ending\nwas completely obvious (you knew who would fall in love, who would\nnobly sacrifice themselves, who was going to die, etc.)\n"
"\nOnly today i watch the film and.....the only thing worthy are the\nspecial effects. The acting is lame. A movie full of classics clichés.\nNot funny at all. A bad blockbuster in my opinion. A script made\napparently by a child. Similar to transformers 2. I prefer Hell Boy 1\nand 2 that this. The CGI is OK.<br><br>What happened with Idris Elba in this movie? I suppose is a script\nfault. And the two \"genious\" are pathetic, characters full of\noveracting. <br><br>This movie with out CGI was like Dragon Ball Evolution or The last\nAirbender.<br><br>Sorry if there's some mistakes in my review. I'm not very good with the\nEnglish.\n"
"\nI will not waste my time or yours. 10 lines of review is all you'll get\nfrom me... <br><br>This is simply one of the worse movie I ever seen and surely the worse\nI have seen in a long time. Except the CGI, everything feel amateurish\nat best. Poor plot, poor acting, poor dialog, tons of cliché, literally\ndozen of basic scientific inaccuracies, predictable end etc.<br><br>Every 5 minutes, I was griding my teeth for one reason or another. This\nthing is worth a 3 to an ultimate max of 5, how on earth does it\ncurrently have a 7.1 rating is beyond me.<br><br>It's sad that nowadays, all it take to make a movie seems to be a pile\nof cash, a bunch of random actors, pretty CGI and a single idea/concept\nthat you can stretch for 2 hours with an alternate mix of forgettable\n100% CGI scene and seriously lacking story and dialog.\n"
"\nThere is really nothing interesting about this movie. The way the movie\nis written does not make the audience connect to the characters at all.\nThere is no sense of caring for the characters because we do not get\nattached to them.<br><br>This movie is essentially an adult version of \"Power Rangers.\" People\nteam up to form giant robots, and then they go out and fight giant\ncreatures that look like they were designed by a teenager in an art\nclass. The acting is laughable at best. In fact the most entertaining\nthing about the movie is how bad the acting is. The only actor in the\nmovie who actually puts on a good performance is Idris Elba, but it\ndoesn't matter because everyone around him is doing a horrible job.<br><br>The first 5 minutes of the movie are great, but after that it is a huge\nlet down.\n"
"\nWhen people saw the trailer to this film you know only one thing popped\ninto their heads, people inside giant robots controlling them to fight\ngiant creatures.. yeah POWER RANGERS YAY! <br><br>I have read some mixed opinions some saying its a good film because its\ndifferent and that it looks good but to be completely honest it did\nhave a good premise but the way it panned out was really bad. Its not\nenough too LOOK good, sure seeing colossal sized robots fight against\nmonsters is cool but that's not enough.<br><br>I think if it was done better the film would've been sweet but the fact\nthat I thought the acting was sub par , they tried to add depth to the\nstory but failed, there were some unnecessary parts included where\nother parts to the film good of been better expanded on. It was just\nnot very good, its watchable... for your kid but other than that poor\nfilm.\n"
"\nI don't normally review films on this site but had to say just how BAD\nthis film is! What a total waste of money they blew on this piece of\ntrash! It is FILLED with nothing but cheesy one-liners &amp; almost every\nmovie cliché' ever! If you haven't seen it just think of Power Rangers\nwith a bigger budget! All the characters were so typical and annoying,\nand a lot of the movie didn't even make sense! One second the giant\nrobots are deep underwater then they stand up and the water is only\nround their ankles! WTF?! The drivers of the main robot are your\nstereotypical USA Jar-Heads with an attitude, and the Russians &amp;\nJapanese are so cliché'd too, also they threw a classic nerdy British\nguy in there as the scientist! OMFG This is probably the most\nUN-original film ever. Anyway in short it SUCKED!\n"
"\nThe 1 star rating applies to the writing and directing of the movie.\nSure, I didn't expect Shakespeare. Movies like The Rock, or 007 I find\nentertaining.<br><br>However, PR went above and beyond to provide a shitty experience. The\nwriters should be barred from any movie writing. Even 2 year olds\nshouldn't be exposed to this drivel.<br><br>If you want to make a movie about \"big robots\" there is plenty of good\nstuff around to license. I understand the cash grab mentality to create\nyour own IP, but this stinker should have been sunk to the bottom of\nthe Pacific ocean, nuking optional.<br><br>If you enjoyed The Phantom Menace I'm sure you liked this one, too. The\nrest of us will be busy scouring our souls from this taint. The only\npositive thought is that I didn't drop $20 to see this in the theater.\n"
"\n...this movie is for the eight-year-old in everyone.<br><br>It's not particularly clever, or well-written, and requires a COLOSSAL\nsuspension of disbelief, but I'll be damned if I wasn't entertained by\nPacific Rim. I first saw this movie in my college's auditorium with a\ngroup of friends as part of Film Club (they wanted to show something\nfun during the midterm study break), and to be honest, this movie made\nme very happy. The action scenes and effects are delightfully colorful\nand violent, and most of the characters were surprisingly interesting\nand well-developed for a movie like this. Plus, there is something to\nbe said for a film that portrays the Millennial Generation in a\npositive light for once.<br><br>Even though it was written and directed by the same guy as Pan's\nLabyrinth, DO NOT expect anything profound to come out of Pacific Rim.\nIt's a cheesy action movie, but one that manages to get the audience to\nlook past that and enjoy it in all its over-the-top splendor.\n"
"\nThe acting was not good, especially Burn Gorman (who can do a lot\nbetter) was hamming up the scenery like there was a discount on pork.\nThe movie felt at times too slow, the script is - well - something\nbetween cheesy, cliché and borderline-stupid. Every trope from \"I lost\nmy partner and won't ever do this again\" over \"This insane plan is our\nlast chance and the high-ups don't see it\" to \" (...) is the best\nsoldier for this job and you well damn know this, Sir.\" was pulled our\nof the hat at least once... <br><br>...but honestly, the visuals are fine and after all, it is a \"Giant\nrobots punching giant monsters\"-Movie. So yeah, I wanted to see \"Giant\nrobots punching giant monsters\" stuff and I got \"Giant robots punching\ngiant monsters\". So no complaints from my side.\n"
"\nIn short: i saw the trailer on TV and it looked terrible, now after\nwatching the movie on the small screen, i wish i had paid to watch it\nat the cinema. It was a thoroughly entertaining movie.<br><br>In (slight) detail: Firstly, what were they thinking when they made the\ntrailer? It makes the movie look thoughtless, stupid and worse than\ntransformers (which i hate). It didn't appear to be the type of movie i\nwould enjoy, i would sit there laughing at the cliché acting and\nunoriginal story. HOWEVER, after borrowing the bluray from a friend, i\ndecided to watch it (mainly to please my girlfriend, who likes these\nkinda things). I usually prefer pretentious thought provoking films (i\nknow). I put this movie on with low expectations, and somehow from\nstart to finish it kept me highly entertained. Although it was in parts\nvery chiche, it didn't matter. The acting was decent (Idris Elba stole\nthe show). The special effects were mind blowing and i was never bored.\nBravo Guillermo Del Torro!!!\n"
"\nThere's not much to say, this movie is exactly what it poses for.\nOl'timers that grew up watching mecha animes (like me) will love it.\nKids are just kids and will adore the fabulous action sequences. Btw if\nyou did not know what 'mecha' is,you probably won't enjoy it as much.\nLots and lots of nerdy details that will get your attention-if you are\na nerd of course; something that essentially caught mine is that the\nromantic element in this flick is completely non-formulaic for\nHollywood but just makes perfect sense for animes. Technically\nspeaking: acting/directing=quite good, sfx/music=up to industry\nstandards, CGI=very good, plot/story=entertainingly silly. There is a\n15-30-min period in the middle of the film that drags a bit, but that's\nOK. Enjoy!\n"

"\nBeing a BIG fan of anime, I was saving this movie for a free and relax\nweekend. From the Trailers, this movie looks like a BAD-ASS fight\nbetween giant robots and aliens. But this movie have the potential to\ndisappoint the audience at each aspect. Where to start....story line,\ncasting, acting, science, physics,...every thing was going haywire. I\npatiently waited, as its just a movie, things might surprisingly align\napproaching the end, BUT THEY DIDN'T.<br><br>In conclusion this movie might be watched, only if these conditions are\nmet:- (1) if you are hanging out with your friends (2) just want to\npass time (3) want to make fun of something <br><br>Otherwise don't waste your time on it\n"
"\nFirst off i am a huge fan of this genre/type of film so may be slightly\nbiased.<br><br>I recently got pacific rim on 3d Blu-ray and i have to say the 3d is\nprobably the best i have seen in a movie to date outside of the cinema,\nits not pop out the screen type 3d but more depth, like looking through\na window. No its not the most original story, no the acting isn't the\nbest, but the fight scenes are epic the monsters (kaiju) look\nfantastic, the jaegers are amazing and the actors appear to be having a\ncracking time of it (Charlie Hunnman has the biggest school boy grin in\nthe beginning scene when first in the jaeger syncing up with his\nbrother).<br><br>Overall as long as you go in to this and can level with the fact that\nthe dialogue isn't going to be hugely important and yes the acting is a\nbit wooden, basically turn off your brain and you should thoroughly\nenjoy yourself.\n"
"\nI don't mind big budget summer blockbusters. These days I expect a\nbrainless CGI fest. It's not like we can expect a classic like Jaws or\nJurassic Park anymore, but I'll admit I was mildly entertained by the\nlikes of Godzilla, Armageddon and Transformers.<br><br>Pacific Rim on the hand is just awful. It's like watching Power\nRangers. As good as the CGI was at one point I was convinced I was\nwatching actors in rubber/metal suite fight over a miniature city. In\nfact it's like watching those old Japanese Godzilla movies, but nowhere\nnear as good (and they were bad).<br><br>It was painful watching this. The acting is horrendous. And just when\nyou think it can't get any worse, it gets worse. I honestly can't even\nremember what any of the characters names were and I only watched it 1\nhour ago.<br><br>Honestly I feel sorry for kids if this is the future of Hollywood\nblockbusters. I can't believe we've gone from the likes of Jaws &gt;\nJurassic Park &gt; Armageddon &gt; Transformers &gt; Pacific Rim. Talk about a\ndownward spiral. How can it possibly get any worse? What's next?\n"
"\nThis is the first movie in a long time that I've switched off before\nthe end - I made it 90% of the way through so feel justified in writing\na review.<br><br>The entire movie was just a series of fight sequences between big\nboxing robots and giant space lizards. Now I'm all for a bit of\ntongue-in-cheek action but unfortunately this movie attempted to\ndeliver its paper-thin story all too seriously.<br><br>The film actually features some good actors but the lines and plot they\nare forced to work with meant the whole thing felt like a series of low\nbudget sitcom scenes spliced together with special effects fight\nsequences.<br><br>In summary - I wouldn't waste your time.\n"
"\nThis movie was great! Just about every thing was perfect. <br><br>My only real complaint is the leading actor. Charlie Hunnam is big on\naction and short on some of his acting. He does have that slow speech\nnon-American actors have when attempting to mask their accent. It\nreally damages the chemistry between the two leads because he is\nfocusing so hard on sounding a certain way. It just wasn't natural for\nhim. I'm not going to go so far as to say he can't act, but I think his\nperformance could have been better and more natural if he could have\njust spoke how is he accustomed to.<br><br>Masking an accent really hinders the actors abilities to connect with\ntheir character. <br><br>If you can power past the lead actors annoying drawl you will no doubt\nenjoy this movie if you like action, robots, big explosions, Asian\nculture, well-done monsters and a surprisingly good story.\n"
