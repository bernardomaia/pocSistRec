simplistic  silly and tedious  
its so laddish and juvenile  only teenage oys could possily find it funny  
exploitative and lagely devoid of the depth o sophistication that would make watching such a gaphic teatment of the cimes eaale  
gaus discads the potential fo pathological study  exhuming instead  the skewed melodama of the cicumstantial situation  
a visually flashy ut naatively opaque and emotionally vapid execise in style and mystification  
the stoy is also as unoiginal as they come  aleady having een ecycled moe times than id cae to count  
aout the only thing to give the movie points fo is avado  to take an entiely stale concept and push it though the audiences meat ginde one moe time  
not so much facical as sou  
unfotunately the stoy and the actos ae seved with a hack scipt  
all the moe disquieting fo its elatively goefee allusions to the seial mudes  ut it falls down in its attempts to humanize its suject

this 100minute movie only has aout 25 minutes of decent mateial  
the execution is so pedestian that the most positive comment we can make is that o schneide actually tuns in a petty convincing pefomance as a pissy teenage gil  
on its own  its not vey inteesting  as a emake  its a pale imitation  
it shows that some studios fimly elieve that people have lost the aility to think and will fogive any shoddy poduct as long as thees a little gilongil action  
a face of a paody of a comedy of a pemise  it isnt a compaison to eality so much as it is a commentay aout ou knowledge of films  
as exciting as all this exoticism might sound to the typical pax viewe  the est of us will e lulled into a coma

to the civilized mind  a movie like allistic  ecks vs  seve is moe of an odeal than an amusement  
equliium could pass fo a thiteenyeaolds ook epot on the totalitaian themes of 1984 and faenheit 451

im not saying that ice age doesnt have some faily petty pictues  ut thees not enough sustance in the stoy to actually give them life

plays like one long  meandeing sketch inspied y the woks of john wates and todd solondz  athe than a fully developed stoy  
the film doesnt have enough innovation o pizazz to attact teenages  and it lacks the novel cham that made spy kids a supising winne with oth adults and younge audiences  
a mawkish selfpaody that plays like some weid mastepiece theate sketch with neithe a point of view no a compelling eason fo eing  
an aveage movie with no aspiations to e anything moe  
atletts heo emains a eactive ciphe  when opening the mans head and heat is the only imaginale eason fo the film to e made  
giney and jaecki just want to sting the astad up  
the plot is plasteed with one hollywood cliche afte anothe  most of which involve pecocious kids getting the ette of onoxious adults  
less woying aout coveing all the dama in fidas life and moe time spent exploing he pocess of tuning pain into at would have made this a supeio movie  
a film that suffes ecause of its many excesses  
too land and fustily tasteful to e tuly puient  
in any case  i would ecommend ig ad love only to winge fans who have missed he since 1995s foget pais  ut even then  id ecommend waiting fo dvd and just skipping staight to he scenes  
depicts the soiest and most sodid of human ehavio on the sceen  then laughs at how cleve its eing  
nijinsky says  i know how to suffe and if you see this film youll know too  
cq may one day e fondly ememeed as oman coppolas ief petentious peiod efoe going on to othe films that actually tell a stoy woth caing aout
the only thing scay aout feadotcom is that the filmmakes and studio ae azen enough to attempt to pass this stinke off as a scay movie  
    stale and uninspied  
a deay movie  
    the stoy simply puttes along looking fo astute osevations and coming up lank  
instead of contiving a climactic heos death fo the elovedmajo chaactewhoshall emainnameless  why not invite some genuine spontaneity into the film y having the evil aliens lase guns actually hit something fo once  
it just didnt mean much to me and played too skewed to eve get a hold on  o e entetained y   
this actionthilledak comedy is one of the most epellent things to pop up in a cinematic yea aleady litteed with celluloid gaage  
mi ii is a movie that makes it possile fo the viewe to doze off fo a few minutes o make seveal uns to the concession stand ando estoom and not feel as if he o she has missed anything  thats ecause elatively nothing happens  
no amount of aty theoizing  the special effects ae gemanexpessionist   accoding to the pess notes  can ende it anything ut laughale  
lue cush follows the fomula  ut thows in too many conflicts to keep the stoy compelling  
oyds sceenplay  cowitten with guadian hack nick davies  has a floid tun of phase that owes moe to guy itchie than the ad of avon  
thees not a spak of new inspiation in it  just moe of the same  done with noticealy less enegy and imagination  
jackson shamefully stolls though this mess with a smug gin  inexplicaly weaing a kilt and caying a ag of golf clus ove one shoulde

ze movie stats out so funny  then she is nothing  
did the film infom and educate me  yes  did it move me to cae aout what happened in 1915 amenia  no  and that is whee aaat went astay  
its a ad sign in a thille when you instantly know whodunit  
has a customaily jovial ai ut a deficit of flimflam inventiveness  
eight legged feaks wont join the pantheon of geat monstescience fiction flicks that we have come to love    
it gets the details of its time fame ight ut it completely misses its emotions  
who  exactly  is fighting whom hee  ah  yes  that would e me  fighting off the uge to doze  
a kilted jackson is an unsettling sight  and indicative of his  if you will  outofkilte chaacte  who amles aimlessly though illconceived action pieces  
contived  awkwad and filled with unintended laughs  the film shows signs that someone othe than the diecto got into the editing oom and tied to impove things y making the movie go faste  
stats out with temendous pomise  intoducing an intiguing and alluing pemise  only to fall pey to a oatload of sceenwiting cliches that sink it faste than a leaky feighte  
the film lapses too often into sugay sentiment and withholds delivey on the pellmell pyotechnics its punchy style pomises  
the only question    is to detemine how well the schmaltz is manufactued  to assess the quality of the manipulative engineeing  aveage  at est  im afaid  
this movie is so ad  that its almost woth seeing ecause its so ad  
a cisply made movie that is no moe than mildly amusing  
this movie feel moe like a nonstop cy fo attention  than an attempt at any kind of satisfying entetainment  
oveall  its a petty medioce family film  
love may have een in the ai onsceen  ut i cetainly wasnt feeling any of it  
in addition to the ovecooked  hamfisted diection  which has all the actos eaching fo the ack ow  the dialogue sounds like hoile poety  
the vey definition of what citics have come to tem an  amitious failue   
its as if de palma spent an hou setting a fancy tale and then seved up kaft macaoni and cheese  
the movie ends with outtakes in which most of the chaactes foget thei lines and just utte uhhh   which is ette than most of the witing in the movie  
wothy of the gong  
while cetainly moe natualistic than its austalian countepat  amais film falls shot in uilding the dama of lilias jouney  
i found the movie as divided against itself as the dysfunctional family it potays  
the soulseaching delieateness of the film  although leavened nicely with dy asudist wit  eventually ecomes too heavy fo the plot  
the movie doesnt add anything fesh to the myth  
as inept as igsceen emakes of the avenges and the wild wild west  
comes acoss as a elic fom a ygone ea  and its convolutions    feel silly athe than plausile  
moves in such odd plot diections and descends into such messagemongeing moalism that its good qualities ae oscued  
its a vey sincee wok  ut it would e ette as a diay o documentay  
once one expeiences m  hanekes own sadistic tendencies towad his audience  one is left with a sou taste in ones mouth  and little else  
oops  shes eally done it this time  that chipy songid itney speas has popped up with moe mindless divel  
its a loathsome movie  it eally is and it makes asolutely no sense  
a chille esolutely without chills  
fo those of us who espond moe stongly to stoytelling than computegeneated effects  the new sta was installment hasnt escaped the ut dug y the last one

the whole movie is simply a lazy execise in ad filmmaking that asks you to not only suspend you diselief ut you intelligence as well  
the film affods us intiguing glimpses of the insights gleaned fom a lifetime of spiitual inquiy  ut am dass  fiece gace doesnt oganize it with any paticula insight  
pompous and galed

none of the chaactes o plotlines ae fleshedout enough to uild any inteest  
as social expose  skins has its heat in the ight place  ut thats not much to hang a soap opea on  
the whole film has this sneaky feel to it  as if the diecto is tying to dupe the viewe into taking it all as vey impotant simply ecause the movie is ugly to look at and not a hollywood poduct  
thees a it of thematic meat on the ones of queen of the damned  as its oigins in an anne ice novel dictate  ut geneally  its a movie that emphasizes style ove chaacte and sustance

something has een lost in the tanslation    anothe outine hollywood fightfest in which the slack execution italicizes the asudity of the pemise

ties so had to e quiky and funny that the stain is all too evident  
as immaculate as stuat little 2 is  it could e a lot ette if it wee  well  moe adventuous  
simply a ehash of the othe seven films  
with jump cuts  fast editing and lots of pyotechnics  yu clealy hopes to camouflage how ad his movie is  he fails  
i found myself moe appeciative of what the diecto was tying to do than of what he had actually done  
a vey depessing movie of many missed oppotunities  
goes on and on to the point of nausea  
y tuns numingly dullwitted and disquietingly ceepy  
oy  has this fanchise eve un out of gas  
one polem with the movie  diected y joel schumache  is that it jams too many pefaicated stoy elements into the unning time  
the comedy is nonexistent  
    a land  petentious mess  
its a pedestian  flat dama that sceams out amateu in almost evey fame  
a land animated sequel that hadly seems woth the effot  
its not just the vampies that ae damned in queen of the damned  the viewes will feel they suffe the same fate  
if eligious films aent you ailiwick  stay away  othewise  this could e a passale date film  
this is the case of a pegnant pemise eing wasted y a scipt that takes few chances and manages to insult the intelligence of eveyone in the audience  
the pace and the visuals ae so hyped up that a cuious sense of menace infoms eveything  
stuffy  full of itself  moally amiguous and nothing to shout aout  
it is most of the things costne movies ae known fo  its sanctimonious  selfighteous and so eage to ean ou love that you want to slap it  
dont let the sutitles fool you  the movie only poves that hollywood no longe has a monopoly on mindless action  
chais stuctue and pacing ae disconcetingly slack  
to e olivious to the existence of this film would e vey sweet indeed  
the diecto  with his fake ackdops and stately pacing  neve settles on a consistent tone  
one just waits gimly fo the next shock without developing much attachment to the chaactes  
instead of panoamic sweep  kapu gives us episodic choppiness  undemining the stoys emotional thust  
the diecto seems to take an unseemly pleasue in the chaactes misey and at the same time to congatulate himself fo having the guts to confont it  
this duious poduct of a collegespawned  colgate u   comedy ensemle known as oken lizad plays like a mix of cheech and chong and chips  
the movie doesnt think much of its chaactes  its potagonist  o of us  
supe toopes is an odd amalgam of comedy genes  existing somewhee etween the often liteal iffs of ealy zucke othesaahams films  and the decidedly foul stylings of thei postmoden contempoaies  the faelly othes  
    will always e ememeed fo the 911 teoist attacks  afte seeing the film  i can tell you that thees no othe eason why anyone should othe ememeing it  
made me feel uneasy  even queasy  ecause solondzs cool compassion is on the ode of emused contempt  
as a kind of coloful  damatized ps pogam  fida gets the jo done  ut  fo that  why not watch a documentay  
with minimal imagination  you could estage the whole thing in you athtu

its not as awful as some of the ecent hollywood tip tipe    ut its fa fom a goundeaking endeavo  
the only thing  swept away  is the one hou and thitythee minutes spent watching this waste of time  
onesided documentay offes simplistic explanations to a vey complex situation     stylistically  the movie is a disaste  
the copse count ultimately oveides what little we lean along the way aout vicaious edemption  
as violent  pofane and exploitative as the most offensive action flick youve eve seen  
egoyans wok often elegantly consides vaious levels of eality and uses shifting points of view  ut hee he has constucted a film so layinthine that it defeats his lage pupose  
life o something like it has its shae of high points  ut it misses too many oppotunities  
this is a tuly  tuly ad movie  
despite eaing the paamount impint  its a againasement euopean pickup  whats had to undestand is why anyody picked it up  wise souls would have tactfully petended not to see it and left it lying thee

a film that will e est appeciated y those willing to endue its extemely languoous hythms  waiting fo happiness is ultimately thoughtful without having much damatic impact

cold  steile and lacking any colo o wamth  
the film is undone y anachonistic quick edits and occasional jaing glimpses of a moden theate audience watching the events unfold  
seems like someone going though the motions

imposto doesnt do much with its template  despite a emakaly stong cast  
waps itself in the guise of a dak and quiky comedy  ut it isnt as quiky as it thinks it is and its comedy is geneally meanspiited  
choppy  ovelong documentay aout the lifestyle  
one sloughs ones way though the mie of this alleged psychological thille in seach of pupose o even a plot  
a film which pesses familia hezog topes into the sevice of a limpid and conventional histoical fiction  when eally what we demand of the diecto is to e mesmeised  
its a fanoy what if   ought to life on the ig sceen

it is ad  ut cetainly not without meit as entetainment

a wok that lacks oth a pupose and a stong pulse  
a faste paced family flick  uppe teens may get cynical  smalle numeed kidlets will enjoy

with a tighte editoial pocess and fime diection this mateial could wok  especially since the actesses in the lead oles ae all moe than competent  ut as is  pesonal velocity seems to e idling in neutal  
doesnt eally add up to much  
its ette suited fo the histoy o iogaphy channel  ut thees no aguing the tone of the movie  it leaves a ad taste in you mouth and questions on you mind  
an entetainment so in love with its oveinflated mythology that it no longe ecognizes the needs of moviegoes fo eal chaactes and compelling plots  
a polonged extusion of psychopathic pulp  
oows fom othe movies like it in the most odinay and ovious fashion  
its supisingly land despite the heavy doses of weid pefomances and diection  
a chilly  emote  emotionally distant piece    so dull that its tagline should e  in space  no one can hea you snoe  
the chaactes seem onedimensional  and the film is supeficial and will poaly e of inteest pimaily to its taget audience  
sovino makes the pincess seem smug and catoonish  and the film only eally comes alive when poo hemocates and leontine pathetically compae notes aout thei udding amous

eveything  even life on an aicaft caie  is sentimentalized

its a teile movie in evey egad  and uttely painful to watch  
this is ote spookiness  with nay an oiginal idea  o ole  o edit  o scoe  o anything  eally  in sight  and the whole of the poceedings eg the question why  
a fan film that fo the uninitiated plays ette on video with the sound tuned down  
too infuiatingly quiky and taken with its own style  
thees a whole heap of nothing at the coe of this slight comingofagecomingout tale  
as much as i laughed thoughout the movie  i cannot mount a cogent defense of the film as entetainment  o even pefomance at  although the movie does leave you maveling at these guys supehuman capacity to withstand pain  
the type of dumeddown execise in steeotypes that gives the teen comedy gene a ad name  
distinctly supa    moe likely to down a viewe in oedom than to send any shives down his spine  
plays like a ad lend of an oveipe episode of tvs dawsons ceek and a ecycled and dumeddown vesion of love stoy  
unless you come in to the film with a skateoad unde you am  youe going to feel like you weent invited to the paty  
when the casting call fo this movie went out  it must have ead seeking anyone with acting amition ut no sense of pide o shame  
just isnt as weid as it ought to e  
a  home alone  film that is staged like  osemays ay   ut is not as wellconceived as eithe of those films  
siegel and cowites lisa azadona and gace woodad have elied too much on convention in ceating the chaactes who suound fankie  
no film could possily e moe contemptuous of the single female population  
hey anold   has some visual wit    ut little imagination elsewhee

a sluggish pace and lack of genuine naative hem the movie in evey it as much as life hems in the spiits of these young women  
a lowudget affai  tadpole was shot on digital video  and the images often look smeay and luy  to the point of distaction  then again  in a ette movie  you might not have noticed  
its mindless junk like this that makes you appeciate oiginal omantic comedies like punchdunk love  
the movie is like a yea late fo tapping into ou eality tv osession  and even tadie fo exploiting the novelty of the  wecast   
tale will e all too familia fo anyone whos seen geoge oy hills 1973 film   the sting

neve inspies moe than an inteested detachment  
what might have emeged as hilaious lunacy in the hands of woody allen o mel ooks  at least duing thei 70s heyday  comes acoss as lame and sophomoic in this deut indie featue  
despite slick poduction values and diecto oge michells ticktock pacing  the final effect is like having two guys yelling in you face fo two hous  
petty much sucks  ut has a funny moment o two  
they do a good jo of painting this family dynamic fo the audience ut they tied to squeeze too many elements into the film  
a supenatual mystey that doesnt know whethe it wants to e a suspenseful hoo movie o a weepy melodama  it ends up eing neithe  and fails at oth endeavos  
two adly intelocked stoies downed y all too cleve complexity  
it is so eanest  so ovewought and so wildly implausile that it egs to e paodied  
these ae textook lives of quiet despeation  
swimfan  like fatal attaction  eventually goes oveoad with a loony melodamatic denouement in which a high school swimming pool sustitutes fo a athtu  
claims to sot the ad guys fom the good  which is its essential polem  
puposefully shocking in its eoticized goe  if unintentionally dull in its lack of poetic fissons  
feels like pieces a unch of othe  ette movies slapped togethe  
almost eveything aout the film is unsettling  fom the peposteous haipiece won y lais villainous fathe to the endless action sequences  
witediecto andall wallace has itten off moe than he o anyone else could chew  and his movie vees like a dunken dive though heavy taffic

one cant shake the feeling that cossoads is nothing moe than an houandahalflong commecial fo itneys latest alum  
phonedin usiness as usual

what little atmosphee is geneated y the shadowy lighting  macae sets  and endless ain is offset y the shee ugliness of eveything else  
diectochef gaiele muccino keeps it fast  zippy  comin at ya  as if feaing that his film is molto supeficiale  
tatakovskys team has some feakish powes of visual cham  ut the five wites slip into the moden ut of naative anality  
the most hoific movie expeience ive had since  cant stop the music   it may as well e called  jaja inks  the movie   its that painful  
god is geat  the movies not  
like a theeing cicus  thee ae side stoies aplenty  none of them memoale  
when in dout  the film atchets up the stiing soundtack  thows in a fishoutofwate gag and lets the cliched dialogue ip  o else a doggie winks  
a gils gone wild video fo the oho athouse cowd  the uning sensation isnt a definitive countecultual document  its makes aent emoved and inquisitive enough fo that  
as oiginal and insightful as last weeks episode of ehind the music  
plays like john le cae with a couple of untout cylindes  
you may e galled that youve wasted nealy two hous of you own pecious life with this silly little puddle of a movie  
its neithe as sappy as ig daddy no as anachic as happy gilmoe o the wateoy  ut it has its moments  
despite the suface attactions  conad l  halls cinematogaphy will likely e nominated fo an osca next yea  thees something impessive and yet lacking aout eveything  
a smug and convoluted actioncomedy that doesnt allow an eanest moment to pass without eminding audiences that its only a movie  
cystal and de nio manage to squeeze out some good laughs ut not enough to make this silly con jo sing  
wothless  fom its pseudoockvideo opening to the idiocy of its last fames  
the chist allegoy doesnt wok ecause thee is no foundation fo it
go fo la salles pefomance  and make do as est you can with a stutteing scipt  
its had to cae aout a film that poposes as epic tagedy the plight of a callow ich oy who is foced to choose etween his eautiful  selfsatisfied 22yeaold gilfiend and an equally eautiful  selfsatisfied 18yeaold mistess  
ties too had to e funny in a way thats too loud  too goofy and too shot of an attention span  
i didnt find much fascination in the swinging  what theye doing is a matte of pluming aangements and mind games  of no eotic o sensuous chage  ut that they ae doing it is thoughtpovoking  
the acting is just fine  ut thees not enough sustance hee to sustain inteest fo the full 90 minutes  especially with the weak payoff  
afte collateal damage  you might imagine that most evey aggieved fathe cliche has een untuned  ut no  
ultimately the  yes  snaillike pacing and lack of thematic esonance make the film moe silly than scay  like some sot of matha stewat decoating pogam un amok  
eleasing a film with the wod dog in its title in januay lends itself to easy jokes and insults  and snow dogs deseves evey single one of them
